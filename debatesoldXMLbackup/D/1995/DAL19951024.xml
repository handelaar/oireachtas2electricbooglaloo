    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The first six-monthly progress report on the implementation of the recommendations of the review group on the Office of the Attorney General was considered at today's Government meeting. Arrangements are under way to publish the report and I have now placed copies in the Oireachtas Library, with copies of a Government press release.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report is testimony to the significant progress made to date in implementing the recommendations of the review group.  I do not intend to take up the time of the House in reciting from the report.  Deputies can see for <Col N="910" /> themselves the degree of progress which has been achieved in a relatively short time in relation to the provision of resources and the introduction of the most modern office systems in the office of the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>In relation to computerised tracking of extradition proceedings the office of the Attorney General now has an operational work management system which allows for the tracking of all cases, including extradition cases, from the time of their receipt in the office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied that, in line with the proposals in the Programme for Government, more efficient and streamlined systems now operate in the Attorney General's office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am satisfied.  I wish to express my appreciation of the work of the review group and also of the Attorney General and his staff in acting so promptly on the recommendations of the review group.  This is the first six-monthly report; other matters will be dealt with expeditiously in the next six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The review group recommended that processing of personal injury actions be delegated to the office of the Chief State Solicitor and that a claims manager be appointed by the Chief State Solicitor to value claims. The group also recommended that posts in the advisory section and the parliamentary draftsman section be open to solicitors as well as barristers.  Has the Government decided not to follow those recommendations or what is the position in that regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The post of parliamentary draftsman is open to solicitors. On the processing of claims by the Chief State Solicitor's office in personal injury cases, that is a specific question of which I would need notice, but I will get that information for the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach said the <Col N="911" /> post of parliamentary draftsman is open to solicitors, but the review group recommended that all posts, from parliamentary draftsman to legal assistant, be open to solicitors.  Has that recommendation been accepted by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The report has been accepted by the Government in general terms.  The procedure has been established by the Attorney General to furnish six-monthly reports and implement their recommendations.  The Government will not make decisions on every individual recommendation but will allow the Attorney General the freedom that should be allowed to a professional of his standing to look at the report in the light of experience elsewhere and decide on the best course of action to take.</P>
      <P>In addition to drawing on the review group report, the Attorney General will bring in the advice of professional international law office management consultants to assist him in assessing these decisions.  It is best that the Government accept in principle the report but allows the Attorney General a degree of freedom in consultation with the best international expert advice to make decisions on individual recommendations. In cases where I am unable to give the Deputy an answer to a question about a particular recommendation, I will endeavour to provide that information quickly by personal communication or by way of further Dáil question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that in the interests of accountability the Attorney General should be answerable to a Dáil committee for the operation of his office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter will be dealt with in the legislation on compellability of witnesses.  The decision is that the Attorney General should be <Col N="912" /> accountable to the Dáil for the administration of his office through the Committee of Public Accounts.  As regards the legal advice he tenders to the Government, that is governed by the lawyer-client relationship and the Attorney General should not be accountable for that to anyone other than the Government.  The distinction between where he is accountable in regard to administrative and budgetary matters and the matters for which he is accountable only to the Government will be dealt with in some detail and discussed in the House when the relevant legislation comes before it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of reform of the Attorney General's office, does the Taoiseach believe that transparent guidelines are required in that office to specify when the State should indemnify a Government Minister when sued in his personal capacity?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter to which the Deputy referred is not covered in the subject matter of Deputy Ahern's question relating to computerisation or Deputy O'Dea's question relating to the recommendations of the review group. It is not covered in the questions tabled by the Deputy's party and I respectfully suggest that it does not arise under this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach answer the question in view of his stated public commitment to transparency and openness?  It was raised in the context of the reform of the Attorney General's office and is a matter of public interest as there is taxpayers' money at stake and the public is entitled to a reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I most certainly will answer any question tabled to me adjudged to be in order under the rules <Col N="913" /> of the House by the Ceann Comhairle. However, it is prudent that those questions should be tabled in the normal way and dealt with in accordance with the rules of order as to admissibility of questions by the Ceann Comhairle.  I will provide full answers to any questions adjudged to be in order and tabled to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Did I correctly hear the Taoiseach say that the Attorney General is accountable to the Committee of Public Accounts, which is not the case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not hear me say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad I &mdash; not the Taoiseach &mdash; was mistaken in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I can repeat what I said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>At present the Attorney General is not accountable to anybody in this House.  The Office of the Attorney General is one of those offices like that of the office of the DPP which is independent either under the Constitution or under law.  Will the Taoiseach agree it is timely to make a distinction between &ldquo;independence&rdquo; and &ldquo;accountability&rdquo; so that such independent offices are appropriately accountable directly to the House or to one of its committees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As of now the Attorney General is accountable to the Government under the Constitution, it being the body that appoints him.  That has been the position regarding Attorneys General since the Constitution was enacted in 1937.  In response to a question by Deputy Harney I said that the Government has been considering this matter and its current view is that some provision should be made for the Attorney General or his head of administration to report to the Committee of Public Accounts in regard to the <Col N="914" /> expenditure of moneys, matters of financial and administrative accountability, the normal functions that come within the remit of that committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General but not in regard to policy or legal advice matters.  That is not now the case, but it may become the position if the Government proceeds on the lines of its current thinking.</P>
      <P>The wider question the Deputy raised of the balance to be struck between &ldquo;accountability&rdquo; and &ldquo;independence&rdquo; is one that arises in respect of a number of offices.  It is not an easy one to address. There is not a simple formula that can be adopted to deal with that question. Regarding certain functions, independence is often of great importance to preserve civil liberties and to avoid political pressure but those are not matters that can be dealt with on a black or white basis.  There are degrees of importance that would be attached to independence in regard to different offices.  In some offices the requirement for independence is of a very high order and, therefore, the consequent level of accountability is correspondingly less.  In others there is a requirement for a greater degree of accountability and, by extension, a somewhat lesser degree of independence is justifiable in light of the functions being performed.  It is not possible to enunciate a general principle on this matter, one must consider each office on a case by case basis and make decisions accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Programme for Government espoused openness and transparency.  Regarding the proposal that the Attorney General or a member of his staff should report to the Committee of Public Accounts, will the Taoiseach give an undertaking that the Attorney General or a member of his staff will be in a position to inform that committee regarding settlements or cases that have been decided?  Last Christmas evidence before that committee indicated that approximately 3,000 cases per annum are taken against the State at any one time and that many of <Col N="915" /> them are dealt with in the courts or settled privately.  Will the Taoiseach give some undertaking to examine the matter and give a commitment that perhaps the Attorney General and his office will be able to give such information to the committee?  I also wish to ask the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">

      <P>When I am asked five questions together I am concerned that I might miss one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a sparse legislative programme this week.  A commitment was given in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to increase efficiency in terms of processing matters that pass through the Attorney General's office.  Is the Taoiseach satisfied with the present position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the last part of the Deputy's question first. The Deputy is aware that the Government is in the process of recruiting additional parliamentary draftsmen.  As parliamentary drafting is a delaying factor in the production of legislation that should alleviate the problem.  We are recruiting a number of parliamentary draftsmen but at a minimum it takes a newly recruited parliamentary draftsman two years of work on the job to reach the point that he or she is fully fledged and able to work independently of the normal level of supervision that would apply to an apprentice in any area of work.  In view of that as the House is aware, the Attorney General is seeking to bring in outside parliamentary drafting expertise on a contract basis.  Parliamentary drafting is a precise science.  It is not sufficient to have a good general knowledge of the law and to have practised it.  A certain element of architecture in the drafting of a Bill is required independent of a good knowledge of the law.  We are looking for specific drafting skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The other question the Deputy raised concerned the issue of settlements.  It is generally in the State's interest to act as any other person or organisation in receipt of legal proceedings, to have the capacity to settle cases out of court from the point of view of legal costs.  Sometimes it can be a requirement of those settlements that the terms are not published and both sides agree to that.  If the State does so it must respect that decision even before the Committee of Public Accounts.  I will consider the matter of other settlements.  I cannot go further than that in response to the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask a final supplementary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Almost 20 of the 30 minutes available for dealing with questions to the Taoiseach is now exhausted.  There are six other questions to be dealt with, let us make some progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the present line of accountability in the Attorney General's office is unsatisfactory?  The Estimates for the office are presented by the Minister for Finance, political questions relating to it are put to the Taoiseach and the accounting officer, who is not the head of the office, must come before the Committee of Public Accounts.  Will he agree that it is time to rationalise that line of accountability to a committee of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The accounting officer of all Government Departments is the person who comes before the committee in respect of all Votes and he or she is not the Minister in the case of any office, therefore there is no concern about that point.  I share the Deputy's puzzlement regarding the historical reasons the Minister for Finance is responsible for the Vote and I am responsible for answering here.  The offices are so structured that in some <Col N="917" /> cases I am not able to answer because of the independence or constitutional or legal requirements that apply to the office in question.  There is an anomaly there.  I hope that at some stage in the next five or ten years I will be able to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> referred to accountability of officers such as the Attorney General.  We have accountability on financial matters as outlined by the Deputy.  Is the Taoiseach now saying that the commitment in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> to have the Attorney General come before a committee of the House has been abandoned by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is proposing to make provisions in regard to the Attorney General reporting to the House in a way which is consistent with his consitutional obligations. Obviously, the Government or any programme for Government, cannot go beyond what the Constitution allows.  It is important to bear in mind that the Attorney General is an independent constitutional officer, not an officer of this House.  He is not subject to this House in the same way as is for example, a Minister.  On the other hand there is a legitimate interest in the work of the office and the Government will do everything it can to account for that office.  Both I and my predecessor have had to account and do account for the Attorney General's office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.  The Director of Public Prosecutions has again assured me that sex abuse cases are given very careful attention and prosecutions are decided upon by him whenever that is considered appropriate. The Director is satisfied that the proper criteria are being applied within the office when such prosecutions are being considered and that a formal review of procedures which apply within the office is not necessary.  Informal reviews have however taken place and will continue.</P>
      <P>The office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in common with other Government Departments and offices, has embarked on a strategic management initiative process, which will include a close examination by private sector consultants of its efficiency.  Any appropriate suggestions for improvement of efficiency will be implemented. In addition, the Department of Finance, with the full support of the office, last week commenced a review of its structure and organisation.  When the report of that review is available later this year it will be considered urgently by the Government.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance, in response to an urgent request for extra legal staff, has sanctioned the immediate recruitment of a third legal assistant and a fourth legal assistant for the office to alleviate understanding on the legal side. The review by the Department of Finance, as mentioned above, into the structure and organisation of the office will include consideration by the office of the production of annual or other reports on the work it has done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree it is unacceptable for serious offences against children to go unprosecuted for essentially technical reasons? If the Director of Public Prosecutions finds there are deficiencies in the present state of the law &mdash; such as that evidence from children might not be acceptable &mdash; which prevent him from prosecuting, will the Taoiseach give an undertaking to the House that he will change the law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware some time ago legislation was passed in regard to offences against children. It related to the presentation of evidence by children and other related matters.  If the Director of Public Prosecutions identifies areas of law reform that need to be undertaken where justice is not being served by the present system, certainly the Government will take any such recommendation from the Director of Public Prosecutions very seriously and will seek to act upon it.  It is important to bear in mind that each case is different, that the Director of Public Prosecutions must be independent and just in his assessment of the evidence both from the point of view of the victim and from the point of view of the prospective accused and also must be realistic about the proofs that will be required to secure a successful prosecution before deciding to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not the case that the Director of Public Prosecutions, in his recent public announcement identified such areas?  Will the appropriate Government officer, presumably the Attorney General in this case, direct the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecute in any case where there is a <i>prima facie</i> case?  Surely in those cases there should be a direction from the Attorney General?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should recollect the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, which makes the Director of Public Prosecutions independent in the exercise of his office.  He is not subject <Col N="920" /> to direction from the Attorney General. Direction from the Attorney General was the case prior to that legislation. The establishment of an independent Director of Public Prosecutions was a step forward which was widely supported on all sides of the House at that time.  It would not be a good idea if the Attorney General was to give directions. There are provisions in the Prosecution of Offences Act for consultations to take place between the Attorney General and Director of Public Prosecutions but these are not consultations at which directions can be Attorney General and Director of Public Prosecutions but these are not consultations at which directions can be given to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Director of Public Prosecutions is independent and should remain so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the measures being introduced by the Taoiseach in this regard.  Can I take it that the Taoiseach now accepts the argument which he denied over the last two years that the necessary independence of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions can survive a greater degree of accountability and answer-ability than currently exists?  Will he accept that at a time of great controversy regarding the non-prosecution of certain sexual offences, particularly sexual offences against children, either through non-reporting or through inexplicable decisions of the DPP not to prosecute, there is a need for an overall policy review of the prosecution policy as administered in the office of the DPP?  Will that be included in this review of the DPP's office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the first part of the Deputy's question, it is a good thing to provide the Director of Public Prosecutions with the resources necessary to enable him to provide regular published reports on the work undertaken.  However, the work of the DPP should not be subject to accountability to the House in regard to either decisions to prosecute or not to prosecute in particular cases, or categories <Col N="921" /> of case.  We should not politicise prosecutorial decisions.  I know this is a matter on which there are divided views. There are other jurisdictions where the DA is quite often subject to marked and openly admitted political pressure from his electors to prosecute in particular cases &mdash; if some of the dramas on our television screens are to be believed as being a fair representation of law in certain American states.  That is not the way we should go.  It is desirable to maintain independence from political pressure in regard to prosecutions but the House could be given more information. One of the reasons it did not get the information, as the Deputy is aware from answers she has received to questions, is that staff resources are not available to collect the statistical information. I hope as a result of the review now being undertaken more information can be provided but not of a type that would encroach on the independence of the DPP in regard to prosecutorial decisions.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second part of the question, prosecution policy will not be covered in the reviews I have undertaken. These are reviews in regard to the workings of the office, the efficiency of despatch of business within the office and the objectives of the office. Accountability other than in respect of individual cases or categories of case will be covered.  The question of prosecution policy is a matter for the Minister for Justice rather than me.</P>

      <P>To return to my earlier point, has the DPP not pointed out the deficiencies in current law, particularly where evidence from children is not acceptable?  Has the DPP not signalled to the Government that this is an area requiring a change of law?  Is the Taoiseach not concerned that where there was a statement of admission, and no other evidence, prosecutions were not proceeded with?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be examined by the Minister for Justice &mdash; I do not promote the legislation in this area. There are difficulties in founding any prosecution on confessions alone. Deputies only have to look back to important cases where miscarriages of justice were alleged in this and in the neighbouring jurisdiction, where convictions were based on confessions alone, to see there can be problems in this regard.  It is important to allow the DPP assess each case on its merits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is the Taoiseach so loath to allow some review of prosecution policy in the context of sexual offences?  Is he not aware, for example, that lapse of time is constantly being used by the DPP's office as a reason not to prosecute in child abuse cases?  Will the Taoiseach not agree that lapse of time will always be a feature of child abuse cases and to use that as the sole reason for not prosecuting can no longer be supported given what we know about child abuse cases and the length of time it takes people &mdash; in some cases it may take 20 years &mdash; to report the allegations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the point the Deputy is making but it is important to recognise that the DPP must make a decision in the light of the evidence in each case and how robust that evidence will be under cross-examination in court.  It is not simply a matter of ignoring lapse of time.  The relevance of lapse of time will vary from case to case. There is no doubt that in some cases people's recollection will be very clear, graphic and verifiable, less so in others. In some cases there will be corroborating evidence, in others there will not be such evidence.  In cases such as this it is best to leave the matter to the independent judgment of the DPP in each case. <Col N="923" /> We should not set target rates of prosecution for particular offences where the DPP is expected to prosecute 40 per cent of the files he is sent in a particular category because that is considered to be the politically acceptable way to deal with the offence as a means of expressing our concern about that type of offence.  That sort of generalised approach is not desirable.  It is more desirable, in the interests of civil liberties &mdash; and my concern is with civil liberties &mdash; to allow the DPP make independent judgments in each case.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The optional testing programme for hepatitis C for recipients of blood transfusions or blood products was launched on 12 September 1995.  Since the launch of the programme 4,192 blood samples have been received and tested to date by the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  Eight persons have tested positive for hepatitis C antibodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is too early at this stage to draw any definitive conclusions from the optional testing programme.  It is intended that the Blood Transfusion Service Board will continue to place advertisements, at intervals, in all national and provincial <Col N="924" /> newspapers informing people about the programme for the forseeable future.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The contact arrangements for the national screening programme are that advertisements are placed in the newspapers and that will continue both at local and national level.  In addition, occasions such as today will attract publicity which will alert people.  In the first instance, the target group are persons who have received blood transfusions but, as the programme operates through general practitioners, if a person expresses concern on a normal visit to a GP, the GP may decide, among other things, to test for hepatitis C by taking a blood sample and that is what is happening.  It is at the discretion of the GP to decide how wide that screening would be but it is targeted at recipients of blood transfusions.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The commitment I gave in the original documentation was that they would be available before Christmas.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked a further question about the statutory nature of the tribunal. I have put in place an <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal which has advantages which do not attach to a statutory tribunal.  The Deputy is aware of the long delays between the promise of legislation and its eventual enactment.  There is a statutory scheme available for processing compensation claims &mdash; the courts.  The reason we opted for an <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal rather than telling people to process claims through the courts is principally because of the delay in the courts.  There is also the question of flexibility in an <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal and it will include elements which would not normally form part of compensation law.  For example, there is the possibility of the tribunal allowing instalment payments or making interim awards up to a certain level of prognosis. If the outturn in terms of a person's health is more serious than the prognosis, they could go back into the tribunal again.</P>
      <P>If we were to come into the House and put all that on a statutory basis, it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to do so in any short period of time.  It would also be extremely difficult to confine it to people who have hepatitis C and are making compensation claims and not extend it to the generality of compensation claims, for example, claims relating to medical negligence or motor car accidents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 11 and 43 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity to make a statement to the House on the question of mandatory reporting of child abuse, particularly in view of the amount of attention that the topic has received in the media in recent weeks.  Many of these reports have conveyed the <Col N="928" /> impression that the introduction of mandatory reporting is the panacea for the problem of child abuse.  This is not the case and, as I hope to explain the introduction of mandatory reporting is not without difficult and is not something that we should rush into without carefully examining its implications.</P>
    <P>Mandatory reporting involves placing a legal obligation on designated professionals such as doctors, nurses, social workers, psychologists, probation officers and teachers to report cases of suspected child abuse to the authorities. In some jurisdictions the report must be made to the child protection services; in others reports go directly to the police. Some countries have made it a criminal offence for a mandated reporter to fail, without good cause, to make a report and generally reporters are granted immunity from legal proceedings in respect of reports which are made bona fide and with due care.</P>
    <P>In 1990 the Law Reform Commission in its report on child sexual abuse recommended the introduction of a mandatory reporting law here.  In the light of recent suggestions that professionals should be under an obligation to report the slightest hint or suspicion of abuse, it is important to point out that the Law Reform Commission recommended that the scope of mandatory reporting should be strictly defined.  Its report set out in very precise detail the circumstances in which a duty to report would arise.  The commission went on to say: &ldquo;We recommend that the obligation to report should arise when the mandated reporter knows or has good reason to believe that child sexual abuse has occurred&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is also worth mentioning that the commission did not consider that there should be a mandatory obligation on professionals to report a suspicion that a child may at some future time be subjected to abuse.  Furthermore, the commission said that it would be wrong to place professionals under a legal duty to report unspecified abuse.  They said that it should remain a matter of judgement <Col N="929" /> in individual cases whether to report suspicion of non-specific abuse.</P>
    <P>In the light of recent events, it is also worth noting that the commission's recommendation was that reports be made to the health boards.  It did not envisage placing a duty on professionals to make reports to Garda, although it would be open to them to do so.  I make these points to illustrate that what has been written and said about mandatory reporting in recent weeks bears litte relation to the type of system envisaged by the Law Reform Commission, following its in-depth study of the subject.</P>
    <P>There was also a reference to the fact that the Kilkenny Incest Report recommended the introduction of mandatory reporting.  In this context, it should be noted that that report favoured the mandatory reporting of all forms of child abuse to the health boards, which, in turn, would be under a legal obligation to notify all cases and suspicions to the Garda.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, earlier this year I introduced a new procedure for the notification of suspected cases of child abuse and neglect between health boards and the Garda.  This procedure gives effect, on an administrative basis, to the recommendation relating to mandatory reporting in the Kilkenny Incest Report in so far as health board and Garda personnel are concerned.  It is only fair to inform the House that some difficulties have already manifested themselves since the procedure was launched.</P>
    <P>The first relates to pregnant girls aged under 17 who present at maternity hospitals.  As the age of consent to sexual intercourse here is 17 years, by definition a criminal offence has been committed.  The question that arises is whether doctors and other health professionals should report all such cases to the Garda so that the Garda can investigate the circumstances leading to the pregnancy and, if necessary, initiate a prosecution against the putative father. I am sure that many Deputies share my alarm at such a prospect and at the danger that young expectant mothers <Col N="930" /> might delay seeking medical assistance if they knew that by so doing their boy friends, who themselves might be under age, could find themselves the subject of a Garda investigation.</P>
    <P>The second area of difficulty relates to counselling services being provided by health boards to adults who have suffered sexual abuse as children.  It is inevitable that in the course of such work, health board staff will become aware of the identities of at least some of the alleged perpetrators of such abuse.  The question that arises is whether staff should pass this information on to the Garda even when the victim has made it clear that he or she does not wish to make an official complaint. If it were to be decided that health professionals were under such a duty, it could deter victims from coming forward for support and counselling.</P>
    <P>Having said all this, I want to make it clear that I have an open mind on the question of the introduction of mandatory reporting here.  I am anxious, however, that all the implications of such legislation, including the type of issues that I have just outlined, should be fully teased out.  Towards this end, I have established an <i>ad hoc</i> group of officials drawn from the three Departments in which I have responsibilities &mdash; Health, Education and Justice &mdash; and I have instructed them to prepare a draft discussion paper before the end of this year.  This paper will set out the main arguments for and against mandatory reporting.  I intend that the paper will form the basis of wide-ranging consultations with professionals groups and other interested parties.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to deal with a specific query raised by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.  My Department would not be aware on a day to day basis of the number of child abuse cases being investigated by health boards and the Garda.  However, the scale of the problem can be gleaned from the fact that the number of reports of all forms of abuse and neglect received by the health boards is approaching 5,000 per year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the publicly stated acceptance by professional bodies, teachers, doctors and the Church of mandatory reporting, will the Minister accept that he and his Department, rather than these professional bodies, are most concerned about the difficulties of mandatory reporting?  Could he put in context the fact that on a recent television programme he urged the Church very strongly to get involved in mandatory reporting by bishops and parish priests and so on of child sexual abuse allegations while, at the same time in his Department, he is not pursuing with the same degree of urgency putting in place the guidelines and safeguards necessary for the introduction of mandatory reporting?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Deputy that I was the one responsible last April for putting in place guidelines for the health boards and the Garda.  At that time I said this was an administrative form of mandatory reporting and that if experience led me to the conclusion that there were still gaps or difficulties which we had not taken account of I would be the first to introduce changes.  It is recognised from all that has been said that this is a very complex issue with which one must proceed to deal with a certain amount of caution. Nevertheless, I have instructed the officials in the three Departments for which I have responsibility to prepare a discussion paper as a matter of priority so that it will be ready before the end of the year.  As my responsibilities relate to the Departments of Education, Justice and Health, I may have a certain advantage and greater overview which makes me more conscious of the problems in this area and of the necessity to adopt an overall approach which will take cognisance of some of the problems to which the Deputy referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In his statement the Minister said he has instructed his officials to prepare a draft discussion paper and I should like to know if he is <Col N="932" /> aware that on 17 May 1994, 17 months ago, his predecessor stated in reply to a question from me that he had initiated a process for the drafting of a discussion paper in his Department.  Will he explain what a discussion paper is?  Is it pulled out of a hat in a Department whenever pressure arises as a result of a horrific tragedy or case?  Is it studied by departmental officials or do other people participate in the discussion process?</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the 1987 guidelines, as updated by him last April, are not being adhered to and have failed to protect children at every opportunity?  In this respect I would remind him of the Kelly Fitzgerald case, the west of Ireland farmer case, the Madonna House case, the Trudder House case, the raft of clerical abuse cases and the Drogheda Hospital case where the guidelines failed abysmally to protect children.  Is the Minister happy to say to children, and to those who are concerned about children they believe are being abused, that a discussion document is being prepared in his Department, a document similar to the one referred to by his predecessor 17 months ago?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy please let me finish my reply.  This is a very complex issue.  In its conclusion the Law Reform Commission said that the law should be specific enough to discourage over reporting, whether by the over zealous or the defensive reporter while on the other hand it should be broad enough to facilitate the identification of children who are generally at risk and should be based on a definition of child sexual abuse which lays down a minimum rather than an optimum standard of care towards children.  This makes it perfectly clear that one does not proceed to deal with this matter unless one has given it very careful consideration.</P>
      <P>When I issued the guidelines last April I said it probably would be necessary to look at them again and that is what I am doing as a result of experience in two cases.  I assure the House that in terms of discussion papers etc. there will be no undue delay in dealing with this matter.  While people in the professions and other fields have their own interests I regard the welfare and interests of the child as paramount and I will not allow anything to divert me from those considerations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The programme <i>A Government of Renewal</i> contains a commitment to expand the Eccles pilot breast screening programme on a phased basis.  However, it was necessary to await the independent evaluation of the report from the Eccles programme on the epidemiological aspects of breast cancer screening.  That evaluation report supports the introduction of a breast screening service, subject to the establishment of a population register.  I was pleased, therefore, to be in a position to formally announce the phased expansion of the programme at the launch of Europe Against Cancer Week on Friday, 6 October 1995.</P>
      <P>The decision to proceed on a phased basis is guided by the need for the achievement of acceptable compliance levels among the target population; ongoing evaluation of the programme from a quality assurance perspective; and availability of the necessary clinical expertise to conduct the programme.  It is my intention to ensure that the phased introduction of the breast screening programme takes cognisance of these critical success factors.</P>
      <P>As Deputies will be aware, there is an international debate surrounding the efficacy of the breast screening programmes. The debate centres on a number of key issues including: the impact on mortality of breast screening programmes; the concerns associated with false positive and false negative results; and the cost effectiveness of the breast screening programmes.  I am confident that the phased introduction as I already outlined will address these concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of whether the introduction of a national breast screening programme will impact significantly on mortality levels cannot be answered in the short-term.  However, the evidence <Col N="939" /> from international clincial trials suggests that reductions can be achieved through breast screening.  For now, the emphasis must be on putting in place a programme which achieves the highest standards of quality at all levels.  The staging of the programme will be related to the achievement of performance targets in line with these quality measures.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that the first phase of the programme will commence as soon as possible and will cover the Eastern, North Eastern and Midland Health Board areas.  It will target 120,000 women in the age cohort 50 to 64 which represents 50 per cent of the national target population.</P>
    <P>The Eccles pilot breast screening programme has been recognised by the European Network of Reference Centres for Breast Cancer Screening as a centre of excellence.  The decision to include the Eastern, Midland and North Eastern Health Board areas in phase 1 was based, primarily, on the need to draw on the clinical expertise which has been built up in the Eccles programme.</P>
    <P>Officers of my Department will shortly be meeting the director and senior staff of the Eccles pilot programme to agree a detailed work programme, costings, management and evaluation arrangements for this phase. The development of a comprehensive population register will be an essential step in this programme.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to &ldquo;acceptable compliance levels&rdquo; among the national target population. What would be consider an acceptable compliance level?  Will he state whether the necessary clinical expertise to conduct the programme is available in each of the three health board areas chosen and what organisational structures have been put in place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Approximately 75 per cent would be recognised as an adequate compliance level.  This figure was achieved in the <Col N="940" /> pilot scheme.  Expertise is now available in the Mater Hospital as a result of the Eccles pilot breast screening programme which covered the Dublin and north east areas in the first instance. This pool of expertise will be availed of in screening 120,000 women in the age cohort 50-64 which represents half the national target population.  On the question of structures, it will work from the Eccles programme in the Mater Hospital and have the co-operation of the three health boards concerned.</P>
      <P>It will involve both mobile and static units but the detail of that is now being worked out between officials of my Department and the people who are running the programme in co-operation with the health boards.  They have been given the go ahead to proceed immediately. We have the finances in place and the programme will work through 1996.</P>
      <P>In looking at the areas into which we could extend, it was a question of ensuring that a proper programme would be put in place.  It would be easy to announce a national screening programme and get some kind of political kudos for doing so but I was fearful, on account of international experience and what we have learned here on the pilot programme, that if we did not get a sufficient compliance rate, if we could not get sufficient standardisation to ensure quality and if we could not rule out false positives and false negatives in so far as we can through having the proper expertise, we could spend a lot of money on an ineffective programme and raise false hopes among the target population that we were doing something effective when, in fact, we were not.  I am sure the Deputy is aware of the conflicting views in this debate internationally. Taking all things into account, it was proper for me to move prudently on a standardised high-quality basis rather than opting for a national scheme in the first instance.</P>

      <P>The Minister has, on a number of occasions, taken the opportunity to pay tribute to the work <Col N="941" /> being done in the National Breast Cancer Research Institute located at University College Hospital, Galway, and I am not being parochial when I mention that institute.  It is the only one of its kind in the country.  Would the Minister accept that an enormous amount of clinical and medical expertise has been built up, both within the institute and within the hospital, where the institution has been located and how soon will he be in a position to extend the screening programme to such an institute?  Obviously, the Minister would not have any concerns in that instance in relation to a proper programme being put in place, as he puts it.  Second, how soon realistically does the Minister expect to have nationwide availability to breast cancer screening?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Some of those questions I can answer and some I cannot.  First, I know the Deputy is not being parochial because we all must look at this Question in the national context.  From a parochial or constituency perspective, it would have suited me to have this programme in the Mid-Western Health Board functional area as, indeed, it would have suited the Deputy to have it in the Western Health board area.  In looking at the evidence which was presented to me, it was absolutely persuasive that the way to proceed was to develop the screening programme in the area where the pilot programme was operating and we included half the target population.</P>
      <P>Yes, there is a pool of expertise in Galway.  There is a pool of expertise available in Cork, too, where the national cancer database operates at the moment.  I hope, in the context of the report on cancer services in the country which will be available to me shortly, I will have more to say about what expertise is available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of a screening programme, the expertise which had actually worked a screening programme for a targeted population was attached to the Mater Hospital project, and it is no reflection on the quality of expertise available <Col N="942" /> around the country that we would allow them to continue the work they started. I am not sure yet as to the phasing in of the scheme because the outcome of anything we do in the health service from now on must be measured as well as undertaking the service.  If the results are good as we go through 1996 and 1997, I would hope, some time in early 1997 to be in a position to announce further extensions.  In terms of the target population rather than the geography, 50 per cent of the national target population is being taken in now.  If we were to extend it, for example, to the Western Health Board and the North-Western Health Board and, let us say, that part of the Mid-Western Health Board which is north of the Shannon, I think we would take in about one third of the remainder.  I think the number is about 41,000 but I can check that figure for the Deputy.  There would be in the neighbourhood of 80,000 in the rest of Munster, let us say, the Southern Health Board and the Limerick-Tipperary part of the Mid-Western Health Board.  It might be possible to do the next 50 per cent together.  At the moment, the people who are organising the programme are looking at an extension in two tranches along the lines I have indicated.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As the Deputy will be aware, since 1993 a number of initiatives have been taken for the purposes of organising and supporting the general practitioner service in fulfilling a wider and a more integrated role in the healthcare system.  The mechanisms for developing the service <Col N="943" /> agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish College of General Practitioners include the operation of an incentive based drug target scheme and the provision of a fund for the improvement of physical facilities and development of services within general practice.</P>
      <P>The Department requested health boards to allocate a proportion of development resources towards the provision of a range of paramedical services to which general practitioners would have ready access for their patients. These would include physiotherapy, occupational therapy, chiropody, dietetic services and counselling.  Health boards were informed that arrangements with service providers under this programme could be entered into on a contract for service basis either through sessional arrangements or short fixed term contracts.  In this connection, it is open to boards to make arrangements, either directly or through general practitioners, with health professionals who are providing services in a private capacity.  Any such arrangements are subject to agreement on funding and levels of service to be provided.</P>
      <P>I should emphasise that the purpose of this initiative is to provide a more accessible service for medical card patients and it was taken following feedback received from practising general practitioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister made all the various health boards aware of this because it only seems to be happening in the Eastern Health Board at present?  Does he consider the way forward to lie in privatising many of the functions and facilities health boards provide for GMS patients, particularly those services he mentioned, such as physiotherapy?  The Minister could add orthodontic services and facilities for the handicapped.  I believe there is a number of FAS schemes in progress to facilitate people with handicaps.  Does the Minister see this policy as the way forward in the health services?  Should we be privatising more of our facilities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> My approach would be non-ideological.  I take a service from wherever I can find it if it provides a better service, especially for persons on medical cards. The origins of the scheme to which the Deputy refers is, as the Deputy would know, that arrangements were entered into with general practitioners on what is colloquially called the 50/50 cash back drugs scheme.  By way of providing incentives, extra services were provided. One of those was to physically upgrade GP practices, dispensaries and so on. This has been done in various parts of the country.  This arrangement was made too and it is working well.  It was done with the full co-operation of medical practitioners and it has improved services for medical card holders in terms of advice on diet, physiotherapy, chiropody and so on.  It involves the general practitioner getting into a contract of service or buying an item of service from a private service provider but, of course, it is subject to the health board being satisfied with the service which is being provided and the cost of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not correct to say this occurs only in the Eastern Health Board area. When I first read my briefing note I thought the arrangement was confined to the Western Health Board area because there are more instances of it in that area than elsewhere.  For example, there are physiotherapy services available at Merlin Park Hospital, Galway to which GPs in the Galway area refer patients.  A sum of £35,000 has been provided for sessions there and the service seems to be working well for the benefit of patients.  A physiotherapy scheme was also introduced in Mayo-Roscommon, where GPs can refer patients directly to a private physiotherapist. The cost of that service will be recouped to the GPs by the health board, again, from the drug savings on the scheme to which I referred.  Also in Galway, additional clinical sessions have been establisehd by the board at University <Col N="945" /> College Hospital, Galway where dietetic services are provided.</P>
    <P>New clinic sessions have been provided in a number of health centres around the country.  As the Deputy says, the Eastern Health Board provides some services too.  All general practitioners in the Eastern Health Board area were asked for proposals on the provision of physiotherapy, dietetic and psychiatric counselling services.  It was suggested that they could provide the service in one of three ways &mdash; a group of general practitioners could recruit service providers on a contract basis; general practitioners could contract services for patients through established local service providers or make appropriate arrangements with local hospitals. I presume the letter which was sent from the Eastern Health Board to all general practitioners was taken as a new initiative whereas the practice is fairly widespread in the Western Health Board area and has worked well.  I would like to see it applied generally.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The patient concerned was last assessed in the outpatient clinic in Beaumont Hospital on 16 October 1995 and is currently on the in-patient waiting list for neurosurgery.  The hospital is unable to give an exact date for admission at this stage.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the scheduling of surgery is the clinical decision of the consultant concerned and urgent cases are always given priority.  Should the patient feel concerned that his condition has deteriorated he should return to his general practitioner who will be in the best position to emphasise the urgency of the case directly to the consultant.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in June of this year, I launched the 1995 Waiting List Initiative with the commitment of £8 million nationally.  The aim of this year's initiative is to further reduce waiting times in a number of specialties where waiting times are considered excessive, and a target of 10,934 additional procedures nationally has been set.  Under this year's initiative, a total of £840,000 was allocated to Beaumont Hospital for the provision of 930 additional procedures which includes 200 neurosurgical procedures.  I am confident that this will significantly reduce patient waiting times in this specialty.</P>

    <P>The scheme is not designed to assist in the transport of children to or from <Col N="949" /> school which is the responsibility of the Department of Education.  However, the Department of Education has been in touch with my Department concerning the possibility of co-ordinating transport provision for children with a disability.  This is an issue which will be examined by the health-education inter-departmental co-ordinating committee to address issues of common concern in the provision of services to children with a disability.</P>

The question tabled deals with the transport grant scheme which does not cover children. It applies to adults and is to enable them obtain or retain employment.  In a minority of cases, adults living in isolated rural areas may qualify.  The question is not relevant to the scheme but, as I pointed out in my reply, the Departments of Health and Education set up an interdepartmental co-ordinating committee to which I will refer this issue.</P>

It is a scheme to provide a grant to disabled adults to organise transport and drive cars.  Clearly it is an adult scheme and does not fall remotely within the terms of reference that would apply to children.  Nonetheless I will ensure that the problem identified by the Deputy is brought to the attention of the health and education interdepartmental co-ordinating committee, but I will not give him any time commitment because primary responsibility resets with the Department of Education and I would be unable to deliver on any commitment I might give the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The subvention scheme which accompanied <Col N="951" /> the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 was implemented on 1 September, 1993 and ensures that those most in need of care in a nursing home, and without the means to pay for it, receive assistance towards the cost.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's query, I have no plans to revise the means test for subvention for the following reason. A person in receipt of a nursing home subvention is entitled to items which are covered by the subvention, including incontinence wear.  Article 16.1 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, provides that a registered proprietor of a nursing home shall not seek any additional payment from a subvented patient for any service which is considered to be essential to the maintenance of a person in a nursing home and common practice in a nursing homes.  Among the services which are considered to be essential to the maintenance of a person in a nursing home are incontinence wear and bedding, laundry service and aids and appliances necessary to assist a dependent person with the activities of daily living.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year officials of my Department wrote to the health boards regarding this matter asking them to advise each proprietor of a registered nursing home in their area of the requirements of the nursing homes regulations, informing them that they may not seek additional payments from subvented patients for services such as incontinence wear and aids and appliances.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The chief executive officers of all health boards meet monthly to review certain <Col N="952" /> matters, some of which we refer to them from time to time.  They are at present reviewing the operations of the provisions of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 because, as Deputy Sargent said, while it has worked very well it operates very unevenly.  While it is of great benefit, certain anomalies need to be ironed out.  I can give the Deputy an assurance that a general examination of its operations will be undertaken. Almost £16 million is being expended now on subventions; even though the implementation of the scheme began only recently.  That is a significant amount of money being expended to aid patients in nursing homes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise the terrible predicament in which a member of staff and management of a nursing home are placed when required to supply certain types of medical aids, particularly those relevant to the specific care of the elderly?

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> If a subvention is given to a person in need of incontinence wear, in the amount of subvention granted, the relevant health board should allow for the fact that incontinence wear constitutes a cost. Therefore, rather than claim such cost on a medical card, it should be incorporated in the subvention.  If there is a case or cases along the lines described by the Deputy, an appeal should be submitted to the relevant health board to raise the level of subvention to cover that cost. This should be the approach rather than further extending the benefits of medical cards to persons in nursing homes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There always are difficulties but the nursing homes are private and have an economic cost below which they cannot operate, which is why the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, was introduced in the first place.  I know of many nursing home proprietors who had been catering for a number of patients well below the economic cost.  Therefore, when the subvention was first introduced, those proprietors were simply recovering lost ground, when not all of the subvention went to a patient's benefit, much of it having been absorbed by increased nursing home charges.  We are at present examining the overall position. However, Deputy Sargent's question appears to be prompted by a particular case or cases.  The way to resolve such difficulty is not to seek extension of the relevant medical card for incontinence wear but rather to appeal the level of subvention so that an increased subvention can be allocated by the relevant health board to cover the extra cost which, accordingly to him, is not now covered and cannot be met by the patient's relatives.</P>

When one considers the overall number of nursing homes, it will be seen we have received complaints about very few.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Under the recent Nursing Homes Act, nursing homes that were operational before its introduction were allowed a certain period of time to comply with the terms of the Act and were then licensed by the health boards.  The health boards, under the terms of the Act, have a statutory obligation to ensure that nursing homes operate in accordance with the Act. That is separate from the issue of subvention. Even if a nursing home does not have any patients in receipt of a subvention it still has to comply with the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the summer, in consultation with the proprietors of the nursing homes, the health boards and other interested parties, I announced a set of guidelines of &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; for nursing homes.  However, those guidelines are optional rather than mandatory.  The provision of mandatory guidelines is enshrined in the Nursing Homes Act. <Col N="955" /> Not only are the health boards involved with ensuring standards but they have a statutory obligation to ensure that those standards are maintained.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that he is interested in best practice, best efficiency and intent on people not being excluded from the provisions or falling through the net.  Could he reflect, therefore, on the feasibility of extending the cover under the medical card scheme, given that it will be more focused on the need which must be met rather than putting money into a general coffer for a particular nursing home or the system in general?  This would serve people who may not be residents of nursing homes and who should not be forgotten in considering this issue. Those responsible for operating the nursing homes would understand the reason for that.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to the House on 20 September, the report of the investigation into the operation of Madonna House was referred for legal advice with a view to determining how much of it could be published, without undue risk of legal complications.</P>
      <P>Within the last few days, I have received advice that substantial parts of the report cannot be published without running a serious risk of committing grave contempt and defamation.</P>
      <P>A number of civil actions have been initiated against Madonna House and the Eastern Health Board by or on behalf of former residents of the home. Those actions claim damages against the defendants for assault, negligence and breach of duty.  I am advised that it would be improper and unlawful to publish any material which prejudges issues arising for determination by the courts in the pending proceedings.</P>
      <P>I am examining what options are now open to me in the light of this advice.</P>
      <P>From a preliminary study of the legal advice I have received, it appears that there are two possible options open to me: not to publish the report or to publish an abridged version.  As far as I am concerned the first option can be discounted. My colleague, the Minister for Health and I are anxious that as much of the report as possible be put into the public domain.

I am concerned in particular to ensure that the recommendations <Col N="957" /> contained in the report are made known and that the general public are informed of the steps being taken to implement them.  I also intend to engage in urgent consultations with the Attorney General to see what legislative measures, if any, can be taken to ensure that, in future, similar reports may be published without fear of proceedings.</P>

      <P>Who would be prejudiced by the publication of the full report?  The Minister's legal advice is that to publish the report in full would prejudice the rights of some individuals. Is the Minister referring to the person charged and convicted of abuse?  Would it prejudice those who operated Madonna House or members of the health board?  Does the report indicate whether the 1987 guidelines were breached in this whole affair?  In the light of the facts regarding events at Madonna House involving abuse by an employee of children in care, does the Minister intend to introduce a process of licensing care workers throughout the system on a national basis?  Such a measure has been requested by care workers who work with children.</P>

      <P>I am informed that the Deputy has legal training.  I am sure that if she were approached by a client who requested advice based on the information I have provided to the House she would advise that client to be extremely careful.  In circumstances where phrases such as &ldquo;running a serious risk of committing grave contempt and defamation&rdquo;, and &ldquo;it would be improper and unlawful to publish any material which prejudges issues arising for determination by the courts in the pending proceedings&rdquo;, I am sure the Deputy will understand that there is very little I can add to my original reply to the House.  A number of civil actions have been initiated against Madonna House and the Eastern Health Board by or on behalf of former residents of the home.  In relation to the guidelines and whether they were breached, I have already mentioned the necessity for me <Col N="958" /> to be careful in any replies I provide to the House on this matter.</P>

Is the legal advice received by the Minister to the effect that he will be in a position to publish the report in its entirety when the courts have finished with these matters &mdash; which are the subject matter of the report &mdash; given that the prejudicial aspect will not then apply?  When does the Minister expect to be in a position to say whether he will publish an abridged version of the report in the public interest?</P>

The Minister for Health and I have made our desire clear to make as much of this report as possible available to the public.  It is our intention to do so when the time comes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I headed the Irish delegation to the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women which was held in Beijing from 4 to 15 September. Also present for parts of the conference were the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Doyle.  The delegation also included officials of my Department, the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Health and Education, four Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; three Deputies and a Senator &mdash; and representatives of the Employment Equality Agency, the National Economic and Social Forum, the National Women's Council of Ireland, the Irish Countrywomen's Association, Dóchas/Banúlacht and the Irish Aid Advisory Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1139" /> The conference was essentially intergovernmental in character with a parallel forum for non-governmental organisations.  However, I appreciated the support of my colleagues who were present from the Oireachtas.  I was pleased to be able to facilitate the Oireachtas Members on this occasion by including them in the official delegation.</P>
    <P>The conference held particular significance, coinciding as it did with the year of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations.  In recent days we have heard much concerning the inadequacies and shortcomings of that organisation but, nonetheless, it provides the only forum through which countries with widely diverging cultures and outlooks can meet and formulate strategies with the common objective of improving the status of women.</P>
    <P>The World Conference on Women was the biggest event of this type to have been organised by the United Nations to date.  Around 5,000 delegates of 189 states and of many international organisations attended.  During the first week of the conference, and during the week preceding it, an NGO forum was held near Beijing.  This was attended by around 25,000.</P>
    <P>The world conference itself operates through a plenary session at which statements were made by representatives of participating states and organisations and through working groups and subgroups which discussed the content of the Declaration and Platform for Action which constituted the output of the conference. I made the statement on behalf of Ireland to the plenary session.  Under the rules of the procedure, speakers were encouraged to concentrate on commitments of their governments and in line with this I made commitments to aim to ensure that women constitute at least 40 per cent of the membership of State boards; strengthen and extend the scope of employment equality legislation and outlaw discrimination in non-employment areas on grounds of gender, marital and parental status and on <Col N="1140" /> other grounds; follow through on the process of consultation with women's organisations and bodies responsible for the health of women concerning a discussion document, published by the Minister for Health, which reviews the health status of Irish women and examines how the health services can better meet their needs, and prepare a plan; implement a policy to develop a comprehensive family planning service within the public health system; in the education system, provide for equal participation by females in all areas of the curriculum; provide that, at third level, each educational institution will have to develop and publish a policy promoting gender equality; increase Ireland's official ODA by 0.05 per cent of GDP each year in order to achieve the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GDP; implement the 20/20 concept as included in the Copenhagen programme; provide for appropriate involvement of Irish NGOs in the implementation of the platform to be agreed at this conference; continue to mainstream gender in Irish aid programmes; and enact legislation to extend further protection for women and children in situations of domestic violence.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will note, four of these commitments relate to my area of responsibility.  The remainder are solely for other Ministers and inquiries on their implementation should be addressed to the responsible persons. These commitments are, of course, examples rather than a comprehensive statement of the Government's policy on equality.  In fact, all the actions agreed in the platform constitute commitments of the participating governments on the basis on which they were agreed.</P>
    <P>With specific reference to those commitments for which I have responsibility, the Government has the ambitious objective of ensuring that women constitute at least 40 per cent of the membership of State boards.  I am at <Col N="1141" /> present examining, as a priority, possible legislative measures which would facilitate this outcome.</P>
    <P>I hope to publish the Employment Equality Bill during the current Dáil session and to publish the Equal Status Bill as soon as possible in 1996.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the follow-up to the world conference at greater length later in my statement but Deputies can be assured that there will be an appropriate role for NGOs as there has been in the whole process up to now.</P>
    <P>With regard to domestic violence, the draft legislation to extend further protection for women and children in such situations is currently before the Oireachtas.  In the run-up to the conference some felt the prospect of a strong Platform for Action was poor, given the amount of unagreed text following earlier preparatory committee meetings.</P>
    <P>Despite much preparatory work the conference was faced, at the beginning, with a draft Platform for Action which had a considerable number of unresolved questions.  About 40 per cent of the text was the subject of disagreement.</P>
    <P>The principal difficulties were in the areas of human rights, sexual rights, health, resources, respect for cultural and religious differences, sexual orientation, the definition of the family, parental responsibilities, inheritance rights, use of &ldquo;gender&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;sex&rdquo; and, of course, the possibility and content of a declaration to accompany the Platform for Action.</P>
    <P>For the most part, these issues were resolved in a satisfactory way.  The difficulty of securing agreement among the whole community of nations, embracing diverse philosophies and cultures, was obvious.  The platform was agreed with reservations entered by some states which had difficulty with certain sections.  The successful result of the conference is a tribute to all the participants. The Declaration and Platform for Action are important for women worldwide, and should help to ensure that <Col N="1142" /> equality comes about for women everywhere.</P>
    <P>The documents agreed at the conference cover all aspects of women's lives and set out strategies to advance the goals of equality, development and peace.  In particular, they call for the promotion and protection of the human rights of women and girls as an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of all human rights and fundamental freedoms. The consensus and progress made at previous world conferences in Nairobi, Rio de Janeiro, Vienna, Cairo and Copenhagen are reaffirmed and endorsed with the addition of important new commitments.  Measures which feature prominently in the conclusions of the conference are the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women and girls and the removal of all obstacles to gender equality and the advancement and empowerment of women; the full participation of women on the basis of equality in all spheres of society, including the decision making process; the prevention and elimination of violence against women and girls; the elimination of unequal access to health-care and related services; the promotion of people centred sustainable development; steps to ensure the advancement of women in the context of peace, and the attainment of general and complete disarmament; and the promotion of women's education, including education with emphasis on science and the new technologies, economic independence and the eradication of poverty.</P>
    <P>In advance of the conference Ireland expressed the desire to see a strong, positive and progressive Platform for Action, which built on previously agreed standards and texts, in particular the conclusions of Vienna, Cairo and Copenhagen.  Ireland attached great importance to the human rights of women and the girl-child, and the recognition of women as actors, not as victims. Ireland also supported a strong condemnation of all forms of violence against women, whether physical, sexual or psychological, including violence perpetrated or condoned by the State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1143" /> In negotiations on the Declaration and Platform for Action the EU Presidency spoke on behalf of the Union. National concerns were pursued at EU co-ordination meetings.  The approach of the Irish delegation was to: (a) support the retention of positive language agreed at previous conferences such as the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna and the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo; (b) support references to the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of sex, sexual orientation and parental status in employment and to legal protection against sexual and other harassment, in line with Government policy in this area; (c) support recognition in the platform of the additional disadvantage faced by some women, for example, members of racial or ethnic minorities; (d) ensure that the EU did not pursue positions which we could not accept, particularly due to constitutional or legal factors; and (e) ensure that recognition of the vital role of women in development was strongly reflected in the development aspects of the platform.</P>
    <P>I am very happy with the contribution made by the Irish delegation during these negotiations.  In particular, I am pleased that the Irish delegation was able to help in achieving agreement on contentious issues, especially in the final days of the conference, when Ireland was represented by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, on a high-level group dealing with the most difficult subjects.</P>
    <P>When the report of the conference, including the text of the platform becomes available, I will lay it before the House and endeavour to make it available to interested persons and organisations.</P>
    <P>The UN Fourth World Conference on Women was the culmination of a long preparatory process at national, European and international levels.  Ireland played an active and important part in this process.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> Each participating state was asked to prepare a national report outlining progress made towards the advancement of women in preparation for the conference. Reports were to review and appraise national progress and outline future strategic goals and objectives. Ireland's national report was submitted to the UN in October 1994.  A committee chaired by my Department and representative of other relevant Government Departments, the social partners, the Employment Equality Agency and women's organisations co-ordinated Ireland's preparations for the conference. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Burton, organised an information seminar on the subject in May.  A number of regional meetings have been held by the National Women's Council of Ireland and the ICA and the former body organised a national conference on 19 July.</P>
    <P>Five regional preparatory meetings under the auspices of the UN regional economic commissions took place in 1994 and agreed regional platforms for action.  The preparatory conference for Europe and North America took place in Vienna last October.  I led Ireland's delegation to the Vienna preparatory conference, as I believed this conference was an important milestone on the way to Beijing and important in its own right.  The Platform for Action agreed at Vienna was positive and progressive and parties to it sought to ensure that it was adequately reflected in the Beijing Platform for Action.</P>
    <P>The preparatory committee for the world conference was organised under the auspices of the UN Commission on the Status of Women and met twice in 1994 as well as in March-April 1995. The remit of the 1995 meeting was to finalise the draft Platform for Action but, despite an extension of the meeting, it failed to reach agreement on a large portion of text.  There was substantial disagreement on many issues in the platform with most of the text subject to reservations by delegations or groups of delegations.  There was a perception <Col N="1145" /> that some states wished to dilute language agreed at previous similar conferences on issues such as the human rights of women and girls, reproductive rights and health.  There were also differences on economic, resource and environmental issues between the developed and developing countries.  In view of the many issues in dispute in relation to the platform, informal consultations took place on some sections of it in New York on 31 July to 4 August.  This meeting managed to reach consensus on some of the contentious issues and these agreements were affirmed at the start of the world conference.</P>
    <P>At European Union level an <i>ad hoc</i> group was established at the end of 1994 to co-ordinate activities.  The group met on several occasions during the year and met throughout the conference in Beijing to co-ordinate the EU position. Meetings were held at ministerial level in Beijing also which helped to maintain the unity of the EU position as the negotiations evolved.</P>
    <P>The overall outcome of the negotiations was satisfactory from the point of view of Ireland and the EU with our stance prevailing in some cases and not in others.  The rules of procedure provided that all possible efforts should be made to ensure that the work of the conference and the adoption of its report were accomplished by general agreement.  Each part of the documents had to receive the assent of all or almost all of the participating states.  If a small number could not accept a text it was adopted and the dissenters had the opportunity to record their reservations.</P>
    <P>The European Union wanted sexual rights, a concept not previously agreed at a world conference, to be guaranteed in the platform.  These rights were to include the right to have control over and decide freely in matters of sexuality, free of coercion, discrimination and violence.  This proposal evoked opposition from many states.  However, though the term &ldquo;sexual rights&rdquo; is not <Col N="1146" /> used these rights are now in the platform. Ireland supports this important development.</P>
    <P>All references to sexual orientation in the platform were deleted as they were unacceptable to a substantial number of countries.  These references were supported by the EU which had proposed including sexual orientation in the platform as a ground on which discrimination in employment should be prohibited.  Age, race and religion, which had been proposed by others in the same context, were deleted.  For our part we could have accepted mention of all those grounds but when many other countries objected compromise was necessary.  Useful additions to the platform in the course of the conference were references to the central role of religion in the lives of many people and to the role of women as mothers.  These two elements helped to counter a criticism which had been made of the Beijing process, namely, that it was imposing a specifically western model of the promotion of women.  The paragraph on religion has important references to the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion and to the fact that any form of extremism may have a negative impact on women and lead to violence and discrimination.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 9 of the platform provides a saver for states in implementing the agreed actions inasmuch as it recognises that this has to be the sovereign responsibility of each state.  This paragraph was the subject of much disagreement at the conference and the text as finalised is a compromise which is acceptable because, while affirming the prerogatives of states, it emphasises the need for the full realisation of all human rights and fundamental freedoms of all women and provides that implementation must be in conformity with these rights and freedoms.</P>
    <P>A satisfactory compromise was reached to ensure that references to human rights were not qualified by the words &ldquo;universal&rdquo; or &ldquo;universally recognised&rdquo; which the EU viewed as restricting the enjoyment of these rights.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1147" /> The economic independence of women is crucial to the achievement of equality and women must have access to secure, well-paid employment as a key to tackling other problems such as violence, poverty and exclusion.  Strategies to promote the increased involvement of women in economic life must include positive action, family-friendly conditions of employment, increased sharing of family responsibilities and access to high quality, affordable, child-care.</P>
    <P>Experience has taught us that legal measures alone are not sufficient to ensure that equal opportunities for women and men become a reality.  To change society, and the relative levels of power within society, it is necessary to change attitudes and behaviour as well as the legal and administrative context.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Government attaches great importance to equal participation of women and men in decision-making roles and is committed to a radical programme of action in appointing women to State boards.  Each country has a duty to examine the obstacles existing to women's full participation in public life.  Political parties, the social partners and public institutions have a role to play here.</P>
    <P>Proposals coming to Government must already include an assessment of the probable impact on women of any policy change.  This is an important mechanism for sensitising decision-makers. The Government has also built the objective of equality for women into the Structural Funds, through specific commitments in the National Development Plan on gender-proofing and child care. These have been followed through in the Community Support Framework and in individual operational programmes. This is very much in line with current European thought on mainstreaming.</P>
    <P>A feature of recent world conferences has been the ever-increasing role of non-governmental organisations.  This is encouraged by the UN system and by participating states.  I have already paid <Col N="1148" /> tribute to the Oireachtas Members who went to Beijing and I also wish to express my appreciation of the role of Irish NGOs both as members of the official delegation and for their active participation in the NGO forum.  During my stay in China, I had the welcome opportunity to visit the forum site, see at first hand the activities of Irish NGOs and participate in discussions with them. I arranged for daily briefings of NGOs by officials from the Irish delegation and understand that these were found to be very helpful.</P>
    <P>The overall allocation at my disposal for the world Conference and activities associated with it was £100,000 in 1995. This covered the cost of the members of the delegation from my Department who attended, the expenses associated with preparatory meetings and the publication of a supplement to our national report.  The expenses of Ministers and officials of other Departments who went to Beijing were borne on their own Votes.  From my allocation, I set aside an amount to fund conferences organised by the National Women's Council in the run up to Beijing.  I also used it to pay expenses of the NGO representatives on the official delegation.  Other NGOs were funded by me subject to the following maxima: Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed £2,300; National Traveller Women's Forum £2,700; Forum of People with Disabilities £2,300; Women's Aid £2,700; National Youth Council £1,200; Cork Federation of Women's Organisations £2,300; Inishowen Women's Network £1,200; Women of the North West £2,300; and Tallaght NOW £1,200.  In deciding on this allocation, I wished to assist a mix of organisations: broadly based organisations like the National Women's Council and the ICA, organisations dealing with women experiencing double disadvantage such as disability, young women, grassroots groups and, in the case of Women's Aid, an organisation dealing with violence against women which is an important area of concern in the Platform for Action.  I decided I would not assist women's <Col N="1149" /> groups of political parties because, if I were to do this for all parties, it would eat up the funds which I had for NGOs in general to go to Beijing.  While a decision on which organisations to fund and which to refuse is always a difficult one and is bound to be disputed, I believe that my allocation of resources, which are necessarily limited, has met with general acceptance on the part of women's organisations.  The Departments of Foreign Affairs, Social Welfare and the Environment assisted NGOs in their sphere of activity.</P>
    <P>While it was gratifying for all of us who attended the conference to see agreement reached on the Platform for Action, especially after the uncertainty and pessimism of the preceding months, it is not on this that the success of the conference will ultimately be judged. Instead it will be judged on the actions which result from it throughout the world.  Only after a period of years and in the light of the development or lack of it in bringing about equality, will we be able to say whether the effort expended on this world conference was worthwhile.  I am hopeful that Beijing will provide the impetus worldwide not alone to governments but to society generally to make substantial and measurable progress in this regard.</P>
    <P>I will be paying particular attention to follow-up in Ireland and intend to take decisions shortly on the structure which will co-ordinate this.  Chapter 5 of the Platform for Action calls for the involvement of NGOs in formulating strategies for the implementation of the platform and, in line with my approach to date, I will ensure that this is a feature of our follow-up.</P>
    <P>The policies initiated by the last Government and continued by the present administration facilitate the implementation of the platform as do the equality activities of the European Union.  I am thinking in particular of our targets of gender balance on State boards, the introduction of new equality legislation and, at the European level, the Fourth Action Programme on Equal Opportunities between Women and <Col N="1150" /> Men which is now being formulated. The EU Social Affairs Council has already reviewed the outcome of Beijing at a recent open session.  It has also decided to return to the topic at least once a year.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to publish a White Paper during the period of office of this Government which will include a review of our plans on equality in the light of the actions agreed in Beijing.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, in the lead-up to the conference there was profound uncertainty about the prospects of agreeing conclusions.  There was also a degree of unease about arrangements for the event itself and the related NGO forum.  I am fully aware of the criticisms which have been made of China's record on human rights and of the amplification of that criticism which occurred in the run-up to the conference in Beijing.  In focusing international attention even more closely than before on these issues, I would hope that the conference would have beneficial effects on all in China, women and men. My colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, ensures that we take up the issue of human rights with the Chinese authorities at every appropriate opportunity, including of course the grave ongoing problem of Tibet.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the various constraints, I am satisfied that the conference was a success both in terms of organisation and of the documents which emanated from it.  It will always be difficult to reconcile the widely different views that exist on aspects of the subject matter of the conference but I am confident that, in the Declaration and Platform for Action, we have the basis for the advancement of women as we face the 21st century.</P>

      <P>I was not aware of that; I delivered the message I received. Deputies Wallace and de Valera are disappointed they are unable to be present.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said, this important conference on women provided an opportunity for a ten year review of progress on a worldwide basis and for a fresh commitment on the part of governments and NGOs to a new Platform for Action over the next decade. The people of Ireland, and both sides of Dáil Éireann, share a common vision of a new society which will be just and equitable and in which women and men can participate equally as full citizens ensuring the right of every woman to participate with dignity and independence.</P>
      <P>The huge attendance of NGOs out of 25,000 representatives, indicates the strength of the non-governmental organisations throughout the world. Ireland was well represented in that sphere and Cork, where many women's groups have been formed, had a special representation.  The fact that there were 5,000 delegates from 189 states and from many international organisations and that there were five times as many non-governmental organisation representatives speaks volumes for the role of those organisations throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1152" /> The Minister was in the happy position that he had a good story to tell and was happy with the contribution made by the Irish delegation during these negotiations.  That was the story he had to tell and it reflects the fact that good work was done.  The Minister had a good story to tell, a record of much progress in Ireland over the past ten years and a considerable volume of work in progress in 1995.  Much remains to be done.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the conference that virtually every system of government has failed to achieve equal participation for women and men in decision-making. Women are less represented in the middle and upper levels of management than men and that is the case in both the private and public sectors.</P>
    <P>Prejudice against women is still a widespread phenomenon in top management. The percentage of women at principal officer level in the Civil Service in January last was only 12.1 while only 5.5 per cent had reached assistant secretary level.  A new approach of positive action is needed to overcome prejudice against women and remove obstacles which prevent women's full participation in the public and private sectors.  Women do not need discrimination in their favour; they need positive action to give them an equal opportunity to achieve their potential.</P>
    <P>The economic dependence of women is one of the hallmarks of our society which needs to be addressed.  If women are to achieve equality then they must achieve economic independence.  They must have access to secure, well paid jobs as a key to overcoming poverty, exclusion and domestic violence.  Access to education at all levels is essential to achieve this advancement.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister referred to the commitment to gender balance on State boards and the employment equality legislation to which we are looking forward.  He also mentioned the education system and the need to provide for equal participation by women in all areas of the curriculum.  I would add education and training, an area <Col N="1153" /> in which women do not have equal opportunities.</P>
    <P>While educational opportunities for young women have increased at a rapid rate, women who have worked unstintingly in the home are currently denied access to FÁS courses, community employment schemes and second chance education.  This practical discrimination against women must be dismantled, although I appreciate it may have to be done in a phased way.  This is real discrimination to which we should turn our attention because it has an important bearing on the economic independence of women which the Minister referred to as a vital requisite for the future.</P>
    <P>We need action programmes to increase the involvement of women in the economic life of the country.  Positive action can ensure family-friendly conditions in the workplace, more sharing of family responsibilities, better access to child care facilities and protection for the legal rights of women to equality in the workplace.  A changing feature of society today is sharing responsibilities, especially among young parents.  One of the great difficulties in this regard, however, is access to child care facilities.</P>
    <P>No positive action programme will be complete unless it includes adequate measures to deal with the provision of child care facilities.  The State also has a responsibility to ensure that adequate standards and safeguards are available for the protection of children and their good health and safety while in temporary care.  It should be noted that Ireland currently has one of the lowest levels of child care provision in the European Union.</P>
    <P>The whole question of child care facilities needs urgent attention.  Much good work has been done by women's groups who help disadvantaged women in particular communities.  That has developed in recent years and it is particularly important for lone parents and other disadvantaged persons trying to get back into the workforce.  Some of <Col N="1154" /> the changes in social welfare have facilitated that development and the transition of lone parents in particular into the workforce.</P>
    <P>We must address the whole question of child care facilities and set up a programme which deals not only with cases of disadvantage and special disadvantage, which deserve our support, but with the wider issue of child care facilities for women in society and the supports needed if they are to have the opportunity to participate fully in the workforce.  Although responsibilities are shared in a much more forthright way today than in the past, a special programme on child care facilities is urgently needed.</P>
    <P>The participation of women in the workforce is low and the average income in 1993 was 61 per cent of average gross male earnings; only 34 per cent of women of working age were in the labour force in 1992, earning an independent income through paid work, in comparison to 70 per cent of men.  In addition, some 85 per cent of low paid part-time workers are women.  That is why we tackled the difficulties faced by part-time workers in recent years and extended social welfare provision to cover part-time workers.  In practice we found that over 85 per cent of part-time workers were women and in that way they were being discriminated against indirectly.</P>
    <P>The fact that two-thirds of women are not in the labour force has important implications and long-term consequences for women.  They do not benefit from the income and the independence associated with being in the labour force and, in the long-term, are excluded from many other opportunities, including social welfare participation and participation in training and educational opportunities.  This contributes to a state of dependency, an issue which must be tackled.</P>
    <P>It is important to provide options and support for women through the provision of child care facilities, social welfare inclusion and equal access to training and work experience programmes.  I <Col N="1155" /> do not intend detailing those as everyone participating in this debate will appreciate that many women are excluded from training opportunities because they do not have an individual social welfare payment due to their state of dependency.  That is a major problem which has wide implications but it can be dealt with in a phased way.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a considerable programme to which we can look forward.  I recognise that much work will be ongoing during 1995 but we must now look to 1996 and beyond to determine what tasks should be undertaken by Government to ensure that the position of women generally in our society is enhanced.</P>
    <P>The conference was particularly valuable in that it reasserted many of the rights, entitlements and standards with which we have become familiar and to which we have become accustomed.  It committed all the nations to continuing progress along the lines set out in the declaration.  In that sense, the conference had two objectives, to consolidate the positions already achieved and to look to the future and obtain commitments from all countries which would not only help us with our work but ensure that through the United Nations we could also help disadvantaged women throughout the world.</P>
    <P>I must comment on the extensive and valuable preparatory work done by Irish women's groups and representatives. The report they produced was particularly helpful.  We can look to this conference as one at which we presented a strong official position and contributed substantially to plans for the future.  We represented our position well as a member of the European Union and the Minister's speech at the conference strongly highlighted the nature of current needs.  The Minister did well in this regard and it was a very valuable conference.</P>
    <P>I asked a parliamentary question today about the organisations who were refused participation.  I notice the Minister referred to the organisations he <Col N="1156" /> supported and pointed to the fact that he decided not to assist women's groups in political parties because to do so for all parties would eat up the funds available to allow NGOs in general to go to Beijing.  That is a funny statement because there are only six parties if one includes the Green Party.  At £2,300 a head, one is talking about a total expenditure of only £10,000 to £12,000.</P>
    <P>The women who participate in the political parties, whether in Fine Gael, the Progressive Democrats, Fianna Fáil, or the Labour Party, voluntarily contribute an enormous amount of their time to developing and promoting the needs of women and ensuring those needs are represented in policy documents and so on.  They play an important part in this work.  The Minister's decision was wrong; he should have included them.  A number of them approached the Minister for some assistance to send even one person but that was refused.  The Minister has given his reason here but it is not a good reason.  He had £100,000 and it was hardly a big issue for the Government to provide another £5,000 to £10,000 for others who requested support.</P>
    <P>I have always strongly believed in supporting community development and non-governmental organisations because of their importance to society. There is a tremendous number of voluntary organisations in this country.  I prepared a charter for them which is lying somewhere on the Minister's shelf. They play an important role but the women who participate in the democratic process of the political parties play an equally important part.  It is a denigration of our democratic process to say they are not important enough.  It is a mistake.  Too often we have people saying that politics is more or less the butt end of things.</P>
    <P>I regard politics as the ultimate in public service and remember President John F. Kennedy making that point very strongly.  I spent a good deal of time studying public service in the Institute of Public Administration and serving in <Col N="1157" /> the public service.  Those who participate in and contribute voluntarily to the political process should be recognised and have their say.  Decisions such as the Minister's contribute to the thinking that there is something wrong with politics. Politics is the ultimate democratic process.  When the guns were set aside on the streets in Dublin and throughout the country this Chamber became the debating forum in which people worked out their differences and pressed for change.</P>
    <P>Apart from that issue, the Minister has done a good job and represented us very well.  There is a good programme in place which needs to be revitalised next year.  We will certainly help the Minister with that process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased we have this opportunity to make statements on the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing.  Very often there is no feedback from such conferences whether on women or other issues of national import.</P>
      <P>The British author and journalist, Paul Harrison said in his book <i>Inside the Third World:</i></P>
      <P>Women not only constitute half of humanity, they are the nurturers of all future generations.  Poverty, including poverty among men, cannot be eradicated unless at the same time all the particular mechanisms for oppressing women are eradicated as well.</P>
      <P>That is essentially what the Fourth World Conference on Women was all about.  In the run-up to the conference Gertrude Mongella, the General Secretary of the Fourth World Conference on Women, said:</P>
      <P>I emphasize again and again that women and men must tackle women's problems together, for they are society's problems.  If we cannot do this, we will soon be in a situation in which today's women confront yesterday's men.</P>
      <P>That is a very telling statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very often not much is expected of <Col N="1158" /> international years, world conferences, government summits and similar events but they achieve some benefit, particularly if the discussions receive worldwide media attention.  I regret that the media attention on this world conference was minimal.  That is significant in terms of how high women's issues appear to be on the agenda.  They are obviously not high on the agenda of the media in this country and that is regrettable. At least, because of the stars of the conference and the difficulties experienced during parts of the conference, there was more media attention than would otherwise have been the case.  It is extraordinary that the media isolated controversial elements without concentrating on the positive aspects of the conference.</P>
    <P>Both government and non-governmental organisations are prompted into action by such conferences.  It is often forgotten that such events present an opportunity for better North-South co-operation. The day-to-day misery in the developing countries does not normally make headlines and conferences present just such an opportunity.</P>
    <P>The history of the women's conferences is also the history of the growing importance of non-governmental organisations.  They have been heavily involved from the beginning and have been used alongside governments to implement policy.  The Minister paid tribute, as I do, to the many NGOs which contributed, not only at the conference but especially to the preparations for the conference.  Their extraordinary input enriched the programme and helped enormously to achieve a successful conclusion to it.</P>
    <P>The NGOs have had a considerable influence on all the conferences following the meeting in Mexico at the beginning of the decade in which several thousand of their representatives took part.  They have also had a considerable influence on the action programme for the second half of the United Nations decade for women.  For example, in Copenhagen it was agreed to adopt a proposal by the German delegation to <Col N="1159" /> set up a network of centres to implement equality at all political levels from local to national and to include grassroots structures.  These are the measures needed to ensure monitoring of events.  The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1979.  By 1990, 102 states had ratified or acceded to the convention &mdash; 28 in Africa, 30 in Latin America and the Caribbean and 12 in Asia &mdash; while 45 states &mdash; 16 in Africa, two in the Caribbean and 24 in Asia &mdash; had rejected it.  At world conferences we turn around the decision of these countries.</P>
    <P>The Nairobi conference in 1985 became the symbol for empowerment. At the conference a participant from Senegal said: &ldquo;Only if we have power will we have influence and money, without influence and money there will be no end to the oppression of women and the whole population will continue in misery&rdquo;.  This says everything about what we must do to empower women and ensure that they take their rightful place not only in Ireland but throughout the world.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to read the draft Beijing declaration put together during the middle of the night and approved by the main committee.  It expresses the determination of governments to intensify efforts and actions to achieve the goals of the Nairobi forward looking strategies for the advancement of women by the end of the century.  I do not believe in that timetable but those strategies provided a framework for action at national, regional and international levels to promote the empowerment of women and their enjoyment of human rights.  The draft declaration states that governments assert their determination to promote women's economic independence, including employment, and people centred sustainable development, including sustained economic developments through the provision of basic education, lifelong education, literacy and training and primary health <Col N="1160" /> care for girls and women.  It also states that governments express their determination to ensure peace for women and, recognising the leading role women have played in the peace movement, work towards general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international controls and support negotiations on the conclusion without delay of a universal and multilaterally and effectively verifiable nuclear test ban treaty.</P>
    <P>The draft declaration calls for the elimination of all forms of violence against women and girls and states that governments pledge to intensify their efforts to ensure equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms for women and girls and, above all, give a commitment to implement the Platform for Action, ensuring that a gender perspective is reflected in all their policies and programmes.  They urge the United Nations system, regional and national institutions and all women and men to commit themselves fully to action.  As someone privileged to attend the conference I was struck that the one word which kept arising was &ldquo;implementation&rdquo;.  This is the crux of the matter in terms of our programmes.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the team of Irish officials who worked at the conference. Their dedication and hard work was extraordinary and as an Irish participant I was particularly proud of their ability to work on proposals and arrive at satisfactory conclusions.  I wish to pay tribute to our Ministers and, in particular, to the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, who helped to achieve a satisfactory result during the final days of the conference. It is important to make these points.</P>
    <P>This was not a political conference in the sense that we understand it, it was a conference about improving the status of women and the programmes we need to embark upon to ensure this happens. I was very glad to hear the Minister enumerate the commitments he made on behalf of Ireland at the conference.  I could be very critical and say that some <Col N="1161" /> of these are aspirations but at least we have a list of commitments and can call the Minister to account if we believe he is not realising these.  This relates to the point about implementation.</P>
    <P>While the conference was an incredibly important occasion there were two days of particular importance.  One of these was the parliamentarians' day during which the members of parliament &ldquo;resolved&rdquo; to bring certain matters to the attention of governments, etc.  This type of language is very important as it gives impetus to the efforts to ensure that programmes are implemented.  A declaration was drawn up by the Members of the European Parliament and the parliaments of the member states which will help in the efforts to ensure that programmes are implemented.  It states that the members of the parliaments of the European Union take the view that the European Union should implement the decisions taken on the Platform for Action and assume the role of catalyst with regard to efforts to achieve equality for women in political and economic life, the family and society in general.  This is an extremely important statement given that we were present at the conference as a member of the European Union, negotiating as part of a team and helping to influence in a very positive way the outcome of the conference.</P>
    <P>It goes on to state clearly and equivocally that women's and children's rights are an integral, inalienable and indissoluble part of universal human rights and that this includes sexual and reproductive rights.  There was some difficulty about the inclusion of such wording in the document.  It was important for us to do a solo run, so to speak, on that issue.  It calls on all states which have not yet ratified the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women to do so and to take active steps to remove reservations. This is an interesting statement given the many criticisms about the venue for the conference.  It calls on the United <Col N="1162" /> Nations, in view of the numerous problems experienced in obtaining guarantees for freedom of expression, access to the conference and visa authorisations, to reinforce existing criteria which must be fulfilled before taking decisions on a site for any future conferences and to insist strongly on compliance with the criteria on the part of the host government. These criteria would include an assurance of acceptable conditions for NGOs and people with disabilities.  I think representatives of NGOs agree that some of the situations in which they found themselves were intolerable.</P>
    <P>It goes on to state that they reaffirm their commitment to the notion of equality between women and men as opposed to equity; stress the need for a gender perspective in all legislation, policies, programmes and structures, ensuring mainstreaming in all areas; underline the need to take specific measures to ensure women's equal access to and full participation in power structures and decision making; consider the empowerment of women as a critical factor in the eradication of poverty which is a persistent and increasing burden on women and believe that economic independence for women is essential in order to attain true equality. These sentiments were echoed by our colleagues from the Third World.  They stress the importance for women of global sustainable development; call on governments to ensure equal access for all girls and women to education, vocational training and the labour market and to realise measures to reconcile professional and family life for men and women; stress the right of all women to attain the highest standard of sexual and reproductive health; reject, in the strongest possible terms, all forms of violence against women and girls, whether this be physical, psychological or sexual and call for a specific initiative against trafficking in women; consider that due attention should be given to the particular situation of migrant and refugee women.</P>
    <P>I am not putting this forward as an alternative, but members of the national <Col N="1163" /> parliaments of the member states of the European Union and of the European Parliament who are in a privileged position should always seek to act as a catalyst for change in the empowerment of women, particularly those who find themselves in less fortunate circumstances than ourselves.</P>
    <P>Much work remains to be done here on women's rights in terms of access to employment, training and so on.  While, to a certain extent, we should count our blessings, it should be realised that there is a need to give a lead and ensure that at conferences such as this we are able to stand over our record when it comes to the empowerment of women so that no one can point the finger and accuse us of preaching.</P>
    <P>While implementation of policies is important, monitoring is essential if we are to reach our targets.  I was glad the Minister said he intends to publish a White Paper which will include a review of the plans on equality in the light of the actions agreed in Beijing.  That is welcome.  In relation to the Platform for Action we need to be aware of developments bearing in mind that the agenda for the conference in Beijing resembled that for Nairobi.  That was extraordinary.  I hope this will not be repeated in ten years time.</P>
    <P>I am glad we have been given this opportunity to discuss what happened at the conference.  It behoves all of us, as parliamentarians, to ensure that the action plan is implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had the privilege of attending at the request of the Taoiseach the Fourth UN Conference on Women which took place in Beijing in September.  I also represented the Fine Gael Party and the Fine Gael women's group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank all those at an official level who made our participation at the conference possible and so worthwhile, including the Secretary of the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  Mr. Bernard McDonagh, all the officials at <Col N="1164" /> that Department and Anne Webster and John Bigger of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>I single out for particular mention Thelma Doran who was Irish Ambassdor in Beijing at the time.  Her help, practical advice and hospitality knew no bounds.  She made our stay extremely pleasant and memorable.  I thank her for the way she looked after the Irish delegation.</P>
    <P>I also thank my secretary, Gerry Cassidy, while the Department of Health was ably represented by Ruth Barrington.</P>
    <P>The conference was also attended by Deputies Helen Keogh, Séamus Pattison, Frances Fitzgerald and Senator Ann Ormonde and by the back-up staff to the representatives of the committees which were represented.</P>
    <P>The officials who supported the official delegation worked throughout the day and night.  They were present for a briefing session in the lobby of the hotel at 7.45 a.m. each morning and briefed the NGOs during the break for lunch.  Their commitment, expertise and example knew no bounds.  Their contribution was noted by one and all.</P>
    <P>The Chinese through the Irish Embassy in Beijing made superb arrangements for us, including transport arrangements.  In particular, I thank the Chinese Ambassador who met and briefed me before I left for the conference. A lovely conference centre was put at our disposal.  Matters were more difficult during the NGO conference the preceding week when unfortunately, it rained for the entire week.  We had clement weather which made our trip much more pleasant.</P>
    <P>Despite some initial pessimism &mdash; the question had been asked why China had been chosen &mdash; the governmental conference in Beijing was successful.  Representatives of 189 countries agreed a declaration and a most important document, the Platform for Action, which commits governments to take steps to address during the next decade or so inequalities and repression of women. There is general agreement that the <Col N="1165" /> Platform for Action is an important step beyond what was agreed at the third UN Conference on Women which took place in Nairobi some ten years ago and that this will create a momentum in favour of women throughout the world.</P>
    <P>In the run-up to the conference some felt that the prospect for a strong, vibrant Platform for Action was poor, given the amount of unagreed text following earlier preparatory committees. The draft Platform for Action contained over 40 per cent of unagreed text.  The difficulty of securing agreement among the entire community of nations representing many diverse philosophies and cultures was obvious.  The successful result of the conference is a tribute to all participants.  The Declaration and Platform for Action are important for women and should help to ensure that equality becomes a reality for women in the immediate years ahead.</P>
    <P>The strength and unity of the European Union was an important factor in securing the Declaration and Platform for Action.  The EU played a leading role at the conference.  EU consensus was reached in a spirit of partnership and co-operation.  I pay a special tribute to the Spanish Presidency, to Minister Christina Alberdi, who handled the negotiations on behalf of the EU so effectively.</P>
    <P>Ireland expressed the desire to see a strong, positive and progressive Platform for Action which built on previously agreed standards, in particular the conclusions of Vienna, Cairo and Copenhagen.  We attach great importance to the human rights of women and girl-children and the recognition of women as actors, not as victims.  We also supported a strong condemnation of all forms of violence against women, whether physical, sexual or psychological, including violence perpetrated or condoned by the state.</P>
    <P>The Beijing agenda included 12 critical areas of concern to women: poverty, education, inequalities in access to health and related services, violence against women, armed conflict, the economy, women in decision-making, <Col N="1166" /> mechanisms to promote the advancement of women, human rights, the media, the environment and the situation of the girl-child.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, has outlined, the principal difficulties were in the following areas: human rights, sexual rights, health, resources, respect for cultural and religious differences, sexual orientation, the definition of the family, parental responsibilities, inheritance rights, the use of the word &ldquo;gender&rdquo; instead of the word &ldquo;sex&rdquo; and, of course, the possibility and content of a declaration to accompany the Platform for Action.</P>
    <P>The Government considers that the documents agreed at Beijing should be the blueprint for the future.  Ireland takes the commitments in the Platform for Action very seriously and will follow-up appropriately, as the Minister for Equality and Law Reform indicated this evening.  The Government is already committed to an ambitious and wide-ranging programme to ensure equality becomes a reality in all aspects of society.</P>
    <P>Why China?  Why Beijing?  I am fully aware of the criticisms which have been made of China's record on human rights and of the amplification of the criticism which occurred in the run-up to the women's conference in Beijing.  In focusing international attention even more closely than before on these issues, I hope the conference will have beneficial effects on all in China, men and women.  We take up the issue of human rights with the Chinese authorities at every appropriate opportunity including, of course, the grave ongoing problem of Tibet.</P>
    <P>Not surprisingly, the Platform for Action identifies improving the health of women as one of the major priorities for action by UN member states.  The platform calls on governments to review health policies and legislation to ensure they reflect a commitment to women's health.  It calls on governments to design health programmes, in co-operation with women's organisations, which <Col N="1167" /> address the health needs of women throughout their lives and take into account their multiple roles and responsibilities.  In particular, governments are asked to strengthen preventive health programmes for women; to take measures to protect their reproductive health and to promote research and information on women's health.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, who has already moved on this issue with the publication earlier this year of the discussion document on women's health.  A consultative process is now following on its publication whereby women's groups throughout the country are being given an opportunity to discuss women's health.  This process puts this country in good shape to implement the health commitments of the Beijing Platform.</P>
    <P>Health is an area on which particular progress was made in Beijing.  As an example of how the consultation took place and how matters were teased out at the conference centre in Beijing, I wish to deal with this extremely contentious issue.  One of the greatest successes of the conference was the acceptance, in paragraphs 96 and 97 of the health section of the Platform for Action document, of the concept that sexual rights are human rights.  It may seem strange that before the conference in Beijing, as far as the UN was concerned, there was no reference to sexual rights being human rights.  That is a particular success, given the diverse cultures, philosophies and backgrounds of the women representing 189 nations who discussed the particular text.  Those of us who were in Beijing will realise that in the draft Platform for Action, with which we set out for Beijing, much of paragraphs 96 and 97 were actually in brackets.  In the draft text, paragraph 97 read:</P>
    <P>(Sexual rights include the individual's right to have control over and decide freely on matters related to her or his sexuality, free of coercion, discrimination and violence.  Equal <Col N="1168" /> relationships between women and men in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for the physical integrity of the human body, require mutual consent and willingness to accept responsibility for the consequences of sexual behaviour.)</P>
    <P>To the European delegation, the American delegation, the Canadians, Australians and many more, the draft text was perfectly acceptable and would represent a viewpoint held by our countries at this stage in our development. Particular difficulty was expressed by the many Islamic states, particularly the fundamentalist Islamic states, the Vatican, Malta and Peru and it was interesting to see on how many issues the Vatican and the Islamic states were on the one side of the fence.  After hours of discussion between what one may broadly call the developing versus the developed world, between the Islamic states and many of the Judaic-Christian states, with the exception of Malta and the Vatican, a compromised text was reached.  The EU states, the Americas and others had to accept a compromise paragraph 97 in the Platform for Action to ensure that women in the developing world, particularly in Islamic states, were not shut out from the final agreed document.  We had to give to ensure those from the less developed countries could be kept on board in terms of what was finally agreed.</P>
    <P>The final agreed text for paragraph 97 was:</P>
    <P>The human rights of women include their right to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence.  Equal relationships between women and men in matters of sexual relations and reproduction, including full respect for the integrity of the person, [we should note how that was changed from &ldquo;including full respect for the physical integrity of the human body&rdquo;<Col N="1169" /> in the draft require mutual respect, consent and shared responsibility for sexual behaviour and its consequences.</P>
    <P>It is not quite as sharp as the draft text of paragraph 97 but it is an example of how we had to compromise and accept a consensus which represented the huge disparity in the cultures and backgrounds of the different countries represented at the conference.</P>
    <P>Deputies will see that by accepting that wording as part of the health programme, the Islamic states, the Vatican, Malta and Peru accepted the concept of sexual rights in the context of health and human reproduction.  One might wonder why such a difficulty arose and why we had to sit through the Thursday night of the conference to agree a final text for the declaration, and for paragraph 232 (f) of the Platform for Action, when we wanted to repeat what had been agreed in paragraph 97.</P>
    <P>It was not to be.  I am afraid that for different reasons, mainly because of how it would be presented to governments, most of the countries which had difficulties with paragraph 97 in the health section could not agree to paragraph 232 (f) in the declaration, which, again, wanted to refer to sexual rights. Indeed, the term &ldquo;sexual rights&rdquo; had to be omitted completely from the declaration. While the concept of sexual rights is included &mdash; and it is a huge step forward &mdash; in the health section in paragraph 97, those countries which had difficulties in coming to an agreement on the text of the concept of sexual rights, even as part of women's health, could not go that final step and allow the whole concept of sexual rights to be put in the declaration, which was a synopsis or summary of the Platform for Action. We had to find another formula of words, after hours of debate and discussion, which represented as near as possible a consensus on that point.</P>
    <P>I will give the House just one example of how the debate and arriving at a consensus was extremely difficult.  There <Col N="1170" /> were many other areas where this difficulty existed too, an example of which was the whole problem with sexual orientation which does not appear anywhere in the final document, despite objections from many countries and representations by many of the gay and lesbian groups to the delegates to respect their particular sexual preference. We arrived at a consensus in this area.  There were trade-offs to get an agreed document.  As the concept of sexual orientation introduced new language for the UN with which it was not familiar and had not accommodated in any text heretofore, reference to it was finally dropped.  There was broad agreement among developing countries, particularly the Islamic states, the Vatican, Malta and Peru to name but a few, that they would not accept a reference to sexual orientation in any form. However, I would put forward the view that the final agreed text of paragraph 97 that the human rights of women includes their right to control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters relating to their sexuality, including sexual or reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence can be freely interpreted to include matters of sexual orientation.  It means that women are free to decide matters of their own sexuality free from coercion, discrimination and violence and, as far as I am concerned, matters of sexuality include matters of sexual orientation.</P>
    <P>The progress made on paragraph 97 in the health section will allow, in its interpretation, progress in terms of accepting sexual orientation.  It does so without putting states with cultural and religious differences offside to the extent that they would not accept the final document.  It is a consensus.  It is not quite what many states would have liked but, in its interpretation, those who have difficulty with the reference to sexual orientation being dropped can be accommodated.</P>
    <P>There were long discussions about the inheritance rights of girls and the right to equal inheritance.  Interesting matters <Col N="1171" /> were raised and we learned to understand one another's cultural backgrounds and philosophies.  There was a great cross fertilisation of views.  There is a problem in Islamic states regarding equal inheritance.  Under their law men are obliged to look after widows, single sisters, orphaned women and women in their society who are not married and, as such, get a greater share when it comes to inheritance.  That is a point we had not considered.</P>
    <P>Consensus on inheritance was finally reached at the eleventh hour even though it was difficult and protracted. Again perhaps it did not go as far as the western world would have liked but we had to accommodate the internal laws and customs in countries with a different philosophy and tradition from ours. I will not deal at length with the use of the words &ldquo;gender&rdquo; and &ldquo;sex&rdquo;.  We knew before we went that this would be difficult and it proved to be so.</P>
    <P>I was surprised at the resistance from America towards increasing development aid and the hours that were spent talking about &ldquo;increasing&rdquo; development aid versus the provision of &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; development aid.  &ldquo;Adequate&rdquo; is open to individual interpretation.  We might think that what we contribute to development aid is adequate.  We would have preferred a reference to &ldquo;increasing&rdquo; the governmental contribution to development aid but the French and the Americans did not want a reference to &ldquo;increasing&rdquo;.  We would be told about our net allocation from the EU if we made too much of how we increased our ODA over the last year or two.  Thankfully the Minister for Finance has plans to increase it over the next few years. We had to be sensitive as a nation that gained from EU aid that we could not blow our own trumpet.  We would have been told quietly: &ldquo;of course you did but you are getting most of it from abroad anyway&rdquo;.  These sensitivities which might not be immediately obvious to us must be taken on board.  I was disappointed, as was the Irish delegation, at the final wording in relation to <Col N="1172" /> resources which refers to &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;increasing&rdquo; resources.</P>
    <P>The greatest success of the conference is that, for the first time, the United Nations accepts that sexual rights are human rights.  It stunned me initially that this was not always assumed.  I operated in my life, as do most of us, as if that were taken for granted.  It is not and never has been throughout most of the world.  For the first time the UN has accepted that as a concept.  I welcome it and hope there will be further progress in this area.</P>
    <P>The Platform for Action addresses the burden of poverty in a thoughtful and comprehensive manner.  It looks at the curse of poverty as it affects women everywhere, not only in developing countries but in the so-called developed world as well as countries in transition, the former Eastern European countries for example.  It makes the point that there is poverty in all countries &mdash; as mass poverty in developing countries and as pockets of poverty amid wealth in developed countries such as Ireland. It highlights the plight of low paid workers and the destitution of those who fall outside the social welfare system in some countries &mdash; those who have no safety net.  The document points to the growing problem of the increase in the number of women living in poverty; the feminisation of poverty in our world.  The majority of the more than one billion people living in poverty are women.  The majority of those living in absolute poverty are single heads of households and thus responsible for the care of children, aged parents and other dependants.  The document does not limit itself to describing and condemning the extent of women's poverty.  It looks at the concrete measures that must be implemented if poverty is to be alleviated.</P>
    <P>Some of the more interesting proposals for government relate to the need to promote women's economic opportunities and equal access with men to funding.  The need for governments to target the basic social, educational, <Col N="1173" /> particularly in the science and information technology areas, and health needs of women, especially those living in poverty, is also highlighted as is the urgent need to develop specific policies in support of female headed households which tend to be even more marginalised by poverty.</P>
    <P>Some of the proposals relate to conditions which predominate in the developing world such as women's lack of legal entitlement to inherited land or to obtain credit.  From that we can take the message that women's shared experiences can form links upon which we can build and so move towards shared solutions to the problems which affect women everywhere.  The great strength of the conference is the intense dynamic and sense of common purpose it has engendered between women everywhere.  We heard of the problems encountered &mdash; the banishment of the NGOs to Huairou, the difficulties with transport, the rain and mud.  However, a real effect of the conference on those participating was the creation of a sense of belonging and a belief that it would succeed.</P>
    <P>Ireland stands committed to the principle that human rights are indivisible. The rights of one are the rights of all. As the American First Lady, Hillary Clinton, stated at the conference: &ldquo;If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference it is that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights&rdquo;.  No system based on a universal commitment to human rights can survive if the rights of women are not seen as an integral factor in the equation.  The one clear message that came from the Beijing conference as we spent hours negotiating and teasing out disagreements in relation to the draft text was that for all the cultural, philosophical and religious differences of the women of the 189 states who participated in the conference there was far more which united us as women than divided us.</P>
    <P>While in Beijing I took the opportunity to have three bilateral meetings. I had one with Minister Cheryl Gillan <Col N="1174" /> of the UK delegation at which we discussed equality in both jurisdictions and educational matters.  I thank Carmel Foley for accompanying me to that meeting.  I had two meetings with Chinese Ministers on their public sector reform programme.  The first was with the Ministry of Supervision, Mr. Li Zhi Lun who is responsible for the country's administrative apparatus, identifying and rectifying problems and ensuring that officials comply fully with all state laws, decrees and policies.  He is also responsible for eradicating any incidence of corruption among state administration officials and for maintaining the highest standards of integrity throughout all levels of state administration, provincial, county and municipal.</P>
    <P>He gave me many examples of how he did his job in which I was particularly interested given my current, primary role as Minister of State with responsibility for public sector reform, particularly in the customer services area.  He pointed out to me that his ministry acts as a kind of ombudsman, investigating complaints and recommending courses of action against any offending officials. For example, an official may receive, first, a warning, followed by a minor or major demerit, demotion or, ultimately, dismissal.  One of the violations of state policy cited was the failure of an official to adhere to the family law policy which limits families to one child.  Many other violations were cited.</P>
    <P>The Minister explained to me that punishment was meted out to violators through a 31-point code of administrative behaviour, pointing out that there were many exemplary punishments. Thus, potential wrong-doers are educated by the exemplary punishments meted out to convicted wrong-doers.</P>
    <P>The Ministry of Supervision is conscious of its role in ridding the Chinese public administration of corruption wherever that exists given that China is a country many of whose citizens still live below the poverty line.  In striving to maintain the highest standards of behaviour, the Ministry of Supervision <Col N="1175" /> constitutes a kind of quality control mechanism.</P>
    <P>I had a most interesting two-hour bilateral meeting with the Chinese Minister accompanied by my officials and others from the Irish Embassy.  I will not detain the House with all the details. Suffice to say that the whole concept of public sector reform is alive in China. While we have quite a good deal to do in that area, China has a great deal to do.  I was amazed at how even the concepts prevailing here in delayering, down-sizing, early retirement, voluntary redundancy, redeployment, natural wastage, a newly emerging social security system to compensate all, were alive and well in the parlance of public administration in China, which was an eye-opener to me.</P>
    <P>I thank Mr. Gu Jiaqi and Mr. Li Zhi Lun, the two Ministers I met in the course of my bilateral meetings in Beijing for their time and attention to me and my delegation.</P>
    <P>I found my visit to Beijing extremely worthwhile.  Perhaps I was somewhat cynical before leaving, being somewhat unsure what to expect, but I am delighted to have had the opportunity to participate actively in the Fourth United Nations Conference on Women.  I thank the officials of the many Departments who accompanied and advised us while there.  I was delighted to represent the Minister for Equality and Law Reform for the last week in Beijing.  He had to return home to further his preparations for the impending referendum on divorce.</P>
    <P>I found the whole mission extremely worthwhile.  I hope all women will benefit, before the next United Nations conference on women, from the deliberations that took place in Beijing.  I hope the platform document, together with its declaration, will be implemented in full by all the 189 nations that took part.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I was rather amused at the last statement of the Minister of State, Deputy Avril Doyle, on her meeting with the Minister <Col N="1176" /> responsible for supervision in the People's Republic of China.  I was particularly interested in the minor and major demerit and final dismissal provisions. That Chinese Minister might be a very interesting adviser to our present Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications although no doubt the punishment he might mete out would not be acceptable to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Like all other Members, I compliment those representatives of Government, the three women Ministers and the Minister for Equality and Law Reform who attended with Deputies Frances Fitzgerald and Keogh and Senator Ann Ormonde who attended on behalf of Fianna Fáil.  Their contributions were significant, both on behalf of our Government and their respective parties.  I was privileged to have been nominated to represent the Select Committee on Social Affairs but felt it more appropriate that its chairman, Deputy Pattison, should attend.  I am sure it was a very worthwhile experience for all who attended and actively participated in the various deliberations.  Those of us who were not present who watched the very limited media coverage &mdash; here I agree with other Members that press coverage within the print and electronic media was very scarce &mdash; will have felt that such coverage did little justice to the tremendous amount of work put in by all participants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a profound developmental and educational challenge facing women, in effect, a re-positioning, a reworking of how society perceives us and how we perceive ourselves.  In that respect the Fourth United Nations Conference on Women probably was a reflection of that challenge.  If ever one has been the first woman to have done or achieved something one finds oneself with the exception label on one's forehead: for example, &ldquo;the first woman Cabinet Minister&rdquo;, &ldquo;the first woman President&rdquo;, &ldquo;the first woman party leader&rdquo;, but the problem is that, being the first, does not necessarily mean one is followed immediately by many others. Everybody becomes happy that the <Col N="1177" /> equality issue has been taken care of by the presence of one woman so nobody follows on.  I very much regret that the Taoiseach did not avail of the tremendous, capable, efficient and effective talents of women in his political party and appoint a second woman Cabinet Minister. If and when a future vacancy occurs, I hope he will draw from that pool of very experienced women and appoint one of them to the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>The great temptation of any woman is to congratulate herself on having got so far, particularly when it was not easy for any woman to have got that far and to kick out the ladder after one has climbed it or at least become fairly impatient whenever it is suggested that it remains very difficult for women to climb to the top of that ladder.  The laws on equality are there but the vast majority of women are log-jammed at the bottom, in the cheap, least fulfilling jobs.  While the framework is in place women can still run into an assumption indicating fairly basic, active prejudice which can place a constraint on career development.</P>
    <P>A group of women, including me, spoke recently in a public office in this city about harrassment and such issues. One of the youngest women present said that what galled her most &mdash; which she considered gave the simplest example of chauvinism at work &mdash; was when a male patted her on the back and said &ldquo;good girl&rdquo;.  While some of us might be somewhat surprised at that reaction, she made the point forcibly that, coming from a male, the plaudit &ldquo;good girl&rdquo; was patronising.</P>
    <P>I suppose we should not talk about prejudice because that is not the main factor that holds women back.  We hold ourselves back; we do not allow ourselves to be ambitious and we allow ourselves to be frightened by other ambitious women.  We must change that attitude.</P>
    <P>I was re-reading Úna Claffey's book the other evening on the women who were elected to this Dáil &mdash; we are delighted to have had elected two additional women Members since then, <Col N="1178" /> Deputies Fox and Lynch &mdash; and I was surprised how few women Members said they would even like to be a Minister, would want to be a party leader or even become Taoiseach.  I suspect that, were the same number of male Members interviewed, most if not all, would respond that they wanted to be a Minister, party leader or Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>In women's organisations while ambition, drive and determination to achieve may be acceptable, even laudable, the fact is that within society generally women often are regarded as harsh, hard or unfeminine, if and when they possess precisely that ambition and drive.</P>
    <P>I do not know where the notion originates that femininity is the same as weakness and softness.  It is rubbish, particularly in this country where women have always had to be strong.  If we read any of the great poems such as &ldquo;Cúirt an Mheáin Oíche&rdquo; or &ldquo;Caoineadh Airt Uí Laoghaire&rdquo; we encounter magnificent, unafraid, vivid, sensual women who knew what they wanted and saw nothing wrong with going out to obtain it.  We need to celebrate women who are strong without typecasting them.  I refer to something which many female Members of the Oireachtas have experienced.  People are very willing to congratulate us on how well we have done but seem to feel that we are one-dimensional.  The perception seems to be that we have not experienced any bad times or been hurt or bruised.  That is a mistake.  We should not have to parade our miseries and vulnerabilities to be understood as fully human.</P>
    <P>We need to celebrate women who are strong while at the same time empowering women who are trapped by their circumstances.  We will be privileged to empower such women when we decide whether spouses whose marriages have broken down should have those marriages brought to a legal end leaving them free to remarry.  That is a very simple issue but an agonising one. It is simple, threatening and provides an opportunity to prove that we can debate <Col N="1179" /> issues which touch on relationships, religion, standards and lifestyles in a way which allows us to differ without enmity.  I believe that our laws, like the rest of our society, need to be continually shaken up.  Much has been done in this regard by various Governments but the process needs to continue.  Governments continually need to be refreshed with regard to their understanding and treatment of women.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, inquired as to why Beijing was the site of the conference.  Many people were critical about the exercise of the United Nations organising the conference in Beijing.  When we moved past the cynicism and criticism we began to realise it was a good thing, that it focused international attention on a part of the world which does not often receive such attention. It was equally important that people were allowed to come from all nations to debate issues which are fundamentally important to women.  These include sexual and human rights, women's rights to education, self-fulfilment, promotion and to be respected as individuals within their own societies.</P>
    <P>I did not attend the conference. However, I found it interesting, watching the small amount of television coverage it received, that there was such major triumphalism in relation to the presence of the First Lady of the United States of America, Mrs. Clinton.  Before the conference, many people asked whether she should attend and suggested that, if she did, she would make such a politically correct speech that it would be of very little benefit.  We saw that this woman was prepared to be the strong woman we have come to know her to be.  She was prepared to point a finger at the authorities in a country known for its appalling violations of human rights, which was important and significant.  Many questions were raised at the NGO forum and the major conference in relation to the human rights issue.  That was also important and significant and should be welcomed by everyone.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1180" /> I was delighted that the Minister made commitments &mdash; with which we all agree &mdash; on behalf of Ireland at the conference. A commitment was made, for example, for 40 per cent female membership on State boards.  My party made that commitment while in Government with other parties in this House and supported it in Opposition.  It is a very important and significant step forward. It was a great pleasure, each time a Minister came before Cabinet to make suggestions as to who might be appointed to a particular semi-State board, to see how many of those recommended were women and how many of the existing membership of that board were women.  It focused our minds on that issue.  I am glad the Minister followed through on that commitment in Beijing on our behalf.</P>
    <P>The Minister also made a commitment to strengthening and extending the scope of employment equality legislation and outlawing discrimination in non-employment areas on grounds of gender, marital and parental status, etc. There is now quite a body of legislation on the Statute Book which deals with equality legislation but more needs to be done to change the prejudices against women and the idea that they can be pigeonholed, placed in a pink ghetto or that the glass ceiling will remain forever. We need to work on these issues together.</P>
    <P>The commitment with regard to women's health is very important.  We will have an opportunity to discuss the fundamental document dealing with women's health issues in the near future.  That is an area about which we should all be concerned.  Professionals, Members, my party and others have sought a decision to extend a national breast cancer screening programme which was discussed at Question Time. This is an indication of women taking responsibility for their own health.  We need women to do this and to apply the pressure for the developments they wish to see in that area.</P>
    <P>When I first entered this House 20 years ago, many people had difficulties <Col N="1181" /> even discussing the issue of family planning and a family planning service within the public health system but, thankfully, that has changed.  We now have a nationwide and comprehensive system.  Perhaps it is not as comprehensive as we might like but it is a major change from the situation 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Minister's commitment in relation to the education system and providing for equal participation by females in all areas of the curriculum, the first Oireachtas committee on women's rights was set up in the 1980s and I was privileged to be its first chairman. We considered a range of policy areas on which the committee should focus.  The first area we decided to work on was education.  We felt that all the early prejudice in a child's life began when they first entered school and originated from working with the kind of text books which were then available. Members will recall those books from their time at school.  The committee's first report dealt with the area of education and made several recommendations. Most of these were put into practice by the two previous Ministers for Education, former Deputy Hussey and Deputy O'Rourke.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a commitment that there would be a promotion of gender equality in each third level educational institution.  This has been done in various areas of Government.  One of the areas where it is neglected, however, is that of the committees of this House.  Gender equality does not exist in this regard despite the fact that there are more women Members than ever.  An opportunity exists to provide and promote gender equality when political parties are nominating Members to serve on committees or when political partners decide their nominee for chairperson of a particular committee. All political parties are guilty of not promoting gender equality when housekeeping issues regarding the committees of this House are involved.  Gender equality should be at the top of the agenda of every manager and senior <Col N="1182" /> management person in the public service and State and semi-State organisations.</P>
    <P>It was regrettable that the NGO forum took place away from the main conference in Beijing.  It caused unnecessary friction at the very beginning and slight difficulties and tensions. While I accept that tensions are healthy it would have been better to have had the NGO forum side by side with the conference.  That could be borne in mind for the future.</P>
    <P>We have actively promoted changes in legislation on domestic violence but a number of areas still have to be looked at, for example, inter-agency co-operation. It has been said on many occasions that the Garda Síochána is way ahead of other agencies in providing a unit in every division with appropriate structures to deal with and follow up on domestic violence.  All relevant Government Departments need to ensure that the agencies involved in investigating domestic violence are proactive.</P>
    <P>The Platform for Action refers to women and peace, an area that is largely neglected when we talk about equality for women, positive action and anti-discrimination laws.  We need to look no further than the north eastern corner of our country where violence has deeply affected women some of whom have been left without children and some of whom have been widowed.  The women of Northern Ireland with the support of women in the Republic have been empowered to make decisions for themselves. We can see on our own doorsteps that women's action for peace is very positive and should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government and non-governmental personnel and representatives from the Dáil and Seanad who attended the conference on our behalf.  The Platform for Action is very much an aspirational agenda for change. We need to monitor its enforcement so that when we attend the next UN conference on women in ten years time we will not have a repetition of what happened in Beijing where a great deal of <Col N="1183" /> what had been discussed ten years previously in Nairobi was debated and in some instances very little progess had been made.  I am sure those who attended the conference would prefer to see a huge proportion of the Platform for Action implemented by the time we come to the next conference on women.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>As one of the minority gender who attended the Beijing conference it is incumbent on me to record the views I formed at the conference.  I was selected to attend in my capacity as chairman of the Select Committee on Social Affairs.  As Members are aware this committee addresses all questions relating to Estimates for Health, Education, Social Welfare and so on.  Work must be done in these areas if we are to achieve the equality that the Beijing conference demands.  Deputy Frances Fitzgerald represented the Joint Committee on the Family and Senator Ormonde represented the Joint Committee on Women's Rights but more delegates from the Oireachtas should have been sent.  Media coverage prior to the conference was negative and this negative vibe persisted throughout the conference.  The media coverage the conference received as Deputy Keogh and others said was pathetic with the exception of <i>The Irish Times</i> whose journalist, Lorna Siggins, made a valuable contribution in endeavouring to inform the people of the issues before the conference.  Hers was worthwhile journalism and the money was well spent.  When one reflects on journalists running all over continents on questionable missions, one wonders why the media does not pay attention to what was one of the most important conferences on women in ten years.  Since there might not be a conference of similar stature for another ten years one would have expected a more positive approach from the media which has such a grave responsibility in the area of equality and empowerment of women. As has been said, half the world's population are women &mdash; even though I saw <Col N="1184" /> many posters in Beijing which stated that half the men in the world were women.</P>
      <P>I join with other speakers in paying tribute to the leader of the delegation, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mervyn Taylor and the other Ministers and officials who did us proud.  The Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, referred to the secretary of the Department of Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Bernard McDonagh.  Also working very hard were the principal officer, John Hurley and Anne Webster from the Department of Foreign Affairs and others who worked late into the night.  Some nights I doubt if they got any sleep because they had to prepare documents for the following morning. We owe them a deep debt of gratitude for their commitment.</P>
      <P>Other speakers have dealt with equality at home so I wish to comment on equality globally.  Though half the world's population are women, many people do not know that more than 70 per cent of those living in poverty are women.  Most people do not know that 75 per cent of the world's refugees are women and, as such, they suffer all kinds of violence, including torture and rape.  It is not generally recognised either that two thirds of the illiterate of the world are women and that 60 per cent of the 130 million children who do not attend school are girls.  This shows that women have less access to education than men.</P>
      <P>In the area of health the position is the same.  I wish to quote the following from an address to the conference by the director general of the World Health Organisation, Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time when so many countries are going through painful economic transitions and profound social re-appraisals, it is particularly important that this Fourth World Conference on Women should ensure that women's needs and expectations are not sacrificed to immediate constraints but receive utmost attention and priority, <Col N="1185" /> as they rightly deserve.  Saving on women's health and education is unacceptable from an ethical point of view.  It is also a grave miscalculation from an economic and social point of view.  No country and society can afford to lay half of their natural resources to waste, to neglect half of their human potential.</P>
    <P>Globally women account for an ever-increasing share of infections, particularly HIV infections.  The proportion of women in the overall figure of those infected rose from 20 per cent in 1980 to 40 per cent in 1992, by the year 2000 half of those infected with HIV will be women, and in many countries 60 per cent of all new HIV infections are among 15 to 20 year olds with a female to male ratio of 2:1.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of health is malnutrition which is a telling example of how health problems can affect women to a greater extent then men.  Statistics show anaemia to be widely prevalent among women of all ages and all continents.  In developing countries 55 per cent of pregnant women and 44 per cent of all women suffer from anaemia.  Inequalities in food intake and disregard for women's nutritional needs start early in life.  In the area of health there is a vast amount of work done.  There are other inequalities &mdash; discrimination, violence, multilation etc.</P>
    <P>Like some of my fellow delegates at the conference I attended the NGO session in Huairou, about one hour's drive from the main conference centre.  To say that we were highly impressed with the commitment of the people there would be an understatement.  I had not quite realised before I went to Beijing that so many women with such scarce resources would be making their way to Beijing and to Huairou.  Reference was made to the physical conditions which included half-constructed buildings.  The EU Commissioner, Mr. Pádraig Flynn, recently gave a description of his visit to Huairou while attending the conference. He said he had to climb up a scaffold of three storeys to reach a floor with no <Col N="1186" /> windows and no walls, just a floor and about 1,000 women.  That story is hard to believe but those of us who were in Huairou would believe it.  The obstacles that were put in the way of these women were, in the end, no obstacles.  The women surmounted them.</P>
    <P>The women's commitment to their cause was such that, whether they were up to their knees in muck or the rain was pouring down on them, they got on with their work.  On any given day there were about 300 workshops in operation from early morning until late at night. Many of the women came by bus to meet us at the main conference centre. It should be mentioned that there was a group of approximately 25 women from Cork there who, although they had some assistance from the Minister's Department, in the main made their way there on their own initiative and by working hard because they saw, more than many people here, the relevance of this conference and felt they had a contribution to make.  They made a very positive contribution and helped the overall delegation.  They gave us public representatives much encouragement and we are grateful to them for that.</P>
    <P>I should mention that Thurday, 7 September was a parliamentarians day for parliamentarians attending the conference. I attended on that day with my other parliamentary colleagues and I was impressed because what went on at the main conference would have been meaningless without the full support of those who have the power to pass laws and make provisions to implement the steps being decided upon.  The message came across loud and clear that the obligation of seeing decisions through to implementation rested on the shoulders of parliamentarians and, as parliamentarians, whether men or women, we have a duty to represent the views and interests of both men and women and to serve the common interest.  National legislation must focus just as much on the interests, values and aspirations of women as on those of men.</P>
    <P>The conference recommitted itself to reform any legislation discriminating <Col N="1187" /> against or liable to harm women and undertook the ratification of national conventions that were not already ratified for the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women.  It also recognised the fact that each country should have a mechanism, parliamentary or otherwise, for measuring the impact on women of any draft law or Bill and any related budgetary provisions. It was felt it would curtail a form of administration that has proved damaging to the process.</P>
    <P>Parliamentarians pointed to the importance of having more women in politics.  According to surveys carried out by the Inter-Parliamentary Union women make up barely 11.3 per cent of the world's parliamentarians, only slightly higher than the figure 50 years ago.  Despite considerable progress in the division of political responsibilities and power in many countries, particularly Nordic and some developing countries, in general women are in the minority in the upper echelons of political parties and movements and in some cases they are not represented at all. Women account for more than 20 per cent of parliamentarians in only 20 countries and a woman presides over a parliamentary chamber in only 17 countries. There are 15 women Heads of State or Government and we made no secret of our pride in being one of them. It was also recognised that some countries continue to deny women the right to vote, the right to be elected to national parliaments or local or regional boards and as parliamentarians we committed ourselves to redressing that matter.</P>
    <P>The conference was worthwhile, a valuable experience for me as a legislator and chairman of a committee that deals with matters relating to health, education and welfare services.  As a result of what I learned and the encouragement I received, particularly from the NGOs, I hope to be an even better legislator.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have <Col N="1188" /> an opportunity to contribute to this debate.  It is appropriate that it is taking place on the 50th anniversary of the UN.  It is important to discuss the relevance of the conference worldwide and its particular application here.  As a member of the Joint Committee on the Family, I was pleased to have an opportunity to attend the conference.</P>
      <P>It was an important opportunity to articulate at world level and to be part of a world conference that articulated a view on issues affecting the lives of women and girls worldwide.  The United Nations has an important role to play in ensuring Governments address the issues of equality, access to education and health care and opportunities for women throughout the world.  Despite its many failings, the United Nations has done great work for women in the past 20 years.  It has informed my view, and I am sure that of many other Members, on matters of equality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions were asked about China hosting the conference.  It was the turn of an Asian country to host it and China offered.  Human rights issues in China, particularly those relating to the girl child, were brought into focus as a result of it hosting the conference.  Rather than erecting an iron curtain or having a cold war, it is important to engage in dialogue with countries, including those where human rights issues are being ignored or present difficulties.  In the long term women in China will benefit because the conference was held there, although I accept we are talking about a country where controls are rigid, where there is not freedom of the mass media and where information on the conference was not given freely.  The Chinese made every effort to ensure the success of the official conference, but not the NGO conference.  I was struck by Deputy Pattison's description of what the NGOs had to endure.  He gave an accurate account of some of the difficulties they faced.  Conditions for them should have been better.  Women had to overcome many obstacles to participate <Col N="1189" /> and many meetings were held in buildings that would not have got planning permission here.</P>
    <P>The conference was extraordinary by any standards.  A total of 25,000 people attended the NGO conference and 15,000 attended the official conference. It is also important to note that participation at the official conference was approximately two-thirds women and one-third men, although primarily women attended the NGO conference. I am sure most of those who attended believe it was worthwhile.  Given the scale of the conference, it involved many different conferences for some people.  There were 4,500 workshops and it was logistically challenging to find out what was happening every day and to decide what to attend.</P>
    <P>It was my first attendance at a UN conference and I was struck by the lobbying and ongoing and developing partnership between members of NGOs and Governments attending the conference. This happened at a number of conferences in the past number of years, including Cairo and the world conference on the environment, and it is the way politics and policies of the future will emerge.  Politics is about an engagement between those elected through the representative democratic system and those involved in non-governmental organisations, communities and so on. We should pay tribute to the opportunities the United Nations presented to all concerned to develop this model and this was evident at the Beijing Conference.</P>
    <P>The success of the conference has been questioned but I believe it was successful. Success was achieved in a number of areas and important issues will flow from it regarding women's human rights, the girl child, tackling the unfortunate, but increasing, poverty of women worldwide and the enormous problems that subsistence economies are placing on women, in particular, who still bear the brunt of poverty worldwide.  Deputy Pattison referred to the increasing feminisation of poverty, the number of illiterate women, the fact <Col N="1190" /> that 75 per cent of refugees are women and the problems they face, including sexual assault, rape and violation. Women are vulnerable and the conference reminded us of that.</P>
    <P>It was agreed that there should be a stronger reference to women's role in development in the Platform for Action and that additional resources would be targeted directly at women in that context.  Ireland played a strong role in that regard and Irish NGOs were active in the discussions on development.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to formulate a comprehensive and co-ordinated national policy on early education embracing all existing providers of early education in Ireland at present and calls on the Minister for Education and Health to take the following interim steps as a means towards achieving this objective:</P>
      <P>&mdash; to establish a National Forum on Early Education made up of representatives from all groups involved in the provision of such education along with representatives from the relevant Government Departments;</P>
      <P>&mdash; to cease the expansion of the Early Start Programme any further until genuine consultations and negotiations leading to an agreed plan take place with the Irish Pre-School Playgroups Association, An Comhchoiste Réamhscolaíochta, the Association Montessori International, the St. Nicholas Montessori Society, the National Children's Nursery Association and the INTO;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; to implement forthwith the sections of the Child Care Act, <Col N="1191" /> 1991, concerning the supervision and regulation of pre-school services;</P>
    <P>&mdash; to put in place, in consultation with the teacher training colleges and universities a progressive education and training programme in early education with suitable accreditation;</P>
    <P>&mdash; to increase the level of funding to pre-school playgroups operating throughout the country in the next financial year;</P>
    <P>&mdash; to allow qualified AMI Montessori and St. Nicholas Montessori teachers to apply for positions on the early start programme; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; to undertake a national research study on early childhood services in Ireland to provide the necessary data base for the development of an early education policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>We table this motion in a constructive and positive spirit.  We, in Fianna Fáil, are signalling clearly the need for the formulation of a coherent and co-ordinated national policy on early education inclusive of all the interests involved.  Through this motion we are endeavouring to stimulate much needed debate on the nature and quality of early education that should emerge in the years ahead.  We want a national debate on this issue to be followed by an agreed action plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Early education is very important in the development of the child.  International research reveals that high quality early educational provision has a positive impact on the future educational, psychological and social development of the child.  Research also reveals that well resourced pre-schooling can help to level the playing pitch for children from economically and socially disadvantaged backgrounds. <Col N="1192" /> However, it must be stressed that the primary reason for the development of a proper early education policy is to have a positive impact on all children irrespective of class.  It cannot be developed as a compensatory measure alone.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Education states that &ldquo;the overall aim for the Department of Education's pre-school programme is to compensate for background deprivation&rdquo;.  However, Nóirín Hayes, in a recent paper entitled &ldquo;The Case for a National Policy on Early Education&rdquo;, which formed part of the combat poverty series of discussion papers presented at a recent seminar I attended, stated that the view of early education intervention as a compensation is now considered insufficient and may inhibit the development of innovative and successful programmes for children.</P>
    <P>Dr. Francis Douglas of UCC in stressing the importance of parent education at this level argued strongly that all classes of society must be involved and that &ldquo;if the middle classes do not join in, society overall will not perceive the `Early Years' as important&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The need for society to recognise the importance and value of early education for the child in itself cannot be over-stated. In the long term society will benefit enormously from positive early educational intervention.  Nóirín Hayes in her paper refers to the well reported High Scope study undertaken in the United States which found that children who attended a carefully designed and well resourced programme were more likely to progress to third level training and education, were less likely to break the law and more likely to be self-supporting compared to a control group who had not experienced the programme. The High Scope programme stressed the importance of allowing children to explore play, plan, reflect and to solve problems.  Researchers found that for every $1 invested in that type of early education programme the state saved $7 by the time the child reached the age of 27.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1193" /> Early education will reduce delinquency, the cost of crime to society, social exclusion and educational failure. We spend a vast amount of resources today on policing, prisons and educational initiatives for early school leavers aged 13 to 16 years of age.  We must reverse that cycle and invest a greater amount of resources than we have to date in early education.</P>
    <P>As far back as 1936, Montessori succinctly put the case for early intervention:</P>
    <P>The greatest crime that society is committing is that of wasting the money it should spend for its children, of dissipating it to destroy them and itself.  When wasteful society is in urgent need of money, it takes from the schools and especially the infant schools that shelter the seeds of human life.  This is humanity's worst crime and greatest error.</P>
    <P>That message is as relevant today as it was then.</P>
    <P>There will be an increase in demand for early education provision here in the years ahead.  Internationally it has been found that economic growth stimulates greater demand for such services.  In Denmark it was found that even though the birth rate had fallen from approximately 80,000 in 1974 to about 60,000 in 1986, there has been an ongoing increased demand for childcare services every year since 1974.  The Danish National Union of Pre-school Teachers indicates that at present there is a shortage of 30,000 day-care places under its system.  Like most modern societies the growing demand for such places has been caused by a number of factors, such as both parents working, a greater percentage of women in the workforce and a lower percentage of parents who are prepared to stay at home.  While in 1974 approximately 50 per cent of Danish mothers with young children stayed at home, in 1992 only 10 per cent stayed at home.  That trend is also becoming evident in Ireland and demand for early childhood education will almost certainly increase in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1194" /> Our motion calls for the formulation of a comprehensive and co-ordinated national policy on early education.  A co-ordinated policy does not exist at present.  A study of the existing position would reveal that there is no co-ordination between various State agencies dealing with early childhood services or between State agencies and voluntary community groups involved in the provision of early education.</P>
    <P>A number of institutions are involved in providing early childhood education and day care in the Republic.  The principal forms of provision include junior and senior infant classes in primary schools catering for children aged four to six years, nursery schools, most of which are Montessori based, catering for children aged three to five years, pre-school playgroups catering for children aged between three and five years, the Naonraí, the Irish speaking or bilingual playgroups and créches which cater for the newborn and children up to three years of age.</P>
    <P>According to McKenna's Childcare in Ireland 1990, 15 per cent of three year olds were in playgroups, about 2 per cent in the Naonraí and 1 per cent in Montessori schools.  Department of Education statistics for 1990 reveal that junior infants accounted for approximately 56 per cent of four years olds and senior infant 95 per cent of five year olds.  Two per cent of newborns and children up to three years are cared for in public and private créche facilities.</P>
    <P>Most Irish pre-schools belong to one of the voluntary organisations, including the Irish Pre-School Playgroups Association, An Chomhchoise Réamsolaíochta, the St. Nicholas Montessori Society, The Association Montessori International and the National Children's Nursery Association.  They have been providing early education services for many years and have considerable expertise and experience to bring to this issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education introduced the early start programmes in <Col N="1195" /> 1994 in eight locations without any consultations with the pre-school playgroups or the Montessori associations. This year the early start programme has been expanded in 25 additional locations without consultation or co-ordination. In many cases early start schools were established in the same communities where pre-school playgroups had been providing early education for more than 20 years, in some cases adjacent to pre-school playgroups. That represents an exceptionally wasteful duplication of State resources.  It also represents an arrogant and dismissive attitude towards the community based pre-school playgroups which have pioneered the cause of early education with limited State resources down through the years.  Those groups deserve better treatment than that meted out to them by the Minister for Education.</P>
    <P>Despite assurances from the Minister the early start programme has resulted in a significant drop in numbers in many pre-school playgroups and, unfortunately, will lead to the closure of some.  The tragedy is that there are many areas throughout the country which do not have any early education provision.  If there was proper consultation in advance, much heartache, anguish and anger could have been avoided.</P>
    <P>Only three weeks ago I received a heartbreaking letter from a teacher in the Dunloe pre-school, which is based in the Blackpool area of Cork city, informing me that after 21 years the playgroup would have to close and she would lose her job.  Last year in Cork, the early start programme was established next door to the before-5 nursery in Churchfield which has an outstanding reputation for the quality and standard of its provision.</P>
    <P>The resources invested in the early start programme have been significant in terms of equipment and refurbishment. Surely it would have made better sense to resource the existing pre-school playgroups more effectively and to locate the early start pre-schools in <Col N="1196" /> areas where there is no pre-school provision whatsoever.</P>
    <P>In Galway, for example, the community playgroup in Bohermore is threatened as a result of the introduction of the early start programme.  This group is catering for children from a disadvantaged area with grant aid from the Western Health Board.  The IPPA, which represents over 1,700 pre-school playgroups throughout the country, feels that if consultation had taken place with its adviser in Galway, for example, they could have directed the Minister to other areas of Galway city which do not have such a valuable service.</P>
    <P>In Ballymun there are over 11 community based pre-school playgroups offering a stimulating learning environment. These playgroups have developed through community and parental involvement for over 20 years and are now under threat as a result of the introduction of the early start programme into the area.  Prior to the summer recess, the Ballymun community was forced to picket the Minister's offices and the Dáil to highlight their plight.  The Minister refused to meet them at the time.  It was only last week, despite prolonged agitation, that she met with representatives of the IPPA. She has not met with the Ballymun pre-school playgroups or representatives of same.  This treatment of representatives of community based playgroups in this manner is shameful and cannot be justified on any grounds.  There have been similar experiences in Finglas, Mulhuddart, Corduff, Blakestown, Tallaght, Warrenmount, Crumlin and in areas of Waterford and Wicklow.</P>
    <P>The Irish Pre-School Playgroups Association is a voluntary, charitable organisation with over 1,700 members who provide playgroups and other childcare services nationwide.  The IPPA strongly supports parental involvement and training in early school provision and provides an advisory service for members and non-members alike.  It believes in working in close co-operation and partnership with other voluntary and statutory organisations <Col N="1197" /> who have a direct interest in early childhood services.  It is estimated that over 19,757 children and 2,500 adults were involved under the IPPA umbrella in February 1994 &mdash; that figure has grown since then.</P>
    <P>Side by side with this phenomenal growth in the pre-school playgroup movement Naonraí developed.  The first Irish speaking playgroup was established in Shannon, County Clare, in 1968.  In 1992 there were 210 Naonraí functioning all over the country under An Comhchoiste Réamhsolaíochta Teoranta. Bord na Gaeilge provides some financial assistance to the comhchoiste.</P>
    <P>There are ten district advisers who visit Naonraí once a month which means supervisors and committees can obtain all the back-up services and advice they require.  The growth of the Naonraí and the maintenance of high standards in them is due in great part of the untiring efforts of these advisers.  The growth of the IPPA and the Naonraí is well documented by Dr. Francis Douglas, UCC, in his excellent history of the organisations. Their growth and development represents a significant story of empowerment of local communities over a lengthy time frame.  Dr. Douglas rightly points out:</P>
    <P>Never forget that the playgroup movement caters for approximately 20 per cent of the 3-4 year olds in this country.  The movement is far and away the largest provider for this age group and there is no way in which the cumulative knowledge and experience built up can be just &ldquo;written off&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The actual participation of parents was always and continues to be a significant feature of the movement's character. Considerable expertise and experience have been gained over the years by the playgroup leaders and organisers.  This experience and expertise is a very valuable resource and one that should not be ignored in the context of developing any new initiative in early education services. It was a great pity that, prior to the development of the early start <Col N="1198" /> initiative, the Minister for Education failed to consult and reach agreement with the pre-school playgroup movement on the future development of early education services in Ireland.  Given their involvement in the provision of such services over the years and their expertise and experience in the field, this was the least they deserved.</P>
    <P>The IPPA made repeated representations to the Minister for Education in relation to the early start initiative. They articulated a number of concerns at the time.  They still believe it will put a number of existing playgroups out of business and leave playgroup leaders unemployed.  Existing experienced playgroup leaders are excluded from the early start programme &mdash; the value of their experience is not recognised.  They also make the important point that the hidden cost of public service based pre-school education will far exceed the costs of community based and volunteer supported pre-school education.  They are also afraid that the early start initiative could result in an extension of the structural primary school education system down to the age of three years. Those concerns deserve attention, discussion and resolution.</P>
    <P>Before any further expansion of early start is contemplated, agreement should be reached with the pre-school playgroup movement and others involved in the provision of early childhood services. That is why, via this motion, we are calling for the establishment of a national forum on early education with representatives from all the groups involved and the relevant Departments. Such a forum could lead the way towards a consensus approach to the development of an agreed national policy on early education in Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is an obvious need for such a consensus to emerge.  We have all received representations from the various pre-school playgroups and Montessori associations.  Their anguish, concern and anger have been conveyed to us in no uncertain manner.  That is the reason I am calling for a consensus on what <Col N="1199" /> should be a fundamental plank of Irish policy.  Nóirín Hayes in her paper, &ldquo;The Case for a National Policy on Early Education&rdquo;, highlights the lack of co-ordination between Departments and between the Government and the playgroup movement.  In addition to the voluntary-community provision there are up to eight Departments with an involvement in the provision of early childhood services.</P>
    <P>Having done some research in this area I was surprised to find so many statutory agencies involved in one form or another without any co-ordination between them.  The Health Act, 1970, empowers the Department of Health via the health boards to provide grants towards the operating costs of centres providing for children in need of special support.  Pre-school playgroups are grant-aided by the health boards to varying degrees.  There is no uniformity. The health boards perform no role in relation to curriculum training or the quality of the service provided.  Under the Child Care Act, 1991, the Department is also responsible for the supervision and regulation of pre-school services in consultation with the Departments of Education and the Environment.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education has had an ongoing involvement in early education.  It funds the Rutland Street pre-school project which has about 95 three to four year olds attending.  Over the last number of years the Department has allocated funds to developing pre-schools for traveller children. Almost 50 such groups are staffed by a variety of personnel, some trained as teachers, some with training in early education and others with no training. The Department began the early start initiative as a pilot scheme in September 1994 located in designated disadvantaged areas.  It is a well resourced initiative, staffed by primary school teachers, assisted by classroom assistants. There is an initial start-up grant, a capitation grant per child and funding for parental involvement initiatives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1200" /> Under the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Leader II project appears to facilitate the development of rural childcare as a sub-heading in the local development and disadvantaged areas schemes.  The Department of Enterprise and Employment has considerable involvement in the delivery of childcare in a number of ways through the various training and employment schemes where childcare provision is seen as a requirement. Under FÁS a variety of training opportunities is offered in childcare settings. The new opportunity for women programme &mdash; known as the NOW programme &mdash; funded from Europe has enabled certain pre-schools to be funded, such as the Wallaroo playschool in Cork, with the aim of facilitating parents who wish to go back to school or employment.  The newly formed county enterprise boards are giving some indirect support to early childhood services.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, under the European umbrella, Area Development Management Limited, or ADM, established in 1992 to manage the global grant for local development, has a specific pilot child care initiative financed through the 1994 budget of the Department of Equality and Law Reform with a training element provided by FÁS.  Under the national plan, ADM can allocate funding to child care initiatives generally in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare, under the community development programme, funds child care projects to varying degrees in disadvantaged areas. The Departments of Finance and the Environment also impact on the early education needs of young children in the context of town planning, residential developments and budget allocation.</P>
    <P>With so many Departments involved there is a clear need for greater co-ordination among them.  As Nóirín Hayes states:</P>
    <P>Co-ordination is essential to ensure equality of access to early education services.  A look at the development <Col N="1201" /> of services in Ireland shows how the drive for services has often come from needs other than those of children themselves.</P>
    <P>Denmark faced similar problems in the 1980s and, responding to those, its government in 1987 appointed a permanent committee of civil servants from 13 Ministries delegating to these members the responsibility for following all matters relating to the conditions affecting children's lives.  Such a permanent committee of civil servants should be set up in Ireland to ensure greater co-ordination. Such co-ordination is vital to ensure quality standards and proper regulation.  From the funding perspective, co-ordination is vital to ensure value for money, efficient use of resources and the avoidance of duplication of resources and energy.</P>
    <P>Given the overall education budget and the limited resources available to early education, many involved in the pre-school playgroups movement could not understand the duplication of resources and funding which the early start initiative represented for them. They were working in the field for years depending on limited State assistance and voluntary fund raising by parents. The establishment of well resourced pre-schools adjacent to their own pre-school playgroups seemed to them to be a waste of resources which could have been applied in areas where there is no education provision.</P>
    <P>In a recent reply to a Dáil question which I tabled, the Minister for Health informed me that the latest year for which statistics are available on financial assistance to pre-school services by health boards is 1992.  The total amount paid out by health boards towards pre-school playgroups in 1992 was £1,660,700, out of which the Eastern Health Board allocated £1.023 million. This would have been in the form of grant assistance to approximately 2,000 playgroups throughout the country. These are approximate figures in terms of the number of playgroups and illustrate the relative under-development of <Col N="1202" /> pre-school services in many parts of the country.  The fact that statistics are only available for 1992 clearly illustrates the need for more proactive co-ordination between the different Departments.  The Department of Health is currently collating statistics for the year 1994.</P>
    <P>In a recent reply to a further question tabled by me, the Minister for Education indicated that up to £1.5 million has been provided in 1995 for the early start programme which will cover the activities of approximately 32 pre-schools. Irrespective of who is in power between now and the end of the century, it is clear that limitless funds do not exist for the provision of early education services.  A specific budget allocation for early childhood education embracing all the providers must be put in place as part of the co-ordination process to which I referred earlier.  A special five year plan with specific targets outlining phased increases in such a budget allocation should be drawn up.</P>
    <P>The various current expenditures on childhood education in different Departments should be brought under the one heading and allocated on a rational and co-ordinated basis.  It is obvious that the voluntary/community provision will play an indispensable role in the provision of early education in the years ahead.  Funding decisions should reflect this reality.  In that context this motion calls for the provision of increased funding to the pre-school playgroups throughout the country in the next financial year.  They need extra resources urgently.  I call on the Government to provide the additional resources in this year's Estimates for the community pre-school playgroups.</P>
    <P>I note from a recent editorial by Senator Joe O'Toole in the INTO publication <i>Education Today</i> that pre-school education should require separate funding. He stated: &ldquo;The developed world's most under-funded primary education system cannot be expected to develop the fourth level of education without separate budgetary provision&rdquo;.  In the same editorial he argues that much of &ldquo;this new service&rdquo; can be delivered <Col N="1203" /> within the infrastructure of primary education.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that, because of the lack of consultation and proper planning and co-ordination, tension has developed between the early start programme and the community pre-school playgroup movement.  I am satisfied that the teachers on the early start programme are conscious of the role of play as an essential part of a young child's life.  In the same publication, Teresa Murphy, one of the primary teachers involved in the early start programme, states categorically that &ldquo;... play is basic to early childhood education, supplying the foundation upon which learning is built&rdquo;.  The INTO has considerable expertise in this area and has a positive role to play in the development of early education in the years ahead and it must be brought on board in the context of formulating a national policy on early education.</P>
    <P>The continued exclusion, however, of full-time qualified AMI Montessori and St. Nicholas Montessori teachers from applying for positions on the early start programme is unacceptable, discriminatory and unfair.  The Department of Education recognises Montessori teachers for teaching in special schools for mentally handicapped, emotionally disturbed and hearing impaired children. I am at a loss to understand why the Department cannot consider them eligible to apply for positions on the early start programme.</P>
    <P>In reply to numerous representations in this issue, the Minister stated that the early start pre-school is an integral part of the national school to which it is attached.  The Minister has refused to give specific reasons for the exclusion of fully qualified Montessori teachers from the early start programme.  She has consistently ignored the fact that fully qualified Montessori teachers are specifically trained to deal with three to four year olds and have enormous expertise in this area.  They should be eligible to apply for positions within the early start programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1204" /> In the context of formulating a national policy on early education, a proper training programme with clear ladders of progression must be put in place.  All existing providers of early education should have access to such a programme.  As Dr. Francis Douglas points out, it should be possible for playgroup teachers who have taken the IPPA introductory course to progress to a university degree and post-graduate courses if they wish.  The steps should be put in place.  Dr. Douglas has initiated a BA degree in early childhood studies in UCC, the first of its kind in the country. It is the type of model that should be followed elsewhere.  Furthermore, the pre-school playgroups movement should have an input into the drawing up of such a training programme.</P>
    <P>The teacher training colleges should give greater emphasis in their curriculum to early education.  Proper ongoing inservice training programmes should be provided.  A specific amount should be allocated towards early education inservice training from the European funding that has been made available for inservice training generally.  Nóirín Hayes emphasises the need for training. She states &ldquo;There is a need to develop some system of accreditation of prior learning which will give credit for such experience and which will open up a path to further accredited training&rdquo;.  In addition, Dr. Douglas suggests that recognition must be given to experience gained over the years and existing qualifications that people might have.  There is clearly a need for specific training for all involved in working with young children.</P>
    <P>The most under-developed and unregulated sector is the newborns to three year olds.  Less than 2 per cent of the nation's children are catered for in this regard.  There is no registration of crêches or nurseries, inspection of facilities or regulation of standards.  The 1991 Child Care Act contains a section on the supervision and regulation of pre-school services but it has not yet been implemented.  Even though this section is not particularly strong it should be <Col N="1205" /> implemented immediately.  It is the only legislative instrument concerned specifically with early education.</P>
    <P>There is a clear need for a national research study to be undertaken on existing early childhood services in Ireland.  As Nóirín Hayes points out, there is little information available in this area.  She states: &ldquo;There is limited data available on the variety of services used by parents for their children, how different services are experienced by individual children and what parents count as quality&rdquo;.  Such research is vital to the formation of a co-ordinated and comprehensive policy on early childhood services in Ireland.</P>
    <P>My party wishes to develop a consensus approach to the development of early childhood education.  We believe consultation with all involved in early education is essential.  We believe co-ordination between Departments is vital and in that context we recommend the establishment of a permanent committee of civil servants to ensure that such co-ordination in the development of child care services is provided.  We believe that a national forum on early education should be established and all groups involved in the provision of early education should have representation on such a forum.  The forum should deliberate within a specific time frame and should prepare a five year plan with targeted aims and objectives.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive and inclusive training programme would have to be developed for the providers of early education.  Given the financial difficulties experienced by many pre-school playgroups throughout the country, we believe there is a clear need for the provision of additional resources and funding to these groups in the forthcoming financial year.  The early start programme represents additional investment and interest by the Department of Education in this sector and that in itself is welcome.  Nonetheless we feel that there should be no further expansion of the programme until genuine consultations and negotiations leading to an agreed plan take place with all the <Col N="1206" /> interested groups.  Qualified Montessori teachers should not be excluded from seeking employment in the existing early start pre-schools and we make that point on the grounds of equality of opportunity.  A national research study is essential to facilitate the development of a national early education policy.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, we tabled this motion in a constructive spirit.  We hope it will prove to be a catalyst for further debate.  Early childhood education should be at the top of the education and political agendas.  To intervene positively in the early development of the child will pay rich dividends for society in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Martin for providing an opportunity to contribute to this motion.  Everybody favours improvements in the education system and in the provision of facilities.  It will be wonderful if resources are available for a national pre-school system but we should examine it in an intelligent, planned way after full consultation with everyone involved.</P>
      <P>The provision of a pre-school programme is probably the most effective way of giving children, particularly those from disadvantaged areas, a good start in terms of their educational future and personal development.  A number of reports have highlighted the need for such a programme and child care facilities in general.  In 1994 the Department introduced the early start scheme in eight schools.</P>
      <P>I recall reading an interview with the Minister in <i>The Irish Times</i> in which she said that progress in implementing the pilot programme was slow, that there was a need for more research, parental and community involvement and training for teachers and that we should make haste slowly.  She was saying all the right things at that stage.  She wanted to introduce a scheme, there was money available and she was going about it in a planned and organised way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened since last January? Why did everything change?  Why was it suddenly full steam ahead with all the <Col N="1207" /> consultation she had promised being thrown to the winds and forgotten?  Her behaviour was incredible.  I am speaking from a particular perspective.  In my own area the community pre-school playgroups in Ballymun recently celebrated their 21st anniversary.  These groups have, through the years, been run on a shoestring budget.  The funding is organised through the local authority. A number of dedicated people provided a tremendous service to the community, operating from schools, flats, basements, community centres and any other suitable building.  Emphasis has always been placed on the involvement of mothers.</P>
    <P>There are many, perhaps too many, young mothers in the Ballymun area. The emphasis has not only been on getting the children into the playgroups but on involving the mothers.  A great deal has been done for them through personal development and other courses. This service has been operated by a few very dedicated people.  These same people are now very upset that, while they operated on a shoestring budget for many years, suddenly money seems to be no object.  They are being pushed aside while a new scheme, which they see as duplication, is being imposed.</P>
    <P>The Minister secured the agreement of the teachers' union and ignored those who have run the community pre-school playgroups in the area and did their best to provide this service for the past 21 years.  She seems to work on the basis that the teachers are the important people.  If the Minister gets them on her side, she will be seen as a heroine when she calls around to all the conferences over the Easter period.  Once she makes the teachers happy, everybody else has to fall in line.</P>
    <P>We must get away from the notion that education is for the benefit of the teachers and that they are the only people with a point of view.  They are one concerned major body but there are many other people involved.  Education is primarily about children and giving them the service and the start they need. <Col N="1208" /> However, there are many other people, such as those running the pre-school playgroups, who should have been consulted as equals.</P>
    <P>The Minister could have brought these people in, thanked them for their good work over the years and explained why she believes the early start programme is better.  She has been very ungrateful.  She has acted in a ruthless and savage manner by totally ignoring them and not even consulting them or asking for their views.  Some of the people from Ballymun and other areas were picketing outside the gate before the summer recess.  It is appalling that the Minister did not see fit to meet them.</P>
    <P>Politically, the Minister had been very naive.  There are always times when a Minister has to make decisions and he or she cannot keep everybody happy. However, in this case resources were made available to the Minister by the last two Ministers for Finance.  That is normally an occasion on which a Department Minister or Government can make themselves popular by providing an extra service.  In this case the Minister has made enemies and subjected herself to abuse.  In teacher language, she has been a very bold pupil and acted arrogantly.  It is possible that life came too easy for her.  She was made a Minister on her first day; she would not be the first person who was made a Minister on their first day in this House and lost the run of themselves.  One cannot afford to do that.  One must consult with and listen to people.</P>
    <P>I cannot remember the names of others who came into this House and achieved stardom on their first day but there is nothing like serving one's political apprenticeship; unfortunately, the Minister has not done that.  She should listen.  She is the boss and makes the decisions but there are many people with experience in the pre-school area and she should at least talk to them and treat them as equals.  In the past couple of days there has been a flurry of telephone calls and meetings &mdash; probably because of this debate &mdash; but it is six or <Col N="1209" /> seven months late and it is not enough. Such consultation should be on an ongoing basis and these people should be treated as equals.</P>
    <P>These people have a great deal of experience.  Some of them do not have qualifications but, in many cases, the more experienced people do not have formal letters after their names.  They have experience of life and up to 21 years of dealing with these children. Their experience should be recognised and they should be allowed to qualify under the Department's regulations. Their qualifications and experience should be incorporated into the new early start system.</P>
    <P>I will not pretend to be an expert on education.  I know there is a difference among the experts as to whether the more relaxed atmosphere of a playgroup is better for a three and a half year old than the more formal structure of a classroom.  I will not be the judge of that.  The solution for three year old children may be playgroups while for four year olds it may be the early start initiative.  As I said, these people have much experience and should be consulted. The Minister's arrogant and pseudo-intellectual approach is a disgrace.</P>
    <P>I support the motion and look forward to a good debate.  I hope the Minister will change her tune and treat these people in a serious way so that we can all move forward and provide a good pre-school system for children.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Dail Éireann commends the Government for the initiatives it has <Col N="1210" /> taken to alleviate the effects of social disadvantage on the educational welfare of children;</P>
    <P>&mdash; in particular, as one element of the Minister for Education's comprehensive policy for tackling disadvantage in the educational system, it commends the Minister for the establishment, following the most detailed research and preparation, of a high quality pre-school service in areas of disadvantage; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; commends the Minister for Health for implementing a range of initiatives in the area of pre-school care under the 1991 Child Care Act and for the financial and other supports given to voluntary playgroups and other early childhood services&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for early childhood services rests with the Departments of Health and Education.  Those children under six years of age who are enrolled in a primary school, including an early start pre-school centre are the responsibility of the Minister for Education.  All other children under the age of six years are the responsibility of the Minister for Health.  It is clear, therefore, that the services of the two Departments are complementary in providing comprehensive care for the wellbeing of young children with some overlap in that the Minister for Health is required to consult with the Minister for Education and, incidentally, with the Minister for the Environment, when making regulations regarding pre-school services.  I propose to deal with the work and the responsibilities of the Departments of Education and Health in the area of early education.</P>
    <P>Early childhood initiatives in the Department of Education have to be seen in the context of a general programme aimed at alleviating the educational effects of socio-economic disadvantage. The Department has initiated a number of schemes to address the issue of educational disadvantage.  The <Col N="1211" /> initiatives which have been favourably received by parents, teachers and school management include enhanced funding on a capitation basis (a) to meet management costs, (b) for the purchase of books and equipment and (c) for the promotion of home-school links; additional staffing above quota and the home-school-community links service.</P>
    <P>The Government has been able to achieve a considerable increase in the funding under the capitation scheme from £17 <i>per capita</i> when it came into office to the current level of £25.  The management and the administrative and teaching staff in the schools continually comment very favourably on the marvellous psychological boost these funds bring to the schools as well the very real assistance they give in bringing the level of provision up to that which pertains in schools in better off areas.</P>
    <P>The Government has also been able to add significantly to the number of schools at primary and post-primary levels which now have the services of a fully deployed home-school-community links person.  This service is a targeted resource in areas of greatest disadvantage to establish a collaborative partnership between parents and teachers in promoting children's education.  In addition, the Minister for Education has commissioned the Combat Poverty Agency to carry out research into criteria for the identification of disadvantage so that resources can be even more accurately targeted to meet the needs of those who are most at risk of school failure and drop-out.</P>
    <P>These initiatives were established to bring the level of educational resourcing in disadvantaged areas up to the level which prevails in other areas and they have both curative and preventative dimensions.  They are part of a purposeful programme of targeted strategies aimed at maximising the up-take of education by children in disadvantaged areas, retaining them in the education system to certification and making third level education a real option for them. <Col N="1212" /> These initiatives, taken with Youth-reach and the VPTC programmes, offer a comprehensive range of supports during a child's school going life to offset the educational effects of disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> between Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left expressed a commitment &ldquo;to a high quality education system&rdquo;.  Among the priorities identified is the &ldquo;further expansion of pre-school facilities, with the ultimate aim of an integrated professional national system linked to the national school system&rdquo;.  On her reappointment as Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, expanded the early start project from the eight locations she had already established to a further 32 locations in the designated areas.  This is a one year preventative strategy which is offered for three year old children in disadvantaged communities and it is targeted at those children who are deemed to be most at risk of experiencing educational failure and includes children who suffer from disabilities. Such pre-school education focuses on those children with the same aims as already stated, namely, to enable each child to reach his or her full potential in the education system; to support each child's retention in the school system to certification and to develop an educational environment in which each child will consider third level education to be a real option.</P>
    <P>The rationale for the intervention is based on Irish and international research evidence which indicates that high quality early childhood services can play an important part in offsetting the effects of socio-economic disadvantage and make a contribution to the alleviation of its educational effects.</P>
    <P>The early start project was established to expose young children to an educational programme which would enhance their overall development and prevent school failure and to offset the effects of social disadvantage.  Other important considerations in the project are the involvement of parents in the pre-school centres and the provision of <Col N="1213" /> development for them and the involvement of transition year students.  Teenagers will be given opportunities for work experience in early start centres as part of their transition year programme.  This experience will enable them to acquire practical skills in childcare and parenting as part of their post-primary education programme.  Their involvement will also provide an important community link for pre-school children outside school hours and help them to enhance their expectations of the education system and their retention in it. Both parental and transition pupil involvement will provide an opportunity for community partnership and participation in developing and operating an important local service.</P>
    <P>Irish and international research in early learning indicate that the most important hallmarks of quality are first, professionally trained staff &mdash; teachers in the early start project are fully qualified primary teachers whose training includes the philosophy, psychology and pedagogy of early childhood development together with experience of infant education.  The teachers also have practical experience of teaching infant classes in the school.  The minimum qualification for childcare workers is a level 2 qualification in childcare which is a full-time post-leaving certificate course and is certified by the National Council for Vocational Awards, NCVA. Third level qualifications in childcare which are certified by the National Council for Educational Awards, NCEA, are also accepted; second, well organised and equipped physical accommodation &mdash; early start pre-school centres are based in well organised accommodation, i.e., in vacant classrooms in primary schools.  Each classroom has a substantial variety of equipment and learning materials; third, good adult-child ratios &mdash; there is a child-adult ratio of 7.5:1 in the pre-school centres.  The involvement of experienced parents, transition year <Col N="1214" /> pupils and other persons, such as childcare and FÁS trainees on work experience, is in addition to this; fourth, parental involvement &mdash; the involvement of parents in planning, organising and administering the centres is an important part of the project.  The project has the additional facet of parental development in informing them about aspects of their children's learning.  It provides the necessary supports to build parents' capacity to promote the development of their children; and fifth, part of the primary education system &mdash; the pre-schools form an integral part of the primary education system and access all the administrative and organisational infrastructure which this implies.</P>
    <P>The early start curriculum includes structured activities aimed at the harmonious development of the cognitive, physical, social, aesthetic and spiritual abilities of the children.  The learning activities have very specific objectives, are highly sequenced and organised in an atmosphere of play, exploration and freedom.</P>
    <P>The approach to pedagogy is one of guided discovery.  The development of the language abilities of the children is seen as a particular curricular priority. The children are encouraged to be active agents in their own development. They are encouraged to express themselves through language, music, drama, art and physical education in a caring and stimulating learning environment.</P>
    <P>An early start centre is staffed by two teachers and two child care workers and caters for a maximum of 60 children on a dual day of 2.5 hours per session, i.e. 15 children per team of teacher and child care worker twice a day.  The 40 locations in which the early start programme is in operation are in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Drogheda, Galway and Dundalk.  Sixteen of these have two teachers while there is one in each of the remaining 24.</P>
    <P>In respect of equipment, there is a start-up grant of £4,500 per teacher, and in respect of parental development a grant of £1,500 per centre of two <Col N="1215" /> teachers and two childcare workers.  A capitation grant of £55 is paid in respect of each child in the early start programme and there is no local contribution.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education has established an expert and representative monitoring committee to advise on the operation of the early start pre-school service; to advise on the future development of the service, to consider the evaluators' reports and provide advice on their implications, to advise on alternative models of pre-school provision in designated areas of disadvantage and to advise on ways in which parental involvement in the children's learning can be developed.</P>
    <P>The monitoring committee, which is chaired by Dr. Anne McKenna, a distinguished expert on early childhood, includes representatives of the principals, the teachers and child care workers in the project; the parents whose children are involved in the scheme and a representative of the National Parents Council, primary, the Irish Pre-school Playgroups Association, IPPA; the World Organisation for Early Childhood Education, OMEP; the colleges of education; the Catholic Primary School Managers Association, CPSMA: the Irish National Teachers Organisation, INTO and the Departments of Health and Education.  The Minister has also nominated two distinguished experts on early childhood from UCD and the Dublin Institute of Technology to the committee.</P>
    <P>The early start project is being evaluated by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra.  To date, the evaluators have collected base line data on which comparisons will be based.  The purpose of evaluation is to monitor the implementation of programmes in schools, attending to variation between sites, describe problems in implementation, examine the interface of programmes with other initiatives in schools designed to address problems of disadvantage &mdash; e.g. home-school-community links programme, monitor the <Col N="1216" /> degree of parental involvement in programmes, describe the achievements of programme participants when they reach junior infants standard and compare those achievements with those of pupils who had not participated in early start programmes and describe the achievements of programme participants when they reach second standard and compare those achievements with those of pupils who had not participated in early start programmes.</P>
    <P>A number of issues are relevant in the context of the establishment of an early start project in an area.  In all of the cases where there are early start centres local school management applied for the service.  The Department of Education was extremely sensitive to the possible effects of the early start programme on the provision of playgroups, nurseries and community groups. Consequently, the decision to locate an early start centre in some areas was not implemented and in others the level of provision was reduced because of the existence of voluntary services for pre-school children.  Consultation took place with officials of the Department of Health in the context of that Department's responsibility for children under six years of age who are not enrolled in primary schools and also with local school management, chairpersons and principals, who were requested to be sensitive to the needs of existing services.</P>
    <P>Montessori teachers are not eligible to teach in the early start service.  Each early start centre is a fully integrated part of the primary school in which it is placed.  The teachers in the early start service must have complete mobility within the school in which they are employed and within the primary system nationally so that they can be redeployed to any other teaching assignment within the school or to another school in the case of redundancy.  It is very doubtful if Montessori teachers would wish to apply for the position of childcare workers in the early start service since they have qualifications which are higher than the minimum required in <Col N="1217" /> the case of child care workers in the early start service.</P>
    <P>Parents, members of communities and school personnel have already indicated that they are very pleased with the provision of the early start service.  I believe that it complements existing voluntary services; that there is ample room for all the providers of pre-school services, both early start and voluntary sector provision &mdash; the potential capacity of the entire early start provision is 1,680 children compared with numbers in excess of 55,000 children in the three year age cohort nationally; that the early start programme operates in areas of greatest disadvantage only and it is not proposed to extend the provision outside those areas, and that it will make an important contribution to the education of children in disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <P>Ag tabhairt tacaíocht don leasú atá molta ag an Aire Stáit, ba mhaith liom déileál sa díospóireacht seo leis na gnéithe a bhaineann leis an Roinn Sláinte.  In supporting the amendment proposed by the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, I will deal with the health aspects.</P>
      <P>With regard to the implementation of the Child Care Act, 1991, the House will be aware that an order bringing a further 44 sections into operation with effect from 31 October has been signed. These include the key provisions of Parts III and VI which deal with the protection of children in emergencies, care proceedings and the powers and duties of health boards in relation to children in their care.</P>
      <P>The commencement of these sections will greatly strengthen the powers of health boards and the Garda to intervene quickly to protect children who are being abused or neglected.  They will also provide the courts with a range of new options in proceedings involving children who are not receiving adequate care and protection, including the power to make supervision orders authorising health boards to monitor children in their own home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1218" /> Three sets of new regulations governing the placement by health boards of children in foster care, residential care and with relatives have been signed. The new regulations will also come into force on 31 October.  They require health boards to visit, supervise and review children in their care on a more systematic basis.  They are designed to ensure the changing needs of the children are not lost sight of and give full recognition to the role of the parents and carers in this process.</P>
    <P>The commencement of Parts III to VI of the Act gives effect to the central recommendation of the report of the Kilkenny Incest investigation.  In accordance with the timescale set by the Government, the remaining 18 sections of the Act will be brought into operation next year.</P>
    <P>Of particular relevance to this debate is Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991, which contains the remaining sections of the Act to be implemented next year. Part VII of the Child Care Act, 1991 contains new provisions for the supervision and inspection of pre-school services for children.  Section 50 requires the Minister for Health, after consultation with the Minister for Education and the Environment, to make regulations for securing the safety and promoting the development of children attending pre-school services.  The provision will apply to pre-schools, playgroups, day nurseries, créches and other similar services which cater for pre-school children.  The regulations will lay down requirements for premises in which pre-school services are provided.  These requirements will relate to such matters as the heating, cleanliness, repair and maintenance of the premises, as well as the equipment and facilities to be provided.</P>
    <P>When the new provisions come into force, persons providing or proposing to provide pre-school services will be required to notify their local health board.  This will have to be done in a manner which will be prescribed by the new regulations.  There will be a statutory duty on every person providing a pre-school service to take all reasonable <Col N="1219" /> measures to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of pre-school children availing of the service and to comply with the regulations made by the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>The health boards will be required to arrange for pre-school services in their areas to be inspected to ensure that the persons providing the services are fulfilling the duties imposed on them under the legislation.  These inspections will be carried out by authorised persons appointed by the health boards, and may include officers of the Minister for Education.  An authorised person will be entitled to enter a premises where a pre-school is being provided and to examine the condition of the premises and the standard of care and attention the children are receiving.</P>
    <P>Consultations on the implementation of this part of the Act will take place with all the interested parties involved in the provision of pre-school services. In accordance with the timescale determined by the Government for the implementation of the Act, I intend to commence implementation of Part VII during 1996.</P>
    <P>Since 1993, additional funding of the order of £30 million annually has been provided to develop child care and family support services and to strengthen the capacity of the health boards to meet the demands of the new legislation. I am happy to say that a significant portion of these moneys has been allocated to the development of the pre-school sector.</P>
    <P>The call for a national forum must be placed in the context of the monitoring committee for the early start programme and the representation on it. The monitoring committee represents the interests, both State and voluntary, involved in this sector as well as the two main Government Departments with responsibility for young children.  Furthermore, early childhood educational services were discussed in the unprecedented national debate which took place in the National Education Convention and in the development of the Green and White Papers on education. Similarly, the early childhood services, <Col N="1220" /> which come within the ambit of the Department of Health, were subject to rigorous review and consultation in the events leading up to the enactment in this House of the 1991 Child Care Act. In these circumstances, therefore, it would be inopportune to establish the forum mentioned in the motion in advance of the findings of educational research and the report of the monitoring committee.</P>
    <P>The early start programme and programmes provided by voluntary groups, including those aided by health authorities, are complementary.  Early start services cater for the three to four year age group and are provided only in areas of greatest social disadvantage. Services aided by the health authorities in the areas of social and community care cater for a wider age range, sometimes from two to six years.  The services of the voluntary playgroup movement are found all over the country and are not especially designed for the needs of the socially disadvantaged.  The Ministers for Education and Health see an important role for all of these types of provision.  The early start service was not designed to compete with or inhibit the development of the voluntary community playgroup sector.</P>
    <P>In establishing the pilot service, the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, was fully aware of the importance of the existing playgroup and pre-school services.  In choosing locations, she was anxious not to compete with existing centres and had consultations with the Minister for Health in this context.</P>
    <P>In the consultation which took place with school managers and principal teachers, the officials of the Department of Education stressed the crucial importance of existing services in their areas and the need to be sensitive to them.</P>
    <P>In supporting the amendment proposed by the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Allen, I believe the initiatives being taken and which have been or are about to be taken in the Department of Education in the context of the Child Care <Col N="1221" /> Act, 1991, and in particular in the context of Section 7, will have an important role in the development of the pre-school sector.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to range over the areas which have been presented to the Dáil by my colleague, Deputy Allen. Suffice to say that the Department of Health is committed to playing its full part in this important area.  We should bear in mind that in the first instance, particularly in the context of the early start programme, the focus is on areas of disadvantage.  As a former teacher, it was apparent to me for instance, in the area of the development of language ability, that from the age of five onwards our capacity for absorbing language declines.  Therefore, it is vitally important interventions take place at an early stage in disadvantaged areas, where standards and levels of verbal communication are not at the standard we would like.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Martin's motion, which has brought Ministers to the House to recognise and acknowledge the importance of this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, referred to the number of children who are deprived of the laudable and desirable facility of early education.  The road to hell is paved with good intentions and the road to not getting things done is paved with pilot studies and schemes.  Out of a total of 55,000 children 35,000 are denied this facility.  Whatever about a need for pilot studies there is need for a commitment to provide this service.  The lack of co-operation and interface with the excellent groups that provide pre-school facilities was a retrograde step.  As the late Tip O'Neill said: &ldquo;all politics is local&rdquo;.  In areas where a pre-school facility was provided and the early start programme introduced on a pilot basis the numbers attending the pre-school facility fell.  However, in other areas no pre-school facility existed and the early start programme was not introduced. The effort at co-ordination and co-operation was hamfisted and caused great distress.  There were excellent facilities <Col N="1222" /> in Ballymun and Blanchardstown before the pilot scheme was introduced.</P>
    <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Moffatt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is satisfactory and agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>In his lengthy and comprehensive address Deputy Martin stated that research abroad highlighted the great advantages which arise from a comprehensive early start programme. The Minister of State is a teacher and knows the advantages of such a programme better than most.  Discussions and meetings on education are well attended and parents are particularly interested in them.</P>
      <P>Uniquely my constituency embraces two new satellite towns, Clondalkin-Lucan and Blanchardstown.  When I entered public life the population in Clondalkin was 1,800, in Lucan it was 800 and in Blanchardstown it was slightly over 1,000.  Today, the population is approximately 70,000 in Clondalkin-Lucan and 60,000 in Blanchardstown. The adjoining satellite town of Tallaght has a population of almost 100,000.  There is a high percentage of young children and teenagers in that population profile.  Many local authority houses were given to large families and families with young children.</P>
      <P>There is great need for a comprehensive educational system from early start to third level.  Much has been achieved by successive Governments.  In the early days the call was for primary and secondary schools.  Now there is a third level facility in Tallaght and we hope there will soon be one in Blanchardstown.</P>
      <P>Deputy Martin referred to the dollar spend as against the dollar cost, $1 against $7 &mdash; the cost of a pupil going through the educational system and the cost to the State in later years if the reverse is the case.  The Minister's amendment is weak and lacks commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition must be mindful of the financial implications of its requests. I recognise the difficulties regarding budgetary constraints and understand the internal political dogfight at this <Col N="1223" /> time of the year when estimates are being prepared.  However, it would not take a substantial amount of money to widen the availability of the early start programme.  The good will of the IPPA who provided pre-school facilities for many years should be tapped.  Listening to the Minister one cannot help but feel that it is a teacher-number issue and that the teacher must be capable of carrying out other duties.  This will impinge on the provision of the service, particularly if there is an increase in enrolments.  There should be greater co-operation with existing groups that provide pre-school facilities.</P>
    <P>The Minister missed an opportunity in regard to Montessori teachers as it will probably not be attractive to them to apply for the position of child care workers or co-operate with the Department. There is room for all those who provide pre-school services as the potential capacity of the early start service is 1,680 children when there are in excess of 55,000 children in the three year cohort nationally.  Deputy Martin mentioned a figure of under 20,000 children. Realistic finance should be provided in this area and the recommendations of the team of experts appointed by the Minister should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>We do not need studies but a commitment, as called for in Deputy Martin's motion, to expand the scheme at a relatively small financial cost &mdash; £1 or £2 million would go a long way towards providing extra places.  No doubt the Minister of State and Deputy Martin will appreciate, as teachers, the knock-on benefits for pupils in primary classes of having attended pre-school groups. This means that those pupils at junior and senior primary school level advance more rapidly, their teachers have greater job satisfaction and their overall quality of education is so much better. It has been proved that the extra year is of enormous benefit to pupils generally.</P>
    <P>What is needed is an ending of the monitoring, research and studies into the potential for advancement.  In the course of his remarks the Minister of State referred to Dr. Annie McKenna, <Col N="1224" /> an expert on early childhood development who has been appointed to the monitoring committee.  That committee, if given the task of producing a costing and comprehensive report within, say, four to eight weeks, could quickly cease their monitoring activities and allow the Minister to advance a strong case for substantially increasing the necessary places in 1996 so ensuring that the approximate 30,000 disenfranchised young children are provided with some type of early start or pre-school facilities.</P>
    <P>The House will appreciate the enormous demands on mothers in particular whether through their being a second or the sole earner within a household.  In disadvantaged areas in particular there is great need for women to be in gainful employment, their menfolk having been made redundant through automation, advancing technology and so on.  An early start or pre-school programme would be of tremendous help to them.</P>
    <P>The financial needs of young parents in my constituency, particularly those with children, are enormous.  While they pursue their respective careers they must meet substantial mortgage repayments and pay the cost of improving their homes and other commitments. All young families in such areas are in dire need of this type of facility which goes to the very heart of our commitment to cherish all our children equally.</P>
    <P>I urge the monitoring committee to reach speedy conclusions on the success or otherwise of the scheme and its integration with the other facilities available so that from next year onwards we can see real progress in this area.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate and I compliment Deputy Martin on having tabled it.  It is timely as there is a great need for a national debate on this issue.  The Minister introduced an early start programme without taking cognisance of the facilities already available. Numerous people have been involved in playschool, pre-school, Montessori groups and so on over many <Col N="1225" /> years.  Yet, when the Minister introduced her programme she did not consult those groups sufficiently or attempt to ascertain what they had to offer. Rather she is displacing many such groups, especially in disadvantaged areas, who could have complemented her programme.  The lack of any such consultation has led to much discord nationwide.</P>
      <P>In Ballina, a disadvantaged area in my constituency, ten years ago a woman established a playschool group.  That person had the requisite qualifications, gained from English schools, to do the job properly.  She does not know where she stands and whether, if she applies to participate in the early start programme, she will be recognised.  Yet to date she has been totally dependent on local support and manages to operate within a very tight budget.  Many more such playschool groups established in disadvantaged areas are of enormous help to their local communities, yet all were disregarded in the Minister's latest proposals.</P>
      <P>There is a great debate at present on early school training, on whether children should attend school at an early stage or whether we should await the outcome of experiments in Germany and allow our children attend school proper only at seven or eight years of age.</P>
      <P>The Government is involved in this early start programme in that a number of Departments and agencies, such as health boards, have been involved to date.  Deputy Martin listed many of the groups who have been supplying funds for this purpose, such as the health boards, FÁS, LEADER programmes, the Department of Social Welfare and so on.  However, when voluntary groups seek such funding they experience tremendous difficulty despite the fact that the Minister said that, under the provisions of the Child Care Act, 1991, the health boards and other agencies should be able to make such facilities more readily available.  It is always very difficult to obtain money from any source when establishing a playschool group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In compiling her programme the <Col N="1226" /> Minister will have been made aware of the promise of much funding by two previous Governments.  We want her to examine the overall programme and utilise available funds wisely.  There is no use merely dissipating the funds among a few projects or areas.  The Minister should re-examine her classification of disadvantaged areas when she considers our major cities and towns only.  The many disadvantaged areas in smaller communities remain totally forgotten. It is indeed a pity that all such funds have been allocated to the more deprived areas within larger cities, thus depriving communities in smaller towns.</P>
    <P>This programme will be of enormous benefit especially to young mothers in need of some respite.  There is no doubt but that playschool and the early start programme can play an enormous part in the national education scene.  As Deputy Martin said, we must examine education <i>in toto,</i> always remembering that any moneys spent wisely in the early years will reap tremendous benefits later to the community at large.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noel Ahern said he had been disillusioned at what had occurred when the Minister took responsibility for this early start programme, omitting those who had been operating the programme over many years.  He quoted an example of one group in Dublin who had catered for children within this age group in the past 21 years and were disregarded by the Minister.  Deputy Ahern went on to speak about the Montessori and other groups, comprised of qualified people more than competent to deal with any educational problems encountered, also disregarded by the Minister.  I ask the Minister to re-examine her proposals and endeavour to include all groups.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate, on this historic day, to acknowledge the contribution of the UN in its first 50 years of existence and the 40th anniversary of Ireland's entry to membership of that organisation.  Ireland, since its <Col N="1227" /> entry, has become one of the United Nations most respected and active participants. Ireland's commitment has not merely been to the General Assembly in New York or Geneva.  It includes a considerable contribution to the UN peace-keeping and humanitarian missions ranging from the Congo in the 1960s to the present day monitoring contingent in former Yugoslavia.</P>
      <P>Over the years Irish people have given uselfishly to many United Nations operations through the Army and, recently, the Garda Síochána, at times at the cost of human life.  In the process considerable experience has been amassed in the area of peace-keeping in which our expertise and contribution has earned international recognition.  In so doing we have acquired first-hand experience of the difficulties which may be encountered while attempting to give effect to a UN mandate and the administrative inadequacies that may occur. Our contribution was also significant in sponsoring the non-proliferation treaty and the vote for China's admission to the UN.  Both these achievements were very important milestones in the career of Frank Aiken who, with no disrespect to any other present or former Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs, is recognised as the man who introduced the United Nations to the role of foreign affairs.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party firmly believes that, in its 50th year, a radical examination and overhaul of its workings and effectiveness is long overdue.  National self-interest on the part of some member states has, for too long, been over influential in the UN decision-making process.  A perception exists, perhaps an unfair one in many instances, that, as an organisation, the United Nations is ineffective, wasteful and bureaucratic. Now that the Cold War has ended the UN has been given new freedom but this brings an enormous range of new responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Already this year we have seen numerous reports, papers, documentaries and international fora deliberating <Col N="1228" /> on the need for reform within the United Nations.  While there may seem to be a general consensus in these reports as to the analysis of the problems, there has been too little obvious agreement on solutions.  It is now a near cliché that the UN is no more than the sum of the political will of its constituent members and its failures are those of its members.  A recent article in <i>The Economist</i> stated that the United Nations is both the alibi and the scapegoat.  It is deferred to in support of national self-interest but is derided and left to carry the burden when things go wrong.  The end of the Cold War may have eased the passage of resolutions but not their implementation.  What is required is a reduction in the number of resolutions and mandates to those which are achievable.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Bankrupt&rdquo; might be an emotive word but it has to be used in the context of the United Nations.  Member states owe over £1 billion on the main account and a further £1.7 billion is overdue in contributions to peace-keeping.  Recent missions in Rwanda, Somalia and former Yugoslavia have attracted much popular criticism.  It is sad to hear of Ireland's forces wearing UN blue berets or T-shirts being ridiculed by Bosnian Muslims angered at the perceived inaction of the international community.</P>
    <P>A general streamlining and restructuring of the UN's administration is needed to ensure that it can more effectively provide protection, justice and development assistance to those who most depend on it.  The nature of threats to security and the cause of conflicts have become increasingly complex with the end of the Cold War.  The UN now requires a more flexible range of peace-keeping, crisis-management, mediation and early-warning tools.  The UN tends to be dominated by Western concerns and self interest.  The debt crisis and the AIDS epidemic currently threaten the security of African nations to an equal, if not greater, degree than threats to Middle Eastern oil supplies which threaten Western economies.  However, when will we see co-ordinated action in <Col N="1229" /> this regard on the same scale as that of the Gulf War?</P>
    <P>There is a genuine recognition of the contribution of Ireland, and other peace-keeping or neutral states, to the UN's positive development.  Ireland is expected and needed to play a leading role in the debate on UN reform.  It is essential that we are to the forefront with constructive proposals on its structure and mandate.  There can be no greater commemoration of this 50th anniversary within the UN than that Ireland should play a leading, vocal and constructively imaginative role in the process of reform.  I hope that the Government will take the lead in that area and that the world will be a safer place for the next 50 years under the protection of a reinvigorated United Nations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue and the very positive terms in which it has been framed. I am very glad to acknowledge that the policy of successive Governments of support for the United Nations has enjoyed the whole-hearted endorsement of all parties in this House from the time of former Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave and former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Frank Aiken, to the present day.  Within the United Nations, Ireland's stance as a strong advocate of the organisation, both in political terms and in practical terms as a major contributor to UN peace-keeping, has gained us the respect and good will of fellow member states.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very significant and solemn anniversary.  It was precisely on this day 50 years ago that the United Nations General Assembly opened its first session with only 51 members.  Last weekend the representatives of 185 member states, most of them at Heads of State or Government level, assembled in New York to commemorate the 50th anniversary. It was the largest such gathering in world history.  Throughout their statements ran the theme that the UN has an indispensable, central role to play in dealing with present-day international crises.  It was also heartening to hear many of those present say that they <Col N="1230" /> were rendering homage to an organisation which not only acted as midwife at the very birth of their nation, but also offered protection and comfort during its early years.  In a very real sense the international community, as well as shaping the United Nations, has been formed by it.</P>
    <P>For most of the past 50 years the UN had to live within the constraints imposed by the Cold War.  Even so, it had many solid achievements during this period.  Since today is a day for commemoration, let us recall the valuable contribution of the UN over the past half century: its role in containing the risks of nuclear confrontation between the major powers; the invaluable framework which it provided for the negotiation of arms control and disarmament agreements; its role in the prevention of conflict through active diplomacy; the contribution of UN peace-keeping, in which Ireland has played a proud role, in preventing the escalation of tension and conflict; the development of universal standards in human rights; the leading role its specialised agencies have played in combating poverty and improving the lives of countless millions of the world's most vulnerable citizens through programmes to advance literacy, to assist and protect refugees and to assure the mass immunisation of children. However, much of the record of the UN falls short of the high ideals of the Charter.  These achievements represent a substantial success for an organisation that arose from the ashes of global war and which replaced the less ambitious and ultimately unsuccessful experiment of the League of Nations.</P>
    <P>Following the end of the Cold War, the UN engaged in a dramatic, and largely successful, intensification of multilateral efforts to resolve the long-standing conflicts that were left over from the Cold War in countries such as Cambodia, El Salvador, Angola and Mozambique.  However, what concerns the international community most urgently at present is the inability of the UN to prevent and contain recent inter-necine intra-state conflicts, such as those which have occurred in Somalia, former <Col N="1231" /> Yugoslavia and Rwanda.  The UN was created out of a determination that the world should never have to face again the horrors of war.  Yet, as we are tragically aware, the UN has not been able to prevent the old nightmares of war, genocide and destruction revisiting us.</P>
    <P>The 50th anniversary of the UN will have served its purpose well if, in the light of these recent tragedies, it causes us to concentrate our attention on the future renewal of the organisation and allows us properly to comprehend why it has not proved effective in dealing with these crises.  Inspired by this anniversary year, we have to look urgently at ways of transforming the UN so that it has the capacity to respond to the challenges which are now occurring and which will undoubtedly recur in future. We must also provide the UN with the financial resources necessary to carry out effectively the tasks which we the member states assign to it.  Not least we have to reform the UN so that respect for its authority within the international community is properly restored.</P>
    <P>Since the beginning of last year the UN General Assembly has been examining the question of the enlargement of the Security Council and other related reforms.  Progress has been slow, but we have now reached a stage where we have to begin to clarify the elements of a balanced solution.  Ireland's approach is based on support for an enlarged Council which is more representative of the general membership and reflects changing international political and economic realities.  We are also concerned to improve the representation of developing countries and to retain the opportunity for smaller states, such as Ireland, to serve periodically on the Council.  Such reforms should improve the Council's representative character, its transparency and its effectiveness.</P>
    <P>Much has been said and written in recent days about the financial crisis facing the UN.  The challenge which it poses cannot be avoided if the UN is to survive.  I repeat, as so many others have done, that the most pressing requirement is for all member states to pay their assessed contributions to the UN <Col N="1232" /> in full, on time and without conditions. Without money the UN, and its peace-keeping operations, will come apart.</P>
    <P>The number, scale and complexity of UN peace-keeping operations have grown enormously in recent years. Shortcomings have been exposed.  As events in Somalia showed it is vital that in devising mission mandates the distinction between peacekeeping and peace-enforcement is maintained.  The most urgent need is to improve the response capability of the UN at the beginning of a crisis.  Above all early deployment could prevent an escalation of conflict and it is necessary to look at proposals for a rapid reaction capability.</P>
    <P>Just as early deployment of peace-keepers may prevent escalation of a crisis so early preventive diplomacy may defuse tension before it erupts into violence. The UN needs to develop such a capacity for preventive diplomacy through early warning and mediation.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of this special Adjournment debate I am very glad to assure the Deputy that the Government is fully committed to fulfilling its obligations under the Charter and to ensuring the success of the UN as a central and indispensable component of the new global order which we are seeking to build for the 21st century.  As a dedicated UN member state we will actively participate in the ongoing reform process and we will endavour to ensure that the organisation is properly equipped with the means necessary to uphold the rule of law in international life, to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms and to lay the basis for a more peaceful and prosperous future for all of the world's population.</P>

      <P>Go luath taréis don Aire teacht isteach sa Rialtas nua i mí Feabhra imbliana chuir an Rialtas an polasaí nua a bhí acu os comhair na Dála.  Ceann de na príomh-aidhmeanna acu ná go dtabharfadh siad cabhair do na Gaelscoileanna go luath.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom a chur in iúl don Aire gur bhliain chriticiúil chinniúnach í an bhliain seo do Ghaelscoil Mhic Amhlaidh.  Tá líon na bpáistí ag dul i méid gach bliain &mdash; tá 91 páiste cláraithe sa scoil inniu cé nár thosaigh sí go dtí mí Dheireadh Fómhair 1993, sin dhá bhliain ó shin.  Tá ceathrar múinteoir sa scoil.  Chomh maith leis sin tá naíonra sa scoil le beirt stiúrthóir.</P>
      <P>Tá géarchéim cóiríochta sa scoil faoi láthair mar seo leanas.  Tá an cead pleanála ón mBord Pleanála don chéad fhoirgneamh sealadach, agus atá fós in usáid, as dáta ó mhí Iúil 1995.</P>
      <P>Toisc an brú spáis i Meán Fómhair 1995 tá úsáid á baint as bungalow príobháideach atá faighte ar léas bliana mar dhara chóiríocht breise.  Tá Enforcement Notice eisithe ag Bárdas na Gaillimhe i leith an fhoirgnimh sin.</P>
      <P>Tá an seomra tionóil ar chúl an tséipéil á úsáid le haghaidh drámaíocht, rince agus araile.  Tá carrchlós an tséipéil á úsáid mar chlós don scoil.

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Kirk.  There has been much discussion in the media in the last few <Col N="1236" /> years about extending and reclassifying disadvantaged areas.  On coming into office this Government promised to deal with this matter.  However, a member of a Government in my constituency went so far as to say that no submission for reclassification had been made to Brussels and that the application was lying in the Minister's office.  I tabled a question and found out that the reclassification application had been in Brussels since 13 October 1994.  Most of us hoped for a decision in time for the 1995 premia payments which are so essential to small producers.</P>
      <P>I went as part of a British-Irish party to Brussels on 27 March and, together with a member of the European Parliament, we had a discussion with EU officials responsible for administering disadvantaged areas schemes.  That official told us that if national governments were willing to put up the money there was no reason the reclassification could not go ahead.  We were told also that there would not be additional money but that the funding would come from the original allocation.</P>
      <P>Just over 60 per cent of Cavan and 40 per cent of Monaghan have been designated as severely handicapped.  These two counties were so hard done by that I and a number of other members of the party carried out our own surveys in various district electoral divisions.  We satisfied ourselves that the farm income was only half what the Department analysis showed.  Unless there is a substantial increase in the area classified as disadvantaged, we will look for a system of appeal.  I have insisted over the years that we have not been treated fairly and I discussed the matter with one of the assistant secretaries who has since retired.  I will fight for a system of appeal.  The stalling is an effort to avoid paying in 1995.  It is regrettable that that should happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity of adding my voice to the appeal for urgency in progressing the decision on the application for further extension <Col N="1237" /> of the disadvantaged areas.  The Minister of State may think the county I represent does not need to be included. However, I would like to disabuse him of that idea because there are considerable areas of the county which would benefit substantially and, on the basis of the criteria, should automatically qualify for inclusion in the disadvantaged area.</P>
      <P>A representative of the ESRI was interviewed on a news programme this evening, and during the interview there was a reference to the decline in the numbers employed in agriculture.  It is expected that that decline will accelerate, but it is important, in a country with an unemployment problem, to retain as many as possible on the land.  Disadvantaged area classification has been a lifeline to many small marginally economic holdings.  The areas which were not included in the last round have brought a case to Brussels, but progress in bringing this to a finality has been very slow. The Minister of State should bring all the resources of his Department to bear on the Commission to have the matter expedited at that level, because if marginally economic holdings fall below the threshold of viability there will be even more people unemployed in the areas which it is hoped will be included when the decision is made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the two Deputies for raising this matter here.  As part of its terms of reference the Disadvantaged Areas Appeals Panel was asked to examine the possibility of reclassifying areas from less severely handicapped to more severely handicapped status.</P>
      <P>Appeals were invited from areas deserving reclassification, and these were examined in detail by the panel. Their recommendations were presented to my predecessor, and were forwarded to the EU Commissioner in October 1994.</P>
      <P>The Commission raised a number of technical queries on the proposal, and these were dealt with at a meeting between officials of my Department and the Commission in June 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present position is that the proposal for reclassification, as originally <Col N="1238" /> submitted, will be discussed at the next meeting of the Agricultural Structures and Rural Development, STAR, Committee which will be held on Thursday, 26 October 1995.  As soon as I receive official notification that the proposal has been accepted by the STAR Committee, a list of the areas for reclassification will be released.  Farmers in these areas will be entitled to apply for the grants applicable to more severely handicapped status in 1996.</P>
    <P>I hope a number of those areas mentioned by Deputy Leonard will be included in the reclassification and that the people in Cavan and in Louth will be happy following the announcement on Thursday evening.</P>

    <P>As agreed by both parties to the dispute, the matter was referred to an assessor who was appointed in January 1992 and the McLaughlin report was published in May 1993.  SIPTU was prepared to accept its findings but Teagasc and the Department were reluctant to do so.  The technicians seek pay parity with similar grades in Teagasc &mdash; the McLaughlin report pointed to serious pay anomalies between grades in the colleges concerned and Teagasc.  The <Col N="1239" /> students involved face serious difficulties because of the dispute.  Each day lost at college will prove detrimental at examination time.</P>
    <P>I admire the versatility of the Minister of State in replying to three matters on the Adjournment, displaying typical Kerry footwork in the process.  I hope he will have tidings of good news on this matter.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Kirk for sharing time with me.  While the McLaughlin report was published in 1993, in 1995 a number of agricultural and horticultural students have been sent home from colleges because of a dispute over pay parity.  The 59 students at St. Patrick's College in Monaghan are in a particularly vulnerable position. That diocesan college was set up from voluntary subscriptions and has provided many students with the necessary expertise in farming methods.  Will the Minister of State do everything possible to resolve the dispute and alleviate the concerns of parents and students?</P>
      <P>I met a group of people last week who raised the question of the withdrawal of the services of the local poultry adviser in the Monaghan area.  Two weeks prior to that I met a group of people concerned about the delay in paying grants for farm building works.  This is not what we were led to expect from the Government.</P>

    <P>While I accept the dispute is not a simple matter, the future of many young <Col N="1240" /> students is at stake.  Therefore, everything possible should be done to resolve it.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Deputies from neighbouring constituencies on their fine team work.  The dispute in question concerns a pay claim by technicians at private colleges.</P>
      <P>In 1991 the Labour Court recommended that an assessor examine this claim.  The Institute of Public Administration carried out the examination and recommended new pay scales. Despite the fact that the increase recommended greatly exceeds the limits laid down in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> to which the union involved, SIPTU, are signatories, I decided, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, in the circumstances surrounding the claim to accept the pay scales recommended.  The only issue in dispute regarding the pay scales is the date of implementation of the award. Backdating to 1 October 1994 has been offered but the union is demanding implementation with effect from May 1993.  The unions have also submitted claims for automatic promotions from Grade I to Grade II and the creation of a supervisory agricultural officer post at Pallaskenry.</P>
      <P>Both the Minister for Finance and I consider that the offer made is a very generous one in present circumstances and that there is no prospect of an improvement on it during the currency of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 25 October 1995.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I assure the Deputy that I am aware of the Síol Resource Centre and of its work with adults with a mental handicap in the Mullingar area.  I recently met representatives of the parents of those attending the centre.</P>
      <P>The provision of services for people with a mental handicap in the Mullingar area is a matter for the Midland Health Board in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Síol Resource Centre was established as a joint venture involving the Midland Health Board, the Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary and the Parents and Friends of the Mentally Handicapped, Mullingar and District.  The service which is part of the overall day services programme for persons with a mental handicap funded by the Midland Health Board, was originally located on ground floor premises rented from the Loreto Sisters in Mullingar.  This arrangement ceased in 1992 when the premises were required by the order due to the expansion of the Loreto secondary school.  The service then moved to its present premises in Spoutwell Lane.  These premises, while centrally <Col N="960" /> located, are not ideal for the services, but were the best option available at the time.  The building is two storey and as many of the clients have multiple handicaps, there is an increased risk of accidents occurring.  The professional advice available to the board has indicated that the premises are unsuitable.  There are also access and parking problems for the minibuses serving the Síol Centre.</P>
    <P>As part of the overall development of services to persons with a mental handicap and to provide for those not in receipt of day services, the board made available to the mental handicap services in 1994 the former training centre in Pettiswood.  This centre is located approximately 1.3 miles from the centre of Mullingar and is being developed by the board, the Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary and the Parents and Friends of the Mentally Handicapped, Mullingar, as a resource centre.  It will provide, in a purpose built, single storey building, a board range of integrated services including: a sheltered employment; supported employment opportunities; development of social skills; numeracy and literacy skills; and activities related to daily living.</P>
    <P>The activities will include visits to shops, sports facilities and other outings as part of the overall programme.  The new facility will offer the clients currently attending the Síol Centre access to a wider range of services.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing more appropriate accommodation for the Síol service, it will also provide additional places for persons on the waiting list, including those who can currently only attend the Síol Centre on a part-time basis, that is, a half day to one or two days per week.  With the additional funding provided in 1995, the board is currently recruiting a manager for the resource centre who I understand will be appointed shortly.</P>
    <P>The board is very conscious of the need to promote the development of independence and the social integration of persons with a mental handicap.  I <Col N="961" /> understand from the board that the Parents and Friends of the Mentally Handicapped, Mullingar and District are actively seeking an appropriate facility in the town centre, which will complement and enhance the overall service provided by the Mullingar Resource Centre for its clients and replace the unsuitable and limited facilities at Spoutwell Lane.</P>
    <P>I also understand from the board that the reasons for the integration of the Síol service within the new Mullingar Resource Centre have been explained to the parents.  One of the anxieties expressed by the parents about the transfer was the proximity of the Resource Centre to St. Loman's Psychiatric Hospital.  The board strongly rejects any inference that the location of the Resource Centre is in any way prejudiced by its proximity to St. Loman's hospital and its environs.</P>
    <P>While I understand to some extent the anxieties which the change may cause to both the parents and their children, the service, which will be provided to them as a result of this move will be delivered in a professional and caring manner and will provide their children with improved opportunities to achieve their full potential.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The long-term illness scheme entitles persons who suffer from certain specified illnesses to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of the particular illnesses.  The scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to expand the number of illnesses covered by the <Col N="962" /> scheme.  The Department regularly considers submissions from a wide range of organisations representing people with conditions such as asthma, spinal injuries, ileostomy, lupus, among others.</P>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme, however, is only one of a number of schemes in operation which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines for persons with an ongoing medical condition.</P>
      <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses, such as general practitioner fees or prescribed drugs due to a long-term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  The drug cost subsidisation scheme caters for people who do not have a medical card or long-term illness book and are certified as having a medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
      <P>Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of schemes for people with long-term medical conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 88 together.  The hospital service has encountered problems in the provision of accident and emergency services, particularly over the winter period in the past number of years.  This is not a phenomenon confined to Ireland but is a feature in other developed countries also.</P>
      <P>The causes of the problems which arise have been well documented.  It is not possible to predict the volume of patients who will require this service at a particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ageing of our population has also contributed to the difficulties in accident and emergency departments.  The winter period brings its own set of problems for our elderly population.  This in turn can lead to an upsurge in the number of patients who present at accident and emergency departments requiring admission to hospital.  Many elderly patients require acute hospital care <Col N="964" /> initially but much of their recovery period could be spent in step down-subacute accommodation.  The shortage of sub-acute beds has caused problems in that acute hospitals have not been able to discharge patients in sufficient numbers and quickly enough, to cater for new patients seeking the services of the hospital.</P>
    <P>The volume of patients who present at casualty departments for treatment has also increased.  For example between 1988 and 1994, the number of new attendances at the six major accident and emergency hospitals in Dublin increased by 30 per cent.  Many of these attendances are not appropriate to acute hospitals.  Many of these people could perhaps be more appropriately treated by their local general practitioners.</P>
    <P>The accident and emergency problem has been building up, especially in Dublin, for some time and has faced successive Ministers for Health.  I would like to make it clear that I intend to tackle this issue.  However, there are no &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo; solutions.  The problem can only be solved through a series of measures, both short-term and long-term, which must be co-ordinated and integrated. Up to now, difficulties in the accident and emergency services have been dealt with by providing mainly once-off solutions. I propose tackling a number of areas including services for the elderly, services for the chronically disabled and services provided by the acute hospitals which, when taken together, will provide a comprehensive and integrated response.</P>
    <P>I am at present visiting the major Dublin hospitals to discuss with them a number of important policy and operational issues, including their accident and emergency service.  It is essential that each hospital puts in place a set of procedures that will result in a better and more streamlined response to accident and emergency services.</P>
    <P>There is a need also for a greater public awareness on the appropriate use of accident and emergency services.  The <Col N="965" /> number of sub-acute beds, both for elderly patients and the chronically disabled patients, needs to be supplemented. I am looking into this area with a view to increasing the number of these services available in the Eastern Health Board area.  In addition it is my intention to give greater support to the community ward initiative undertaken by the Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>The solution to difficulties in the accident and emergency services involves a greater degree of co-operation between the different areas of the health services. I would like to see people referred to general practitioners where appropriate. Our acute hospitals need to refocus their activities to a greater degree in relation to bed utilisation having regard to admission and discharge procedures. I am concerned also that the acute hospitals need the back-up of more sub-acute facilities so as to enable them meet the needs placed upon them.  I am confident that through a combination of the measures proposed together with the co-operation of those seeking the service and those providing the service, that the pressures in accident and emergency departments can be eased significantly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Between 1992-94 my Department centrally negotiated with the VHI board a level of reimbursement for health agencies in respect of VHI subscribers.  This figure was allocated among these agencies by my Department. During the three years period of the cash limit system the gross claims made by health boards to VHI amounted to £63.594 million while the cash limited amount paid was £59.488 <Col N="966" /> million.  The shortfall in payment to each health board was as follows: Eastern Health Board, £0.326 million; Midland Health Board, £0.026 million; Mid-Western Health Board, £0.462 million; North-Eastern Health Board, £0.357 million; North-Western Health Board, £0.289 million; South-Eastern Health Board, £0.640 million; Southern Health Board, £1.319 million and Western Health Board, £0.687 million.</P>
      <P>The increase in VHI income for health boards during the period 1992-93-1994-95 was £8.6 million or 58 per cent.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that agencies are aware that income from VHI should be treated no differently from allocations made by my Department; they must control activity within the overall level of expenditure, including VHI income, available to them.  As the basis for the system was notified to agencies there is no question of their being compensated.</P>
      <P>The cash limit system was introduced in the context of the revision of eligibility arrangements for hospital services, including the formal designation of public and private beds, provided for in the Health (Amendments) Act, 1991.  The new designation system was intended to provide a structured framework within which individual agencies and VHI could adjust to the new environment over a period of time, which was assumed to be over a three year period ending in 1994-95.  A cash limit was intended to ensure that the resulting financial implications for VHI did not compromise the attractiveness of private health insurance to the public or impair VHI in maintaining solvency margins.  This followed on from a commitment in the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> that the Government would be sensitive to the need to ensure that the public hospital system should cater adequately for the requirements of private patients and that the role of voluntary health insurance should not be diminished in any way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of my Department's new regulatory role in the operation of <Col N="967" /> the EU Single Market in health insurance it is no longer possible to continue a centralised negotiating system. Reimbursement arrangements between VHI, or any other insurer, and the public agencies are now the subject of directly negotiated agreements between the parties concerned.</P>

The back-up and support of the centre would continue to be available to any such general practitioners.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> On 7 September 1995 Positive Action wrote to me to advise me that their members would not contemplate any scheme which might be abandoned by a future Government and that unless an admission of liability and draft heads of a Bill covering health care and tribunal issues were forthcoming within two weeks that negotiations would be at an end.</P>
      <P>I wrote to Positive Action on 14 September 1995 and pointed out that through ongoing discussions and consultation that considerable advances had been made in meeting the complex and wide ranging needs of Positive Action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my letter of 14 September, I also stated that I believed that through continuing discussions, considerable further progress could be made in resolving many of the outstanding issues and that this would require a realistic understanding and acceptance of each others position.  I concluded my letter by stating that I hoped that despite the sentiments expressed in Positive Action's letter of 7 September 1995, that we could find a way to work together for the benefit of their organisation's members. Positive Action responded to my letter by letter dated 15 September 1995, pointing out that their absolute priority was a statutory tribunal which would include statutory health care and counselling guarantees and an admission of liability and stating that unless they received a commitment that a scheme of <Col N="969" /> compensation would be established, which is entrenched in law, that they saw no point in further discussions.</P>
    <P>I again wrote to Positive Action on 18 October 1995, stating that I hoped that my offer as set out in my letter of 14 September 1994, to hold further discussions to resolve outstanding issues would be taken up.  On 20 October 1995, Positive Action responded to my letter of 18 October 1995, indicating that they would be pleased to meet with me.  A meeting will be arranged as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The Child Care Act does not provide for the establishment of an independent national inspectorate of children's residential centres.</P>
      <P>Under the Act, responsibility for monitoring standards in children's residential centres operated by voluntary bodies rests with the relevant health boards while responsibility for monitoring standards in centres run by health boards rests with the Department of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> To facilitate the commencement of Parts III to VI of the Child Care Act on 31 October, I recently made new regulations in relation to the placement of children in residential care by health boards.  The new regulations, the Child Care (Placement of Children in Residential Care) Regulations, 1995, will also come into force on 31 October.</P>
    <P>The regulations will require health boards to satisfy themselves as to the standards that obtain in children's residential centres.  Health boards will be required, among other matters, to satisfy themselves that appropriate standards, care practices and operational policies are operated in residential centres catering for children placed by the boards.  The regulations also require health boards to visit, supervise and review children in their care on a more systematic basis than before.</P>
    <P>The new regulations also empower an authorised officer of the health board to enter and inspect a children's residential centre as required and to take the necessary action to ensure compliance with the regulations.  Furthermore, the regulations permit the inspection, by a person acting on behalf of the Minister for Health, of the practices and procedures operated by a health board in relation to the provision of residential care services.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the new regulations will go a long way towards ensuring high standards of care in all children's residential centres and in promoting and protecting the welfare of children in residential care.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> At present under the rules of the Voluntary Health Insurance <Col N="971" /> Board, health care benefit for hospital charges, including psychiatric hospitals, is payable for members up to a limit of 180 days in a subscription year.  There are no proposals before my Department from the Voluntary Health Insurance Board to reduce the benefits it currently provides in relation to hospital charges for its members who are suffering from illnesses of a psychiatric nature.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that it was originally proposed under the draft Health Insurance Regulations circulated by my Department that the minimum level of benefit for cover in a psychiatric hospital would be 40 days in a year. However, having had regard to the representations made to me about this proposal, I have decided that this level of minimum cover should be enhanced. The proposed regulatory framework for the health insurance business in this country is to be implemented on foot of the Third EC Non-Life Insurance Directive and officials of my Department are at present discussing the framework with the EU Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to circulate in the Official Report a table setting out details of the number of alleged cases of child abuse reported to each health board in 1993 and the number of such cases where abuse was confirmed.  The total number of reports received by health boards in 1993 was 4,110 of which abuse was confirmed in 1,609 cases.  Preliminary figures for 1994 indicate that over 4,600 reports were received but it <Col N="972" /> will be some time yet before the number of cases of confirmed abuse is known.</P>
      <P>As regards the detailed arrangements for pursuing allegations of child abuse, the procedures followed by the health boards are in accordance with the guidelines issued by my Department in 1987. In addition, I recently launched guidelines for the &ldquo;Notification of Suspected cases of Child Abuse between Health Boards and Gardaí&rdquo; which amend the 1987 guidelines in relation to the circumstances in which the health boards and the Garda are to notify suspected cases of child abuse to each other and in relation to the consultations that should take place between both agencies following a notification.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that all of the boards are taking steps to improve existing arrangements for the assessment and management of child abuse cases, with particular importance being attached to co-operation and co-ordination between the hospital and community care services of the health services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Michael Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I take the Deputy's reference to the new health regulations to mean the regulations to be made pursuant to the Health Insurance Act, 1994.  This extensive and complex combination of regulations will provide for the registration of health insurance undertakings, open enrolment, lifetime cover, minimum benefits and risk equalisation.</P>
      <P>Because of their technical and wide ranging nature my Department, in March last, circulated the regulations in draft form to interested parties, of whom there are many, and furthered the consultative process by meeting those bodies which wished to discuss the regulations.  This comprehensive process has been completed and the issues raised are being considered in the context of the finalisation of the proposed regulations.  Furthermore, as the regulatory arrangements are being introduced as a consequence of the implementation of the EU's Third Non-Life Insurance Directive, my Department is in contact with the European Commission in relation to the regulatory framework including the enhancement of psychiatric cover under the minimum benefit regulations.</P>
      <P>While I cannot give a specific date on which the regulations will be ready to be signed by me, I can state that a great proportion of the preparatory work has been completed and I am anxious to sign them at the earliest possible date.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The information requested by the Deputy is not available. The difficulty in obtaining the information is that the death certificate issued by a medical practitioner may list the cause of death by clinical condition, rather than by the circumstances leading to the death.  I am aware of various estimates of the number of deaths related to the misuse of drugs, but for the reasons given these cannot be validated.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there are waiting lists for treatment in all of the Eastern Health Board's Community Drug Centres and at the Drug Treatment Centre, Pearse Street.  The Eastern Health Board has under consideration proposals for the immediate expansion of services to reduce these waiting lists and to provide appropriate treatment to all who need it.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I presume the Deputy is referring to an article which appeared in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i> on 20 February <Col N="982" /> 1995.  The article quoted an 18 per cent increase in the GMS drugs bill for November 1994.  The 18 per cent mentioned was not an annual increase but referred specifically to a November 1994 increase as against a November 1993 figure.</P>
      <P>Simple comparisons of expenditure by the General Medical Services (Payments) Board between one year and another should be treated with caution as any reasonable analysis must take account of a variety of issues such as morbidity factors, number of people covered, number of prescribing days and level of submission of claims by pharmacists.</P>
      <P>My Department and the health boards continuously monitor, with the support of the General Medical Services (Payments) Board, expenditure on medicines available under the various schemes and I am satisfied that the strategies adopted to contain the cost of medicines in the General Medical Services are operating reasonably well.  In particular, the indicative drug target scheme operated by general practitioners is leading to more rational and cost effective prescribing by doctors. Since the introduction of this scheme the rise in the ingredient cost of medicines has dropped from an annual average of 11 per cent to an annual average rise of 4 per cent in the past two years.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Persons requiring orthodontic treatment are assessed by health boards in accordance with guidelines issued by my Department and <Col N="983" /> placed on waiting lists according to the severity of their treatment need.  The cases of greatest need are placed in category A or category B and have priority over persons in category C.</P>
      <P>The health board orthodontic services are currently being developed in accordance with the dental health action plan. The action plan provides for a consultant led orthdontic service in each health board.  Most health boards now have a consultant in place and are consolidating and extending their orthodontics services under the overall direction and supervision of the consultant.</P>
      <P>In addition to his or her own direct clinical involvement, each consultant is required to organise and co-ordinate training for health board dentists in the provision of orthodontic treatment.  This will achieve a high level of service at a high standard.</P>
      <P>At present, there is an indefinite waiting period for category C patients. While it will be some time before treatment will be available to category C cases, the planned development of the orthodontic service and the availability of more dentists trained in orthodontics will lead to a significant improvement in the availability of service.  The Deputy will appreciate that there is a necessary limit to the additional resources which can be invested each year in this and other services which are not sufficient to meet the demand.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The recommendation made by the group relationship corporate status was that the relationship between the VHI and the Minister for Health <Col N="984" /> should be that between a commerical corporate entity and a 100 per cent shareholder.  It did not recommend that the VHI be established as a private limited company independent of my Department.</P>
      <P>The group's other recommendations included the appointment of a chief executive with extensive commercial experience and an increase in the number of board members so that its composition should reflect the balance of skills and expertise appropriate for the board of a major commercial insurance company with financial, actuarial and marketing expertise as well as expertise in the health care industry.  The group described its recommendation regarding the appointment of a chief executive as the single most important measure needed to enable the VHI to operate effectively to a commercial mandate.</P>
      <P>A chief executive with extensive experience in the insurance sector has been appointed to the VHI.  I am proposing to shortly introduce legislative proposals for consideration by the House which will provide for the number of persons on the board to be increased.</P>
      <P>In parallel with these measures, arrangements are well in hand to restructure the top level management in the VHI and a number of new senior positions were recently publicly advertised and are in the process of being filled.</P>
      <P>I consider that a change in the corporate status of the VHI, while it would remain 100 per cent State owned, should be further explored.  I am of the opinion that this would be most appropriately and effectively undertaken when the proposed new arrangements to enhance the expertise of the VHI at board and top management level have been effected.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The report on the development of the psychiatric services, <i>Planning For The Future,</i> which was published in 1984 and which has been accepted by successive Governments, recommended that the emphasis on the management of alcohol and other substance misuse should be on community based intervention rather than in-patient treatment.  In line with this recommendation, health boards, which are responsible in the first instance for the delivery of mental health services, are developing comprehensive community based addiction treatment services. Residential treatment for the small number of patients with special needs who do not respond to out-patient treatment programmes continues to be available at the boards' psychiatric hospitals.</P>
      <P>The Aiséirí and Cuan Mhuire centres are private residential treatment facilities for persons suffering from alcohol and other substance misuse and have already been approved for financial assistance from statutory agencies in 1995.</P>
      <P>The provision of support is a matter for the health boards to adjudicate on. They recognise the role played by voluntary or private centres in the treatment of persons with alcohol related problems and are continually considering ways in which the services provided by them might integrate with health board services.  The priority for the boards, however, must be the continued development of community based services and any consideration of support for voluntary or private treatment facilities must be viewed in the light of this priority.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> A programme for infrastructural development of trainer practices has been agreed with the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish College of General Practitioners and commenced in 1994.  At the commencement of the programme in 1994, health boards were requested to assist approved trainer practices with grants <Col N="987" /> of up to £10,000.  Funding of grants in 1994 was arranged on the basis of 50 per cent from health boards through the indicative drug target savings scheme and 50 per cent from the general practice development fund in the Department. Grants to trainer practices are being continued in 1995 at the same level as last year on the basis of 75 per cent from the indicative drug target savings scheme and 25 per cent from the general practice development fund.</P>
      <P>The Department keeps in close touch with the health boards in relation to general practice developments and I am satisfied that the method of funding trainer grants in 1995 has not adversely affected boards in progressing other proposals for the development of general practitioner services.</P>

    <P>Section 26 empowers a court to appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i> for a child who is the subject of care proceeings under Part III or IV of the legislation where the court is satisfied that this is necessary in the interests of the child.

    <P>I should explain that, in framing the provision, full regard was had to the varying circumstances of the cases likely to come before the court and to the need to ensure that the court would have a wide discretion in relation to the appointment of a guardian <i>ad litem</i> for the child in appropriate cases.  It was never envisaged that such appointments would be confined to staff of a particular organisation or to members of a particular professional group.</P>

Since 1992 special funding has been allocated to the board each year for the development of services for drug misusers.  I am aware that the misuse of drugs is a growing problem and that there are waiting lists for treatment at all treatment centres.</P>
      <P>The extension of the present level of services in the Eastern Health Board is a priority.  Before the end of the year, the board will have opened two further community drug centres, which will operate in addition to the three community drug centres at Baggot Street, Amiens Street and Ballyfermot and the Drug Treatment Centre in Pearse Street.  In addition, the board will continue with the development of further services around the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>On Thursday, 19 October last, I opened a new ten bed detoxification unit at Cherry Orchard Hospital, which doubles the number of detoxification beds available in Dublin.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I have no proposals to introduce a hospital workers' charter.  I am, however, aware of the need to offer adequate safeguards against physical violence to staff working in the health service.  This need is addressed through a variety of measures being taken to give effect to the obligations placed on health agencies under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.  To this end, all health service employers have been advised of their obligations under legislation and have been circulated with the &ldquo;Report of the Advisory Committee on the Health Services Sector to the Health and Safety Authority&rdquo; and &ldquo;Guidance Notes on Violence to Staff in the Health Services Sector&rdquo; published by the Health and Safety Authority.</P>
      <P>This commitment to staff safety has been supported through the allocation of earmarked funds for health and safety measures in recent years.  In the current year, the Department has allocated a total of £2.8 million to health agencies to specifically address occupational health and safety issues.  All agencies were asked, in this context, to attach particular priority to addressing aggressive or violent behaviour towards health service staff.  This funding has been used, <i>inter alia</i>, to fund control and restraint training, improved security systems and panic-alarms systems for those individuals considered most at risk, including those working in accident and emergency units, working with psychiatric patients and working in the community. I would hope to continue to make progress on this front in 1996.  In addition to this, schemes covering payments during absences from work arising from serious physical assaults have been agreed for relevant grades in the health boards, public voluntary hospitals and joint board hospitals.  I am satisfied that the measures currently in place, and planned, offer a satisfactory framework to ensure for staff in the health services a safe and healthy working environment.</P>

      <P>In so far as the Eastern Health Board's response to the problem of heroin addiction is concerned, it is proposed, in line with the recommendations in the strategy, to provide a network of community drug centres, which will provide a range of clinical services, counselling and support.  At present, three such centres are in operation.  I expect that two further centres will open before the end of the year.  Other plans for treatment at a community level include the development of additional community drug centres, the provision of a mobile treatment unit, the involvement of more general practitioners in the care of drug misusers and the development of community drug teams.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Information is not readily available on the number of non-EU visitors to Ireland in 1993, 1994 and to date in 1995 who were hospitalised for medical and surgical treatments in each health board area.  My Department has contacted health boards and hospitals to ascertain if the information sought by the Deputy is available and I will reply directly to the Deputy on this issue.</P>
      <P>I should point out, however, that non-EU visitors to Ireland have no entitlement to health services in Ireland.  Such visitors, therefore, are liable either themselves or through their travel insurance for the full economic cost of any treatment they receive.  In all cases hospitals and health boards apply the appropriate charge.  Health boards have the discretion to provide urgent necessary treatment at a reduced charge or without charge, as deemed appropriate by the board, where application of the full economic charge would cause undue hardship.  This is to ensure that no visitor to Ireland, regardless of nationality, is denied essential medical treatment due to inability to pay.</P>

These include key sections dealing with the protection of children in emergencies, care proceedings and the powers and duties of health boards in relation to children in their care.  These provisions will greatly strengthen the powers of the courts, the health boards and the gardaí to intervene to protect children from abuse and neglect.</P>
      <P>I have also signed new regulations in relation to the placement of children in foster care, residential care and the placement of children with relatives. The three new sets of regulations will provide the health boards with a range of options in looking after children in their care.  The new regulations will also come into force on 31 October.</P>
      <P>Eighteen sections of the Act remain to be implemented.  These deal with the supervision of pre-schools and the registration of children's residential centres. It is my intention to bring these provisions into operation during 1996.</P>

      <P>I advised all health boards to ensure that the spirit of the former social welfare schemes continues to be maintained and that commitments made to voluntary organisations by social welfare be honoured.  I also instructed health boards to advise all local voluntary groups in their functional area of the new procedures for applying for funding under these schemes.  My Department also contacted the various umbrella bodies for people with disabilities concerning the new arrangements.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in my statement to the Dáil on 5 October 1995, the Government intends to erect a modest but distinctive memorial as a permanent national famine commemoration monument.  An advertisement seeking suggestions from the general public for the best location for the memorial was placed in the national press on 4 August last.  There has been an excellent response to the advertisement. A wide range of locations has been suggested, mostly in the west and south.</P>
      <P>The Famine Commemoration Committee is considering the proposals at the moment and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement of the location before Christmas.</P>

      <P>&mdash;North Meath Parish Development Association</P>
      <P>&mdash;Navan Travellers' Workshop.</P>

      <P>On 16 February, 1995 the Minister for European Affairs and Local Development, Deputy Gay Mitchell announced the new partnership area of Rialto &mdash; Kilmainham &mdash; Bluebell &mdash; Inchicore under the operational programme for local urban and rural development.  On 2 March 1995 the Minister announced another new partnership area of Drimnagh &mdash; Crumlin &mdash; Kimmage &mdash; Walkinstown &mdash; Perrystown under the programme.</P>
      <P>The evaluation of local development plans and the allocations of funds is being undertaken by Area Development Management Ltd., the intermediary for the management of the element of the operational programme which involves integrated development of designated disadvantaged and other areas.</P>

The purpose of the scheme is to renew and update the tourist amenities and facilities in a certain limited number of seaside resorts.

    <P>Figures of income tax payments by public servants and private sector employees are included in the figure given for PAYE.  Statistics are not available which would enable these figures to be separately identified.</P>
    <P>The estimated income tax liability of proprietary directors for the income tax year 1992/93, the latest year for which the relevant statistics are available, was £294.1 million or 10.9 per cent of the estimated total income tax liability under PAYE for that year.</P>
    <P>The estimated additional yield to income tax in 1994 under the tax amnesty is not included in the figures supplied.  The tax amnesty is a separate category in the budget tables and it accounted for an estimated yield of £249 million, including some £5 million in PRSI and levies.</P>
    <P>In considering the table, it should be borne in mind that the PAYE sector accounts for the vast majority of taxpayers.</P>
    <P> (1)  The figure for PAYE covers more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries.  It includes tax paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well as tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as <Col N="1015" /> rent and other investment income.  It also includes the tax paid under PAYE on the income from employment of self-employed individuals, including farmers.</P>
    <P>(2)  This heading includes tax paid on income from trades and professions, including farming, together with tax paid on other income such as rent and other investment income.  The figures also include relatively small amounts of tax resulting from direct assessments under Schedule E on employees.  This tax is collected with tax from the self-employed and is not separately identified. It also includes withholding tax on professional fees. </P>

      <P>I should say that the Revenue Commissioners have no function with regard to road taxation.  This is an operational matter for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment.  In that respect I should refer you to a reply which he gave on 5 October 1995, in which he indicated that he has no power to waive arrears of road tax.</P>
      <P>As regards information about the obligation to licence a vehicle at the time of registration, in completing the application form for vehicle registration tax purpose, a person registering a vehicle also completes, in part, the application form for first licensing, i.e. road tax, of the vehicle.  Furthermore the reverse of this form states that liability for road tax arises from the month of registration of the vehicle.</P>
      <P>As regards retrospection, the exemption introduced in the Finance Act, 1995, requires that a declaration be made to the relevant licensing authority within seven days of the registration of the vehicle, to the effect that the vehicle has not been used and will not be used in a public place without first making application to that licensing authority for a vehicle duty licence; a road tax disc.  Consequently the backdating of the exemption does not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The charter of rights for hospital patients conveys the right of patients to complain about any aspect of hospital service, to have the complaint investigated and to be informed of the outcome as soon as possible.  Where the complaint is not resolved to the patient's satisfaction, he/she has the right to have the matter referred to the hospital's complaints committee.</P>
      <P>Under the charter all hospitals are required to have detailed complaints procedures in place and those should be publicised prominently throughtout the hospital.  Such procedures do not prejudice an individual's statutory rights to complain to the Ombudsman, the Medical Council or An Bord Altranais.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are no specific procedures in place to investigate allegations of sexual abuse of patients by members of staff. However, in the case of health board hospitals, where allegations of misconduct of any nature or unfitness to hold office are made against a member of staff, the Health Act, 1970, makes provision for the suspension of that staff member while the alleged misconduct or unfitness is being inquired into and any disciplinary action to be taken in that regard is being determined.  There is also provision in that legislation for the removal of staff on the grounds of misconduct or unfitness.  The question <Col N="1021" /> of allegations of misconduct against medical consultant staff falls to be dealt with under disciplinary and complaints procedures attaching to the Consultants' Contract Documents, 1991.</P>
    <P>I must point out that voluntary hospitals are not subject to the provisions of the Health Act, 1970.  Instead, it is a matter for the hospital management board and owners to deal with such issues as they see fit.  However, I would expect that all voluntary hospitals would have appropriate procedures to investigate and deal with any allegation of misconduct against staff, including sexual abuse, in a thorough manner.</P>
    <P>In view of recent events, I propose to review the existing arrangements in all hospitals to ensure that adequate procedures are in place for the investigation and handling of all serious complaints against staff members.</P>

Capital funding of £350,000 has also been provided to support the above mentioned developments.</P>

    <P>The above figures do not take account of the additional 243 residential places provided in 1995.  This data reflects the information which is now available to the health boards from the national mental handicap database. Initial information from the database is currently being submitted to my Department where the validation process will be continued in conjunction with the health boards.  It is hoped to have this process completed towards the end of the year.  We will then be in a position to differentiate more accurately between current and future needs, both of which are reflected in the information given to the Deputy.  This will enable funding requirements to be estimated more accurately.</P>
    <P>In regard to people with a physical or sensory disability detailed information on waiting lists for residential care is not routinely collected by my Department. However, in the context of the review group report on physical and sensory disability this information is being collected in order to ascertain current and future residential care needs.  The review group is due to report by the end of this year and one of its recommendations will be the establishment of a comprehensive database to facilitate service planning.</P>

      <P>The Child Care Act, 1991, provides for the introduction of a system for the inspection and supervision by health boards of pre-school services for children.  I intend to bring the relevant provisions of the Act into operation during 1996.  This will involve the introduction of regulations for the purpose of securing the health, safety and welfare and promoting the development of children attending pre-school services.  In advance of the introduction of the regulations, it is intended that there will be full consultation by my Department with the relevant agencies and bodies concerned with pre-school services.</P>
      <P>At this stage it is not possible to give a firm estimate of the costs involved but it is likely to be in excess of £1 million per annum.  Some of these costs will be offset by the income from annual fees to be paid to the health boards by persons carrying on pre-school services towards the cost of the inspections under the Act.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 to 100, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>There is a commitment in the policy document, <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to bring forward a programme to replace existing incinerators for the disposal of clinical and hospital waste with new non-incineration technologies.  My Department proposes to implement this commitment by arranging for tenders to be invited from specialist waste disposal contractors for the provision of a collection and non-incineration disposal service. The tendering process will be in accordance with the EU tendering procedures for public procurement.  Consultations with the health agencies are continuing and contract documentation is in course of preparation.</P>
      <P>There are 41 publicly funded acute hospitals below the 200 in-patient beds requirement for investigation and licensing by the Environmental Protection Agency.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Entitlement to health services in Ireland is based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, are unable without undue hardship to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Income guidelines are available to assist chief executive officers in the determination of a person's eligibility and these guidelines are revised annually in line with the consumer price index.  These guidelines are higher for persons aged 66-79 and higher again for those aged 80 and over.  However, these guidelines are not statutorily binding <Col N="1031" /> and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, that person may still be awarded a medical card if the chief executive officer considers the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify it.</P>
    <P>In view of this special provision, it is not justifiable to extend an automatic entitlement to a medical card to all citizens aged 90 and over without any reference to their means, particularly in view of the many areas of pressing need in the health services and the limited resources available to meet them.</P>
    <P>Every person who is in genuine need of a medical card must receive one and I am satisfied the health boards give sympathetic consideration to applications made on the grounds of special medical needs.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I presume the Deputy is referring to community care for former patients of our psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the study group on the development of our psychiatric services &mdash;&ldquo;Planning for the Future&rdquo;&mdash; which was published in 1984 and which has been accepted by successive Governments, recommended a shift in the delivery of services for those with mental illness from an institutional to a community based service.  In line with the recommendations of the report, health boards, which are responsible for the delivery of psychiatric services, are developing comprehensive community based services.  Older psychiatric hospitals are being replaced by acute psychiatric units attached to general hospitals while day hospitals, day <Col N="1032" /> centres and community residential accommodation are also being provided.</P>
    <P>Patients who have lived in a hospital for some years cannot readily adapt to community living.  Rehabilitation prior to discharge from hospital, which is concerned with returning skills to a person who has had them impaired by mental illness, is therefore essential to enable them to live in the community.  Special rehabilitation wards for this purpose are a feature of our psychiatric hospitals. Patients may be transferred to low support, medium support or high support community residences following assessment and rehabilitation where they receive care and support of a standard normally provided in a hospital.  All community residences are fully integrated with other components of the psychiatric services, such as day facilities, sheltered workshops and other support facilities, all of which enable the patient to enjoy normal community living.</P>
    <P>I am fully satisfied that patients are not discharged to community living without first undergoing a rigorous pre-discharge assessment, without being fully prepared for community living, and that the necessary level of supervision and support is available to them.</P>

      <P>As part of health service personnel policy, each health agency has been asked to have due regard to the Government's commitment to the disabled when recruiting staff.  In cases where the quota has not been achieved agencies have been urged to make every effort to secure an appropriate increase in the numbers of disabled persons employed, consistent with operational and overall employment control requirements.</P>
      <P>I consider that further progress towards securing an increase in the number of persons with disability employed may be best addressed in the context of an effective equal opportunities policy.  Health agencies have been involved in reviewing their employment practices with this in mind. It is the intention that my Department, in consultation with representatives of management in the various agencies, will consider the overall position to determine what further action may be required to complement measures already adopted by employers.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The net non capital allocation per head of population in respect of each health board area for the year 1994 is set out in the following table.  The figures quoted are in respect of direct expenditure by each health board, the relevant amount spent by public voluntary hospitals and mental handicap agencies and the G.M.S. (Payments) Board on behalf of each board.  The figures are based on the 1991 census of population.</P>
      <P>I point out that expenditure per head of population is an unweighted average which does not take account of a number of important demographic and geographic factors.  The cost of health care in each region is also influenced by other factors such as access to higher specialities, density of population and, in particular, the present stage of development of the services.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The statement by the chairman of the National Rehabilitation Board referred to by the Deputy was based, I understand, on a reference in that organisation's submission in October 1994 to the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.  The Deputy will recall that the commission was established in December 1993 to advise the Government on practical measures necessary to ensure that people with a disability can exercise their rights to participate, to the fullest extent of their potential, in economic, social and cultural life; to examine the current situation of people with a disability and the organisation and adequacy of existing services both public and voluntary to meet their needs; and to make recommendations setting out necessary changes in legislation, policies, organisation, practices and structures to ensure that the needs of people with disabilities are met in a cohesive, comprehensive and cost effective way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission was asked to report <Col N="1037" /> to the Government within a period of two years from the date of its establishment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Treatment for those diagnosed positive for hepatitis C, is being provided at six designated hospitals: Beaumont Hospital, Dublin; Mater Hospital, Dublin; St. James's Hospital, Dublin; St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin; Cork University Hospital; and University College Hospital, Galway.</P>
      <P>A counselling service is available on a nationwide basis.  The counselling service is currently being reviewed to ensure that the service is responsible to the great variety of needs of those diagnosed positive for hepatitis C.  All the services being provided in the public hospital system at present are being provided on a statutory basis under the Health Acts.  Similarly, the persons availing of these services are exercising their statutory rights to free public hospital services under the Health Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have assured Positive Action that those services currently in place under the Health Acts for those diagnosed positive for hepatitis C will remain as long as required.  In addition, I have made a number of substantial proposals in respect of the long-term health care needs of those who have contracted hepatitis C.  These include: general practitioner services free of charge for all those who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion, anti D or another blood product.  This will require an amendment of the Health Act; a specific provision in the Book of Estimates in respect of the funding of <Col N="1043" /> hospital and counselling services for those who have contracted hepatitis C. This would allow any change in the funding of these services to be subject to detailed scrutiny by the Oireachtas; the establishment and funding of a special programme of research on hepatitis C by the Health Research Board, HRB; and the establishment of a statutory consultative council to advise the Minister for Health on matters relating to hepatitis C.  The membership of the consultative council, which will be appointed by the Minister for Health, will include two persons nominated by Positive Action.</P>
    <P>The policy document, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, published in December 1994, included a commitment to fair compensation for women infected by the hepatitis C virus from anti D.  The Government decided in April last to establish, as a matter of urgency, a tribunal which will assess compensation on an <i>ex-gratia</i> basis in respect of anti D recipients who are infected with hepatitis C antibodies-virus and the partners and children of these women who are also infected with hepatitis C antibodies-virus. I met this commitment when I published the scheme for a compensation tribunal, which has been approved by Government.</P>
    <P>Among the many aspects of the scheme are that proceedings before the tribunal will be informal and private; negligence need not be proved; the burden of proof will be on the balance of probabilities; and there is preservation of a right of action should a claimant decide not to accept an award.  Awards from the tribunal will be made according to the principles of the law of tort either on a lump sum basis or on a provisional basis with a right to make a further claim in the event of a serious deterioration in the claimants health in the future.</P>
    <P>The scheme is designed specifically to provide compensation, at the earliest possible date for those who contracted hepatitis C from the use of Human Immunoglobulin, anti D, while retaining <Col N="1044" /> an informal and flexible approach to do justice to the great variety of circumstances and conditions of claimants.  The tribunal will be chaired by the Honourable Mr. Justice Egan, Judge of the Supreme Court, and I hope to be in a position to establish it in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122, 123, 124, 125 and 126 together.</P>
      <P>The rate support grant is paid to local authorities each year to replace, in part, the income from rates formerly applicable to domestic dwellings, agricultural land and Government property.  The initial method of calculating the grant reflected that income, which varied from local authority to local authority because of differences in valuation levels and in the rate poundages determined over the years.  Levels of rate support grant paid to each individual authority have been adjusted over the past decade to take account of structural adjustments in the system of local finance, including in particular, the removal from local authorities of a variety of statutory demands, and the writing off of local loans fund repayments. For reasons such as these, comparisons between the amounts paid in grants in particular years are not a valid indication of the level of State support for particular authorities, or of the rate of increase or decrease in that support in relation to population, inflation or other factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where increased overall allocations for the rate support grant have been made available in the Estimates for a particular year, the additional funds have generally been allocated on a <i>pro <Col N="1055" /> rata</i> basis among all local authorities. However, adjustments have been made in individual cases, particularly in 1994 and 1995, arising from special provisions to reduce debt levels and to deal with other structural problems.</P>
    <P>The grant payments to Kildare County Council for the years 1977-1994 are set out in the following table.</P>

    <P> 1.  In 1982, in line with the recommendations included in the Report on Higher Education in Dublin (1979), the Department of Education acquired a site at Carriglea Park, Dún Laoghaire for a new regional technical college.  The project, which was deferred in 1987, was given the go-ahead by the Government <Col N="1072" /> on 26 July 1995.  This decision was announced by the Minister for Education on the same day.  The first phase is estimated to cost £4.5 million.</P>
    <P>2.  The Minister for Education mentioned in her comments on developments relating to Autistic children that it was decided to avail of the offer of the Daughters of Charity to relocate two schools for emotionally disturbed children which were originally located at Ballyowen, Lucan and Blanchardstown, County Dublin to one centre in vacant accommodation on the campus of the Daughters of Charity at Beechpark, Stillorgan, County Dublin.</P>
    <P>3.  In June 1995, the Minister of State at the Department of Education, Deputy Allen, announced the establishment of a special project for disadvantaged young people in Bishopstown, Cork City.  Funding for the project in 1995 is £8,000. </P>

      <P>I am aware of the difficulties to which the Deputy refers.  My Department provides school transport for children attending special schools and classes on either scheduled or special services.  However, in some cases, this is not feasible due to particular circumstances such as excessive cost, too long a distance, or the inability of a child to avail of the service because of the nature of the disability.  In such cases, my Department offers a grant to <Col N="1075" /> the parents to help defray the cost of private transport arrangements.  The amount payable depends on the distance involved and the level of attendance of the pupil.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately it is not possible, at present, to facilitate the pupil in question with a transport service because of the severe inconvenience such an extension would cause to pupils on the existing service.  However, I have requested my Department's transport agents, Bus Éireann, to investigate whether the existing service could be restructured in order to facilitate this particular child and minimise the inconvenience to the other children on the route.  In the meantime, my Department has sanctioned an annual transport grant to the parents of the child in question.</P>

      <P>The intention of revising the structure and content of the senior cycle from September 1995 was conveyed to school authorities in 1993.</P>
      <P>In May 1995, as a result of action taken by the Association of Secondary Teachers, Ireland, ASTI, and the Teachers' Union of Ireland.  TUI, it appeared that it would not be possible to provide for the inservice education of teachers necessary for the successful introduction of the new programmes. Accordingly, on 31 May 1995, I informed the education partners and schools that it would be necessary to postpone the introduction of the senior cycle changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of progress in negotiations with the ASTI and the TUI during the <Col N="1081" /> summer of this year and following consultations between my Department and the representative associations of school authorities, teachers, parents and other interested parties on the practical aspects of the matter, it was agreed that the reforms would commence in September 1995.  This decision was conveyed to schools, at the earliest opportunity, on 8 August 1995.</P>
    <P>There was an urgency about the introduction of the revised syllabuses in 1995 in the subjects in question because the former syllabuses had become out-moded and because that group of subjects represented the first phase in a general revision of the senior cycle programme to be implemented over a period of years.  Deferral this year could have had the effect of postponing the whole phasing process.  I was, therefore, anxious to proceed with the reforms that had been planned for this year but did not decide to do so until I had satisfied myself through consultations with the parties concerned that this would be possible and practical.</P>
    <P>When I announced my decision to proceed with the reforms, some schools and parents informed me that they had purchased textbooks based on the former syllabuses.  The Irish Educational Publishers' Association subsequently announced that its members would be prepared to exchange these books, provided they had been maintained in mint condition, for books for the new syllabuses.</P>

I do not consider that the allocation of scarce staff resources in order to abstract the information sought by the Deputy, which would require the scrutiny of all these decrees, together with any ancillary orders, would be justified.

      <P>On 15 May 1995, I announced the setting up of the WEB, Working to Enhance Blanchardstown, project, a community based initiative aimed at targeting young people at risk in areas of disadvantage and attempting to divert them away from a life of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other community based youth diversion projects are already successfully established in Killinarden, Tallaght, County Dublin, Ronanstown, Clondalkin, County Dublin, Moyross in Limerick and Holyhill/Knocknaheeny in Cork.  These projects are in line with the <Col N="1086" /> approach advocated for young offenders in the report on urban crime and disorder.  My Department provides funding, through the Garda Síochána, for the employment of a number of people to co-ordinate the activities of various groups involved in keeping young people at risk actively engaged in sporting and other pursuits and as a contribution towards the cost of these activities.  The sum involved in the Blanchardstown project is £50,000.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with the success of these projects to date, which have led to a significant reduction in crime and vandalism in the project areas.  Their success gives me cause for great hope.</P>
    <P>I understand that neither of the Ministers of State working in my Department has made any such announcement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 161 to 164, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The first I heard of allegations concerning surveillance placed on the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and others was on 24 July 1995, when the Minister himself phoned me about the matter.  He told me that he had received letters containing serious allegations, including an allegation that he himself and others had been placed under surveillance.  He stated that he wished to hand over correspondence on the matter to a senior Garda officer and he asked me if I could arrange to pass on the name of an appropriate Garda officer to meet with him.</P>
      <P>Later that day, I mentioned the matter to the Secretary of my Department who informed me that he had been approached on 17 July by the group chief executive of CIE, whom he knew, and who had given him a copy of a letter dated 16 July addressed to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications which contained various allegations, including the allegation that there was surveillance of the group chief executive, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and the newly appointed chairman of CIE.  I was not aware of this approach until 24 July when I spoke to the Secretary.  The Secretary informed me that the group chief executive was very concerned about the matter generally but, particularly, the allegation that he was under surveillance. The Secretary also informed me that he had been in contact with the Garda Commissioner on the matter on 18 July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following my conversation with the <Col N="1088" /> Secretary, I contacted the Garda authorities about the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications' request for the name of a senior Garda.  In a conversation with the Minister later that day, I also alerted him to the earlier approach made to my Department by the chief executive of CIE.  Following that discussion, arrangements were then made in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications for their Minister, whose concern about this matter was clear, and seemed to me to be quite understandable in all the circumstances, to see the gardaí himself.  That meeting took place the following day &mdash; on 25 July &mdash; when the Minister was met by a senior Garda officer.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, having examined the information provided, and taking the Garda's investigative role of criminal issues into account, the Garda authorities decided that the Garda Síochána had no investigative role in relation to the particular allegation of surveillance. The Garda issued a press statement to this effect on 6 August.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications was made aware of the Garda decision by letter dated 31 July and a faxed copy of that letter was also forwarded by the Garda authorities, for information, to my office on 2 August.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that, in view of the decision they had taken in relation to the surveillance allegations, no report was prepared by the Garda Síochána on the surveillance issue and that the question of the content and conclusions of such a report does not therefore arise.</P>
    <P>The allegation that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications was the subject of surveillance was one of a number of serious allegations contained in a series of letters received by members of the Government and others between May and August of this year. All the correspondence brought to my attention was referred to the Garda authorities to consider whether a Garda investigation should take place in <Col N="1089" /> relation to the matters raised.  The Commissioner has recently written to the Secretary of my Department seeking further information from a number of Departments to assist him in this regard and that request is currently being attended to.</P>
    <P>The senior Garda officer who met the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications on 25 July was attached to the Crime Branch, Garda Headquarters at that time.  Since then he has been assigned to the Central Detective Unit, Harcourt Square, to take charge of that unit and the investigation of serious crime, as part of a reassignment of a number of officers.  I have no role in decisions regarding the assignment of individual gardaí.  It is a matter for the Garda authorities and I am informed by the Garda authorities that the decision to reassign the officer concerned was not related in any way to the subject matter of these questions.</P>

This building, now includes three courtrooms, a family law suite, judges chambers, office space, consultation rooms, legal practitioners rooms, a detention area and toilets.</P>
      <P>When preparing the plans for the refurbishment of this building, my Department, while seeking to restore a significant historic building, was conscious of the needs of people with disabilities. Consequently the building has proper facilities installed for persons with mobility difficulties.  These include car parking spaces for the disabled, ramps at the main and family law entrances, a toilet for the disabled and a position in the courtrooms from which a witness in a wheelchair can give evidence. All public areas of the courthouse with the exception of part of the court office and the legal representatives room are accessible to persons with mobility difficulties.  However, such persons may conduct all their business on the ground floor as sufficient, suitable facilities have been made available at this level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Rehabilitation Board examined this building and issued a report which included a number of recommendations which were over and above the regulatory requirements, all these with the exception of two items, the installation of a lift and a telephone for the hard-of-hearing, have been or are in the process of being implemented.  A mezzanine floor has been installed as part of the office area. This and the legal practitioners robing room are the only areas not accessible <Col N="1093" /> to all.  To access both these areas would require not one but two lifts as they are not connected.</P>
    <P>These areas represent only 15 per cent of the floor space.  The building is accessible to wheelchair users and complies fully with all the building regulations.</P>
    <P>This building is not only user-friendly for persons with mobility difficulties but also for other disabled persons. Examples of this include the installation of suitable lighting to assist the visually impaired and loop-systems in the courtrooms to assist the hard-of-hearing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>Cohabiting couples and married couples are assessed on the same basis for unemployment assistance. One does not have an advantage over the other in this regard.  The position in relation to the person concerned is that she was paid unemployment assistance at the maximum rate with <Col N="1095" /> effect from 9 August 1993.  While she notified the Department of a change of address in December 1993, her claim was not reviewed at that stage and she continued to receive unemployment assistance at the maximum rate.</P>
      <P>A review of her claim was undertaken in August 1995 which disclosed that she had been cohabiting for some time.  As she was cohabiting with a partner who was in employment, her partner's earnings were assessable against her unemployment assistance entitlement.  As a result, she was assessed with half of his means of £115 per week.  Her weekly entitlement to unemployment assistance was, therefore, reduced to £4.50, that is, the maximum rate of unemployment assistance of £62.50 less means of £57.50, rounded to £58.  The revised rate was payable from a current date i.e. 20 September 1995.  This is also the rate payable to one of a married couple in the same circumstances.  The person concerned has appealed the decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review of the person's entitlement would have resulted in the same outcome, irrespective of whether she had married or continued to cohabit, as cohabiting couples are treated on the same basis as married couples for the purposes of entitlement to unemployment assistance.  The current social welfare arrangements reflect the Supreme Court judgment in the Hyland case in May 1989.  Mr. Hyland challenged provisions in the social welfare code which gave him, as a married man, a lower rate of unemployment assistance than he would have received if he was cohabiting.  The Supreme Court ruled that these provisions were unconstitutional, in view of the State's pledge in the Constitution to guard with special care the institution of marriage and protect it against attack.  Following the Supreme Court judgement, the Government introduced legislation to extend the relevant provisions to cohabiting couples, so that all couples now receive the same treatment under the social <Col N="1096" /> welfare code.  Consequently, I am satisfied that the existing arrangements are not discriminatory against married couples and do not constitute an impediment to marriage.</P>

      <P>The free schemes administered by my Department include free travel, free electricity allowance, free natural gas allowance, free telephone rental allowance and free television licence.  In 1994, a significant concession was introduced which enabled widows and widowers between the ages of 60 and 65 whose late spouses were in receipt of the free schemes to retain entitlement to those schemes notwithstanding their age and subject to satisfying the other conditions. However, where the late spouses had an entitlement to the free schemes but did not, for one reason or another, claim them prior to their death, current arrangements preclude that entitlement being retained by the surviving widows or widowers.</P>
      <P>I accept that there is a case on grounds of equity for changing the current arrangements so as to treat both sets of widows and widowers similarly in relation to this concession.  I will have this matter examined in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <P>The free electricity allowance and the free telephone rental allowance are available to people aged 66 years and over and to certain disabled people under age 66 who are in receipt of a qualifying payment and who are either living alone or would otherwise satisfy the living alone condition In July 1994, the living alone condition was eased to allow pensioners aged 75 or over who were entitled to the allowances to retain them when another person came to live with them.</P>
      <P>Similarly, this concession is also available to couples as soon as the pensioner in receipt of the qualifying payment reaches age 75.  In the case of the spouse of the pensioner reaching age 75 before the pensioners, the current arrangements provide that the allowances in question may be awarded to the spouse subject to satisfying the usual conditions in his or her own right.  This would require the spouse being in receipt of a qualifying payment and having the relevant utility registered in his or her own name.  It would be a matter for the couple themselves to decide on the most appropriate course of action having regard to their own financial and other circumstances.</P>
      <P>The thrust of the Deputy's question is that the free electricity allowance and the free telephone rental allowance should be available to a pensioner under 75 once his or her spouse reaches 75.  An extension of that nature to the allowance in question would have cost implications and could only be considered in the light of available resources.</P>

      <Quest>if he will respond to representations made by Deputy B. Smith on 1 August 1995 on behalf of a person (details supplied) in County Cavan regarding pension entitlements; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The person concerned is a former Catholic priest who spent a number of years in ministry abroad in that capacity and who is seeking credited PRSI contributions for that period for the purpose of qualifying for a social welfare old age (contributory) pension.</P>
      <P>Under current arrangements introduced in 1985, volunteer development workers who go abroad to work in third world countries are provided with social insurance cover on their return by way of credited contributions.  Such workers are excepted from the payment of social insurance contributions and, on their return home, are awarded credited contributions for a period of up to five years in respect of their absence abroad. The credited contributions awarded are reckonable for all benefits and pensions under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>This arrangement applies to volunteer development workers who are on assignment in developing countries with the Agency for Personal Development Overseas or with other recognised sending agencies and who are paid at &ldquo;local&rdquo; rates of pay, usually by the governments of the developing countries.  As the person in question was not on assignment with that agency or other recognised sending agencies, he is not entitled to receive credited contributions in respect of the period of his ministry abroad, and, therefore, he is not entitled to an old age (contributory) pension.  He may, however, qualify for an old age (non-contributory) pension which is subject to a means test and payable from age 66.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no provision for the award of credited contributions in respect of periods of voluntary work abroad other than in the circumstances mentioned above.  The arrangements for the award of credited contributions are kept under regular review in my Department and the question of making such provision <Col N="1099" /> for former religious will be considered in that context.</P>
    <P>I will arrange for a detailed letter to be issued to the Deputy in reply to his representations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the Deputy is referring to the award of credited PRSI contributions in respect of periods spent in voluntary service at home or abroad.</P>
      <P>Under existing arrangements, PRSI contributions may be credited to individuals in certain circumstances and under certain prescribed conditions. The most common of these relate to periods of certified incapacity for work due to illness, during which disability benefit may be payable, and periods of proved unemployment, during which unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance may be payable. However, since 1985 volunteer development workers who go abroad to work in Third World countries are provided with social insurance cover on their return by way of credited contributions. Such workers are excepted from the payment of social insurance contributions and are awarded credited contributions for a period of up to five years in respect of their absence abroad. This arrangement applies to volunteer development workers paid at &ldquo;local&rdquo; rates of pay in the developing countries and the credited contributions awarded to them on their return are reckonable for all benefits and pensions under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no provision for the award of credited PRSI contributions to persons engaged in work of a voluntary nature <Col N="1100" /> at home.  Where the work concerned is insurable and earnings are £30 or more per week, the full PRSI Class A rate applies.  If the earnings are below that figure in any week, the reduced PRSI Class J rate applies which gives cover for occupational injuries benefits only. The voluntary work option administered by my Department allows unemployed people in receipt of either unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance to engage in certain types of voluntary work without losing their unemployment payments.  In those circumstances, credited contributions continue to be awarded in respect of each week of proved unemployment.</P>

      <P>My Department has recently been notified of an additional allocation of 17.53 million ECU for the two human resources initiatives, Adapt and Employment.  The Employment initiative incorporates a number of distinctive strands, including the Horizon programme referred to by the Deputy.  The Commission has indicated that at European Union level an additional 100 million ECU will be assigned to the Horizon programme.  At the level of the individual member state, however, flexibility has been provided to determine how the additional funds will be allocated in line with national priorities.</P>
      <P>The additional funding now notified is for expenditure in the period 1997-99.  Proposals from the different member states of the European Union to indicate their plans for the allocation of the new funds will be put to the Commission in the interim.  In making proposals in this regard I will take fully into account the needs of the most disadvantaged groupings in the labour market, the real potential of pilot projects under the human resources initiatives to contribute to the improvement of their situation and the best application of these additional funds to maximise their impact.</P>

      <P>The operation of the milk quota system in Ireland is biased in favour of small scale milk suppliers. Producers with quotas of less than 30,000 gallons have first priority access to quota becoming available under the temporary leasing and <Col N="1113" /> restructuring schemes and in the distribution of any unused quota at the end of the quota year.</P>
      <P>The 1995 restructuring scheme provides for a subsidy of 75p per gallon to producers with quotas of less than 22,000 gallons towards the purchase price of additional quota.</P>
      <P>The recently introduced provision of ring-fencing milk quota within the disadvantaged areas is also a positive development for smaller scale producers, the majority of whom are situated in these areas.</P>
      <P>I have also introduced a 10 per cent clawback on short-term leases with land in order to discourage such leasing arrangements and to obtain additional quota for the national reserve which is used to benefit smaller scale producers.</P>

      <P>Under the 1991 information technology plan for the Department which covered the five year span 1991-95, the total envisaged expenditure was £14.609 million.  To date the cost of computerisation under the plan has been £15.105 million.  The excess of £0.497 million over the envisaged expenditure was due to increased demands on computerisation because of the introduction of new and changed schemes arising from the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, which occurred after the publication of the information technology plan.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1115" /> The new priority categories for 1996 have been selected with a view to directing the limited reserve quota towards (a) new entrants to sheep farming and (b) small flockowners, the viability of whose enterprise has been jeopardised by the operation of the quota system.  These categories have been drawn up in the light of the recommendations of the Ewe Premium Quota Review Group.</P>
    <P>In view of the limited availability of the reserve quota, it is not possible to grant automatic entitlement to producers with less than 30 ewes.  Such producers can apply for the reserve if they meet the other conditions of the scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 199, 200 and 201 together.</P>
      <P>The following categories of farmers are eligible for an allocation of premium rights from the suckler cow reserve in 1995:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  small scale milk producers whose certified milk quota on 1 April 1995 was less than 25,638 gallons and who became eligible to apply for the suckler cow premium for the first time in 1993 or in subsequent years. Small scale milk producers who were limited to payment on ten cows in <Col N="1118" /> 1992 because of EU regulations may also qualify under this section;</P>
    <P>(b)  producers who applied for the suckler cow premium regularly since 1990, including 1995, but</P>
    <P>(i)  whose eligible suckler cows in 1992 were lower than normal because of exceptional circumstances or</P>
    <P>(ii)  who did not apply for suckler cow premium in 1992;</P>
    <P>(c)  producers who can demonstrate that the operation of the quota limits will jeopardise the viability of their holdings.  Producers who acquired land, formerly used for beef production, on a permanent basis since June 1992, and producers who qualified for suckler cow premium for the first time in 1993, may also qualify under this category.</P>
    <P>The total income of the applicant, including that of his/her spouse/ partner, must not exceed £15,700 per annum.</P>
    <P>(d)  producers who applied for the suckler cow premium for the first time in 1995.  Applicants must be under 35 years of age on 1 January 1995 and must meet the following conditions:</P>
    <P>(i)  If 26 years of age or over but under 35 years of age on 1 January 1994 must</P>
    <P>(a)  have obtained the Teagasc Certificate in farming or a higher qualification; or</P>
    <P>(b)  have at least three years practical experience in farming and have satisfactorily completed a course of training in farming of a minimum duration of 150 hours; or</P>
    <P>have five years practical experience in farming.</P>
    <P>(ii)  If under 26 years of age on 1 January 1994, must have the <Col N="1119" /> requirements set out at (a) or (b) above.</P>
    <P>The total income of the applicant, (including that of his/her spouse/ partner), must not exceed £15,700 per annum.  At least 30 per cent of that total income must be derived from farming.</P>
    <P>These priority categories will be reviewed in 1996 in light of the recommendations of the Suckler Cow Quota Review Group.  However, in view of the limited nature of the reserve it is not possible that farmers with less than ten suckler cows would be automatically entitled to reserve quota to cover suckler cows for which they did not currently have a quota.  Such farmers may, of course, apply for reserve quota provided they meet the other conditions of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The age limit restriction on new entrants in the allocation of suckler cow and ewe premium reserve quota is consistent with limits applied in other schemes operated by my Department and is designed to ensure that scarce reserve quota is targeted at the most deserving categories of farmers.</P>

      <P>The use of concrete slats in animal housing was an innovative development of the early 1970s.  The Department grant aided such houses on the understanding that components such as slats were replaceable elements which would have a useful, if limited, working life.  This has proved to be the case.</P>
      <P>A National Standard IS 249:82 for slats was introduced by the National Standards Authority, then IIRS, now EOLAS based on the best available information at that time.  In 1992 my Department again co-operated in the work leading to the revised Standard IS 249:92 which had become necessary following national and international experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the early slats have come to the end of their useful life.  The need to <Col N="1122" /> ensure the safety of farm families and farm workers as well as animals must be borne in mind by all farmers.  Slats consequently should be checked at regular intervals to ensure that they are structurally sound.  Where this procedure involves tank entry it is imperative that breathing apparatus be used.</P>
    <P>My Department has considered grant aid for the replacement of such slats but after deliberation has decided that it is more important that the limited aid available be directed to farms where no such buildings have been constructed and the need is greatest.</P>

      <P>There are currently no plans to grant aid the generation of power from solar energy in the domestic sector.  Earlier this year I initiated a review of strategy in relation to the further commercial <Col N="1123" /> development of our alternative energy resources, including solar power.  This review is in progress at present.  Among the issues being addressed is the question of the financial or other supports which may be required to further develop our alternative energy resources and the costs and benefits of any such supports.  I expect that following completion of the review, I will be in a position to make an announcement on future strategy in the new year.</P>

The UK authorities have also confirmed that the submarine wrecks which are covered by this particular salvage contract are all outside Irish territorial waters. This particular matter is, therefore, outside the scope of my powers in relation to salvage and wreck.  However, I understand that there are a number of wrecked submarines in Irish waters.  I would stress that these are not the subject of the salvage contract, however we will be drawing the attention of the UK authorities to the need to comply with the terms of the Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act, 1993 in the event that any salvage operations in relation to these vessels were to be contemplated. I will be keeping the matter under review.</P>

      <P>Rollmops are not produced in a canned state in Ireland.  However, there are six Irish companies which include barrelled rollmop herring in their product range.  These companies have received some £403,200 in grant aid under the Operational Programme for Fisheries.  This aid will help to upgrade and expand these companies and will help to ensure their long-term viability. The grant aid will also help to promote and secure supply of rollmop herring in the Irish market.</P>
