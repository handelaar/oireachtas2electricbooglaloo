      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 2, 14 and 15.</P>
      <P>It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) No. 1 shall be decided without debate; (2) the amendments from the Seanad to the Occupiers' Liability Bill, 1994 shall be taken together and decided without debate by one question which shall be put from the Chair; and (3) the statements on No. 14, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion today at 12 noon and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the opening statement of the Tánaiste, of the main spokespersons for the Fianna Fáil party and the Progressive Democrats party, and of each other Member called upon, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; and (ii) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon not less than ten minutes before the statements are due to conclude to make a statement in reply.</P>

      <P>Is the proposal that No. 1 be decided without debate satisfactory?  Agreed.

      <P>Will the Taoiseach give the House a clear indication of when the compellibility of witnesses Bill, which was ready six months ago, will be circulated? In advance of that, will the Taoiseach give an assurance to the House that the Attorney General will appear before the Select Committee on Legislation and Security in the next few weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The compellibility Bill is under active consideration by the Cabinet.  As the House is well aware, there are many difficult legal and constitutional questions to be considered.  We will be in a position to make the Bill available to the House as soon as our decisions have been taken on the issue. In regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, that is a matter for the committee in question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The constitutional issues to which the Taoiseach refers were well thrashed out during 1994, as a number of the members of the Government know.  It seems to those of us on this side of the House that the only possible issue that could hold up the legislation is the difference between the Attorney General and the Taoiseach on whether he can appear before the committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this <Col N="308" /> opportunity to make a statement to the House on the White House Conference for Trade and Investment in Ireland which took place in Washington from 24-26 May.</P>
      <P>I am sure Members of the Oireachtas who took part in the conference will agree that it was a uniquely valuable occasion.  It would have been difficult to believe, even a short while ago, that the entire attention and weight of the Administration of the most powerful country in the world would be put at the disposal of the people of Ireland for a day, yet that is what happened.</P>
      <P>It is too soon yet to count the strictly economic benefits of the conference. That will depend essentially on the quality of our follow-up.  I believe it has initiated a process which will lead over time to significant additional US investment in Ireland and to a substantial reinforcement of the economic ties between the United States and both parts of Ireland.  The role of the conference in promoting awareness of Ireland, and in promoting the culture of dialogue among Irish people, is already beyond question.</P>
      <P>The White House Conference was an unprecendentd personal initiative on the part of the US President which succeeded richly in the objectives it had set itself.  The conference provided a uniquely prestigious showcase for the attractions of Ireland, North and South, as a location for US investment and business partnerships.  Over three days, it kept in sustained focus the case for investment in Northern Ireland and the southern Border counties in the new context created by peace.</P>
      <P>Backed by the authority of the President and the most senior members of his Administration, the conference highlighted dramatically for the US business community the transformation of Ireland's prospects since the ceasefires of last autumn and the reasons why investment here is now a more attractive option than ever before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to place on record the Government's deep gratitude to the President <Col N="309" /> for his initiative in holding this conference. Along with his continuing strong commitment to the peace process and the other initiatives which he has taken to support the process, the conference is a striking example of the President's generous concern for and profound sympathy with the needs of the Irish people, North and South.  The commitment of presidential time and effort to the conference was truly extraordinary and contributed in no small measure to its success.  We are deeply in his debt.  I hope we will have the pleasure of expressing our appreciation to him more directly when, as I hope, he visits this country before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>We also owe a special debt of gratitude to the Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, to the Secretary of Commerce, Ron Brown, and to the President's special adviser and Secretary of State for Economic Initiatives in Ireland, Senator George Mitchell, for the major contributions which they made to both the organisation and execution of this initiative.  The US administration worked tirelessly to translate the President's vision into reality.  The result was a conference which has ensured unprecedented attention for the benefits of US investment in Ireland, North and South, and the prospect of substantial underpinning of the peace process over the years ahead.</P>
    <P>In organisational terms the conference was a formidable undertaking. It brought together an attendance of some 1,200 people which included senior representatives of the US business sector, Irish companies from North and South and governmental and political representatives from the United States as well as from the two jurisdictions in Ireland.  I believe that, within the practical constraints of a conference of this kind, a fair balance was achieved by the US organisers in ensuring representation for the key sectors of relevance in both the United States and in both parts of Ireland.  The various US Departments involved grappled with the formidable logistical challenges of <Col N="310" /> the conference with great patience and skill and are to be congratulated on their dedicated efforts.</P>
    <P>The primary focus of the conference was, of course, on the business opportunities which exist for US investors, particularly in the context of the direct access afforded to the European Union market, by investment either in Northern Ireland or in the Border counties.</P>
    <P>The Irish and British Governments and our respective agencies agreed on a co-operative approach to the presentation of the arguments for such investment. We impressed on the American audience the reasons that it makes sense to consider either Northern Ireland or the Border counties for future investment.</P>
    <P>At the same time, the Irish Government delegation availed of every opportunity to draw attention to the benefits of investment in the six southern counties, as did the Oireachtas and local government representatives of those counties.  In addition, attractive promotional material which was distributed to participants highlighted the economic, social and environmental advantages of investment in those counties. The concern of Ministers, agencies and officials alike was to ensure full recognition at the conference of the opportunities for investment in the six Border counties, which have suffered greatly over the past 25 years from the consequences of violence and unrest in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is right that, having their efforts overshadowed and hampered in the past by their location in the light of their vulnerability to the repercussions of the Northern conflict, the Border counties should be given special attention as we seek to realise the dividends of peace for Northern Ireland and the island as a whole.  We ensured also that the six Border counties were given the necessary focus in the strategic documents produced by the US Department of Commerce.</P>
    <P>The main work at the conference was conducted at the eight different workshops or breakout sessions.  The topics <Col N="311" /> covered business partnerships, information technologies, food industries, tourism, manufacturing, tradeable services, employment and community development.  The breakout sessions allowed for direct discussions with panel members representing US companies and organisations with experience in Northern Ireland and the Border counties, US government officials and Government private sector and community leaders from Ireland and Northern Ireland.  All the Irish Ministers who attended the conference participated in these sessions, as did representatives from the State agencies.  We were grateful for the testimonials of many US business persons who told the conference in very forthright terms of the benefits to their particular companies from location in Ireland.</P>
    <P>With the primary emphasis of the conference being on trade and investment, it was fitting that the greatest representation from the Border counties was from its business community.  The US Commerce Department organised a specially designed matchmaker programme which matched Border county companies with American companies in order to explore investment, joint ventures or other forms of commerical relationships.  The matchmaker programme launched at the conference will be followed up and developed further as it is a positive initiative which can play a very significant role in directing more US inward investment to the Border counties.</P>
    <P>A major aim of the conference was to demonstrate to US companies that sustained peace is dramatically improving business opportunities on the whole island, particularly in Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  I believe that this objective has been fully achieved. The case for US investment in Ireland on grounds of economic self-interest alone has also been compellingly reinforced by the conference.  US business representatives who attended will have taken away with them the clearest possible sense of the merits of Ireland, <Col N="312" /> North and South, as a location for their investments.</P>
    <P>The Government now looks forward to active follow-up to the conference in the form of investment missions in Northern Ireland and the Border counties in the individual sectors identified for priority attention.  Following the discussions I had at the conference with the US Secretary of Commerce, Mr. Ron Brown, we have already engaged in ensuring the necessary momentum in the follow-up to the conference.</P>
    <P>We have had the benefit of consultations with the US Assistant Secretary of Commerce, Mr. Chuck Meissner, who visited Dublin immediately after the conference.  We look forward to fuller discussions with Senator Mitchell when he visits this country within a few weeks.  Clearly the visit by President Clinton, planned for later this year, will afford a major opportunity to assess the outcome of the conference and the prospects for converting the opportunities identified into real and lasting investment.</P>
    <P>Beyond the strict business emphasis of the conference, there was a broader political dimension which contributed greatly to its success.  As US Commerce Department assistant Secretary Chuck Meissner remarked during his visit to Dublin last week, this was &ldquo;an economic conference that turned into a political success&rdquo;.  In this case good economic endeavour also proved to be good politics. The conference brought together under one roof an unprecedented span of Irish political and economic opinion. It proved how readily even entrenched barriers to dialogue can fall away where there is agreement on the common goal of enhancing the welfare of all the people of this island, the goal which united every single participant at the conference.</P>
    <P>The extensive informal contacts between the participants from North and South on the margins of the conference facilitated an invaluable political dialogue of an informal nature whose repercussions will be felt for some time on this side of the Atlantic.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="313" /> The conference enhanced significantly the culture of dialogue, which is so important to all.</P>
    <P>I had the benefit of informal meetings with a wide range of political representatives, which was one of the major benefits of the conference.  It was gratifying to register in these contacts the extent of common ground which exists between the various traditions in Ireland both on the economic business of the conference and on wider issues. There is much to be built on here and I look forward to further exploration of this common ground in bilateral discussions with the various parties over the coming months.</P>
    <P>Progress in the economic field has an enormous contribution to make to the goal of achieving a lasting peaceful and political accommodation in Northern Ireland.  While there are of course deep divisions on political matters in Northern Ireland, few will contest the view that economic co-operation between the two parts of Ireland makes sound common sense.</P>
    <P>I also pay tribute to the Members from all sides of the House, particularly from the Border counties, who participated with great commitment and dedication in this historic occasion.</P>
    <P>The White House Conference for Trade and Investment in Ireland marked the beginning of a longer term process aimed at converting the potential of the peace process into lasting economic and social progress in Northern Ireland and the Border counties.</P>
    <P>However, I caution against expecting instant results.  Again, as I stated in Washington, one cannot judge the harvest on the day seed is planted.  The amount of information and contracts engendered by the conference will need time to digest and analyse.</P>
    <P>I believe that the conference helped to generate, in the first instance, an increased awareness among American companies of the potential benefits for investment, trade, joint ventures and other business relationships in both parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The follow-up process to this unique <Col N="314" /> conference will continue the close co-operation on economic matters between the US, British and Irish Governments. For our part Departments and State agencies will continue their close involvement in the process to ensure the necessary back-up for companies in the Border region.</P>
    <P>I told my audience in Washington that this is an exciting time to be involved in Ireland as the creative skills and energies of people on both parts of the island rise to the challenge of shaping a new and peaceful future.  The advent of peace in Northern Ireland can only enhance this situation further.  I did not seek charity in Washington, I offered opportunity, an opportunity now more attractive than ever.</P>
    <P>The case we put forward in Washington was not based on sentiment, but on opportunity for profit for all potential investors.  In my speech to the conference, I made it clear that we were not asking business representatives to sail into uncharted waters or expose themselves or their shareholders to unwarranted risk.</P>
    <P>Ireland already offers a very profitable location for US business.  The presence of more than 450 US companies who have chosen to locate here is evidence of this.  In particular, companies in the electronics, healthcare, pharmaceutical and financial services sectors are prominent amongst those who are prospering from their location in Ireland.</P>
    <P>As President Clinton pointed out, benefits accrue on both sides of the Atlantic.  The US enjoys a growing trade surplus with Ireland, now amounting to nearly one billion dollars.  The US corporate presence in Ireland sustains thousands of domestic jobs in the US itself, since, overwhelmingly, Irish involvement is the beach-head for expansion into new markets, rather than displacement of existing patterns.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that the White House Conference was an outstanding expression of President Clinton's personal support and commitment to the peace process in Ireland.  For that he deserves the <Col N="315" /> appreciation and admiration of all peoples on this island.  His visit later this year will provide us with the opportunity to let him see these feelings for himself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a statement to the House on the White House Conference for Trade and Investment in Ireland which took place in Washington from 24 to 26 May.  I concur with what the Tánaiste said in his address.</P>
      <P>Members of the Oireachtas who took part in the conference will agree that it was uniquely valuable.  It would have been difficult to believe a short while ago that the attention and weight of the Administration of the most powerful country in the world would be put at the disposal of the people of Ireland for a day or two, but that is what happened. It is too soon to count the economic benefits of the conference.  That will depend essentially on the quality of our own follow up, but it has initiated a process which will lead, over time, to significant additional US investment in Ireland and to a substantial reinforcement of the economic ties between the United States and both parts of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the conference in promoting awareness of Ireland and in promoting the culture of dialogue among Irish people is already beyond question.  The White House conference was an unprecedented personal initiative on the part of the US President which succeeded richly in the objectives it had set itself. The conference provided a uniquely prestigious showcase for the attractions of Ireland, North and South, as a location for US investment and for business partnership.  Over the three days it sustained focus on the case for investment in Northern Ireland and the Southern Border counties in the new context created by peace.  Backed by the authority of the President and the most senior members of his Administration, the conference highlighted dramatically to the US business community the transformation of Ireland's prospects since <Col N="316" /> the ceasefire of last August and the reasons investment here is now a more attractive option than ever before.</P>
    <P>I wish to place on record our deep gratitude to the President for his initiative in holding the conference, his continued strong commitment to the peace process and the other initiatives he has taken to support the process.  The conference is a striking example of the present generous concerns and profound sympathy with the needs of the Irish people, North and South.  The commitment of the President's time and the efforts of the conference were truly extraordinary and contributed in no small measure to its success, and we are deeply in his debt for that.  I hope we will have the pleasure of expressing our appreciation to him more directly when he visits the country before the end of the year.  On that occasion the Ceann Comhairle will, with his usual style and finesse, graciously thank him on behalf of us all for what he has done for us.</P>
    <P>We also owe a special debt of gratitude to the Secretary of State, Mr. Warren Christopher, the Secretary of Commerce, Mr. Ron Brown and the President's special adviser and Secretary of State for Economic Initiatives in Ireland, Senator George Mitchell, for the great contributions they made to both organisations and the executive of this initiative.  The US Administration worked tirelessly to translate the President's vision into reality.  The result was a conference which ensured unprecedented attention to the benefits of US investment in Ireland, North and South, and the prospects for a substantial underpinning of the peace process in the years ahead.  In organisational terms the conference was a formidable undertaking. It brought together 1,200 people and included senior representatives of the US business sector, Irish companies North and South and governmental and political representatives from the United States and the two jurisdictions in Ireland.  Within the practical constraints of a conference of this kind, a <Col N="317" /> fair balance was achieved by the organisers in ensuring representation of key relevant sectors in the US and both parts of Ireland.  The various US Departments involved grapple with the formidable logistical challenges presented by the conference with patience and skill and are to be congratulated on their dedicated organisational efforts.</P>
    <P>The primary focus of the conference was on the business opportunities which exist for US investors, particularly in the context of direct access afforded to EU markets, by investing in either Northern Ireland or the Border counties.  The Irish and British Governments and the respective agencies agreed on a co-operative approach to the presentation of the arguments for such investment.  We impressed on the American audience the reason it makes sense to consider either Northern Ireland or the Border counties for future investment.  At the same time the Irish delegation from this House availed of every opportunity to draw attention to the benefits of investment in the six southern counties, as did the Oireachtas and local government representatives of the counties. Deputies and councillors have often been criticised for their lack of attendance at and input to conferences. However, that criticism cannot be made on this occasion.  The work done on the fringes was just as significant as that at centre stage.  Every opportunity was availed of to put forward the case for the Border counties and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Attractive promotional material was distributed to participants highlighting the economic, social and environmental advantages of investment in those counties and in Northern Ireland.  The concern of Ministers, agencies and officials was to ensure the conference fully recognised the opportunities for investment in the six Border counties which have suffered greatly over recent years from the violence and unrest in Northern Ireland.  For too long, their efforts were overshadowed and hampered by their location and vulnerability to the <Col N="318" /> repercussions of the violence and conflict in Northern Ireland and it is only right that they should be given special attention as we seek to reap the dividends of peace for Northern Ireland and Ireland as a whole.  We ensured the six Border counties were given the necessary focus in the strategic documents produced by the US Department of Commerce.</P>
    <P>The main work of the conference was conducted in the eight different workshops or breakout sessions.  The topics covered business partnership, information technologies, the food industry, tourism, manufacturing, trade services, employment and community development. They allowed for direct discussions with panel members representing US companies and organisations with experience of investing in Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  US Government officials, private sector and community leaders from the North and South took part in these.  The Irish Ministers who attended participated, as did representatives from the State agencies.  We supported the Government and the work it was involved in at the conference.  We lent weight to the arguments put forward and are grateful for the testimonials given by many US business people who told the conference in forthright terms of the benefits to be derived from locating their companies in Ireland.  The conference will long be remembered, from a business point of view, for Ron Brown's contribution on investment returns on this island for US business people.  If I had been involved in preparing that script, I would have mentioned the good industrial relations experienced by most multinationals by and large through the successful efforts of the Congress of Trade Unions. Although there were some concerns in the 1960s and 1970s there were practically no difficulties on the industrial relations front throughout the 1980s and 1990s even though some of these companies underwent major technological change.  That, together with the return on investment, is an excellent selling <Col N="319" /> point.  A debt of gratitude is owed to those who work for multinational companies.</P>
    <P>With the primary emphasis of the conference being on trade and investment, it was fitting that the greatest representation for the Northern counties was from the business community.  The US Commerce Department organised a specially designed matchmaker programmer which matched Border county companies with American companies in order to explore investment joint ventures or other forms of commercial relationships.  This positive initiative will be developed further and will play a significant role in directing US inward investment in Border counties.</P>
    <P>The major aim of the conference, to demonstrate that sustained peace has dramatically improved opportunities for investment in Ireland, North and South, was achieved.  The case for US investment in Ireland on grounds of economic self-interest alone was reinforced by the conference.  US business representatives who attended will have taken away with them the clearest possible sense of the merits of Ireland, North and South, as a location for investment in the European Union.  We look forward to an active follow-up in the form of investment missions in Northern Ireland and the Border counties in those sectors identified for priority attention.  We have been involved in some of the follow-up action and it is important to continue to work on these issues.</P>
    <P>I wish to record my gratitude to George Mitchell, his assistant Martha Pope, Charles Meissner, who has returned to Ireland since the conference &mdash; the Tánaiste indicated the work in which he will be involved &mdash; Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith and the senior staff at the US Embassy who have given us a clear line on what they would like us to do.  I thank Senator Mitchell who was very helpful to us not only during the conference but prior to it when, through the good offices of the Tánaiste, he met us.  We appreciate that as it assisted us greatly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="320" /> The British Government and the Irish Government made definite undertakings in the Downing Street Declaration and in the months subsequent to it prior to the ceasefire on how we would build on the conference and what would happen if violence were to cease for good. It stated that after a certain lapse of time to establish that a cessation of violence was for real and for good, the parties associated with violence would be able to take part in talks on the same basis as other parties.  The Irish Government honoured that commitment almost immediately and the British Government began to honour it some months later.</P>
    <P>This conference was part of the peace process and what we have achieved. Anyone who studies the peace process will recognise that the Irish situation is remarkable.  There has been a clear-cut break with violence on both sides.  The predicted sporadic continuation of violence did not materialise.  The prospects for Ireland, even in the short term, are much brighter than elsewhere.  A unique opportunity has been offered and it should not be squandered by intransigence or a lack of political courage or vision.  In light of the understandings given by the Governments on both sides of the Irish Sea before the ceasefire, it would be reasonable to expect inclusive negotiations &mdash; if necessary, these can be conducted bilaterally at first &mdash; to be under way by the first anniversary of the cessation of violence or very shortly thereafter.  The Government should use its influence and play a role in ensuring that this happens.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline the main proposals in the Fianna Fáil paper submitted to the conference.  First, the IDA and the IDB, in addition to their normal work, should jointly promote inward investment each year to four unemployment black spots on each side of the Border. The initial list might include inner city sites in east and west Belfast, Cork, Dublin and Derry and towns on both sides of the Border such as Strabane and Lifford.  The merit of this proposal is that it would encourage both agencies <Col N="321" /> to concentrate more of their efforts on areas of high unemployment and work together on this, recognising the difficulty of attracting investment to such areas.  Everyone will have been impressed by the calibre of some of the community representatives from the North at the conference.  Their message was: &ldquo;give us the opportunities and we will respond&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Second, priority should be given to the development of the Belfast-Dublin economic corridor which would have spin-off benefits for the island.  Rather than merely endorsing the concept, we propose that a high level steering group should be established to ensure that this becomes a reality.  Third, development agencies and business organisations should develop greater links between firms, North and South.  It has been clearly demonstrated that the level of trade and economic exchanges between North and South are sub-normal in terms of neighbouring jurisdictions within the EU.  As I said three weeks ago at the Belfast Chamber of Commerce, at the very least we should be talking about bringing these up to a normal level.</P>
    <P>Considerable concern has been expressed in Northern Ireland and the southern Border countries about the genuine additionality of EU funding.  If transparency and accountability are to mean anything that additional funds over and above the normal levels of Government expenditure should be directed to Northern Ireland and the Border areas.  This has not always happened in the past and it is not happening at present but we must ensure that it happens in the future.  The sub-committee on Northern Ireland might usefully monitor developments in this area.  I am not satisfied that Ministers are paying any serious political attention to the planned expenditure of the additional funds in the southern Border counties. This task is being left to over-worked and under-resourced middle ranking civil servants.  I would like some evidence of the Government's serious commitment <Col N="322" /> to Border areas.  When I refer to funds I am talking about Structural Funds and funds under INTERREG and Leader.  There is no Minister or Minister of State from any of the six southern Border counties, and this speaks more eloquently than the Government's presence in Washington.</P>
    <P>There was no acrimony at the conference about fair employment or economic justice principles and it was accepted that people might approach this issue from different routes.  Everyone refers to investment and in practice there does not have to be any incompatibility between the general principles of affirmative action to which Americans are attached and the fair employment law in Northern Ireland which carries some compliance obligations and costs.  My party has never sought to discourage American interest in fair play, which has a vital contribution to make to the peace process.  Some of the Congressmen, especially Republicans, whom I met felt they had succeeded through the link with economic justice in saving the International Fund for Ireland but were frustrated that there had been renewed discouragement through discreet diplomatic lobbying.</P>
    <P>The Northern authorities gave notification that the ban on funding for the Conway Mill from the IFI was being lifted.  This has been a long standing grievance and I understand the community groups had a leaflet ready for distribution at the conference.  The change in unaccountable policy was another fruit, so to speak, of the conference which was attended by many gifted and articulate community leaders from west Belfast who availed of the opportunity to put their case in public and private to an impartial US audience. This follows the announcement some weeks ago of funding for Meánscoil Feiriste.  This removes two of the more important community grievances which were brought to my attention during my visit to west Belfast last January and which I raised a number of times in the House.</P>
    <P>I hope that the data on the issues <Col N="323" /> raised by Commerce Secretary, Ron Brown, will be studied by the IDA.  The data presented at the workshops was better than much of the data presented in the past in that it was focused.  There needs to be greater co-operation between the IDA and the IDB.  I was Lord Mayor of Dublin some years ago and, unlike Government Ministers, I had an opportunity to look at issues in a different light.  It makes no sense for the IDA and the Lord Mayor of Dublin to promote Ireland to large businesses which employ 100,000 and for the Lord Mayor of Belfast and the IDB to do the same two weeks later.  This merely confuses these businesses and we should move from this policy.</P>
    <P>The break out sessions at the conference were excellent.  There are clearly bright prospects for tourism throughout the island.  This will provide a good return on the investment made here in recent years and will also require new investment in capacity, especially north of the Border.  It has been acknowledged by everyone that we must work closely together in the promotion of tourism.  We want more people to visit Ireland and hope that many of them will visit the North and South.  It will be at least two years before we can assess the results of the Washington conference but it will certainly boost investment and contribute to jobs.  Apart from the business contacts and political encounters, the strong backing of President Clinton and the US Administration for the peace process gives a powerful political message of encouragement to everyone on this island and we are grateful for this.</P>
    <P>I thank the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and his office for organising the various matters.  The conference was a tremendous success and I pay tribute to the organisers, including the Government, Senator George Mitchell, his assistant, Martha Pope and Charles Meissner.  I also thank the American Ambassador, Jean Kennedy Smith and her staff.  She was of tremendous help and worked extremely hard at <Col N="324" /> the conference.  She even had nice things to say about the Tánaiste, with which we agreed on that occasion.  She has done an extraordinary job as Ambassador and I thank her.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the investment conference in Washington. Through circumstances beyond my control and that of others I could not be present for the start of the conference &mdash; I had to delay my departure. However, the Leader of my party, Deputy Harney, was present from the start and I was present for at least half the conference.  I share with Deputy Harney &mdash; and I am sure the other Members present &mdash; an enthusiasm for what happened in Washington.  The conference was very successful and it is not an exaggeration to say it was a unique occasion.  I can think of only one small state which might exercise something approaching the same influence in Washington and the United States, and it has been at it longer than we have and its needs, in military terms, are perhaps greater than ours.  It is remarkable that two small states can exercise such influence within the United States.</P>
      <P>It is hard to exaggerate both the significance and, even more important, the potential significance of the United States in terms of trying to expedite and smooth a political settlement in Northern Ireland.  The influence of that country &mdash; I am talking about much more than its Administration &mdash; is enormous. It is one of the few countries where both parts of this island have extensive personal interests in the sense that a great many people who were born in both parts of this island and their descendants live in the United States.  There is enormous good will in the United States towards both parts of the country.  The United States has a unique opportunity to help broker a settlement in Northern Ireland that will be to the satisfaction of all concerned because of their special influence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the formal parts of this conference I was taken with the value <Col N="325" /> of the informal contacts that took place and, indeed, of many aspects of the social programme.  It is only in the United States that I have seen people of very different traditions on this island come together socially, sometimes late at night having lost many of their inhibitions, and that is very valuable.  I saw it once before in the United States at a conference I attended in Airlie House, Virginia, about ten or 11 years ago.  I saw attempts to repeat that type of informal dialogue afterwards at British-Irish association meetings in Oxford and Cambridge and at similar meetings in Britain but they never seemed to work in Britain.  It worked in the United States ten or 11 years ago and again in Washington within the past ten days. The US authorities should bear that in mind.  They have given great assistance through organisations like the National Democratic Institute, and the Republican equivalent, to countries who have political difficulties of one kind or another, particularly to emerging democracies.  They usually do this by sending people from Washington to those countries.  So far as Ireland is concerned, their greatest contribution is to bring political activists at all levels to the United States so that the kind of dialogue we saw spontaneously engendered in Washington might be repeated because it was very beneficial.</P>
    <P>I wish to express my thanks to Ambassador Gallagher and his staff in Washington for the work they did &mdash; it was very difficult work for a relatively small embassy &mdash; and to all the consuls and vice-consuls in the United States who were also involved.  Ambassador Gallagher's efforts, and those of his staff, are worthy of great praise and thanks and were very successful.  Perhaps I could make this observation not just in relation to Ambassador Gallagher but to the Irish Embassy in Washington, which is probably driven in this respect by political and other feelings here, that it is not right to concentrate in the United States entirely on the Administration of the day.  While it was marvellous for this country that the <Col N="326" /> President, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce and other very senior people associated with the White House Administration should devote so much time, effort and attention to Ireland, the Democrats, after all, in the United States are the minority party and the institutional balances in the United States are quite different from here.  The political system is not dominated by the Administration in the way it tends to be here and, perhaps to a lesser extent, in Britain.  I had an opportunity to discuss, after the conference, with some experienced Americans the effect of the conference and that was one of the points they made.  I think it is quite valid and, perhaps, is not thought about here to the extent that it should.</P>
    <P>The influence of the United States is such that that country can immediately put pressure on the different points of view relating to Northern Ireland in order to seek compromise and thereby to make progress.  They can lean on those of the Unionist tradition just as readily as they can lean on those of the Nationalist or, specifically, republican tradition in Northern Ireland and they can do it with equal facility.  Hopefully, if it is seen to be done in an even handed way there is every possibility that those who might &mdash; as I crudely put it &mdash; be leant upon may come to make the compromises necessary to enable real political progress to be expedited. It would seem appropriate at this stage for the President of the United States to suggest to Mr. Adams and his colleagues that the facilities made available to them in the United States, for example, of raising money for political purposes, might have to come to an end if there was not a clear indication from Sinn Féin and the IRA of their willingness to decommission or surrender arms.  However distasteful public discussion of that point may be, it is the key in the short term to progress and it is one where the voice of the United States, whether expressed publicly or privately, would be invaluable because they are in a unique position.  We should be grateful that they are in a unique <Col N="327" /> position and are prepared to use that position.  If they can further the success of the Washington conference in other ways that would be marvellous from everybody's point of view, not least from the point of view of the United States itself.</P>
    <P>I was glad that while much of the preliminary skirmishing that took place in relation to this conference was of a political nature it ended up, pretty genuinely, as an investment conference.  It was not subjected &mdash; after it started at any rate &mdash; to the kind of political gimmickry people feared.  Part of the credit for that must go to the British Government for the way they handled the rather tricky preliminaries because they were, to some extent, in a no win situation whatever they did.  They succeeded in putting the emphasis on the investment aspect and that was extremely useful. Like the Tánaiste I counsel people here, based on experience over many years of trying to get investment in the United States, not to think they will get instant results.  There is a long lead time in investment; for some types of industrial development it can be as long as five or six years and, on occasion, seven or eight years.  While we will not see instant results many valuable seeds have been sown.</P>
    <P>One area which receives less attention than industrial investment but in respect of which US companies could make an invaluable contribution is tourism related investment.  The degree of their investment is relatively small by comparison with industrial investment. Ireland is one of the very few countries which does not benefit from US hotel chain investment.  I notice that when one looks up the directories even the most remote countries and the recently democratised countries in Eastern Europe have their Hiltons and Holiday Inns.  We are almost without that type of investment.</P>
    <P>Because tourism investment tends to show a return in terms of employment and the generation of activity much more rapidly than industrial investment <Col N="328" /> I would strongly encourage US firms to take an interest in this area in the shorter term.  The troubles in the North during the past 25 years, as I well know, inhibited this type of investment and much industrial investment.  There is now an opportunity to invest in tourism. I hope this will happen soon.  The first sign of it is the proposal to build some Radison hotels in Northern Ireland; work has commenced on the first of these.  I would like to see several of these chains on the whole island.</P>
    <P>The only downside to what was an enormously successful event was the lack of media coverage in the short term in the United States.  Many Americans, in spite of the importance of the conference and its participants, particularly on the American side, are unaware that it took place.  The agencies here should seek to publicise the significance and value of the event as widely as they can in the United States, particularly to those who might be inspired to make the investments we all want.</P>

I also pay tribute to Sir Patrick Mayhew and the public representatives from Northern Ireland at all levels.  Our Ambassador, Mr. Gallagher, and his staff also played a major role.</P>

    <P>It was an unbelievable experience to <Col N="329" /> take part in a conference at which President Clinton and Vice-President Gore spoke clearly about their understanding of the problems in Northern Ireland and the direction the peace process should take.  I pay tribute to the Secretary of Commerce, Ron Brown, his assistant, Chuck Meissner, Senator Mitchell, who was supported by Martha Pope and Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith for playing a major role.  Local government representatives from the Border region, community groups and business people also participated to make contact with their counterparts in the United States. These contacts will be invaluable.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs rightly focused on the six Border counties.  We must ensure that when Senator Mitchell and others return the emphasis will continue to be placed on these counties which in many respects have suffered more than the six northern counties.  In this context there is a need to rectify our infrastructural problems as a matter of urgency if we are to avail of the business opportunities that now exist.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley mentioned the tourism industry.  If we fail to improve roads quickly, such as the N2 from Dublin to Derry and the road from Dublin to Cavan, and construct a road running from east to west we will not benefit from the opportunities which will flow from the conference.  It is hard to understand why provision was made in the five year programme forwarded to Brussels for a road running from Dublin to Derry through Longford and Sligo. This matter has to be reconsidered and rectified as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry must be the first to benefit.  While I accept what Deputy O'Malley said that it did not receive as much publicity as we would have liked the industry must benefit from the fact that the conference was given a high profile by President Clinton and his supporters. Taken with the visit of Prince Charles, Ireland will be seen in a much more positive light than in the past when we were known only for the troubles and in-fighting.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="330" /> The workshops proved most useful in making business contacts.  If we are to benefit it is important that steps be taken to follow up these as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, for not turning this into a political conference and for allowing everyone to play a role in dealing with the economic issues.  As a result the conference was highly successful.  At present funds are received under the INTERREG programme and the Delors package and from the International Fund for Ireland.  We need to ensure that whatever funds are provided for the Border region are additional to rectify the damage caused during the troubles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to make a brief contribution. I was privileged as a Border Deputy to have the opportunity to attend this unique and historic conference. It was probably the first time all democratic parties in Northern Ireland and in the South discussed under the same roof the future development of the island and the peace process. For that reason it was truly historic.</P>
      <P>One of the noticeable features of the conference was the obvious sincerity, particularly on the American side.  The fact that the conference was addressed by many senior people in the American Administration including the President, Vice-President, two secretaries, assistant secretary, Senators, Congressmen and senior industrialists, shows the importance that Administration places on this country, particularly on the peace process that is happily progressing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reiterate the comments of my colleague, Deputy Crawford, and pay tribute to our Government representatives, the Tánaiste, Ministers, Ministers of State, the Ambassador and all those who co-operated in making the conference such a success.  As a Border Deputy I was particularly happy to attend and to witness the great emphasis <Col N="331" /> placed by everybody, particularly the Americans, not only on Northern Ireland but on the six counties south of the Border.  We sometimes forget that those counties have also suffered industrially, economically, socially and in other ways as a result of the difficulties in the last 25 years.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley mentioned tourism. Coming from Donegal we always got the impression that tourists, particularly from America, did not travel north of a line from Galway to Dublin unless they had very strong family connections there, because, whether we liked it or not, we were involved in the difficulties and troubles in the North.</P>
    <P>Another positive feature of the conference is that we were considered not as a peripheral country in Europe but as a gateway to the European market.  We very often look on Ireland as being on the periphery of Europe and far removed from everything, but at the Washington conference it was considered from a positive perspective.  I hope we will adopt that attitude in future and promote this country as the gateway to 350 million inhabitants of the European Union.</P>
    <P>The level of United States investment in Ireland is substantial.  There are 450 American companies here and I am confident that in the next few years many more American companies will come.  Fruit of the Loom is the major employer in Donegal at present, employing 2,500 people, it also employs a number of people in Derry.  I was happy during my time in Washington to meet the president and chief executive of that company, Bill Farrelly, and express to him our gratitude for the work he is doing for a Border county.  I am confident that there will be greater investment from such companies in future.  Yesterday in the House I met a senior vice-president of another American company who is taking part in a joint venture with an industry in my parish and hopes to double the workforce there, from 100 to 200, within the next <Col N="332" /> year or so.  Therefore, benefits are already accruing to this economy.</P>
    <P>The Washington conference was a historic occasion and, coming from the north, I again experess my gratitude to all those who made it possible and enabled people such as Deputy Crawford and myself as well as other public representatives from the Border area to attend and witness the great commitment to this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to have more time to contribute to this debate.  I wish to thank a number of people including the American President, Vice-President, Warren Christopher, Ron Brown, Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith and particularly the Irish Ambassador, Mr. Gallagher, and the embassy staff who went out of their way to make us as comfortable as possible.  The conference was very well attended and I was very pleased that Opposition and Government Deputies from the Border area combined their efforts in a unique way on this occasion to achieve the same objective.</P>
      <P>What will be the result of the conference? As the Tánaiste said, we should not expect jobs to be created overnight.  It will take some time and we should see results in the next two years. Benefits are already accruing to this country.  During the conference I spoke to a person in the financial area who represents a major investment company and is considering the Border area for investment.  That person rang me yesterday to say she will tour the Border counties at the weekend and I hope to meet her in my constituency next Friday or Saturday.  That company is interested not only in industrial development but in housing in seaside resorts.  I was disappointed that emphasis was not placed on the urban renewal scheme for commercial and industrial development or on the seaside resort scheme.  These matters should be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the people who were mentioned previously.  For me the conference was summed up by a <Col N="333" /> converstaion I had with an American multimillionaire who said, when I asked him why he attended, that Senator Ted Kennedy had invited him.  He said that if Senator Kennedy asked him to go to the moon he would go, but if he asked him to set up a business on the moon he would have to think twice about it.  That sums up the attitude of the Americans to Ireland.  As the Tánaiste said, it is not a matter of charity; these people come to Ireland as hard-headed businessmen.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste also mentioned the A-team who promote the country on our behalf.  As previous speakers said, all shades of political opinion met under the one roof for the first time, and that was to be commended.  Many companies from the Border area were represented at the conference.  These people had an opportunity to meet people from the US who may be interested in setting up business in their area.  As Deputy Bell said, some people were successful, but others were not.</P>
      <P>Many compliments have been paid to the conference &mdash; I am not being obtuse when I say this &mdash; but it is important to voice a couple of criticisms.  First, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, in an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> before we went to Washington did not mention the Border area; neither did he mention it when he spoke at the breakfast meeting in Washington. There was a lack of emphasis in that regard.  Second, it was disappointing the Taoiseach did not attend the conference.  Since it was set up by the President of the United States it was important for the Taoiseach to attend as it would have given a greater focus to the conference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the view of other Deputies that the conference was an enormously beneficial occasion for everyone involved.  It provided a shared forum for politicians, business people, and church leaders and was endorsed by the US Government at the highest levels.  Sometimes we can be a bit blasé about what was achieved in having a Vice President, a President, the <Col N="334" /> two senior Secretaries of State of the US Government and the support of senior officials in the Department of Commerce to ensure that conference was successful.  It was an extraordinary occasion when Ireland was put squarely on the map.  I emphasised time and again in my contributions during the break out sessions and in my overall address the whole concept of the conference was to cement the peace process. Deputy Ahern's suggestion that in some way it did not emphasise the Border counties misses the point.  The efforts made by my Department and I during that period were to cement opportunities for Border counties.  We identified Border companies that had been given the opportunity by my Department through Forbairt to build strategic partnerships.  Through the IFI and Forbairt we have funded a person in the United States who has known long established contacts with companies, to identify companies where strategic partnerships can be built.  That will be the follow up to that conference.</P>
      <P>Since the conference I met Chuck Meissner and we dealt with issues which have a specific bearing on the Border counties.  We considered how we could develop initiatives in the research and development area.  The US Administration is very interested in the concept of a technology trust, a type of initiative that has been successful elsewhere and we are working on that.  The network of county enterprise boards offers a way to build on the outcome of the peace process and the US conference. I know that Chuck Meissner is very anxious that contact is made between the US Administration and the country enterprise boards to ensure there can be a good structure to underpin initiatives being taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conference was a unique occasion, a marvellous opportunity for Ireland to demonstrate how much has changed since peace has been achieved. There is a new buzz North and South about seizing opportunities in our respective markets.  As Deputy McGinley said, it was important that we were <Col N="335" /> able to emphasise to people in the United States that since peace has been achieved there is a new gateway opportunity for the US to do business in Ireland, not only in the foreign direct investment area where we have an excellent record.  Many American companies based in Ireland have established strong roots and have the highest profitability of US companies located anywhere in the world, earning 25 per cent return on their investment here.  We have a proven track record in being able to deliver opportunities to profitable American companies to allow them to start up production quickly.  During my visit to the US while travelling along the west coast I learned that is increasingly a critical issue for companies interested in investing in Ireland or other countries. Our capacity to provide companies with a properly trained workforce capable of getting into production quickly allows them to seize the market opportunities that exist.</P>
    <P>As I said in my address, foreign direct investment is not the sole way in which we can exploit opportunities opened up by the Washington Conference.  The eyes of many small Irish companies are wide open and they are hungry for opportunities to do business on a joint venture basis with companies in the United States.  Many companies in the United States recognise the opportunity to access a European market of 370 million but it may be difficult for them to overcome cultural differences, such as language barriers and different markets. Ireland has been uniquely strong in developing companies with the agility to get quickly into the European marketplace. We offer smaller American companies great opportunities of synergy, using our small companies &mdash; to use the American term &mdash; to match-make with US companies to provide strategic alliances by way of technology transfer or developing a software product to be distributed through an Irish company.  Companies in Leitrim have been singularly successful in the electronics business and have developed a <Col N="336" /> particularly strong base providing opportunities for them.  Ireland had a unique opportunity to use the conference as a shop window to demonstrate how effective we are.  As many speakers said, American business people who wish to invest in Ireland will not do so on the basis of some charitable concept, but on the basis that they can obtain a good economic return.  We demonstrated convincingly they could achieve that in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I emphasised that it was not a zero sum game in which we were involved.  I was frequently asked if it was not the case that the North and the South are competing for projects and that essentially we are competing and not committed to co-operation.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  If we have a buoyant economy North and South it will be of immense benefit to all people doing business North and South.  It would be a great lift particularly to the Border counties in which there would be an opportunity to trade into a buoyant strong market in the North of Ireland, an opportunity that has not existed before.  There will always be some healthy competition between the IDA and the IDB and that is what we would want, but a great deal of common ground has been established between those two agencies in recent times.  They try to ensure they are not engaged in wasteful competition and use similar standards to ensure that projects are properly approved.  There are agreed ways of dealing with difficulties that might be foreseen.  It is important that companies North and South do not engage in wasteful competition.  The North and the South will identify different areas of comparative advantage, and different skills on which they will seek to build, and that is as it should be.  In that regard we are at one and have a great opportunity to co-operate with one another.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies stressed that benefits from the conference cannot be delivered overnight.  We will not see a major upsurge in investment immediately as a result of what has been done.  I can <Col N="337" /> assure Deputies that the agencies within my Department, the IDA and Forbairt, are building programmes to ensure that we secure the maximum benefit from what was done.  Forbairt is particularly anxious to ensure that the matchmaking concept becomes a central feature of our approach to development in the coming years and the IDA is now engaged in follow up visits to companies that attended the conference.</P>
    <P>President Clinton said at the conference that &ldquo;the chance is there, it is here, it is now.  We have it in our power to make all the difference: let's do it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The theme of the conference was about exploiting the opportunities and providing people North and South with the most tangible evidence of the benefits of the peace process, namely, better living standards and improved opportunities to work and live in their country.  The conference was a first step in a great endeavour in that area.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Coastal Protection: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Michael Smith on Wednesday, 7 June 1995:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for its failure to put in place a comprehensive programme of action to combat coastal erosion, for its lack of interest in the problems which this is causing for many coastal communities and for the exclusion of the worst-affected areas in many towns throughout the country, including Bray, from a range of special incentives to encourage private investment to facilitate the refurbishment of areas affected by coastal erosion.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1.</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann supports the Government's commitment to develop and implement a targeted <Col N="338" /> coast protection programme in respect of priority coastal areas, including Bray.&rdquo;</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for the Marine.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few points on coastal erosion relevant to County Donegal.  When one considers the budget for the Department of the Marine, one would not believe we are an island country.  A budget of approximately £50 million for that Department is ludicrous.  It should receive additional funding, particularly to deal with the problem of coastal erosion which, in general, only comes to light during inclement weather conditions. At other times it is forgotten.</P>
      <P>The sea is gradually washing away land in many parts of County Donegal and I have made representations to Ministers in this and the previous Governments in this regard.  At Lag near Malin Head on the Inishowen Peninsula a person has lost acres of land because of coastal erosion.  The Minister should place more emphasis on coastal erosion affecting small homesteads.  If we do not address the problem now, it will be too late because it will cost a great deal more to do so in a few year's time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Michael Smith put forward a relatively cost effective solution in proposing the setting up of a group of people to examine coastal erosion problems. In the past damage to our coast was to a certain extent catered for in the budget on a piecemeal basis.  Unfortunately, this problem does not have similar significance for all Deputies, but because we are an island country there should be all-party consensus on the matter and the Minister should accept that Deputy Smith's proposal is for the common good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This initiative would involve cross-Border co-operation.  During the fight for fishing rights in the European Community, the first people to support us regarding cross-Border co-operation were Northern Ireland fishermen, illustrating the amount of common ground <Col N="339" /> between the entire population.  At that time Northern Ireland fishermen supported the efforts of Ministers in Europe on behalf of the entire island. As this initiative would receive the support of people in Northern Ireland, the matter should be considered on an all-Ireland basis.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider the cross-Border support this initiative would receive, the amount of funding allocated to the Department of the Marine and the large number of small homesteads being washed away by the sea?  Structural Funding should be designated to assist those people who are losing acres of ground.</P>

      <P>The problem of coastal erosion will not disappear.  Large tracts of land, including smallholdings, in the west are being gradually washed away. For example, a householder in Erris had to be rehoused by Mayo County Council because of coastal erosion.  The remains of people buried in a graveyard in that area are also being washed away.</P>
      <P>A heading in a recent edition of the <i>Connaught Telegraph</i> stated that Mark Killilea, MEP, condemned county councils and the Government for not taking up millions of pounds for coastal erosion. I sent a copy of that heading to the Minister and county managers for comment. If money in Europe is not being drawn down, it is a damning indictment on county councils and the Government and it is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two years ago major storms occurred in the west and in recent years many areas have suffered flooding and stormy weather.  Blacksod, Louisburg and Achill are severly affected by coastal erosion and when I raise the problem at county council level, I am told it is not the <Col N="340" /> responsibility of the county council, that it deals only with grounds owned by it, such as entrances to beaches and so on. This problem will have to be tackled by Government, local authorities and private landowners because it is wrong that they continue to pass the buck in this respect.  We must remember that our coastline, beaches and waters belong to all our people.  It is totally irresponsible that adequate funding is not provided for the protection of our coasts, small holdings and the homes of those who experience problems from coastal erosion.  It is not possible for private individuals to spend millions of pounds on coastal protection.  The Minister, when replying, might confirm that there is money available within the European Union that has not been drawn down by this or previous Governments or local authorities.  If that is the case it is indeed serious.</P>
    <P>A number of weeks ago I brought local authority officials to Dooagh where there is a serious coastal erosion problem.  I requested them to prepare and send a report to Government and Mayo County Council to ascertain what can be done about it.  In County Mayo there are ten blue flag beaches but if coastal erosion is allowed continue, we shall not have ten beaches left.  They are being further eroded annually.  While the Government claims it has not the requisite funds to tackle the problem, we must do something about it or our beaches will continue to deteriorate in quality and quantity.</P>
    <P>This is a serious problem, particularly in the west.  There is a beautiful beach outside Westport &mdash; Bartraw &mdash; which people from Louisburgh, Westport and surrounding areas visit regularly.  Our European Commissioner, Pádraig Flynn, said he loved to take his dog there for a walk.  I challenged him when he was Minister for the Environment on not having invested the funds to preserve it.  I hope that, as a European Commissioner, he can help the Government and local authorities to extract whatever funds are available in Europe to tackle this very serious problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="341" /> The Government and local authorities cannot continue to say merely that there are inadequate funds and they can do nothing about it.  We must save our coastline and the small holdings located along it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Many coastal communities, particularly along our western seaboard, live in constant fear of the next storm and its consequences, having experienced what happened to their farms and properties in recent storms, placing them in enormous danger.  We have all become accustomed to listening to news bulletins following winter storms and the havoc they wreak by further coastal erosion.  Island homes on Arranmore in my constituency are in danger of falling into the sea, having been flooded on numerous occasions because of coastal erosion.  We have a duty to protect these people and their homesteads.  There is also a graveyard there in danger.</P>
      <P>A recent survey of coastal erosion shows that there are approximately 1,500 kilometres of our coastline at great risk, which would cost some £125 million to protect adequately.  I listened to the Minister of State's contribution and understand that over the duration of the 1994 to 1999 programme £5.5 million is available, which is totally inadequate for the purpose.  I do not blame this Government solely.  All of us have a responsibility in this respect.</P>
      <P>The last major coastal protective measures of which I am aware were adopted under the aegis of the Congested Districts Boards at the end of the last and beginning of this century.  Travelling across my constituency from Bundoran to Portnew, to Arranmore and to Magheraroarty, one observes that most of the protective walls or other structures that remain were built at the end of the last century or early this century by those boards.  These coastal erosion difficulties have been aggravated over many years, leaving us in our present dilemma.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and Government recently requested all local authorities <Col N="342" /> to submit applications for grant aid for a number of beaches within their respective jurisdictions.  I know that Donegal County Council has submitted applications in respect of Roy, Rathmullen, Teelin, Drum, Salthill, Mountcharles, beaches experiencing enormous difficulty through coastal erosion. I could add another four or 24 just as bad, such as Magheraroarty, which entire townland has already been cut off on several occasions, to the extent that one more storm would be sufficient to totally maroon a number of houses or lead to their collapse into the sea.</P>
    <P>The finance and other resources available for this purpose are totally inadequate.  If there are funds available within Europe, as one of our MEPs so eloquently claimed in a western newspaper, they should be tracked down by the Government so that the money can be expended for the protection of these coastal communities.  I look forward to the response of the Government and Mayo County Council to Deputy Ring about these elusive millions supposed to be available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Bell will not be contributing, I wish to share my time with Deputy Seán Ryan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our part of this island has approximately 4,000 miles of coastline.  About 1,000 miles of coastline are in need of urgent remedial attention, of which approximately 150 miles are critical and warrant immediate attention.  This has been a problem over very many years. The Oxford Dictionary interpretation of &ldquo;erosion&rdquo; is the gradual wearing away of something.  Two former Ministers of State, one with responsibility within the Department of the Environment and the other for the Office of Public Works, are well aware of the coastal erosion problem, having been in an ideal position to appreciate it.  I am amazed that this motion should have been tabled by them because, while there may be other matters for which they were not responsible, they must <Col N="343" /> accept responsibility for the coastal erosion that occurred over the many years their party was in power.</P>
    <P>Looking back over the relevant estimates one is amazed to find that in 1987, £173,000 was allocated to the Office of Public Works for coastal protection.  In 1988 that allocation was totally abolished and funds were not allocated by the then Fianna Fáil Government for that purpose.  In 1993, when I carried some responsibility, along with my party in Government, taking into account the rate of inflation, that figure was reduced to £220,000.  This year, that figure is £771,000 within the Vote for the Department of the Marine, constituting a 118 per cent increase on the preceding year.</P>

      <P>The Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I undertook some valuable work in our constituency in Arklow three or four years ago when coastal protection works were urgently needed, having made very strong representation to the then Fianna Fáil Minister who listened to our pleas.</P>
      <P>Local authorities are responsible for protective measures to minimise coastal erosion and must provide 50 per cent funding for that purpose, the Department of the Environment contributing the remainder.  Invariably this is too high a cost for any local authority, something they cannot afford.  They cannot prevent coastal erosion because they are starved of funds.  We must all be aware of that and the Government in power must give a 75 per cent or 80 per cent State grant for coastal erosion in any local authority area.  Fire brigade action is taken in every constituency but in County Wicklow, which has a soft coast from Bray Head to Wicklow Head to Wexford, a real coastal erosion problem exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem of coastal erosion is exacerbated when it occurs in a large <Col N="344" /> urban area such as Bray.  Many Members made representations on behalf of the people of Bray for action to be taken.  I very much welcome the proposed £2 million scheme for Bray to prevent coastal erosion and I am delighted that £260,000 will be made available immediately for the first phase of the scheme to improve the groynes and the rock armour in the Bray area. Discussions are taking place with engineers in Bray on the further operation of that scheme.  As the motion refers to Bray I am happy to inform the movers of it that action will be taken in the Bray area.  We can all be proud of this initiative taken by the Government, not just in the past week but over a period in consultation with the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine.</P>
    <P>County Wicklow has a major problem with coastal erosion but the immediate problem in the Bray area is being attended to and money is being made available to address it.  I thank the Minister and the Department for the prompt action taken in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kavanagh for giving me the opportunity to make a brief contribution on the important issue of coastal erosion.  Our coastline, which is almost 5,800 kilometres long, is of immense importance to all of us in terms of our economy and our environment.  Given that our coastal and dune system is non-renewable it is vital that the extent of the problem of coastal erosion is fully recognised by the Department and that a plan be devised and implemented to resolve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Coastal Erosion Committee report, &ldquo;Coastal Management &mdash; A Case for Action&rdquo;, published by Eolas, highlights some disturbing and indeed startling information.  Approximately 1,500 kilometres of our coastline are presently at risk from coastal erosion and approximately 490 kilometres require immediate attention at a staggering cost of £125 million.  The cost of dealing with this problem will have major implications for the Government <Col N="345" /> and particularly for local authorities in coastal areas.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that, for the first time ever, EU Structural Funds will be made available by the Government.  The figure is approximately £5 million but that is totally inadequate to deal with the problem.  I hope the Minister will review this figure following the contributions of Members in this debate.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that we examine alternatives to the more conventional remedies used in the past for dealing with coastal erosion.  We must critically examine methods used in other countries such as The Netherlands, Denmark, the USA and Great Britain, where coastal erosion has been a problem, and learn from their experiences.</P>
    <P>Given the importance of our coastline and our harbours to our expanding tourism industry and for local employment, I ask the Minisier to reconsider the directive to local authorities which in effect states that projects costing less than £75,000 will not be entitled to grant-aid and are not to be submitted for consideration.</P>
    <P>Cheaper alternatives to dealing with the problem of coastal erosion must be considered.  Beach renewal, dune nourishment, the use of vegetation and sand fencing are some of the available options.  Given the financial state of local authorities, they cannot be expected to fund such schemes entirely from their own sources.</P>
    <P>The borough of Portrane, in my constituency, has been identified as an area in need of urgent attention.  Over the years, acres of fields and dune structure have disappeared into the sea due to coastal erosion.  At present, many residential properties are at risk in this area. This is an example of what is happening throughout the county.  Other areas in my constituency have been identified in various reports over the years as being in need of attention including Corballis Beach in Donabate, the Velvet Strand in Portmarnock, Loughshinny Harbour, North Shore in Skerries, Barnageera and Balbriggan Harbour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="346" /> Last week, the blue flag was withdrawn from Portrane Beach and Portmarnock Beach was not awarded the blue flag because of lack of dune management. This major problem must be addressed and I hope the Minister will respond favourably in this regard.  We must implement an overall plan; action is required now.</P>

      <P>This is a timely motion.  Coastal erosion is an inevitable by-product of Ireland's geographic position. Our extensive coastline, which is almost 6,000 kilometres long, is one of our most valuable resources and, like other natural resources, it is fragile, non-renewable and vulnerable not just to the element's but to the excesses of development also.  Coastal erosion can be caused by bad planning and excessive development in our seaside resorts.</P>
      <P>I welcome the amendment.  The greatest threat to our coastline is not from erosion but from pollution.  In that context, the threat of nuclear pollution is particularly worrying.  Any moves to protect our coastline from the natural elements must be accompanied by equally vigorous measures to avert the threat of a nuclear catastrophe.  The potential for such a catastrophe exists across the Irish Sea in the guise of THORP.  We must all be conscious of the fact that the privatisation of the nuclear industry in the United Kingdom represents an enhanced threat to people living here, and not just those living on the east coast.  I hope I am proved wrong in that regard but it is something of which we must all be aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various studies indicate that the Irish Sea is the most radioactive sea in this part of the world.  That can be attributed directly to unhindered nuclear dumping. I am glad the Government took a very <Col N="347" /> active stand on this issue.  That will be appreciated not just by this generation but by future generations because it is an issue of which we must all be extremely conscious.</P>
    <P>This Government is committed to averting these threats by using all international arbitration means at its disposal. While the Irish Sea continues to be endangered by nuclear pollution, our coastline will remain vulnerable to a greater threat than coastal erosion.  I am not dismissing the problem of coastal erosion or the economic impact it has on the communities that depend entirely on tourism.  People probably snigger at the suggestion that we have a huge tourism trade but those living in these areas benefit from tourism.  Even with our weather the majority of Irish people holiday at home by the seaside.</P>
    <P>I realise the importance of protecting our shoreline from erosion and I welcome the steps the Government has taken in this regard.  A 1992 study shows 1,500 kilometres of coastline is at risk from coastal erosion with some 490 kilometres requiring immediate attention. That brings into sharp focus what needs to be done.  Protecting our coastline from the inevitable effects of coastal erosion is daunting, a task that no one Government should be asked to do overnight.  It will be a long and arduous task.</P>
    <P>Up to the end of the century EU Structural Funds of £5.1 million will be made available for protection works and of this, £670,000 will be spent this year on works in Wexford and on commencing a scheme in Bray, County Wicklow. We need to look at these schemes critically and learn from our mistakes.  I am sure other methods of protecting our coastline will be found.  Cork is a harbour town and has a very serious problem with its quay walls.  County Cork has benefited from the scheme for seaside resorts introduced under the Finance Bill.  Perhaps we should consider expanding what is considered a coastal area and examine the criteria for zoning areas for protection.  I am aware that <Col N="348" /> Cork Corporation and Cork County Council will be seeking moneys in this regard and I hope they will get a sympathetic hearing from the Minister.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Government's decision to put money into coastal protection in Bray, County Wicklow.  This is long awaited and warmly welcomed in the county.  It is indicative of changes not just nationally but in the European Union that recognition is finally being given to the fact that coastal erosion is a problem that will not go away and a cause of great danger.  A lady in my constituency is watching her house collapse into the river because of erosion.  From that experience I can see directly what potential erosion has to destroy people's lives and property.  I am very conscious that we have taken a major step forward in looking seriously at the potential of coastal erosion to impact badly on people's lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a long time the European Union did not concern itself with coastal erosion. Obviously studies were carried out but the question of funding was left in abeyance, I suppose because the European Union was fearful of the responsibility in facing up to this phenomenon. We have simply run out of time and it is important to consider it seriously.  A coastal protection programme has major cost implications for any island and there are no easy solutions.  It is a challenge for designers and engineers to look at how we can control the elements to protect human life and property.  It is not an easy thing to do.  It is not a case of raising walls and barriers.  That has been tried and there are many monuments to human folly over the past century where attempts were made to control the elements in an inappropriate way.  The elements responded by destroying the human constructions. There is a general recognition that soft engineering is the way to combat the <Col N="349" /> worst excesses of the sea and the construction of beaches and natural formations to protect landmass is the way forward. An example of how not to proceed is Bray seafront where a promenade was constructed in the last century at a time of great optimism and belief in enterprise.  The sea wall has been constantly under pressure and has been eroded since that time.  I know the area very well because I live on the seafront.  This news is of tremendous relief to them and at last the problem is being taken seriously and action is being taken.  I warmly commend the two Ministers involved for having finally set about providing the solution to what is a major problem for Bray.</P>

      <P>We have no coherent policy on coastal erosion.  The great fear of every politician is that his or her constituency is diminishing.  I do not know about the vote but my constituency is diminishing rapidly.  Only recently the European Union took an interest and has offered us £5 million in the present tranche of funds for coastal erosion.  It is interesting to note that in one area of County Wexford, Rosslare, £5 million will be spent.  That is just on one location.  The former Government put coastal erosion to the top of the agenda and this Government is following on from that.  However £5 million is a pittance in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="350" /> Every Deputy tends to deal with his own constituency.  I will concentrate on County Wexford, particularly as the coastline of Wexford is, like its people, soft and gentle.  We have 177 miles of beach, the most secure of which is probably the beautiful area of the Hook where I live, because it is surrounded by rocks.  Four areas in Wexford have been designated as having severe problems.  I refer to Courtown/Ardamine, Cullenstown, Cahore and Duncannon.  That is not to say there are not other areas in County Wexford which are also under threat.  Rosslare is one of those where a scheme is in place, although not completed. Will the Minister ensure that scheme is continued because what has been done so far has been a success, and the contribution Rosslare makes to the tourism industry is well known?  The tax take from Rosslare in any one year is about £500,000, so any works carried out there would be cost effective.</P>
    <P>There are other areas in Wexford about which I will not have time to speak later, so I will mention them briefly now.  One is the 7,000 acres in the Kilmore/Baldwinstown/Duncormick area in south Wexford which are under sea level.  It is not commonly known that in south Wexford we have the equivalent of the Dutch polders, protected by a bank with water pumped over that bank every day.  The banks are built only a foot higher than necessary at the moment and that 7,000 acres is under severe threat because of global warming &mdash; I do not suppose this House will change international policy on that but we certainly should have an input.  The Minister should take account of this and any other such areas in the country. During recent storm the bank was breached and several thousand acres were under water as were some houses which had to be evacuated &mdash; a problem not mentioned earlier during this debate.</P>
    <P>I understand some 12 counties are affected by coastal erosion.  Local authorities and groups are expected to contribute towards the cost of works to <Col N="351" /> prevent erosion.  That would be reasonable if such charges were fair.  The figures mentioned yesterday do not take into account the cost of a full scheme &mdash; 25 per cent of the cost of a full scheme is too great for a local authority to carry. I hope this will not be used as an excuse for not carrying out works.  The shoreline is a national asset and should be charged to the national purse.  Some areas obviously make money from the fact that they are coastal but the charge to local authorities and local people should be less than it is.</P>
    <P>In the recent past Wexford County Council was asked to submit four priorities.  Wexford County Council estimates the cost of the first phase of works at Courtown/Ardamine at almost £500,000, Cullenstown at £108,000, Cahore at £90,000 and Duncannon at £75,000, and the benefits would be substantial. Wexford County Council has had many discussions about the areas mentioned.  The estimated tourism revenue from north east Wexford is about £25 million a year and there is a substantial tax take from that for the Government.  This estimate came from the County Wexford Coastal Zone Management Plan of 1992, and two thirds of the income may be attributed to the intensely developed Courtown/ Ardamine area which is well known particularly to Dublin people.  The Courtown north beach encompasses a blue flag beach which will be under greater threat the further in the sea comes.  This beach is backed by an area of scientific interest.  It will be interesting to see if Europe will make a more substantial contribution since it is promoting ASIs and NHAs so vehemently here.  Courtown Habour is located between the two beaches at Ardamine and Courtown and is used as a yachting harbour &mdash; it is the only haven between Arklow and Wexford.</P>
    <P>Cullenstown is much closer to home and every year acres of ground are lost to the sea.  The banks there are of clay and any attack there sweeps much needed land into the sea.  My colleague, <Col N="352" /> Deputy Browne, yesterday called for compensation for a small farmer for the loss of his land and that must be considered. The land in that area is disappearing day by day, but there are quite a few houses in that area which makes the problem all the more serious.  The vagaries of the sea are difficult to understand and in recent times the sea has been quite kind to us in Cullenstown in that the river has changed its course. Officials of the Department will be aware that now is the right time to proceed with works at Cullenstown.  If we wait for the sea to change again, which could happen any day, the cost will be far higher.</P>
    <P>At a cost of £75,000 works should commence at Duncannon immediately. The Minister may say there is no money in the kitty, but this must be top of the agenda when land and houses are disappearing into the sea.</P>
    <P>I visited Cahore recently and to see a house with its gable wall being undermined by the sea and almost hanging over the cliff is frightening.  I invite the Minister, Deputy Gilmore, on his next visit to Wexford, to see for himself the severe threat we are under in Wexford and the absolute necessity for moneys to be poured in immediately.  I hope he will bring as good news the next time he comes as he did last time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words about coastal erosion.  I come from Mayo which, being a coastal county, also has problems.  In constituency terms Mayo is divided into east and west.  I am sure Deputy Ring outlined the problems experienced in west Mayo and east Mayo also experiences problems.  In the debate so far, most attention has focused on the east.  I am sure Deputy Nealon will speak about the problems in Sligo and the Enniscrone region.  The western coastline is prone to erosion, not only through storm damage and pollution but as a result of people removing sand and damaging dunes.  We have <Col N="353" /> only lately come to realise the importance of our coastline to farmers, fishermen and tourists.</P>
      <P>We must address the problem of coastal erosion.  The previous Minister, Deputy Andrews, secured funding for that and I hope the Minister will follow his footsteps.  If we manage to secure 75 per cent EU funding we could match it with 25 per cent funding.</P>
      <P>There are ten blue flag beaches in Mayo.  Unfortunately, some beaches lost this status but the north Mayo area, particularly around Ross, has again attained blue flag status.  Deputy Smith referred to the national coastal authority and had many ideas on how to solve the problem of coastal erosion.  Local authorities have a role to play in the management of our coastlines.  We must address the problem now.  It has been stated that £25 million is necessary to undertake coastal works.  However, only £5 million is available but from small beginnings great things grow.  We should look at other countries and see how they tackled the problem of coastal erosion.</P>

      <P>Coastal erosion seems to be part of the folklore of politics in much the same way as drainage of the Shannon.  The Government asserts that everything is under control and that adequate funding is available but that is not so.  The problem is escalating.  The Government should be honest enough to admit it cannot fully control coastal erosion.  Fingal County Council requires £1.2 million in the short term and that sum could be matched by other county councils.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ryan stated that Portrane has been given priority status by the council, it is only when you visit the area that you realise that houses and lands are disappearing into the sea.  The area may make for picturesque postcards but if you are unable to live in your home it poses major problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coastal erosion has caused serious problems at Donabate, Barnageera, <Col N="354" /> Skerries and Hampton.  Portmarnock lost its blue flag status as a result of failure to tackle coastal erosion, among other issues.  There are problems at Corballis and Balbriggan.  Sand has been taken from the harbour and further up the coast.  The penalties for so doing are derisory and the Minister should seek to dissuade people from taking sand by imposing greater penalties.  When sand is taken from the beach the area is covered by stones and pebbles and the amenity value of the beach is reduced. That is not exactly coastal erosion but coastal change which could easily be guarded against.</P>
    <P>The Minister should clarify whether £5.1 billion or £5.1 million is available under the operational programme.  The Minister for the Marine, Deputy Barrett, is quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> as saying it is £5.1 billion while several Deputies on both sides of the House spoke of £5.1 million.</P>
    <P>The approach taken to tackle the problem of coastal erosion reminds me of the way the traffic problem in my town was approached.  The Government seems to be dealing with that problem by telling shopkeepers to wash their windows and householders to wash the front of their houses instead of finding an alternative route for the traffic.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett mentioned global warming, climatic change and so on and these are contributory factors.  We talk about CO 2 abatement rather than CO 2 reduction and we must change that attitude if we are to tackle the root cause of the problem.  There is no point in talking about patching up parts of the coastline while there is an increase in CO 2 emissions which damage the atmosphere and exacerabate the greenhouse effect.  If we are to reduce those emissions we must have tax reform and a reduction in labour costs.  There should be a tax on carbon and energy.  Unless that forms part of Government policy any commitment to contain coastal erosion will be short term and will not succeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Kirk and Kenneally. <Col N="355" /> Coastal erosion is of great concern to those living in coastal counties as it affects farming, tourism and fishing.  The previous Government was aware of the necessity to take remedial action.  The former Minister, Deputy Andrews, secured EU funding to carry out remedial works and a plan for dealing with the problem of erosion was drawn up.  I hope the Government will continue this corrective action and provide the necessary funding.  I wish it every success in dealing with this immense problem.</P>
      <P>Three areas in my constituency are affected by coastal erosion.  In spite of the remedial works carried out some years ago erosion is still a problem in the Youghal area.  Further works need to be undertaken but the Department of the Marine and the Department of the Environment cannot decide which of them is responsible.  Tourism is a major business in the Youghal area and it is essential that the strand is maintained in good condition.  In the Garryvoe area erosion is threatening one of the few bird sanctuaries in the south and if proper remedial works are not carried out it will be destroyed.  This will be a major loss to the ecology of the area.  In the Knockadoon area hundreds of acres of land have been lost to the sea in recent years.  The county council does not have funding to carry out the necessary remedial works and I ask the Minister to ensure that adequate funding is made available for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ahern for sharing his time with me.  Coastal erosion is a major problem and in recent years large tracts of land in County Louth have been lost to the sea.  While erosion is a problem in some areas the laying of deposits in other areas can also cause problems.  It may be possible to develop these areas as wildlife habitats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this problem is not tackled farmers and those involved in the tourism industry will be badly affected.  Ready access to coasts and blue flags are essential to <Col N="356" /> the tourism industry, particularly in eastern counties which are behind western and southern counties in the development of this industry.  It is vitally important to protect our natural amenities. In the Annagassan area of County Louth some people are afraid their houses will topple into the sea as a result of erosion.</P>
    <P>I agree that there should be a twin track approach to dealing with this problem.  First, the necessary remedial work should be carried out as a matter of urgency.  The reality is that gabion cages and barriers are very expensive and time consuming to install.  While the marine engineers have developed ways of dealing with the problem, the necessary finance needs to be provided to local authorities as a matter of urgency. At present local authorities are responsible for the problem but they do not have adequate resources to deal with it.</P>
    <P>Second, consideration must be given to the effect of climatic changes, for example, the greenhouse effect and global warming.  We cannot deal with these problems in isolation and even though there is greater awareness of the need to tackle these problems, more action must be taken at EU level.  It is pointless to spend millions of pounds in remedial works if no action is taken on a wider level.</P>
    <P>As a member of a local authority, I know county managers feel powerless to deal with this problem.  Coastal erosion is the main issue of concern in many areas, yet members of local authorities can do little about it.  They are continually telling their constituents they know there is a problem but they do not have the resources to tackle it.  I hope the Government will provide the necessary finance to deal with this problem.</P>

      <P>The coastline is a resource of immense value in economic, <Col N="357" /> environmental, ecological and sociological terms.  However, coastal erosion now poses a serious threat to the coastal environment.  The coastal resource is fragile and unrenewable and the systems operating in the coastal zone depend to a significant extent on the preservation of the coast.  The Government recognises that erosion is a serious problem and shares the concern of Opposition parties in this regard.  A number of initiatives have been introduced in recent years.  For example, EU funding is being made available for the first time to assist in undertaking protection works at targeted priority locations. Under the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99, the Government has provided £5.1 million with the primary objective of preserving the State-owned foreshore, local authority owned property, tourist amenities including the beach and dune systems natural habitats and the ecology.</P>
      <P>The Government recognises that this level of funding is insufficient to tackle all the erosion along the coast and has, therefore, committed itself to look at what extra funding can be provided.  It must be borne in mind that this funding represents a significant increase on the level of funding provided in previous years.  The record of funding provided by the people opposite has been dismal. In order to draw up a national programme of priority protection works the various coastal authorities have been invited to make a detailed submission on each of their top four priority coastal protection proposals.  The majority of local authorities have now responded and their proposals will be examined by the Department of the Marine, having regard to the rates of erosion benefits arising, the types of work required at the various sites, the associated costs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Department of the Marine is also involved in an international coast protection project entitled ECOPRO &mdash; environmental friendly coastal protection.

This code of practice will be of immense value in aiding both local authorities and coastal landowners to understand the dynamics of the erosion process and provide guidance on how required protection work can be carried out in an environmentally friendly manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the commencement of this debate Deputy Michael Smith suggested there was a need to establish a national coast authority to oversee the management of the coastal resources.  What a pity he did not think of that a decade ago and less damage would be done.  This is an issue which is being examined by the Government. An interdepartmental working group comprising officials from the Department of the Marine, the Department of the Environment and the Office of Public Works has been established to investigate an overall framework for coastal planning and management, covering land use, planning and control, coastal protection, nature conservation, marine resource development, marine environmental protection and the links between these.  To further the development of an overall policy for managing <Col N="359" /> the coastal zone, a major consultancy project is to be awarded shortly.  The brief that is being given in relation to this study identifies the need for a coherent framework for managing and developing the coastal zone, based on the principles of conservation and sustainable use.  The study is a major new development which will have an important impact not only in Ireland but also at European level in terms of the development of a European policy on coastal zone management.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will agree that while much remains to be achieved in terms of the development and protection of our coast, the Government has shown its commitment by setting in motion a number of significant developments and that a comprehensive targeted strategy in relation to coastal protection is now under way, thanks to this Government.</P>

      <P>What we need most of all is some concept of the magnitude of this problem.  I do not think anyone realises how coastal erosion is eating into our coast all over the country. While some money is being made available it is not sufficient to meet the requirements.  Sligo County Council was asked to forward its submission.  It made a submission for a modest number of areas: Enniscrone, £500,000; Strandhill, <Col N="360" /> £275,000; Mullaghmore, £425,000; and Rockley, £330,000.  That is a modest proposal from Sligo County Council by comparison with the needs in the area. It accounts for £1.5 million.  This is an area which is in need of vast amounts of money.  Studies must be carried out on the best ways to undertake this work. There are various ways but the boulder, which I think is the best, is extremely expensive.  There is another method, which was introduced to the Sligo area, bent grass which is very effective in that area.  I would remind the Minister that that was introduced to the Rockley area of Sligo by Lord Palmerston who subsequently became Prime Minister of Britain.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am delighted this motion is before the House at this time in view of the fact that as a number of speakers have said, some EU funding is available for the first time to help deal with the problem of coastal erosion.  That is encouraging and needs to be built on for the future. It is interesting to look at the range of problems which can be created in coastal areas.  I am aware from my own county that in Lahinch, a substantial part of the town is under threat by undercutting from the sea.  That is relatively unusual nationally.  During recent storms the pier at Ballyvaughan was badly damaged and has resulted in a huge cost to the local authority, particularly in the context of cutbacks in road funding in 1995.  An area close to Kilrush, which has escaped for a long number of years, had the sea walls breached and a house and a huge amount of farmland was flooded earlier in the year.  In <Col N="361" /> the north Clare area, in a relatively secluded bay, in the Parkmore area of Burn, a house was flooded to a depth of about three feet; another relatively unusual occurrence connected, undoubtedly, to bad weather conditions and the heavy rainfall this winter.  In the Quilty area there is a sluice which has been giving trouble for a long time. Extensive repairs were carried out which were not entirely satisfactory. The county council has indicated that at relatively modest cost it could be improved further.  In the Kilkee area landowners, at their own expense, constructed a sluice which is extremely successful. I am not sure of the exact cost but it was less than 10 per cent of the cost which was mentioned by a national body.  As Deputy Nealon said that is one of the approaches we need to adopt: less costly works which can be and frequently are equally effective.  They may require ongoing maintenance but it is worth doing.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the work of the national coastal erosion committee.  I welcome the fact that interdepartmental groups are following up on it.  This is excellent work which was undertaken by the county and city engineers.  It highlights the weaknesses in the current strategy and makes recommendations for the future.  It also provides a superb data base which will be of vital use to the Department in pursuing this issue. It draws attention to the fact that there is a number of agencies, none of whom is inclined to accept ultimate responsibility. That issue needs to be addressed in a management plan and in an Act to replace the Foreshore Act and the Coastal Protection Act.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Donegal South-West):</i> I congratulate the new Minister for the Marine.  Deputy Barrett, on his appointment and wish him well during his term of office.  Ar an chéad dul síos ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí ar an taobh seo den Teach, Teachtaí Smith.  Browne agus Dempsey, a thug deis dúinn an cheist thábhachtach seo a phlé sa Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="362" /> Apart from the problem of unemployment in my constituency the matter of erosion is one of the most serious.  In my county the total length of our coast is 650 kilometres, of which 240 kilometres is soft coast and 130 kilometres is at risk.  This is not a Deputy from the county being alarmist, it is a fact and those are the statistics.</P>
    <P>The Minister will appreciate that coastal constituencies depend largely on tourism and fisheries.  Counties such as Donegal are affected annually by a series of storms which have caused and continue to cause serious damage and lead, on occasion, to hardship.  The fishing industry is of importance to County Donegal, from the Foyle Estuary in the north to Bundoran in the south.  It has a number of major ports, including Killybegs, Greencastle and Burtonport, and many smaller ports, not to mention the islands.  This industry, which is a major employer, as well as our beaches, golf courses and harbours have been adversely affected.  Action needs to be taken quickly to rectify the problem in areas such as Downings, Cloghaneely, Knockfolen, Magheraroarty, Gweedore, The Rosses, Arranmore island and the beaches at Maghery, Portnoo, Murvagh and Bundoran.</P>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan £5.1 million is to be made available but this will be insufficient to resolve this serious problem.  The European Union recognises that there is a necessity to provide funds to overcome it. However, this is only a token gesture.  If we are serious about tackling this problem the National Development Plan must be redrafted.  The Government must give a commitment to do this. Rather than point the finger at his predecessor the Minister should take the opportunity to make an input to this process in the weeks and months ahead.</P>
    <P>It is well known that the £5.1 million will be used to improve small harbours and piers.  It should not be forgotten, however, that other amenities such as golf courses, which play an integral role in the development of the tourism industry, have also been adversely <Col N="363" /> affected.  An integrated coastal protection management system must be put in place.  My party has given the Minister an opportunity to do this.  I will work with the Minister, the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, and departmental officials to emphasise at European level, at the fisheries committee and in discussions with Commissioner Bonino the need to provide additional funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>Primary responsibility for coastal protection lies with the property owner, whether it be a private individual or a local authority.  The role of the Department of the Marine is to work in conjunction with the local authorities in the management of the coastal zone rather than individual sites.  Unless and until we move away from this concept we will never be able seriously to tackle the problem of coastal erosion. Landowners and local authorities are helpless.  They cannot cope with the power and energy of the sea and the resources of Government are needed if a serious attempt is to be made to tackle this worrying and escalating problem.  I support the call by my party's spokesperson, Deputy Smith, for the setting up of a national coastal authority within an existing Government Department.  If we are serious about tackling this problem this needs to be done as a matter of urgency.</P>
      <P>There is insufficient awareness of the scourge of coastal erosion.  A study undertaken in 1992 by the County and City Engineers Association showed that out of a total national coastline of 5,800 kilometres over 1,500 kilometres were at risk, while some 490 kilometres required immediate attention at a cost of £125 million.  These figures were quoted yesterday by the Minister for the Marine and it appears that they have not been updated since 1992.  This reflects the lack of urgency in tackling the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nationally, £5.092 million has been included in the National Development Plan for the period 1994-99.  This amount alone is needed in my own <Col N="364" /> county of Waterford where 170 kilometres of coastline are in need of some protection.</P>
    <P>Protection of the nation's coastline with its attendant advantages for tourism, agriculture, etc. is a national and not a local responsibility.  It is an essential ingredient of the infrastructure supporting economic development and it should be 100 per cent funded by the State in common with other infrastructure such as roads, water supply, sewerage facilities, etc.</P>
    <P>In Waterford the following areas need to be protected: Clonea, Ardmore, the Cunnigar, Bonmahon, Abbeyside, Tramore Burrows, Woodstown, Annestown, Ballyvoile, Whiting Bay, Dunmore East, Passage East, Kilfarrassy, Garrarus, Ballymacart, Ballingoul, Ballyquin, Ballinard, Glencorrin and Rathmoylan.  I wish to mention two of these in particular.  If the Cunnigar is breached the complexion of the town of Dungarvan will change.  This provides protection for the town.  It is not an immediate problem but if something is not done now it will be a major problem.</P>
    <P>The other area I would like to mention is Ballyquin which I visited on Saturday last.  It is located a couple of miles from Ardmore, Ireland's tidiest town in 1992.  I had not visited the town for some time and was appalled at the damage inflicted since my last visit. There is a small farmhouse to which the edge of the coast is daily getting nearer. The family involved are watching their farm being eaten away inch by inch.  The extent of the problem has got progressively worse in recent years and unless something is done this holding will be wiped out in ten to 20 years and the house will literally fall into the sea.  I have a graphic photograph which I can give to the Minister if he so wishes.</P>
    <P>There seems to be no real difference between spring tides and slack tides. This means that the land is being buffeted all the time.  I have made repeated representations to various Ministers but to no avail.  The Coast Protection Act, <Col N="365" /> 1963 is outmoded, inflexible and unsuitable and I urge the Ministers to replace it with more modern and comprehensive legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members on all sides of the House for participating in this debate in which stark messages of concern were conveyed.  We now have a clear picture of the extent to which the sea has invaded many coastal areas. Graphic pictures were painted of family farms and towns where the problem has reached catastrophic proportions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the possible exception of Deputy Sheehan who is extremely happy with what is happening in Cork, almost everyone else is anxious that more resources should be provided and deep consideration given to this problem. There is also considerable support for the proposal that a national coastal authority be established to allow a single-minded approach.  Such an authority would have dedicated, experienced and committed engineering and other staff.  The question of additional funding <Col N="366" /> from the European Union and the national Exchequer was also raised.</P>
    <P>To some extent this debate has been overshadowed by the incredible mismanagement of the economy during the past six months.  It may well be the case that the resources that are desperately needed have been dissipated because of the actions of the Government.  I hope that in the course of this debate we have been able to concentrate the mind on the need to find ways to help communities along the coastline who are grappling with this problem.  We should not leave them isolated.</P>
    <P>We would be happy to support the Government if it put forward alternative measures similar to the ones we have proposed.  The establishment of a single authority with dedicated and committed staff and the provision of additional resources is the only way to pursue this question.  If the Government agreed to do this we would consider withdrawing the motion but in the absence of any coherent policy or commitment to eradicate this scourge we will force a vote on the issue.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally I would not be very enthusiastic about setting up 12 new State companies, including one in Dún Laoghaire, as proposed in the legislation, but I accept the Minister's word that the overall effect will be to relax ministerial control.  If that is the case, I can justify supporting the measure.  My political philosophy is averse to the creation of State companies. I find it hard enough to suffer those in existence and normally I would find the creation of an additional 12 companies unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was a member of one of the existing harbour boards.  Waterford Harbour Commissioners, for a number of years <Col N="369" /> and I have a reasonable insight to the manner in which they functioned in the past.  Their constitution is somewhat loose.  It was interesting to be a board member as a wide range of interests were represented on those boards.  It gave every business section of the community interested in shipping an opportunity to be represented, a democratic and desirable way to do business.</P>
    <P>Under this legislation it has been decided to increase the number of board members from nine to 12 to facilitate local authority representatives.  It is sad to relate that in my experience, and this may have been particular to the Waterford harbour board, generally the worst attenders were local authority members. I do not know if they receive expenses, I did not receive any although I had to travel 30 miles to meetings.  It must have been difficult to make room for three local authority members on those boards when they were such poor attenders at board meetings in the past.</P>
    <P>I notice that TDs and Senators are prohibited from being members of the new boards.  I regard that as petty because a harbour board would be assisted by having a local TD, Senator or MEP on it.  It would enable the board to have contact with national politics, Ministers and the European Union which provides a great deal of funding for developing and expanding harbours. I fail to see the logic of excluding Deputies, Senators and MEPs from membership of such boards.</P>
    <P>I have always objected to the election or nomination of worker-directors to State boards.  Under the Bill, depending on the size of the workforce in the harbour, a number of worker-directors must be appointed to the board.  I do not favour the worker director-system as it tends to undermine the running of boards.  Worker-directors believe they have an obligation to inform the workforce of developments and, while that may appear logical, in many cases companies must keep their strategies and plans close to their chests.  It is difficult to run a company if people who attend board meetings inform others of the <Col N="370" /> developments in the company.  I will not accept the need for worker-director representation on State boards.</P>
    <P>The idea of worker-director representation was mooted in the mid-1970s by a Labour Party member of the then coalition Government, but a serious mistake was made in making comparisons with similar boards on the Continent. Worker-directors are not appointed directly to boards on the Continent, they are appointed to a subcommittee which reports back to the board.  Under this Bill worker-directors will be directly represented on boards and that is not acceptable, particularly in the context of major State companies. As Minister I had many State companies under my control one of which, the Sugar Company, faced difficulties and the presence of worker-directors on the board was more of a hindrance than a help in solving those difficulties.  This is the forum in which to air such grievances. The worker-director system was not intended to mean direct representation. Trade secrets should remain behind doors and we should have confidence in those nominated to State boards.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the Minister for the Marine will nominate the members of the board with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Once again the heavy hand of the Department of Finance will control the activities of another Department.  Such a qualification is undesirable.  If the legislation is introduced by the Minister for the Marine and the boards operate under his aegis, total control should rest with him. The recent trend of giving the Minister for Finance a veto on matters relevant to other Departments should be outlawed.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that existing harbour boards comprise representatives of local authorities, chambers of commerce, trade union interests, IBEC, the livestock trade, shipping and ministerial nominees.  I worked with a number of trade union members who did excellent work on the Waterford Harbour Board. Rather than having worker-director <Col N="371" /> representation, would it not be more acceptable to have direct trade union representation on such boards?</P>
    <P>The livestock trade &mdash; the shipping of live animals to other countries &mdash; is a very contentious issue at present.  This country is so heavily dependent on the export of live animals that it is imperative the matter is put in proper perspective and we ensure there is no undue cruelty to animals transported by sea. Unfortunately, this has not been the case in the past and almost weekly we read horrific stories in our newspapers about hundreds of cattle dying or being maimed en route to a country in the Middle East.  Farmers depend to a large extent on the live animal trade, but the public are very aware of the cruelty it may involve.  That trade will come under serious threat unless steps are taken to eliminate cruelty.  I sound a note of caution in this regard.  There is a danger that public reaction will become so strong it will be impossible to ship animals from the south of Ireland through the Gibraltar Straits which is an unsettled turbulent stretch of water.  It is always going to be difficult to ship animals through that region without their incurring serious injuries or fatalities.</P>
    <P>We shall have to examine this matter very carefully.  Any reading of newspaper reports in recent months will have demonstrated that the farming organisations, shippers, the companies involved and the general public all are at loggerheads on this issue which will become even more contentious.  Ultimately, it may mean that we will be allowed ship animals across the Irish Sea only from Rosslare to Fishguard, Dún Laoghaire to Holyhead or Greenore to Holyhead, the remainder of the journey being overland.  This is a contentious issue which will become more so.  I do not think people have fully faced up to or realised the degree of hostility among the general public about the type of activities which have been condoned and allowed take place over many years. <Col N="372" /> I predict they will not be allowed continue.</P>
    <P>This is a very emotional issue that must be addressed.  Fine words, promises and threats thrown around like snuff at a wake will not allay public fears in this respect; some constructive measures and action are needed.  The livestock trade must be saved, but the way we are going we will not save it. We are heading into a confrontation in which the livestock producers, shippers and dealers cannot win.  One cannot fly in the face of the public since there are enormous cruelty problems involved. We shall have to devise a less damaging, less hurtful, much less cruel system.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill I note that 11 ports will be transferred to the State in the form of port companies.  Dún Laoghaire Harbour is already under the control of the Minister for the Marine, as are five other fishery harbours.  I note that Dingle will be the sixth to come under his control.</P>
    <P>In the latter part of the Minister's contribution he said there was a review being undertaken of the financing and control of these harbours.  I ask the Minister of State to expedite finalisation of that review since some of these major fishery harbours are in a very poor state of repair.  Dunmore East in my constituency, one of the six involved, is dreadfully under-financed.  Considerable sections have already fallen or are in danger of falling into the sea and the harbour in great need of considerable extension.  The Minister should speed up production of that review and, if necessary, introduce legislation so that we can discuss the problems in those six fishery harbours which provide thousands of jobs and which, if expanded, could provide additional jobs.  There is no more appropriate sector within which the State can generate employment than these fishery harbours.  It is a shocking state of affairs that such employment should be inhibited through our reluctance to repair or extend those harbours.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>Given our country's <Col N="373" /> island status and extraordinary dependence on exports, having to export in excess of two-thirds of everything we produce, it is crucial that we have totally commercial, top quality port facilities to enable efficient export to various markets abroad.  The sad fact is that that is not the case.  The need for dramatic reforms is underlined by the fact that so much of our trade and commerce is conducted through the port of Larne in Northern Ireland despite the considerable extra distance involved for long distance hauliers.</P>
      <P>The key to success is to be found in reasonable port charges, efficient operations and frequent sailings.  The very success of the port of Larne is an indictment of the operations of our main ports in the Republic, particularly Dublin Port.  If an exporter based in the midlands, midwest or west finds it more economical to drive to Larne rather than to Dublin Port, which is so much nearer, it will readily be appreciated that the position is serious and warrants regular review.  The reforming measures in this Bill to commercialise the operations of our 12 larger ports are welcome and long overdue.  I particularly welcome the proposal that these ports be run on fully commercial, business lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A query I might raise on behalf of my party is whether the possibility of privatising the operations of any of those ports was seriously considered.  That course has been pursued successfully in other countries.  Since it is the intention to run our ports on a commercial basis, why not go the whole hog and investigate their privatisation?  The Minister stated that it is the intention of the Government, on the enactment of this Bill, that our ports will operate as truly commercial, self-sufficient enterprises, free from undue State control.  As my colleague, Deputy Deasy, pointed out a few moments ago, the heavy hand of the Department of Finance appears to hang over such ministerial decisions.  That begs the question whether any degree of hands-on State control is necessary once a proper legislative framework has been <Col N="374" /> put in place for the operation of these ports.  Should they not be allowed get on with the job without any State interference whatsoever?</P>
    <P>I hope the plan outlined in this Bill will enable ports like Dublin, Cork, Drogheda, Foynes, Limerick, Waterford, New Ross and Wicklow to meet the needs of our exporters on a much more efficient, commercial basis.  The key to success will be more competitive port charges, speedier handling of all cargoes and more frequent sailings to Britain and the Continent.  To that end I welcome the objective of reducing port and shipping costs by 15 per cent and an increased tonnage of practically 50 per cent by the end of this decade.  The real test of this Bill will be whether, over the next couple of years, we witness not alone a dramatic expansion in the volume of trade passing through our ports but also a shift in the volume of business from Larne to ports in the Republic.</P>
    <P>On a more parochial note, the port of Limerick/Foynes/Kilrush, one of the finest deep water ports in western Europe, deserved the additional funds devoted by the Minister's predecessor and demonstrated Government confidence in the operations of ports in that area.  The road servicing the port of Foynes, the N64, is totally inadequate to cater for the type of traffic it carries.  It is in need of upgrading but, in the meantime, some remedial work should be undertaken by the Minister, widening various bends and narrow portions.  This is a very important port for our economy. Stretches of the River Shannon from Limerick to the sea, on both sides, are exceptional development land suitable for all types of industrial activity. Moneypoint, Aughinish Alumina, the cement factory and White's of Askeaton are all built along the estuary.  Vast tracts of land are suitable for industrialists interested in establishing industries there.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the problem of the illegal importation of drugs.  Not long ago, a large consignment of drugs which had come through Rosslare port was seized at Shannon.  Adequate support <Col N="375" /> should be given to our major ports to ensure that as few of these drugs as possible are brought into this country. Drugs will destroy the lives of our young people and we must ensure that their importation is as limited as possible.</P>
    <P>In general, I accept the spirit of the Bill and hope it will be passed.  I am pleased that members of local authorities may be appointed to the membership of the new authorities but Deputies, Senators and MEPs should not be debarred from such membership. These people have vital contacts with Ministers and can bring problems to their notice more rapidly than the people in the port authorities.  Perhaps the Minister might reconsider this proposal. Members of Chambers of Commerce, and even dock workers, should be considered for appointment to these boards because they deal with issues affecting their livelihoods.  If our ports are not managed properly, they will soon deteriorate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution. Being from the inland constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, I am not directly involved with this issue but I am indirectly involved and dependent on others for the provision of good harbour facilities.  We depend on our ports for getting our goods to markets outside the country and for the importation of essential raw materials for our manufacturing industry.  We also depend on our ports to bring tourists here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill represents the first real examination of harbours legislation in almost half a century.  Most people would accept that since the previous legislation was passed in 1946 there was a need to update it.  I have a limited knowledge of harbours.  When holidaying in Wexford I would often travel to Rosslare to see what was happening there.  To my knowledge the facilities there are outstanding and the people involved should be commended on the way the harbour has developed <Col N="376" /> over the years.  I believe the facilities in Rosslare are as good as those in any other country, although there are some outstanding problems which have been referred to by previous speakers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred to the fact that membership of the new boards is restricted to members of local authorities and that TDs and Senators are debarred from membership.  That is a slight on people in high office.  If TDs or Senators are willing to serve on these boards they should be considered for membership.  Deputy Deasy made the point that members of local authorities are often bad attenders at meetings but if a person fails to attend three successive meetings, he or she should be replaced unless they can give very good reason for their non-attendance.  People are often anxious to become members of local authorities, committees etc., but their attendance and contributions are often negligible.  That is not good enough and if a person nominated to be on one of these new boards does not attend meetings, he or she should be replaced.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated this new legislation is designed to ensure that ports will be able to operate as truly commercial and self sufficient enterprises free from undue control by the State.  I welcome that.  It will be for the local harbour boards to determine whether development or upgrading of harbours is necessary.</P>
    <P>The export of live animals is a topical subject at present and one which has led to much heated debate and unfounded criticism.  I recently read comments by a member of a harbour authority to the effect that a ship leaving this country with a large number of cattle on board had to abort its sailing because of the illness of a member of the crew.  There were further comments about the condition of the cattle on that ship.  I do not accept that cattle are abused in this manner because of the people who are dealing with them.  If one is selling goods to overseas purchasers they must arrive at their destination in good condition. If they do not, the purchaser will <Col N="377" /> not accept them because they are of no benefit.  We have a lot to learn in this area.</P>
    <P>The people involved in the licensing of boats for the movement of cattle must be properly trained.  I accept there has been substantial losses of cattle but that cannot be attributed to abuse or negligance on the part of farmers.  Ships carrying cattle are not properly structured for this purpose.  I am talking about boats with a capacity for carrying 2,000 head of cattle.  I assure this House that no farmer worthy of his name would abuse his animals but negligence can occur because of various difficulties that can arise on a farm through old age, etc.</P>
    <P>Shipping cattle from this country is a whole new area for us and we must consider the knowledge that shipping companies have in caring for animals on journeys lasting approximately 12 to 14 days.  Port authorities will have a role to play in this regard.  They will have to ensure that the boats carrying these cattle are properly structured with adequate facilities.  With all due respect to people working in our ports, they have very little knowledge of cattle and, in that respect, a farmers' representative, qualified in cattle husbandry, should be employed by port authorities. I would have such knowledge because I grew up on a farm and I have cared for animals.</P>
    <P>I recently visited a boat which I believe would be suitable for the transportation of cattle but I would like to be assured that that boat had the facilities to carry sufficient drinking water and fodder.  There is a question mark over the quality of fodder being loaded on ships for cattle leaving this country. Fodder is measured in weight, a person selling fodder will guarantee the weight, but what about its quality?  That must be borne in mind but the ports authorities will not understand this.  Quality fodder is not necessarily heavy fodder but if one is selling it by weight, it would be very easy to add water to the fodder to make up that weight.  Good fodder with water added will soon begin to <Col N="378" /> overheat and the result is poison.  If animals become ill while being shipped abroad, the fodder being provided to them should be examined because that is probably where the problem lies.</P>
    <P>The number of cattle per pen during transportation should be decided by the weight of cattle.  If 11 500 kilograms cattle can fit in a standard sized pen, one would need a larger pen for 14 similarly sized cattle.  The manner in which our animals are exported is giving us a bad name and we need to ensure that the best facilities are in place for these exports, which are of vital national interest.  This major export market is vital to the farmers in my constituency and in the region.  There is an old saying in the cattle business that it takes the live trade to keep the dead trade live. The farmer benefits from competition between exporters of live cattle and the meat factories.  Harbour boards dealing with the export of live animals should have a farmer representative to ensure there are proper facilities for the animals.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important to create a good impression at our harbours.  I am very impressed with the reception areas and facilities at Rosslare Harbour.  I am also impressed by the ease and speed of disembarkation and the facilities available onshore for passengers.  That has to be the yardstick by which we judge ports around the country.  I cannot speak as favourably of Dublin Port but it would be unfair to be over critical because I have not made a close examination of it.  First impressions are very important and reception areas should be attractive.</P>
    <P>Members have mentioned the problem of drugs and I have raised this at the Joint Committee on European Affairs. The harbour authorities have a role to play in this area.  Obviously the Garda Síochána and the Customs and Excise officials are doing an excellent job.  The amount of drugs seized in recent months is frightening but I am told it is only the tip of the iceberg.  I have been told that ten times the amount that is confiscated is getting in by other means and that it <Col N="379" /> is only a decoy for the Garda and the port authorities.  It is our duty to protect our young people.  We must address this problem and work in co-operation with European Union member states to stamp out drug trading and drug dealers using this country to offload drugs for further transportation.  It is quite obvious that the market is flooded when the price of drugs has come down from £10 to £3 for a tablet.  Everybody has a role to play and the harbour authorities have to ensure proper policing at our ports.</P>
    <P>I hope my earlier comments, which are very important, will be taken on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for bringing forward this Bill so quickly. We badly needed to revise the 1946 Act. Let me express my personal thanks on behalf of the constituency of Louth for the attention the Minister has given to both Dundalk and Drogheda ports. Comprehensive proposals for the development of both ports are under active consideration.  I hope the Minister in his wisdom will sanction those proposals in the very near future.  As a former chairman of the Drogheda Harbour Authority and a board member for a considerable number of years I welcome this development.  I will probably go down in history as the last Member of the Oireachtas to be a member of that harbour authority.  Whether that is good or bad, I have that honour, but it is right that Members of the Oireachtas should not be involved in the type of organisation that is proposed in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With all due respects to the officials from the Department of the Marine, with whom I have dealt on many occasions and found courteous and helpful, I believe bureaucracy stymies initiative and does not allow for the type of flexibility needed in modern trading. For example, we have never been able to improve the facilities at either Drogheda or Dundalk harbours to the extent that they would be able to take larger ships.  The largest ships that can <Col N="380" /> travel up the River Boyne are 95 metres and that means that larger ships have to unload at other ports such as Belfast and Warrenpoint.  That is not a good idea and does not help to secure existing or new business.  Ships are getting bigger and the question of channels in ports will have to be considered with a view to improving and deepening them to cater for the tonnage of modern vessels. It is not an economic proposition for a ship to have to dock in two or three ports to unload a portion of its cargo. I am aware that the Minister has been briefed by members of the Drogheda and Dundalk harbour commission.</P>
    <P>The Bill's proposals on membership are welcome.  I think the board has been overcrowded with local authority members.  With all due respects to my local authority colleagues, we need people on the board who are more in tune with the commercial world.  I welcome the proposal to have a worker director on the board.  I expect a docker representative.  It is important in this era of high powered mechanisation to have a link between the workforce, the shippers and the business community.  The original idea was that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions would nominate people to the board but party representation became more important than trade union representation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>Statistics are not currently maintained in such a manner as to permit compilation of the number of offenders in custody whose crimes were committed while on bail or the number of such offenders who were subsequently granted temporary release.  They could only be compiled through an examination of the individual records of each offender and this would involve the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time.  In all cases where temporary release is being considered, regard is had to a number of factors including the offenders's previous record, the nature and circumstances of the offence, the length of sentence, the length of time served, behaviour while in custody and the safety of the public. The commission of a crime while on bail is one of the factors taken into account in assessing suitability for temporary release.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister now satisfied that the equipment and resources available to the Garda Síochána are inadequate to deal with parliamentary questions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I indicated previously I am not satisfied with the way in which statistics have been kept for a number of years, including all the years during which the Deputy's party was in Government.  There is now a full time research person attached to the Garda college in Templemore working on preparing and gathering of statistics.  A proposal being implemented in my Department is the introduction of information technology to all Garda stations on a <Col N="382" /> three year basis.  This will allow for easier access to the type of information that is more and more sought in the Dáil. The Deputy is right that it is not satisfactory that figures like this cannot be drawn out, but something is now being done to improve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It will come as a major surprise to the general public that I cannot even find out from the Minister how many people who were guilty of, for example, sexual offences were given temporary release this year.  As the number of crimes committed by people on bail has risen from 2,495 in 1990 to 4,416 in 1994, will the Minister accept that the time has come to introduce legislation to end the process of temporary release for prisoners who have committed crimes while on bail?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that people who are in prison for sexual offences are, broadly speaking, not considered for early or temporary release except on the rarest of occasions &mdash; I do not have the figures here for that.  I stress that temporary release includes everything from a two-hour period to attend a funeral, visit a grave or attend a doctor.  The number of people allowed out on temporary release for reasons such as those would be very large.  Last year's figures indicate that about 2,700 prisoners a year are given full temporary release and, in addition, 2,800 are granted varying lengths of renewable temporary release.  Those two categories would not be added together because the figures coincide.  Since the beginning of 1995 there have been approximately 50 to 60 releases a week &mdash; these are temporary releases for a range of activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to whether someone who is in prison for committing a crime while on bail should be released, that issue, along with the question of the safety of the public, behaviour while in custody, the length of time served etc. is taken into account when consideration is given to an application for temporary release.  I hope before the end of my <Col N="383" /> term in Government we will have a better way of obtaining the statistics and figures Deputies seek.  I suffered the same frustration while I was on the Opposition side of the House, but with the introduction of information technology and the availability of a research person, I hope these figures will be more readily available; there are figures available but they are always one or two years out of date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me rephrase my question to the Minister with a view to getting a direct answer.  Does the Minister intend to introduce legislation to prevent full temporary release for a person serving a sentence of imprisonment in respect of an offence committed while on bail?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

I had already received the response from the other two groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I require a little time to reflect on the responses received but I hope to be in a position to meet the three groups before <Col N="384" /> the end of this month to indicate how I propose to proceed.</P>

I do not propose, nor would the Deputy want me to, to debate and negotiate publicly with him the details of those reports.  I am as concerned as anybody else to bring this dispute to an end.  If the solution were as simple as the Deputy seems to think, why did the last Minister not solve this dispute?  The solution is not simple.  What I want is to ensure that we have a Garda association, a body that commands the respect of all gardaí in that rank.

I agree it is time the dispute was brought to an end but it will not be resolved by driving the parties to litigation.  For that reason.  I proceeded in the way I thought was in the best interests of good industrial relations in trying to bring the parties together.  I have often discussed the matter with the Garda Commissioner who advises me that Garda operations on the ground are not affected by the dispute in that the professionalism of the gardaí wins out in the performance of their duties over any personality clashes that might exist.</P>

      <P>However, I understand from the Attorney General that solicitors acting for individuals comprehended by the Deputy's question have sought payments to their clients in the circumstances referred to by the Deputy.  I also understand that the Chief State Solicitor has written to the solicitors acting on behalf of those persons informing them that there is no liability in law in respect of their claim....

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am currently reviewing the whole question of the payment of fines and debts.  My aim, in line with the commitment in the Policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> is to ensure that the system of collection of fines and debts is as effective as possible, while at the same time continuing to ensure that the sanction of imprisonment is used only as a last resort.</P>
      <P>There are already, of course, safeguards in place so as to avoid the possibility of unnecessary imprisonment.  At present, courts must, when imposing a fine, take into account the means of the offender.  In the case of refusal to obey a court order to pay a debt, the court may only commit the debtor to prison where it is satisfied that the refusal is wilful and not merely a result of inability to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am considering whether a system could be devised which would enhance the efficient and effective collection of fines and debts while at the same time providing a practical and realistic method of payment for offenders and debtors.  I have in mind a system of attachment of income, where a court could order fines or debts to be deducted from a person's income.  This would ensure the collection of the amounts due in a way which would be <Col N="391" /> manageable for the offender and debtor and which would avoid consideration of the option of imprisonment.</P>
    <P>I am also looking at the related question of payment of fines by instalment. There is a certain overlap between this and an attachment of income scheme which is a type of payment by instalment. As not everyone who could benefit from paying by instalment has an attachable income, the possibility of a parallel system of payment by instalment is also under review.</P>
    <P>The various options I am considering would require legislation.  I can assure the House that, when I have concluded my examination of all of the issues involved, I will waste no time in bringing before it any proposals for legislative change which I and the Government believe are desirable.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement that she is considering the introduction of a system of payment by instalments and attachment of earnings.

      <P>The Garda spend a great deal of time collecting fines but these are part of the judicial system and they are imposed on people who do not have car tax, car insurance etc.  There is an onus on the Garda to implement the wishes of the courts by ensuring the fines are paid.</P>
      <P>In a number of instances on-the-spot fines can be imposed but they cannot be imposed for traffic offences.  I will consider this system during my review of how best to deal with fines, the time it takes to collect them and the number of people who evade the payment of fines imposed on them by the courts.</P>

      <P>Given that approximately 6,000 petitions are sent <Col N="392" /> to the Department of Justice annually, what does the Minister intend to do about the petitions which were being processed but not finalised prior to the Geoghegan judgment and the petitions which have been received since that judgment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Justice Geoghegan's judgment did not do away with the system of petitions but it clearly indicated that it should be implemented in the way proposed by the legislators in the 1950s, that is sparingly and only in very special circumstances.  I have been using that method since I took up office, which was prior to Mr. Justice Geoghegan's decision, and I will continue to do so.  In the letters I have written since the judgment I have indicated that my decisions will take into account Mr. Justice Geoghegan's judgment and that the granting of a petition is without prejudice to the powers or rights of the Garda to implement a fine if they so wish; that the opening of a petition does not automatically stop the Garda from carrying out that duty.  I will continue to implement the system in the most sparing and thoughtful way possible and I will seek additional information from the Garda in the reports they send to me on the petitions.</P>

      <P>I previously answered a more substantial question on petitions. This question does not relate to petitions and I do not have the information I gave on the last occasion.  Suffice to say that when one is considering a petition one has the option to ignore it an send it back, mitigate the fine in some way or allow additional time for payment. All those options are available to me when considering a petition.  In my reply to the previous question I gave a list of the fines I had handled since I took office.  In approximately 70 per cent of cases I sent back the petitions, in a smaller percentage of cases I gave people additional time to pay and in a few cases I mitigated the fine.  As the person is not legally represented in court, the court is not always in a position to know his or her income or circumstances when a decision is being handed down.  I assure the Deputy that I was not in any way making a judgment on any previous Minister, that is a matter for somebody else.  This arose during the term of office of the previous Minister and the judge made a judgment on four specific cases she had dealt with. The judge referred to that Minister and I am not making any case for her or any other Minister.  I will implement the system in a sparing and caring way.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>the plans, if any, she has to train gardaí to drive heavy goods vehicles in order that the rate of detection of defective vehicles could be improved: and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[10431/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a two week driving course on heavy goods vehicles, rigid vehicles, is provided in the Garda College, Templemore.  The course is provided on request and is aimed at members attached to the traffic corps principally in Dublin, who are engaged on tow-away duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A week long course on the detection <Col N="394" /> of defective heavy goods vehicles is provided in the Garda College for all members attached to the traffic corps and public service vehicle units.  This course does not involve instruction in the driving of such vehicles and is considered by the Garda to be adequate to enable them to enforce road traffic legislation in relation to heavy goods vehicles.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>A two week course is totally inadequate.  If these vehicles are stopped for any reason gardaí have no expertise to detect whether they are defective.  As can be seen from statistics, quite a number have been involved in accidents and usually the local PSV inspector is the only person competent to check the vehicles.  It would be more prudent to have trained gardaí who can spot vehicles before an accident occurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda assure me that it is not necessary to be able to drive a heavy goods vehicle to detect one that is defective.  The course gardaí undergo in Templemore concentrates on the skills required to identify defects in vehicles.  The Garda inform me it considers it adequate to enable gardaí to enforce the law.  In 1993-94, 220 members took that course in Templemore. The figures available from the annual report of the Garda Síochána for 1993 show that the number of offences of driving a dangerously defective vehicle in which proceedings were taken totalled 253 resulting in 107 convictions. Whatever training they are getting is enabling gardaí to catch and convict people who are driving defective vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with what the Minister has said because my information is that gardaí are trained in regard to heavy goods vehicles only to detect defective lights, indicators and so on.  Would it not be more prudent to train more gardaí?  Department of <Col N="395" /> Transport, Energy and Communications officials, in co-operation with the Garda, are empowered to stop vehicles and check them for overloading, tachographs etc.  If a certain number of gardaí had this expertise it would dramatically reduce the number of accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The strength of the traffic corps in Dublin is 104 &mdash; a chief superintendent, a superintendent, three inspectors, eight sergeants and 91 gardaí.  Outside of Dublin the strength is 209: one inspector, 32 sergeants and 176 gardaí. The Garda informed me they are responsible for their deployment.</P>
      <P>Approximately 330 members of the force are engaged primarily in traffic related duties.  The Deputy made the point that some gardaí are unhappy with the training they are getting.  I will take that point on board and pass it on to the Commissioner to ensure that the training helps them to detect defects.  I would not care to think it only helped them to detect broken lights.  We could all do that without going to Templemore to undergo training.  I will pass on the concerns which were obviously passed to the Deputy by some gardaí who know something about the course.</P>

      <P>Perhaps we could take a leaf from our colleagues in England who are governed by the British Transport Commission Act, 1949.  We are not in a position to have our own transport police and I take the Minister's point about the traffic corps but it does not deal specifically with the matters I am trying to draw to the Minister's attention relative to heavy goods vehicles. Perhaps the Minister will give consideration to setting up a unit within the Garda?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only repeat what I have said.  In 1993-94 a corps of 220 members took this course in Templemore. Some 220 members who have done this course to enable them detect <Col N="396" /> defects in heavy goods vehicles are scattered throughout the country.  I will pass on the Deputy's concerns to the Garda Commissioner and ascertain if there is a need to strengthen the course being given at Templemore.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>the plans, if any, she has end the unqualified right to silence of crime suspects; if she will consider introducing legislation to provide that a judge or jury should be entitled to draw an inference where a crime suspect refuses to answer certain questions put to them by gardaí during questioning; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>While under our criminal law the general rule is that a person is not required to answer any questions in connection with an offence of which they are suspected, it is not correct to say there is an unqualified right to silence. The general rule &mdash; which is in line with a general constitutional protection against self-incrimination &mdash; is subject to a number of statutory exceptions.</P>
      <P>The most recent of these were included in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.  Sections 18 and 19 of that Act allow a court or jury to draw inferences from an accused's failure or refusal in the course of Garda questioning to account for certain matters: marks on his or her person or clothing or presence in the vicinity of a crime.  These inferences cannot be drawn unless the accused was told in ordinary language what the effect of failing or refusing to provide the relevant information might be.  While inferences can be treated as amounting to corroboration of other evidence the Act specifically provides that they cannot alone form the basis of a conviction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will appreciate that in this <Col N="397" /> area of our law conflicting and competing rights are at issue.  On the one hand, it is argued that the right to silence is an old and very important protection of a suspect's rights and that its removal could place in jeopardy those innocent of any crime.  On the other hand, the concerns which have been increasingly expressed in recent times to the effect that the present situation helps those involved in very serious crimes to avoid conviction require that at the very least the law in this area is constantly kept under review in the light of changes that have taken place in the nature of crime and the nature of society.</P>
    <P>It is only right to sound a note of caution in relation to any possible change in the law in this area: there are clear limits to what any such changes could achieve.  In particular, it is difficult to imagine any change in the law in this area which would not continue to provide that inferences from silence alone are not a sufficient basis for a conviction. In other words other evidence linking the suspect to the crime would also have to be available.  I mentioned this not to indicate any unwillingness on my part to consider further changes in the law in this area but to emphasise that we should be realistic about what such changes might achieve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>No one in this House would accept that on silence alone should a person be convicted.  Is the Minister aware of views expressed by certain members of the Judiciary, during the past few months, on the right to silence?  In effect they have made public statements from the Bench in regard to the more or less unqualified right to silence and have exhorted us to make changes.  Will the Minister say whether, in any of the communications or meetings she has with the Judiciary from time to time, they have expressed this view?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in an article on 16 April 1994.  The Garda Commissioner also talked about this in an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> in September 1994 in which he queried the effectiveness of Garda questioning of suspects where they must first tell suspects that they have a right to silence.  He has made some suggestions which will be included in my review of the law on the right to silence.  In my meetings with the judges to date I cannot recall that any of them specifically raised that issue, because it was not the reason for my meeting them.  I am aware that a number of judges feel the right to silence should be restricted and it is possible to make changes in the right to silence that would not interfere with a person's constitutional right not to incriminate himself but would ensure that hardened criminals do not use this right to avoid prosecution.  We must also get other evidence to prosecute them but it is an area I am keeping under review.</P>

I intend to present comprehensive proposals to the Government shortly to ensure that criminals will not be able to get away <Col N="399" /> with flouting the law because they have the money to buy the best advice and because they are never found anywhere near the scene of a crime although they are pulling the strings.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that it is most unhelpful &mdash; all of us commit this sin &mdash; to use the term &ldquo;right to silence&rdquo;?  No one is suggesting that a person should be tortured to extract answers.  It is legal fiction that silence cannot give rise to an inference or that the failure of the accused to give evidence at his own trial cannot be held against him.  Does the Minister accept that there has been a dramatic change in the public's perception of this issue?  Will she look at the reports of the English Criminal Law Reform Committee in which some interesting proposals are made?  It suggested that an accused person should be made liable to testify at his own trial and that a jury should be allowed to draw an adverse inference if he fails to do so.  As it is most unsatisfactory to be told that a matter is under constant review and that there will be developments shortly, will the Minister outline the timeframe within which proposals will be presented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there has been a dramatic change in the public's perception of some of these issues, including the right to silence and bail.  Heretofore it would not have been envisaged that the mood of the public would change, that these would prove damaging rather than protect innocent people.  The Deputy, who is a lawyer, rightly said that inferences may be drawn if a person remains silent or fails or refuses to account for marks on the person or clothing or their presence at the scene of a crime.  However, further corroborating evidence is required.  While the <Col N="400" /> mood of the public may have changed they would not accept that a person who remains silent should be prosecuted where there is no corroborating evidence. Therefore, we must strike a balance in restricting the right to silence.</P>
      <P>The changes proposed in England are being examined in the Department.  The Garda Commissioner has suggested that a procedure could be introduced whereby suspects would be subject to cross-examination by an independent person.  In a Bill introduced in 1994, either by the Deputy or Deputy O'Donnell, the Progressive Democrats suggested that this could be done in the District Court.</P>
      <P>I cannot outline a timescale within which I will present proposals to the Government.  A number of issues are being examined and I hope to bring this examination to finality very soon.</P>

      <P>I will not refer to any person outside the House.  I agree with the Deputy that we need to strike the right balance.  Under the legislation introduced in 1983 or 1984 inferences may be drawn where a person refuses to account for their presence at the scene of a crime, or for marks on the person, or clothing.  That legislation was the subject of a lively debate and amendments were made thereto.  Some Members were concerned that we were going too far in restricting the right to silence. However, we have come a long way since then.  The public would now like to see some changes but we must strike a balance to protect innocent people who, for one reason or another, do not wish to speak while being questioned or where there is some impediment which prevents them from doing so.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be referring to a recent newspaper article which attributed to the Governor of Mountjoy Prison certain views about the introduction of a methadone maintenance programme.  My policy in regard to methadone maintenance is developed in consultation with all relevant interests, including, in particular, medical interests and is implemented by those interests.  Any decisions taken will be based on such consultations.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to introduce a methadone-based treatment programme for short term prisoners who have been part of such a programme prior to committal. Appropriate arrangements are being finalised to enable this to be done in the medical care unit of Mountjoy, probably from the end of the current year.</P>
      <P>The policy in relation to long term prisoners and also for those short term prisoners who have a drug dependency problem but who are not on methadone maintenance, is to provide humane detoxification and I am currently preparing the necessary plans to advance this proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>One should be careful about using an emotive term such as that.  Drugs are being brought into Mountjoy Prison and other prisons.  I will outline some of the steps I have taken since coming into office to deal with this matter, one of which was the cause of some hilarity when I announced it, but sometimes very simple practical measures will cut down on the availability of drugs in prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the Deputy knows little about this matter.  One of the main ways in which drugs became available in Cork prison was by being hurled over the walls from a neighbouring industrial estate.  I provided resources to put a net on top of the wall and also to erect a more secure fence around the indusrial estate to ensure that access point is cut off.</P>
      <P>Workers are at present finishing the building of a search room in Mountjoy. Unfortunately, a number of visitors bring drugs into the prison.  To introduce a system whereby visitors are denied access to prisoners would be inhumane &mdash; we may have reached the stage where such a step is necessary &mdash; and very often visitors help prisoners to rehabilitate.  We have introduced a special search room whereby after each visit prisoners are individually searched fully &mdash; I use that word very carefully &mdash; to ensure they have not had access to drugs during the visit.  Prisoners going out on remand or attending court will also be searched upon return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not a fool; I believe it is not very easy to fully ensure that drugs are not brought into prisons.  The fact that a person can carry £500,000 worth of <Col N="405" /> ecstacy in a bag in their pocket gives an idea of the scale of the problem, but I am determined to do what I can to deal with it.  A number of steps have been taken such as raising barriers in the visiting room, installing closed circuit television cameras and preparing a separate room in prison for prisoners who are known to receive drugs.  Those prisoners are denied visits for some time and when they resume they take place in a very closed secure area where there is a glass barrier between them and their visitors.  This is not a matter on which I have given up.  I have taken steps since coming to office and will continue to take steps to resolve the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for reminding me of that matter.  Another part of my proposals is to provide a detoxification unit and preparations are currently under way to make such a unit available.  We are also looking for space for a drug-free unit so that prisoners who are drug-free when they come into prison or become drug-free while in prison will be able to serve their sentences in a very secure unit where they will not have easy access to drugs.  I am adopting a multi-faceted approach to cut down on the amount of drugs brought into prisons.  Mountjoy is the prison to which all prisoners are remanded and therefore there are hundreds of movements in and out of that prison every day.  Despite the difficulties involved, the prison officers do a mighty <Col N="406" /> job in trying to cut down on the amount of drugs being brought into the prison.</P>
      <P>I recently received the Mountjoy Prison report, a matter which Deputy Byrne raised on an Adjournment debate.  A number of the issues proposed by the prison visiting committee are already in train; some measures were implemented by my predecessor, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, and I have implemented others since coming into office.  As these methods are applied, I hope there will be a reduction in the amount of drugs in prisons.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister believe that a detoxification unit would be adequate for the scale of the problem that exists?  Is she aware that at a recent prison officers' conference it was stated that up to 50 per cent of the inmates of Mountjoy are offenders who are addicted to drugs?  In the light of her plans for future capital building programmes, rather than talking about a detoxification unit will the Minister consider, as has been suggested by me and Deputy O'Donoghue, the building of a secure residential detoxification centre, indeed a whole jail, for that category of offender?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Drugs are brought into prison by visitors as well as prisoners who are out for court cases and so on, by secreting them, all over their bodies and inside their bodies.  Any search that is effective in ensuring that drugs in very small packets &mdash; a very small packet of drugs can be a very large amount of substance for addicts &mdash; are not brought <Col N="407" /> into prison must include physical body searches.  There is a system in prisons where prisoners can wear their own clothes; they got that right some years ago.</P>
      <P>One of the new facilities that has been completed in Mountjoy is a laundry which will cut down on the need to send clothes out to be laundered.  Every article of clothing which is washed by a prisoner's relative must be searched when it is brought back.  I do not have to spell out how easy it is to hide a small packet of heroin or other dangerous drug substance in seams and pockets of clothes.</P>
      <P>I am making a start of course.  I do not believe that one small detoxification unit will be adequate to cater for the number of drug abusers who, sadly, end up in our prisons, but I intend to start that process, with a number of other mechanisms, to try to reduce the level of drug abuse in prisons and to give prisoners, particularly those serving long sentences, an opportunity to leave prison clean.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister probably knows that I am a hardline advocate of the use of the a methadone maintenance programme to treat drug abusers.  I do not believe the Minister fully understands or appreciates the complex nature of drug addiction as she said that a methadone programme will only be available to short term prisoners who were already on such a programme before entering prison.  Will she agree that about 80 per cent of the crime on the streets of Dublin is committed by drug addicts who ultimately end up in Mountjoy Prison?  Will she also agree that her humane detoxification programme is useless in so far as detoxification treatment will not cure an addict who will have a natural desire to demand illict heroin and Mountjoy Prison is awash with it?  Unless the Minister is determined to allow short and long term prisoners who are drug abusers regardless of whether they were <Col N="408" /> on detoxification methadone maintenance programmes in the community, access to an integrated detoxification programme in the prison system, she will fail.  Does she not consider that in the prison system legislators have an obligation to rehabilitate drug addicts hooked on illicit drugs and that the best way forward is to ensure that when they are reintegrated into society they are on a methadone maintenance programme and will not need to steal from &mdash; or mug &mdash; tourists visiting this country?</P>

      <P>My objective is to ensure that offenders who enter prison drug free will not leave it as drug addicts and that on entering prison criminals on drugs &mdash; a captive group &mdash; will be given every treatment available to try to break their habit.  As I said, I am anxious to introduce immediately a methadone maintenance programme for prisoners because those who were already on one prior to entering prison would lose the benefit gained from such treatment if there was no programme in prison. People who deal with drug addicts and drug abusers advise that it is better for such people to participate in a detoxification programme for a period of time rather than to develop a dependency on a substance like methadone.</P>

I bow to the Deputy's superior knowledge of some treatment methods.  I am working on putting in place a drug treatment system which previously did not exist in Mountjoy Prison.  I am sure I can deliver <Col N="409" /> on providing methadone treatment for prisoners who were on such treatment before entering prison and set up a detoxification unit to ensure that prisoners who are drug abusers can avail of methadone or detoxification treatment.</P>

      <P>Did I understand the Minister correctly, that it is her intention to provide a room in Mountjoy Prison in which all prisoners returning from the courts will be strip searched and that there will be a pattern of internal and external body searching to prevent the importation of drugs into the prison?  Will body searches apply to all prisoners or only to those suspected of carrying drugs?  If they applied to all prisoners it would quickly result in chaos.  What is the sense of having such a strict regime for prisoners returning from the courts to Mountjoy Prison when, because of existing arrangements, it is possible to have bodily contact with visitors?</P>
      <P>In those circumstances will she agree that all the measures she intends to introduce effectively amount only to a drop in the ocean in terms of responding to the urgency of the problem? Will she agree it is not sufficient to say she is making a start?  This House should be told that within two years there will be as effective an end as possible to the drugs problem in our prisons. Will she agree to set a deadline by which she will ensure there will no longer be illegal drugs in our prison system?</P>

As Deputy Byrne said, about 50 per cent of alleged offenders who end up in our courts and subsequently in our prisons are drug abusers and, unfortunateley, the drug problem is brought into the prison system. I will set a target on this issue.  By the time the term of office of this Government ends, and it must end by November 1997, there will be major changes in our prison system and the prison visitors' committee will not have to submit the type of report it presented in 1994.</P>

      <Quest>the average length of custodial sentence imposed for crimes in the most recent year for which figures are available; the average length of time actually served in custody; her views on public concern at the prospect of criminals, particularly those who have committed violent crimes, being released before their sentence has been completed; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The average length of custodial sentence imposed for crimes in 1992, the latest year for which statistics are available, was approximately 11 months.  Statistics are not readily available which would show the relationship between temporary releases and the length of sentences served.  Such statistics could be compiled only through an examination of the individual records of each offender and this would involve the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time.</P>
      <P>Temporary release may be granted by the Minister for Justice under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1960.  Before granting temporary release the Minister has regard to a number of factors.  These include the circumstances of the offence, the length of sentence imposed by the court, the length of time served, behaviour while in custody, the previous record of the offender and whether the granting of temporary release would be likely to pose a threat to the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A system of review meetings is operated at all the prisons and this enables the views of the various agencies dealing with an offender, such as prison staff, <Col N="412" /> chaplains and the probation and welfare service, to be fully taken into account.</P>
    <P>If temporary release is granted it is always subject to conditions.  In all cases there is the condition that the person released must be of good behaviour. Other conditions could include supervision by the probation and welfare service, reporting at regular intervals to a Garda station, etc.  Temporary release automatically ends if any conditions are breached in which event the individual concerned can be immediately returned to custody without warrant or without any court proceedings.</P>
    <P>Temporary release arrangements are in effect our system of parole which is a feature of prison systems worldwide. Paroles are an important vehicle for reintegrating an offender into the community in a planned way.  While due regard must be had to any risk which a particular release might pose, the generally accepted view is that the risk to the community would be even greater if, in certain cases, attempts at planned reintegration of offenders were not made since they must return to the community, anyway, on the expiry of their sentence.</P>
    <P>For the avoidance of any doubt on the matter, I am not suggesting that the temporary release arrangement now in place cannot be improved on.  The Deputy will probably be aware that the five year plan for the management of offenders, published by my Department a year ago freely acknowledged &mdash; at chapter 5 of the document &mdash; that certain changes were desirable and would be implemented.  Implementation of these plans is now under way, in consultation with all the relevant interests involved.</P>

While I do not doubt the Minister's wisdom or sincerity, does she <Col N="413" /> agree it is difficult for politicians to convince constituents that there is a proper prison regime in place when people sentenced to a term in prison do not serve the full term?  Is she aware that at almost every Neighbourhood Watch meeting people cite chapter and verse about individuals given long custodial sentences being allowed out in a short time?  How can we resolve this difficulty? Does the revolving door syndrome and the temporary release system simply facilitate prison overcrowding?  Does it act as a vent for an otherwise explosive scenario?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The tempory release system is used for a number of reasons, not least to deal with overcrowding in prisons.  There are approximately 2,200 people in prisons at any one time and I am sure Members will not be surprised to hear that a number of them are released before completing their sentences. For that reason proposals are in place to increase the number of prison places.  Temporary release is also granted for humanitarian reasons, but I do not know the circumstances under which the person about whom the Deputy spoke was released to attend a funeral.  Temporary release is frequently granted to prisoners, even those serving long term sentences, to attend funerals or visit sick relatives.  The prison authorities receive hundreds of requests from prisoners every month for temporary release but many of them are refused.  On entering prison almost all prisoners apply for temporary release to visit people outside, but such release is not granted as freely as people believe. Each case is examined separately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot envisage a time when a Minister for Justice will abolish the temporary release system, but I hope I can eliminate the element of the system that allows temporary release for no reason other than to provide a prison space for another criminal.  I would like to introduce a system under which prisoners would serve the full term of their sentence but, unfortunately, because of the <Col N="414" /> number of prison spaces available that is not practical at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is farcical that people are sent to jail for non-payment of fines of, say, £25 at a time when we operate a revolving door syndrome.  Having regard to the recent talk about changing our bail laws and the right to silence &mdash; changing the system to provide for more people going to jail &mdash; would the Minister agree to put her resources in one basket and provide a prison network, run by prison authorities, under which those who fail to pay meagre fines would be put on community service work and hardened criminals sent to jail?  It is unacceptable that hardened criminals are allowed back on the streets, through the revolving door syndrome, having served only a few months of what was a substantial prison sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct, there is a need for more prison places and I propose to provide them.  The prison system and the question of dealing with offenders is not as simple as the Deputy suggests.  It is a myth to imply that our prisons are full of people who have not paid fines of, say, £25.  Figures indicate that at any time approximately 0.2 per cent of our prison population is made up of people who have not paid a fine or a debt.  While I was very unhappy about the recent high profile case in this regard, such people do not normally go through the prison system.  There are other ways of punishing those who do not pay fines and I am considering introducing legislation to deal with such people.  If a person does not pay a fine within a specified period, the courts may decide that person should serve up to 15 days in prison but, even if they are sent to prison, very few serve that length of time.  They also become the subject of the revolving door syndrome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that what I stated today is not the correct way of tackling the problems in our society and I have made efforts to improve the present system.  I do not want hardened criminals sentenced by <Col N="415" /> our courts released before serving their full sentence.  Society expects such people to serve their full sentence.  More people could be put on community service work and monitored under the probation and welfare service or the juvenile liaison scheme.  There are other methods by which people can pay the price to the community for crimes they have committed which would not necessitate their being incarcerated in our prisons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree it would be very simple if, every time the governor of a prison filled out a temporary release form, he got the relevant prisoner to sign it and filled out a separate document showing how much of the sentence has been served, how much remains unexpired and sent a copy to the Minister's Department?  She would be in a better position to answer questions in this House if she could get that information from a two-line document.  Is she not aware that in the 1992 prison report circulated so promptly to Members recently it was stated that in excess of 2,000 young men had been committed to St. Patrick's institution where there are approximately 230 places?  This means the revolving door is spinning so fast that all of them are serving, on average, only one month.  It is very clear that the vast majority of sentences in that institution are not being served.  The Minister must know that these figures are available if she resorts to her own reports.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore) Eamon Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their positive attitude to this important and timely Bill.  This is a period of historic change in Irish ports. With the passage of this Bill, the 1990s will see a radical restructuring of our leading ports, combined with new technology on our docksides and new shipping services to our world markets.  We are seeing the implementation of probably the most far-reaching changes in port and shipping policy in the history of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is designed to allow our 12 <Col N="465" /> major harbours to grow into fully commercial and market-driven ports.  In the next five years, £135 million of Irish and European funds will be invested in the development of our major ports.  The ferry companies are responding with exciting new investments.  Irish Ferries launched their <i>Isle of Inishfree</i> service from Dublin last month; Stena Sealink will begin their high speed service from Dún Laoghaire this autumn and Irish Ferries sail into Roscoff for the first time this month.  Between the port developments and these new ships over £250 million will be spent to improve access for Ireland's trade and tourism.</P>
    <P>All these developments at sea and onshore will bring benefits to the travelling public, exporters, business and tourism, with travelling times between Ireland and the United Kingdom and the Continent being reduced.  Travelling and transport costs will become competitive to the benefit of the travelling public and shippers alike and port facilities and administration will be modern, efficient and competitive.  I am sure all Members will join me in welcoming this great progress in our ports sector.  Our commercial port traffic has grown by over 46 per cent since 1980.  As the only island nation remaining within the European Union, we are more dependent on seaports than any other member state.  We must minimise our transport cost barriers to enable us compete in the Single European Market.  We have set an ambitious target of reducing port and shipping costs in the Republic by 15 per cent in real terms by 1999.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry recently set a target for our food industry to become the primary food exporter to the UK market. This Bill shows that the Department of the Marine and the Government are serious about putting the right structures in place to meet the export challenge.</P>
    <P>I would now like to respond to some of the key points and queries raised by Members during the opening debate.  A number referred to the fact that the Bill provides far too much intervention by <Col N="466" /> the Minister for the Marine and Finance. Many of the provisions of the Bill are standard, especially those in relation to the establishment of the companies, the appointment of ministerial directors, their remuneration etc.  Provisions such as these are normally subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance.  It is not intended to depart from this practice in so far as this Bill is concerned.</P>
    <P>Likewise, borrowings by semi-State companies are subject to ministerial control, both by the Minister with direct responsibility for the company and by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The aim of this legislation is to give the new port companies more commercial freedom and flexibility in day to day matters.  The ports will, for the first time ever, be empowered to set their own rates and charges, they will be able to enter into joint ventures.  In general, they will have control of their own destinies.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to the provisions dealing with sale, leasing and acquisition of land.  Under the Harbours Act, 1946 all transactions of this nature, with the exception of short term leases, were subject to approval by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Now the companies will have to notify the Minister of all such transactions and the Minister, if of the view that a particular proposed sale or lease is not in the best interests of the harbour, may direct the company not to proceed with it.  Section 15 (1) (c) empowers the Minister to exempt specified classes of leases, sales or acquisition from such prior notification.  I envisage that minor transactions such as short leases, sales or acquisitions of small plots of below a certain value, will be exempted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith referred to section 17 (1) (h) and suggested the amount quoted was too low.  This section empowers the new port companies to invest in undertakings, other than subsidiaries, up to a limit of £250,000. Investments above this threshold will be <Col N="467" /> subject to ministerial control.  Borrowings by port companies are dealt with in section 23.  Port companies will be empowered with the consent of the Ministers for the Marine and Finance to borrow up to 50 per cent of the value of the company's fixed assets.  The value of Dublin Port's fixed assets could be in the region of £100 million.  A borrowing limit of up to £50 million is a considerable improvement on the present borrowing limit of £200,000 for Dublin Port.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh mentioned existing local authority guarantees of borrowings by harbour authorities.  I envisage such existing guarantees will remain in place.  However, future borrowings may now be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  This facility was not available under the 1946 Act.</P>
    <P>In so far as the appointment of the local authority directors is concerned, the position is that the Minister, in consultation with the Minister for the Environment, will make regulations prescribing the manner in which such directors are to be selected and by whom they are to be selected.  While no decision has been taken in this regard, I envisage that the local authority directors will be selected from among the elected representatives.</P>
    <P>The ministerial directors will in general be drawn from the professional and business community.  In appointing such directors I will be anxious to select persons with the appropriate business acumen. For this reason, I may decide to invite recognised bodies such as IBEC, the chambers of commerce, etc. to recommend persons for consideration for appointment as directors.  Though not specifically provided for in the legislation, the chairperson of each port company will be selected by the Minister. In selecting a chairperson, the Minister will choose one from the board of 12 members.</P>
    <P>Interest was also expressed by a number of Deputies on the question of how the fixed assets of the new port companies will be valued.  No decisions in this <Col N="468" /> regard have been taken to date but there will be full consultations with the harbours concerned at the appropriate time.  There are a wide variety of acceptable valuation bases which may be used in determining asset valuations, for example, historic or original cost, existing use, alternative use, depreciated replacement cost.  It is likely that different valuation bases will have to be adopted for the different classes of assets in the ports, for example, harbour walls versus floating craft, surplus versus core operating assets and so on.</P>

      <P>Deputies Browne and Byrne asked that I clarify the position on pensions I wish to assure the House that the pensions of harbour authorities' pensioners and employees are secure.  However, before deciding what action is necessary to ensure that habour authorities can meet their pension schemes requirements I need to have full information on the financial status of the ports.  As has already been said, a comprehensive study from DKM Economic Consultants has been commissioned.  On receipt of the consultants' report I will be in a position to take any necessary action, in consultation with the Minister for Finance and the harbour authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Finucane referred to the area of jurisdiction of the Foynes Harbour Trustees and suggested that it should be extended.  The Bill sets out the existing harbour limits of the 12 ports recommended for State company status.  There is also an enabling provision in section 9 (2), which empowers the Minister to <Col N="469" /> alter, by extension or diminution, the limits of a harbour.  The case for Foynes can be considered under this heading once the new legislation is in place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenneally inquired whether section 343 of the 1967 Finance act, which deals with the tax regime for ports, will be retained.  This Bill does not repeal section 343 of the 1967 Act so there is no reason it should not continue in force.  However, the tax regime under which the new port companies will operate is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  Therefore, amendment to section 343 could, at some stage be proposed by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenneally also expressed concern that the larger ports will take business from smaller ports.  The overall policy on port development is to increase competition between and within ports to drive down port and shipping charges.  However, investment in ports will be promoted only where it is established that they respond to or anticipate market needs and are not primarily aimed at displacement of traffic from competing ports.  In general, the smaller ports cater for the needs of the immediate hinterland and the advantages they provide to their customers will ensure the continued viability of these ports.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nealon's case on the future administration of Sligo Harbour was well made.  There are three options for consideration in so far as ports such as Sligo are concerned.  First, to retain the <i>status quo</i>; second, to transfer them to local authorities or, third, to establish State companies to manage them.  Each case will be considered on its merits once the new legislation is in place. There will be a full consultation with all interests concerned and submissions in this regard will be carefully and sympathetically considered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne expressed concerns that exporters are using Northern Ireland ports because of lower charges there.  While this may have been the case in the past, the situation is now changing.  Since 1989, a major development programme for ports in this State <Col N="470" /> has been in progress.  This programme involves three main elements; improvement of port infrastructure through a major investment programme &mdash; some £90 million was spent in the period 1989 to 1994 and some £135 million is planned from now until 1999; improvements in labour relations to ports &mdash; the labour relations position in Dublin has been transformed in the recent past; and third the reorganisation of the port structures as provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>This development programme is primarily aimed at reducing costs to users, in particular, to our exporters.  Both port and shipping are being targeted and our aim is to reduce costs by a minimum of 15 per cent in real terms by 1999.  This programme will ensure that our ports offer state of the art services at competitive prices.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Smith touched on the potential of marine leisure and recreational facilities to the tourism industry. The Harbours Bill applies to commercial seaports.  The primary function of the new port companies will be to provide facilities and accommodation for goods and passenger ships and their cargo, in other words, to ensure that tourists and cargo can get to and from their destinations with the least possible delay.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also create the freedom for the ports to develop recreational facilities.  Obviously, this must be done within commercial parameters.  It is my policy to encourage any such development.</P>
    <P>In summary.  I would emphasise this Bill is designed to ensure that the ports will be able to operate as truly commercial and self-sufficient enterprises, free from undue control by the State.  The reorganisation of the commercial seaports will greatly improve the ports' efficiency and effectiveness to the benefit of exporters, the agricultural and industrial sectors of the economy and our tourism trade.  The main thrust of the new legislation is to relax ministerial control while increasing accountability for operational and financial performance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="471" /> I thank all the Deputies for their constructive response to the Bill.  I will have an opportunity to consider some of the specific points made by Deputies between now and the Committee Stage debate.  Any further submissions on the legislation, in particular amendments which would make it more effective, will be taken on board and any amendments to the Bill considered justified can then be brought forward on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>A matter in the constituency that recently came to my attention is the case of Mr. Tom Sheridan &mdash; whose brother was a Member of this House &mdash; who was killed in 1920 in the War of Independence.  A very fine memorial was erected in Crossdoney at the place on the road where he was killed.  The local people who contributed to it, the committee and members of his family, maintained the memorial until recently.  His niece looks after the memorial as best she can but she is concerned that it may not be possible to do so in the future.  She is <Col N="472" /> anxious that the memorial be looked after.  As I understand it no State body undertakes this work.  The National Graves Association will look after the Sheridan memorial.</P>
      <P>The reason I have raised this issue in the House is to ask the Minister to provide funding for voluntary organisations or arrange some other way for the State to look after these memorials.  We owe a debt of gratitude to the people who gave their lives throughout the centuries for the independence we achieved on this part of the island in 1921.  I ask the Minister to ensure in future that these memorials are properly looked after. The Wolfe Tone Memorial in Bodenstown is looked after by the National Graves Association and the 1798 memorial in Tralee &mdash; which I am sure the Minister will be interested to know is sculpted by the same man, Albert Power who sculpted the Ó Conaire statue in Galway.  If the Minister proposes to use voluntary organisations I suggest they be grant-aided for specific memorials that are of national significance.</P>

      <P>As my colleague Deputy O'Hanlon outlines, there is clearly a vacuum in the arrangements for maintenance of monuments and graves around the country.  Voluntary groups have played their part in looking after these monuments but with the passage of time priorities change.  In many instances relatives and near relatives of those commemorated maintained the monuments and Republicn plots around the country.  The question of where responsibility lies when they are no longer able to do the work is at the heart of the matter raised on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy O'Hanlon states, there does not appear to be a Department with responsibility in this area.  We are inviting the Minister to consider the possibility of providing support for what is very necessary and worthwhile work. All of those commemorated have made an immense contribution to the wellbeing of the country in times gone by <Col N="473" /> and it would be negligent of this generation if they failed to honour them by looking after their monuments.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider sympathetically the points we have made.</P>

      <P>I am very grateful to Deputies O'Hanlon and Kirk for drawing the attention of the House to this important topic.  Let me assure them that I regard the matter they have raised as one of importance and I share their view.  They have asked me to deal sympathetically with it and I will as far as I can.  I concur with the sentiment that those who are honoured by memorials are people who have made it possible for us to have an Adjournment debate this afternoon. There are many others, sadly too many, whose achievements should be marked by memorials but are not.  All my instincts are similar and supportive of the sentiments expressed by the Deputies opposite and that is something we should share in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to express my appreciation of the work of the National Graves Association and other groups who voluntarily give of their time and effort to look after graves and memorials of people who gave service to this country.  The position is as the Deputies state, that a number of Ministers have varying responsibilities in relation to graves such as the Ministers for the Environment, Defence and Finance, through the Office of Public Works.  For my part, the only mechanism available under the aegis of my Department to allocate grants to local groups would be the Heritage Council, which I will be appointing before the end of this month. The Heritage Act, 1995, under which the new statutory council will be established sets out the council's terms of reference and while they are very broad, they do not seem to extend to making available the type of grant envisaged by the Deputies.  The council will, of <Col N="474" /> course, be an independent statutory body and will be free to examine any project submitted to it to determine if it comes within its statutory remit.  If it was prepared to make a proposal to me I would give it sympathetic consideration. I would like to go a bit further and there is a possibility, perhaps, of some assistance being made available by way of FÁS.  In the spirit in which this matter has been raised I am anxious to be of assistance and I will consult with my colleagues to see how this matter, which has slipped as it were between Departments during the lifetime of a number of Governments, can be dealt with and if I can I will come forward with other suggestions even those that are beyond my narrow remit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of fish kills in Cork rivers in recent weeks is devastating.  The fear is that this is only the tip of the iceberg.  We all accept that this is intolerable and cannot be condoned and allowed to continue.  The silage making season is under way but the grass is very wet and the run-off from silage is extremely hazardous.  This is a red alert situation for farmers, local authorities and everybody concerned with the environment.</P>
      <P>Farmers are very conscious of proper controls in slurry and silage pits and many have undertaken improvement works.  It must be conceded that the cost to farmers is prohibitive and in some instances upgrading the system could cost as much as £40,000.  The majority of farmers would not be able to afford this. It is foolhardy to suspend the control of the farm pollution scheme whereby grant aid is made available to farmers to adopt proper procedures for the management and erection of physical structures which ensure proper environmental controls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister will agree that as Minister for the Environment he has a <Col N="475" /> role in setting standards for environmental control &mdash; and that is quite right &mdash; because we want to preserve our green image.  The cost of environmental controls must be met by the Department of the Environment or by other Departments.  Welcome as it is that large amounts of money will be ploughed into sewage treatment plants in different parts of the country, yesterday officials of the Environmental Protection Agency appeared before the Joint Committee on Sustainable Development claiming that the vast bulk of pollution is caused by the agricultural sector.  We must therefore ask if we are putting the cart before the horse. If agriculture is our major industry and if we set store by it to increase employment, to seek niche markets for our products, it behoves us to do everything possible to maintain our green image and not put the cart before the horse. The Government is committed to sustainable development &mdash; it has set up a committee to deal with it.  It must therefore be conscious that major initiatives have to be put in place in the agricultural sector.  The suspension of the control of the farm pollution scheme must be decried.</P>
    <P>I am calling for a licensing system to be introduced through the Environmental Protection Agency.  In doing so I am conscious that the Environmental Protection Agency sets down licences for major industries.  If agriculture is the major industry here this licensing system should be extended into that area. In promoting this I am conscious that such a licensing system can be but a part of a policy of initiation which would include grant aid so that progress can be made and farmers can meet modern environmental requirements and regulations. I am aware that this cannot be done overnight but must be done on a phased basis.  If we are serious about sustainable development, about industry and about putting regulations and controls in place, we must provide the necessary resources to extend a proper <Col N="476" /> licensing system to the agricultural sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Batt O'Keeffe for raising this important matter.  The recent fish kills in the Cork area are an unfortunate reminder of the need for extreme vigilence in relation to the discharge of effluents to rivers and lakes. The summer months are the high risk period for waterways when water levels are generally lower and when accidental spillages, if they occur, will have greatest impact.  Both fish kills have their origins in the agricultural sector and are currently under investigation by Cork County Council.</P>
      <P>While these fish kills have had an immediate and well documented effect it is worth recording that the numbers of such kills have thankfully been falling in recent years.  In 1987 there were 122 fish kills and in 1989, 111.  This fell to 60 in 1991, 51 in 1992, 33 in 1993 and 31 in 1994.  The 1994 total was the lowest on record.  The present fish kills are the first recorded this year.</P>
      <P>Another feature of this overall downward trend is the decline in the level of fish kills caused by farm related activities; these were traditionally the main cause of fish kills.  Farm related fish kills fell from 85 in 1987 to three in 1993 and ten in 1994.  The fall can generally be attributed to thousands of farm surveys carried out throughout the country since 1988 by the local authorities, with co-operation from Teagasc and other agencies, at the request of my Department, which led to the identification of high and medium risk farms and appropriate remedial action programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Awareness of environmental risk among farmers has also increased and more than 30,000 farmers have been grant-aided for pollution control works under the control of farmyard pollution scheme.  Indeed the current difficulties with the CFP scheme in terms of the large volume of applicants must be seen as an indication of the greater environmental awareness of farmers which I welcome.  I fully support the efforts of <Col N="477" /> my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, to seek additional financing for this scheme and to minimise the impact of the present restrictions.</P>
    <P>Regarding legislative controls, there are already in place extensive controls under physical planning and water pollution legislation designed to deal with the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>Under planning legislation, the provision of silage pits is subject to planning permission requirements, and the provision of new, stand-alone, slurry storage facilities also needs permission. Where new animal housing is being provided, within the floor area and other exemption limits, it is a requirement that effluent storage facilities be provided as part of the development; these facilities must be adequate to serve the new structure having regard to, <i>inter alia</i>, the need to avoid water pollution. Where the conditions and limitations attached to the exemptions in the planning regulations are not complied with in these cases, the status of exempted development is forfeited.  It is a matter for planning authorities to use the enforcement powers available to them as required in the circumstances applying locally.</P>
    <P>Under the Water Pollution Acts 1977 and 1990 it is an offence to cause or permit the entry of polluting matter into waters.  Local authorities have substantial powers to regulate or restrict practices on premises, including land, which could result in the pollution of waters. These include express provision for remedial measures such as replacement of fish stocks and the making good of consequential losses incurred by any person as a result of the pollution.</P>
    <P>As regards the Environmental Protection Agency, integrated pollution control licensing of environmentally complex activities is one of the primary functions of the Environmental Protection Agency.  The full range of activities licensable under this comprehensive and modern environmental control system is set out in the First Schedule to the Environmental Protection Agency <Col N="478" /> Act, 1992.  Integrated licensing of scheduled activities commence on 16 May 1994 and is being introduced on a phased basis.  Earlier this year I extended the system to a broader range of new and established activities, and I intend progressively to extend the system to the full schedule of licensable activities.</P>
    <P>Intensive agriculture is one of the classes of activity listed in the First Schedule to the Act.  Licensing of new or established activities in this class has not yet commenced but will clearly be a matter for consideration in the context of future extensions of the licensing system.</P>
    <P>The licensing of slurry and silage pits is not included under the intensive agriculture class of activity in the First Schedule to the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.  Integrated licensing is a complex and demanding management and control system aimed at the elimination or minimisation of the effects of pollution from industry and other intensive activities which impact on more than one environmental medium.  It would not be appropriate or efficient to introduce integrated pollution control licensing for individual slurry and silage pits.  Practical considerations also dictate that pollution control of normal scale farming activities should rest with local authorities rather than the Environmental Protection Agency. The Environmental Protection Agency is a national authority with a current staff of some 120 and an intended full staff complement of less than 200. Direct licensing activity by Environmental Protection Agency must be targeted at specialised processes with complex environmental impacts.</P>
    <P>By contrast, local authorities employ some 26,500 full time staff enabling them to maintain the presence on the ground that is required to monitor a widespread activity such as farming.</P>
    <P>It was with interest that I heard the County Manager in Cork say that he would require half the Irish Army to monitor the water courses in County Cork.  That gives an indication of the <Col N="479" /> scale of monitoring required and the need for co-operation from all interests.</P>
    <P>I have made it clear that strong enforcement powers are available to local authorities and that these should be fully deployed.  At the same time, it must be recognised that regulations above are not the full answer to pollution prevention.  Awareness is also the key, and I would like to take this opportunity to again appeal to all farmers, industrialists, local authorities and others who manage effluent wastes to exercise the maximum care for the environment.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Chair for allowing me to raise the school transport service available to families in Caraun, Caraunbeg, Caraunmore, Crosse and Cloonyconaun in my constituency whose children attend the local New Inn national school.  I tabled a parliamentary question last week which was answered by the Minister for Education yesterday.  She stated that families have a reasonable and adequate level of transport service available to them.  I dispute this and on behalf of the local parents, I do not accept it.</P>
      <P>The children have a limited transport service even though they have return school bus tickets.  In the mornings they are collected at various points along the school bus route and have a satisfactory service.  Everyone readily accepts that. However, on their return from New Inn national school the service is not satisfactory. The children are collected at the school and transported to Ballyfa junction even though they have return tickets which states they are to be set down at the Rathally-Cloonyconaun junction.  As this is a dangerous junction the gardaí have instructed that the children are to be desposited at Ballyfa junction which is north of the junction aforementioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I seek in the interests of the children is rather than leave them at Ballyfa <Col N="480" /> junction, which is also dangerous, they should be left at Caraun Road junction which is westward of the Ballyfa-Loughrea Road.  The children would be within visual distance of their homes and could walk the rest of the journey.</P>
    <P>The children are collected at various points, including some of their homes, in the mornings and taken to school.  As regards the journey in the evening, the distance I am talking about is 700 metres.  The gardaí have instructed that the original deposit point is too dangerous but the children are left at a junction which is also dangerous.  Children in urban areas avail of the normal bus service to go to school.  The Department of Education pay Bus Éireann £25 million annually for the services provided in urban areas.  I am speaking about rural Ireland and it is entitled to the same treatment, within reason.  I am asking for a decision to be made in favour of the children and for the transport division of the Department to make an arrangement with Bus Éireann, which is ready to provide the service if instructed to do so, to return the children safely to the Caraun Road junction.  The parents could then rest assured that the State was discharging its duty towards these lovely young children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the absence of the Minister for Education who is presenting the Estimate for her Department before an Oireachtas committee this afternoon.</P>
      <P>One of the Minister's areas of responsibility is to ensure the safe transportation of 166,000 primary and post-primary pupils throughout the country. She also has responsibility for ensuring that the State gets the best possible value for the money it spends on the provision of the service on which, in the current year, approximately £39 million will be spent.  This figure includes approximately £4 million which Bus Éireann receives in charges from pupils who are liable for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main policy aim of the school transport scheme is to facilitate equality <Col N="481" /> of access to primary and post-primary education by providing transport to enable children who might otherwise have difficulty in doing so, attend school regularly.</P>
    <P>In the organisation of school transport services, all routes are planned to ensure that, as far as possible, every eligible pupil has a reasonable standard of service, from the point of view of timetable and distance from the route, while at the same time, ensuring that all vehicles are fully utilised in the most efficient manner.</P>
    <P>As a rule, primary school transport routes are planned so that no eligible child will have more than 1.5 miles to travel to a pick-up point.  Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way or be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route.  Home pick-ups were never envisaged as part of the scheme as the cost of providing such a service on a nationwide level would be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>The scheme, which is operated by Bus Éireann, on behalf of the Department, is examined on an ongoing basis to ensure that safety standards are maintained.  All routes are examined with regard to the suitability of the roads for the various types of vehicles used.  Safe set-down, turning and pick-up points are carefully selected, always with safety in mind.  In the planning of routes, road conditions, traffic hazards and all other aspects of safety are considered.</P>
    <P>The position in this case is that the pick-up point in the morning is different from the set-down point in the evening. Most of the children are picked up at home or at Caraun Cross in the morning. This is due purely to the fact that they are on the driver's route when he is heading from base.</P>
    <P>This concession was agreed on an incidental basis and is subject to review from time to time in the light of the number of pupils in the area offering for transport and provided that no extra State cost is incurred in accommodating them.  I should also point out that this <Col N="482" /> facility could be withdrawn in the event of the driver being changed at any stage in the future.</P>
    <P>The set-down point which is at Rathally Cross is approximately one mile from the childrens' homes.  This is considered to be a reasonable and adequate level of service in the context of the general operation of the scheme.  With regard to the safety aspect of this set-down point, Bus Éireann has advised that the road is not considered to be any more dangerous than other similar ones throughout the country.</P>
    <P>As the children involved already avail of a reasonable level of service and as Bus Éireann, which has an excellent safety record, is satisfied as to the safety of the set-down point, the present arrangement is the most that can be offered.</P>
    <P>It would, therefore, not be open to the Minister to direct the transport division and Bus Éireann to make any new arrangements to further accommodate the children in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy O'Leary.  I wish to raise the disappointing allocation of funding under Leader II to the south Kerry area.  Under Leader I, some 16 areas were designated and £35 million was allocated over a two year period. Under Leader II, some 35 areas were designated and £77 million has been designated over a five year period. Under Leader 1, £17.5 million was allocated to 16 areas per year whereas under Leader II, £15.4 million per year was allocated to 35 separate groups.  It is regrettable that the Minister allocated £21 million from his budget to Leader II.  The reimposition of centralised control is disappointing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, was quoted in <i>The Kerryman</i> on 5 May, 1995 as stating that the allocation to groups was made on the basis of population.  The programme has been diluted to the point where the level of <Col N="483" /> resources will make little or no difference to the scale of the problem in areas suffering a decline in population.  The population of south Kerry can anticipate a fourfold reduction in the level of resources from £3.06 per person per annum under Leader I to 81p per person per annum under Leader II.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is only two well aware the biggest problem experienced in rural Ireland is depopulation.  The direct linking of resources under Leader II to population base flies in the face of logic if the programme is to have any hope of addressing the real needs in rural areas.  It appears that the Minister has made a disastrous error in reducing the amount of funding available, increasing the areas and extending the duration of the disbursement of the funds.</P>
    <P>The programme appears to be little more than a political cosmetic exercise. The previous programme was a resounding success in south Kerry.  It is extremely disappointing that the level of funding has been reduced to the stage where the allocation will only be 81p per person per annum in the Leader area of south Kerry.  I very much welcome the expansion of the area but I deeply regret the decision not to increase the funding and the extension of the duration of the disbursement of the moneys to five years.  In excess of 20 per cent of the amount allocated will have to be spent on administration.  It is fair to say that the group in south Kerry managed to provide real assistance at grassroots level and created as much economic activity as possible in a very brief period.  The dilution of the funding means that once again people in south Kerry, in the Minister's constituency of north Kerry and other constituencies, will be scratching the surface.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised and shocked to learn of the meagre allocation for the Leader programme over the next five years.  Last winter meetings were held in community centres in every parish in south Kerry and the groups <Col N="484" /> were very encouraged by the promises given by the Minister of State both prior to and immediately after Christmas.  The management plan for south Kerry which was estimated to cost £8.5 million will have to be reduced dramatically.  I ask the Minister and the Minister of State to secure extra funding in the same way as other Minister secured extra funding for problems which arose in their Departments.</P>
      <P>This issue has been further compounded by the announcement of the closure of the Pretty Polly plant in Killarney with the loss of 152 jobs.  This closure will affect the Killarney and mid-Kerry catchment areas.  I ask the Minister of State to do everything in his power to secure additional funding to back up the funding from the EU and to ensure that the committees set up in every parish in south Kerry are adequately financed and are in a position to spend the money wisely, to create badly needed jobs and to help the local community.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter.  I wish to join with Deputy O'Leary in expressing my disappointment at the closure of the Pretty Polly plant in Killarney.  I hope the IDA can find a replacement industry as soon as possible as this closure impacts not only on Killarney but also in the areas in south Kerry and Castleisland.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy O'Donoghue, unfortunately the flexibility clause was abused in some cases under Leader I and as a result this very successful scheme was discredited.  The Deputy has only to read the Comptroller and Auditor General's report to see confirmation of this.  The funding under Leader II was in line with all other Government schemes and I will do my best during the review of Structural Funds to ensure that more money is allocated for this programme which is very important for rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of confining Leader II to the pilot areas already in existence, <Col N="485" /> I am sure thousands of communities would be very disappointed if the Government pursued that course of action.  I would not like to see communities which need money and help being excluded.</P>

Cordal and other areas in the south Kerry constituency, Meitheal Forbairt na Gaeltachta which includes the area from Camp to Slea Head and Ballinskelligs and the Duhallow Leader group which includes the areas around Rathmore and Gneevegulla.  When these allocations are taken into consideration the allocation per head will be increased considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Leader is the EU initiative for rural development and it provides an opportunity for rural communities to involve themselves directly in their own development.  Leader I ended in December 1994 and the Government recently selected the groups to implement Leader II.  The group selected to operate the programme in south Kerry has been approved for funding of £1.761 million.  This figure was based on an independent assessment by consultants and on recommendation made by <Col N="486" /> the officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  It was not tampered with by a political person.  I relied totally on the advice of the consultants and the experience of the officials to make the decison.  I will not take any credit for allocations with which people are pleased and neither will I take the blame for allocations with which they are not pleased.</P>
    <P>Leader is designed to complement other programmes and measures which are being funded by the EU under the Community Support Framework 1994-1999. The programme is not intended as a response to all of the problems or potential for development in rural areas and the allocation of funds to the programme and to individual groups must be seen in that context.</P>
    <P>Virtually every operational programme under the Community Support Framework has an impact in rural areas, including south Kerry.  All of the State agencies and mainline programmes of grant aid such as the supports for industry, tourism and the provision of infrastructures apply throughout the country. In this context, I would mention two measures in particular which are co-financed by the EU under the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development and which will have an impact in south Kerry and other areas.  These are the county enterprise board and the area based partnership company which are established to support integrated social and economic development with particular reference to the disadvantaged.  The approved Leader group in south Kerry is also the structure for delivering the area board partnership approach in the area.  Both of these programmes will provide significant funding for local development.</P>
    <P>Such is the range of measures and sources of funding available in most areas that we are very concerned to encourage co-operation between Leader groups and official agencies so as to ensure a co-ordinated approach to local development.  It is a formal requirment on Leader II groups, therefore, <Col N="487" /> that they demonstrate a close and harmonious working relationship with all other agencies in their area in order to avoid overlap and duplication of effort.</P>
    <P>The unique feature of Leader compared with other programmes is of course the bottom-up concept of engaging communities directly in the local development process.  Given our background of community, voluntary and cooperative involvement this is a feature of Leader I which was particularly successful. The independent evaluation of Leader I found that one of the most valuable aspects of the programme was the enormous commitment of the board members, support structures and local communities.</P>
    <P>The independent evaluation also found that the activities of Leader groups in stimulating and facilitating development through animation and capacity building was an essential feature of Leader I which distinguished it from other programmes.  We are emphasising this activitity under Leader II and it is not acceptable that groups operate as purely grant giving agents. Under Leader II there is a formal requirement on groups to engage in animation and capacity building in order to assist the local communities to help identify potential for development, to establish suitable community structures to work towards local objectives and to advise, guide and otherwise assist, including where appropriate offer financial assistance in achieving local aspirations; and advise, guide, support and facilitate individuals or small enterprises with worthwhile ideas for development.</P>
    <P>In many cases, the role of the group will be to support and facilitate the community or individual project promoter to the point where the project reaches <Col N="488" /> the development stage.  I have already indicated that sources of funding are available to support a broad range of development projects and it is not necessary to provide the Leader group with funding for each and every project idea.  A comment I frequently hear is that there are considerable resources available to support projects but that in many rural areas a more basic problem is the lack of sufficient human capital at community and individual level to generate ideas and identify and encourage entrepreneurs with potential to create employment and additional incomes. We are encouraging Leader groups to fulfil that role.</P>
    <P>Total funding for Leader II is £77 million &mdash; £54 million from the EU and £23 million in national funding.  This is a substantial increase on the Leader I funding of £35 million.  Given the benefits that can accrue to communities and the willingness of communities to participate in the programme, the Government was determined that Leader II would apply to all rural areas and this will be the case.</P>
    <P>The allocation under Leader II for the group approved in south Kerry is £1.76 million.  While this represents a reduction from the group's Leader I allocation, I am satisfied that it is substantial funding given the size and population of the area and the background of other sources of funding that I have outlined.  In view of the south Kerry group's experience of Leader I and the expertise it has accumulated, I am confident that the funding available will enable it to make a very useful and worthwhile contribution to local development in the area over the next four to five years.</P>

    <P>My other main responsibilities in the law and order area relate to the Government's response to the existing crime situation; ensuring the enforcement of the law; ensuring that the gardaí have adequate pesonnel and resources to enforce the law and to protect the citizens of the State; providing an effective courts system; updating and framing criminal legislation and the treatment of offenders, both in the community and in our prisons.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will, no doubt, be aware of the comprehensive package of law and order measures which were drawn up by my Department on foot of the recommendations included in the Corporate Strategy Document which the Garda Commissioner presented to the Minister for Justice in 1994.  These measures were designed to help the forces of law and order, particularly the Garda, the Prison Service and the <Col N="419" /> Courts, to deal with the needs of a changing society.</P>
    <P>Specific measures in this regard, included in this package, were: the recruitment of over 1,000 new gardaí over a three year period; the recruitment of 200 additional civilian employees to release an equivalent number of gardaí for operational reasons; the installation of closed circuit television cameras as an aid to policing to combat city centre crime; providing an additional 210 prison places, recruiting 50 additional probation and welfare officers and support staff over a three year period; providing additional facilities for the probation and welfare service; and the appointment of three additional judges and support staff.</P>
    <P>I am confident these measures, some of which are now coming to fruition, will be significant help to the forces of law and order over the next few years.</P>
    <P>I regard as a particular priority the need to properly address the drugs situation, because I believe that drugs are at the root of most crimes being committed today.</P>
    <P>My Department has prepared a report on important aspects of law enforcement in relation to this area and I will bring proposals to Government based on the report as soon as possible. These proposals will cover putting in place the best arrangements for achieving a cohesive and co-ordinated response to the drug trafficking problem by the existing law enforcement agencies, the need for legislative changes to assist the law enforcement response and the contribution in the health and education areas in developing strategies to reduce demand for drugs.  These proposals represent the most comprehensive set of measures ever to be put in place to tackle the drugs problem and, as such, will provide the framework for dealing with the problem for years to come.</P>
    <P>In order to successfully deal with crime, we must address the fundamental causes of crime.  In this context.  I am heartened by the success of a number of <Col N="420" /> youth diversion projects which my Department, the Garda Síochána and the Probation and Welfare Service are involved with local businesses and community groups.  These projects are aimed at identifying young persons in danger of becoming involved in crime and diverting them away from crime. This approach is in line with the thinking outlined in the report of the Interdepartmental Group on Urban Crime and Disorder which recognised the needs of our changing society.  This type of initiative is very worthwhile and I will provide additional funding over the next few years to maintain and extend these projects.</P>
    <P>With regard to the approach to the management of offenders, I should like to draw the Deputy's attention to my Department's policy document &ldquo;The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan&rdquo; published in 1994 which set out a comprehensive strategy to the whole spectrum of offender management. I am satisfied that implementation of the strategy in this five year plan will be an adequate response to the demands of our changing society in this particular field.</P>
    <P>Modern approaches to sentencing suggest that, as far as possible, prison should be avoided in favour of community sanctions and measures.  Those sentenced to a term in prison are likely in the future to have a need for more specialised help if they are to be encouraged to lead constructive lives on release.  Above all, of course, there will be a need to have sufficient prison places to accommodate those criminals for whom prison is the only option and from whom the public must be protected.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned by delays in the hearing of cases in the Courts.  The present level of these delays is too high. In this context, I am reviewing the provisions of the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1994 which has remained before the Dáil since the change of Government to ensure that the measures it contains will adequately address the need to tackle the backlog of cases to be <Col N="421" /> heard in the Courts.  I expect to be in a position to proceed with my own proposals in this regard shortly.</P>
    <P>With regard to legislative developments, I am sure the Deputy is aware of the major legislative programme which I have under way in the area of criminal law reform, details of which I have already given to the House.  This will include Bills dealing with court procedures, juvenile justice, fraud, insanity, non-fatal offences and powers of arrest. This programme will continue the process of ensuring that the Garda and the courts have comprehensive and effective powers available to deal with the modern realities of crime.</P>
    <P>The policies of my Department are kept under review to ensure that they meet with changes in crime trends or the needs of changing society in so far as my Department can meet those needs.  In conclusion, I can assure the Deputy that I am committed to taking whatever reasonable measures are required to ensure the security and safety of all our citizens and their property.</P>

      <P>First of all I would point out that my responsibility in this regard refers to my Department only and not to other Government Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general position about <i>ex-gratia</i> payments made from official funds is that details of these payments are contained in the Appropriation Accounts volume for the year in which they are made in any case where the sum paid exceeded an amount of £5,000.  <i>Ex-gratia</i> payments for smaller amounts also <Col N="422" /> arise on foot of a range of incidents such as minor accidents on Government premises involving torn clothing, personal property stolen-damaged on duty etc., but under current procedures these are not required to be itemised in the Notes to Appropriation Accounts. However, the numbers and the costs involved in these claims would be small. As regards admission of liability in relation to any <i>ex-gratia</i> payment, I should point out that where a payment is expressed to be <i>ex-gratia</i>, no admission of liability, by or on behalf of my Department, is made.  Payments made under the Scheme of Compensation for Personal Injuries Criminally Inflicted are also made <i>ex-gratia</i> following deliberation by a duly appointed Tribunal.</P>
    <P>However, I do not think any of these types of <i>ex-gratia</i> payments are the type of <i>ex-gratia</i> payment which the Deputy has in mind and, if this is the case, I can inform the Deputy that, apart from those <i>ex-gratia</i> payments already referred to, my Department has not made any <i>ex-gratia</i> payments arising out of the failure of an organ of the State or its agencies.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>The cases of persons remanded on bail which are returned to Dublin Circuit Criminal Court this month are being listed for hearing in November. This represents a delay of six months, but the six-month period includes the two-month court vacation period of August and September.  Cases involving persons remanded in custody for the offence with which they are being charged are given priority and are heard more quickly.  With regard to the Central Criminal Court the delay in the hearing of cases extends to seven months excluding the court vacation period of August and September.  Once again persons remanded in custody are given priority.</P>
      <P>Delays in the hearing of cases in all courts are subject to a variety of factors many of which are outside the control of the courts.  Cases which are listed for trial are subject to application for adjournment from either the accused or the prosecutor and indeed are often adjourned at the request of legal representatives in the interests of their clients.</P>
      <P>Having said that, however, I must now say that I am very concerned by delays in the hearing of cases in the courts and in particular delays in the hearing of criminal cases, where delays can add further to the stress of victims and &mdash; or witnesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under our <i>Programme for Government</i> we are committed to reviewing the provisions of the Courts and Court Officers Bill to ensure that the measures it contains will adequately address the need to tackle the backlog of cases to be heard in all the courts.  Since I took up office as Minister for Justice, I have dedicated a significant amount of my time to this review, consulting with the Judiciary, the county registrars, the Law Society, the Bar Council and other interested groups and I hope to be in a <Col N="425" /> position to bring forward proposals in this area in the very near future.</P>

      <P>First of all, I should state that the law or the gardaí in the enforcement of the law do not distinguish between the children of traveller families and other families, nor should it.</P>
      <P>The gardaí have power to deal with begging under a number of legislative provisions.  Under section 3 of the Vagrancy Act, 1847, every person begging, or placing himself in any public place, street, highway, court or passage to beg, or causing or procuring or encouraging any child or children to do so, is guilty of an offence.  Under section 4 of the Act, the gardaí can take into custody any person whom they find offending against the Act.</P>
      <P>Under section 14 of the Children Act, 1908, if any person causes or procures any child or young person, or having the custody, charge or care of a child or young person, allows that child or young person to be in any street, premises, or place for the purposes of begging or receiving alms, or of inducing the giving of alms, whether or not there is any pretence of singing, playing, performing, offering anything for sale, or otherwiseshall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person having the custody, charge or care of a child or young person is charged with an offence under this section, and it is proved that the child or young person was in any street, premises, or place for any such purpose as previously stated, and that the person charged allowed the child or young person to be in the street, premises, or place, he shall be presumed to have allowed the child to be in the street, <Col N="426" /> premises, or place for that purpose unless the contrary is proved.</P>
    <P>Under section 19 of the Act, any Garda may take into custody, without warrant, any person who within view of the Garda commits an offence under Part II of the Act, or any of the offences mentioned in the First Schedule of the Act, or any of the offences mentioned in the First Schedule to the Act, where the name and residence of such person are unknown to the Garda and cannot be ascertained by the Garda.</P>

      <P>From my inquiries to date, I can advise the Deputy that in 1938 a 32 nation international conference was held in Evian to seek a solution to the Jewish refugee problem.  This conference succeeded only in establishing an international governmental committee on refugees with a headquarters in London.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Taoiseach held a commemoration service for all those killed in the Holocaust on 28 April, as a mark of the Irish people's solidarity to the Jewish Community. Also, as the Taoiseach said in his address at the Joint Commemoration by the Jewish Community and the Ireland-Israel Friendship League on 26 April last:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a society we have become more willing to accept our responsibility to respond to events beyond our shores. We are today a society more willing to undertake obligations for building a better and safer world.  We have learnt that we have a role to play in <Col N="427" /> seeking to prevent persecution and war and in alleviating the suffering which they bring.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that our refugee practice has advanced over the years and that, while I am Minister for Justice, I will endeavour to ensure that it accords with the highest international standards.  This is one of the central aims of the Refugee Bill which is now before the Select Committee on Legislation and Security and the review of which is being progressed by a Minister of State at my Department.</P>
    <P>I would instance three ways in which our practice in relation to refugees is demonstrated: (i) our increased role in UN sponsored activities; (ii) Government decisions through the years to admit groups in need of the protection to the State, most recently the Vietnamese and Bosnians; and (iii) our intention (and that of the previous Government) to place our international obligations to refugees on a statutory footing.</P>
    <P>I have outlined some of the basic features of my plans in relation to refugees in the past and will be glad to develop the theme now if that is the Deputy's wish.</P>

I met representatives of the <Col N="428" /> families of victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings on the occasion of the anniversary of those atrocities on 17 May last, following which I issued a detailed statement on the outcome of the most recent Garda inquiries into those events.  I will let the Deputies have a copy of my statement, the detailed text of which was not published in the media.  Those meetings and the issue of a detailed statement on the Garda inquiry, gave effect to commitments made by myself and my predecessor in the matter.</P>
      <P>At my meetings with the families and in the statement I subsequently issued, I made it clear, at the request of the Garda Commissioner, that the Garda files on these investigations remain open, and that if any lead should emerge which might bring the culprits to justice, it would be pursued rigorously.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are, therefore, examining the most recent RTE &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; broadcast which addressed, among other issues, the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, to see if it may have produced or pointed to any new evidence that would advance their investigation of those bombings.  The Garda authorities have not concluded that examination but, once their final assessment of the significance of the programme is available, I will communicate with the representatives of the families, and also inform the Deputies who tabled these questions of the positon.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot at this stage be specific as to the Bill's content.  However, in the context of the issues raised in the question, I can say that particular attention is being given to providing the courts with a wide range of community based sanctions and measures that they will be able to impose on children found guilty of offences.

      <P>The ICCL submission was brought to the attention of my Department by the Department of Foreign Affairs only recently.

At the outset, I should point out that the facilities in this State compare very favourably with the treatment of asylum seekers in other countries, where asylum seekers may be held in special centres and where they may not receive welfare assistance on the same level as that granted in Ireland.</P>
    <P>All asylum seekers are given a leaflet which, in addition to information on the asylum examination procedure, contains information on whom they may contact for assistance in securing accommodation, welfare assistance and legal advice.</P>
    <P>Asylum seekers are allowed access to the same services and facilities as Irish nationals in similar circumstances. While they are not entitled to social welfare benefits, they receive supplementary welfare assistance, £60.40 per week for an adult, £37.50 for an adult dependant and £13.20 for a child dependant and a rent allowance which can range from £30 per week for a single person to £400 per month for a family. In addition, in most cases, the health boards will pay the deposit required in securing accommodation for an applicant. Asylum seekers also qualify for health services in the same way as Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>If one assumes that the average asylum seeker is a single person, living in private rented accommodation, then the average cost of providing assistance to such a person is £4,700 per year.</P>
    <P>Asylum seekers in Shannon are referred to the Irish Red Cross who arrange their accommodation and other needs.  While they are initially accommodated in B &amp; Bs, they subsequently tend to move on to private rented accommodation in the Ennis area or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, applicants are usually referred to either the Irish Red Cross or directly to the Eastern Health Board Homeless Unit.  They are initially housed in hostel accommodation but <Col N="432" /> subsequently they too are given assistance to find private rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>The children of asylum seekers usually attend local schools.  Voluntary groups often assist with language training and adults may attend evening classes such as vocational education committee run classes.</P>
    <P>I would also add that the reception and care arrangements for persons who are admitted to the State on foot of Government decisions &mdash; such as the Vietnamese and Bosnians &mdash; are already administered in an integrated fashion by the Refugee Agency.  This agency is state funded and was establised in 1991 under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The Irish Refugee Council also do valuable work with refugees.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any case where refugees or asylum seekers have encountered discrimination when applying for State benefits and services.  If, however, the Deputy has information regarding any discrimination she should bring it to my attention and I will have the matter investigated in liaison with other relevant Departments.  The Government has appointed a Minister of State at my Department who is responsible for reviewing the terms of the 1994 Refugees Bill and I understand that the Minister is progressing the review, which is at an advanced stage.</P>

      <P>I recently met with RGDATA to discuss the findings of their report.  Of course, I am concerned at the level and nature of crime being perpetrated against shopkeepers and their staff.  Following this meeting, I forwarded a copy of the RGDATA report to the Garda Commissioner for his views, particularly in relation to the action proposed at paragraph 6 of the report and these views are awaited.  In the meantime, I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are aware of this situation and are targeting areas of high incidence of this type of crime.  I am also informed by the Garda authorities that Business Watch was established in February 1994 under the auspices of the Crime Prevention Unit at the Dublin Metropolitan Headquarters in Harcourt Square.  It operates in conjunction with the chambers of commerce who encourage their members to participate in it.  The scheme is operated on the lines of the neighbourhood watch scheme and plans are devised through mutual co-operation to reduce the opportunity for criminals and to provide safety to shopkeepers and security for their property.</P>

      <P>Statistics are not compiled in a manner which would make it possible to distinguish those crimes which are drug-related, in the widest interpretation of the term, from those which are not.  It would not always be possible for invesigating gardaí to say for certain whether a particular crime was drug-related.</P>
      <P>Information which is available shows that of the 5,857 persons committed to custody on conviction in 1992 (the latest year for which statistics are available), 154 (2.6 per cent) were sentenced in respect of the sale/supply of drugs; possession, production, cultivation, import, export of drugs or forging/altering prescriptions or having same.  Where a person is committed under sentence for more than one offence, only the principal offence is recorded for statistical purposes.  If, therefore, there was a drug offence but it was not the principal offence it would not be included in these figures.</P>
      <P>I should add, of course, that offenders who commit offences not related to drugs but for the purpose of feeding a drug habit (e.g. larceny, trespass, forgery etc.) would not be included in these statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards reducing the incidence of drug related crime my Department has prepared a report on important aspects of law enforcement in relation to the drugs problem.  I will bring proposals to Government based on the report as <Col N="437" /> soon as possible.  These proposals will address the questions of a cohesive and co-ordinated response to the drug trafficking problem by the existing law enforcement agencies, the need for legislative changes to assist the law enforcement response and the contribution in the Health and Education areas in developing strategies to reduce demand for drugs.  These proposals will represent the most comprehensive set of measures ever to be put in place to tackle the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>With regard to community policy initiatives, I have been informed by the Garda authorities that they have drawn up a comprehensive community based drugs awareness programme and arrangements are well advanced towards its implementation throughout the country.  The programme will be operated by community gardaí and juvenile liaison officers and will involve visits to schools as well as attending meetings of community-based groups and the business community.  This programme will include the use of video and audio displays.  Extra training will be provided for those gardaí involved in the programme.</P>
    <P>The programme has been carefully devised with the objective of advising young people of the dangers of drugs and encouraging them to resist the pressures to take drugs.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also be aware of the mobile drug prevention unit which was launched in October 1994.  This has been used by the gardaí in the course of visits to various centres and communities, including schools, with the objective of raising awareness about the dangers of drug abuse and imparting advice and assistance where necessary.</P>

      <P>Juvenile offenders who meet certain conditions may be dealt with under the Juvenile diversion programme as an alternative to prosecution.</P>
      <P>These conditions are:</P>
      <P>&mdash;that the offender is under 18 years of age on the date of commission of the offence;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that the offender admits the offence;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that the offender has not been cautioned previously or, having been cautioned, the circumstances are such that it is deemed appropriate to administer a further caution;</P>
      <P>&mdash; that the parent(s) (or the guardians as the case may be) agree to co-operate with the gardaí by accepting any help or advice about the juvenile's future, or where the parents fail to co-operate, the juvenile deserves the opportunity of availing of the benefits of the programme. .le</P>
      <P>While the consent of the juvenile party is not a condition for inclusion of a juvenile offender in the programme, their views are ascertained and given due consideration.</P>
      <P>Since the programme is designed as an alternative to prosecution, it cannot be availed of in circumstances where there would be a bar to a prosecution, e.g. where the evidence would not sustain a prosecution.</P>
      <P>In the majority of cases the decision as to whether or not to include a juvenile offender in the programme is a matter for the Garda Síochána.  However, a juvenile offender involved in certain specified crimes, including sexual offences, can only be included in the programme on the direction of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all cases involving young adolescent abusers, the Garda Síochána notifies the appropriate health board in <Col N="439" /> accordance with joint procedures agreed between the Garda Síochána and the Department of Health.  The health board can then arrange for appropriate counselling and other support services.</P>
    <P>The parents of the offender will usually, either in co-operation with the health board and the Garda juvenile liaison officer dealing with the offender or through their own family doctor, arrange appropriate medical/psychological intervention.</P>
    <P>The Garda juvenile liaision officer remains in regular contact with the parents and the offender.</P>

      <P>Offenders between 16 and 18 years of age, in common with all offenders in prisons-places of detention, have access to a full range of counselling and psychological services.  These are provided for example by: doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, probation and welfare officers, chaplains, teachers, workshop instructors, Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, Gamblers Anonymous and the Samaritans &mdash; on a 24 hour, 365 day a year basis, by telephone. Full details are set out in the Department's policy document &ldquo;The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan&rdquo; published last year which also indicates improvements that are being implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Offenders between the ages of 16-18 years are held in separate accommodation for juveniles in St. Patrick's Institution and where practicable in Wheatfield. Those who are held in adult prisons are accommodated with other young offenders or with selected older prisoners.  I am, at present, looking at <Col N="443" /> ways of rearranging available accommodation to ensure that all young prisoners are kept separate from adults.</P>

A Garda research unit was recently established to undertake practical and mission-orientated research of relevance to a modern police force and it is currently carrying out a programme of research projects, one of which is examining the question of integrating the statistics compiled by the different branches of the criminal justice system.</P>
      <P>I should also add that the introduction of the new Garda information technology system, which is currently in development, will enhance the recording of crime statistics and will allow for an even more detailed analysis of the crime situation.  It will take time and expertise to get to the stage where we will have an adequate statistical base coming on stream each year.  I will progress this objective in any way I can.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the resources now in place are sufficient to enable the Garda to deal with the drugs problem.  In Dublin, drug units have been established in each of the city's five Garda divisions and their activities are co-ordinated through the Central Drugs Squad in Harcourt Square.  Full-time drugs units now operate in Santry, Cabra, Raheny, Dún Laoghaire, Crumlin, Ballyfermot, Tallaght, Store Street, Pearse Street, Kevin Street and Donnybrook.  Outside Dublin, there are drugs units in Cork, Galway and Limerick.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the issue of drugs is a matter of the highest priority for me, as Minister for Justice and in this regard I will be bringing detailed and comprehensive proposals before Government very shortly.  I can-assure the Deputy that I will see to it that sufficient resources are allocated to ensure the optimum response of the Garda to this most pressing of problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="447" /> As regards the threat posed to European society by drugs, I believe that action must be taken at the European level if we are effectively to tackle the problem and, to this end, the Government is determined to do all it can to have the issue addressed by the European Union as a whole.  In this regard, I note the excellent work of the European Drugs Unit, which is based at The Hague, and which operates under the aegis of the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers as established by Title 6 of the Maastricht Treaty.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, when responding to a recent Parliamentary Question &mdash; as reported at Columns 1602-3, Volume 449 of the Official Report &mdash; stated that the possible introduction of a national identity card in Ireland is a complex issue which would require in depth debate.  I concur with that view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that section 40 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, empowers me to provide, by way of regulations, for a national, voluntary, age card scheme as a means of helping to curb the supply of alcohol to under-age persons, i.e. under 18s.  I consider that the most acceptable and effective way of dealing with this issue is through the promotion of voluntary local age card schemes.  Such schemes backed by vigorous community involvement and with continual monitoring would seem capable of making a greater contribution to tackling under-age drinking than a single nationwide scheme.  I understand that over 100 local schemes are operating successfully throughout the country and that plans are under <Col N="448" /> way to establish new schemes in other centres.</P>

A sum in respect of C45 tax was deducted by a principal contractor from payments made to him and the taxpayer has claimed a refund of this tax.  However, due to outstanding tax returns and liabilities, it is necessary that the taxpayer's overall tax affairs be brought up to date before the question of any refund can be considered by the inspector of taxes.</P>

The results of this investigation will form the basis for phase 2 of the programme.  I understand, however, that the incident referred to by the Deputy was caused by prevailing weather conditions and circumstances which cannot always be completely guarded against.</P>
      <P>The closure of the Reading Room was necessitated by the leakage of water into the building caused by a build-up of debris in a down pipe in the vicinity. In the interests of safety of members of the public Library staff considered it prudent to vacate the premises having regard to the possibility of any electrical malfunctions.  In an effort to ensure a non-recurrence of this type of incident the Office of Public Works has now initiated a more regular system of inspections of the roofs of certain buildings including the National Library in an effort to ensure as far as practicable that there is not a recurrence of this type of incident.</P>

      <P>As stated in the White Paper on Education &ldquo;Charting our Education Future&rdquo; speical additional arrangements may need to be made to enable people with disabilities to follow third level courses without difficulty. Third level institutions will be encouraged to provide special arrangements for students with disabilities.  These will build on existing good practice and relevant research.  The Higher Education Authority will pursue a supportive and monitoring role and will actively encourage the development of such special arrangements in all institutions.</P>
      <P>The Higher Education Authority has already established a Committee on Access and Participation of Students with Disabilities in Higher Education.

      <P>Funding for the Garda building programme is provided in the Vote for the Office of Public Works and is, therefore, a matter for which I do not have direct responsibility.  However, it is one of my priorities as Minister for Justice to ensure that adequate and suitable accommodation is provided for the gardaí and, in that context, I will endeavour to ensure that maximum funding is made available for the Garda building programme consistent with the availability of Exchequer resources.</P>

I regret that in the reply to written Question No. 124 of 1 June 1995 it was inadvertently stated that I had made the appointments.  This was because of the fact that, while the appointments were decided prior to the change of Government, they came into effect after its establishment.  In preparing the reply to the original question all the appointments which came into effect within the term of the new Government were inadvertently included as having been made in its period in office.</P>
