      <P>Yesterday I expressed disappointment at the transfer of so many legitimate questions put down to the Taoiseach relating to comments he made to other Ministers.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Matters of Government policy are dealt with departmentally and if a question is asked about an area of policy which is the responsibility of a particular Minister it is appropriate that that Minister answer it.  Obviously from time to time in the course of his or her public duties the Taoiseach will attend functions where it is appropriate for him or her to speak about policy matters that come within the purview of another Minister.  If that were to be used as a basis for tabling questions about every Department to the Taoiseach, he or she would answer for the entire Cabinet. That is not desirable.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;regarding the Attorney General joining in legal action on the issue of Sellafield.  The Taoiseach is responsible to the House for the Attorney General.  I also asked the Taoiseach about comments he made in Cork about Irish neutrality.  I do not believe it is right to transfer such matters to other Ministers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will recognise that the legislative process is necessarily a slow one.  There are vacancies that need to be filled in the short term and these will be filled.  Anybody who is familiar with the courts here will realise there is a shortage of judges to deal with cases and that it is important <Col N="7" /> that judges should be appointed whenever a vacancy arises.  That will continue to be the case until this legislation is passed.  We have no apology to make for filling judicial positions in the meantime. We will continue to do so in order to assist in the pursuit of justice for litigants.</P>

      <Col N="13" /> Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I may be permitted at the beginning of my remarks to say how wrong it is that in the name of Dáil reform Members of this House are restricted in speaking on Bills of this kind.  This Bill contains 159 sections.  It covers a very wide range of taxation measures and a great many Members have an interest that goes beyond three or four of those.  To require us, in the name of Dáil reform, to compress all that into half an hour on Second Stage is wrong.  It is not an answer to say we can come back on Committee Stage, because Dáil reform means that Committee Stage is held properly in select committees.  That means a great many Members of the House do not have the opportunity to be as involved on Committee Stage as they would like.  It is a view I held while in Opposition and I hold it still on this side of the House. Some aspects of reform are driven by a certain kind of pandering to the media and are ill judged.</P>
      <P>This Bill suffers from the same faults as every Finance Bill I have seen since coming into this House, including a number that I proposed.  It is a fault in our budgetary process that we try to include too many things in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this budget and the Finance Bill there are 12 measures in relief of personal income tax, two measures that increase taxes on persons and, as far as I can count, nine taxation measures aimed at improving the situation in relation to enterprise.  All those relieving measures are, in themselves, useful. I have no doubt that they will have beneficial effects even if, as inevitably happens, one or two of them turn out, in a couple of years' time, to have a googly hidden in them which will result in us having to rewrite the legislation.  I would go so far as to say that perhaps the odd measure that increases taxation has a good deal to be said for it.  However, the <Col N="14" /> fact that there are so many of these measures and that they are all contained within what is, in all conscience, a relatively limited financial envelope means that none will have an enormous effect.</P>
    <P>There is no single measure of tax relief that will in itself make a major difference to the shape, burden or effects of our tax system.  I would like to see Governments, and Ministers for Finance in particular, make a determined effort to try to direct their budget strategy, their budget actions and, therefore, their Finance Bills towards a much more concentrated set of measures that would have a real effect on how the tax system affects our people &mdash; I tried to do it with only limited success.  The 12 relieving measures in the Finance Bill are useful but not all are of the same importance, and not all had to be implemented this year.  For far too long we have been following this rather silly policy of blunting the edge of what we try to do &mdash; with very good will; this Government is very well motivated &mdash; by being utterly unable to resist the temptation always to do a few more little things that will look good, have a beneficial effect and add to the &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; factor for the Minister for Finance on budget day and the Government for a few weeks after. It is not good tax planning to have so many diverse elements in a Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Because of time limitations, I cannot speak on all these issues, although I hope to mention some in the relatively brief amount of time available to me. There is one issue about which I want to raise a question.  I genuinely raise this question because section 153 of this Bill provides for something new in our tax system.  It is what I will call the &ldquo;snitching&rdquo; section, the one that requires auditors to tell the Revenue Commissioners if they suspect their client is engaging in some questionable practice.  This is the first provision of its kind that we have had in our tax system.  I have to say quite honestly, and with all respect to the person who originally made that recommendation, our current Chief Justice, President of the High Court at the time he made the recommendation, that <Col N="15" /> I do not think it is good enough to proceed with a tax measure that has the effects this might well have on the say so of a judge who, eminent as he may be on the Bench, is not necessarily best qualified to make proposals about tax law.</P>
    <P>I listened last evening to what the Opposition have been saying about this. Deputy McCreevy in particular was scathing and I smiled wryly as I listened to him doing his usual act.  He said he did not believe this section was necessary and that all the powers the Revenue Commissioners require are contained in the 1983 Finance Act.  The reason for my smiling wryly was my memory of Deputy McCreevy and his party colleagues opposing, tooth and nail, everything I put into the 1983 Act to improve the collection of taxes.  They opposed every measure that I put forward in 1983, 1984, 1985 and 1986 to improve taxation on the grounds that it was oppressive.  Now, at last, they have come to realise that what I put before them in 1983 was a reasonable set of measures to provide for the collection of taxation. I listened to Deputy McCreevy with another slightly funny feeling in the pit of my stomach because here we were listening to Deputy McCreevy of Fianna Fáil opposing this measure in the Bill because it is so intrusive and giving out about a measure designed to help in the collection of taxes, when his party, in Government with the Labour Party not so long ago, produced in an enormous tax amnesty the most immoral giveaway of taxes ever invented.  Those two things do not sit too well together.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy McDowell complaining about this measure last night, and I agree with many of his reservations. However, I found it strange to listen to Deputy McDowell, a member of a party whose leader is the most enthusiastic and committed disciple of political correctness in this House &mdash; the Progressive Democrats are politically correct to the point of nauseation. Deputy McDowell's party leader, Deputy Harney, is the very one who was <Col N="16" /> running around this country only a couple of months ago telling all and sundry that we needed more whistle blowers in various areas of public life.  Now they are objecting to a whistle blower provision in this Bill.  I am not known for being politically correct; there is a blandness in that that robs politics of any colour, but I do not like this kind of provision and I ask the Minister for Finance to reflect on it.  If my memory serves me well, one of the abuses that came to light during the work of the beef tribunal was something spotted by an auditor who simply thought he needed a little more evidence to accept that a company for which he was working at the time spent as much as it claimed on transport.  He did a simple thing; he looked at the various documents justifying the expenditure and decided to telephone the companies in question to find out if they had done the work.  On making inquiries he found that a number of the companies did not exist.</P>
    <P>This procedure is open to the Revenue Commissioners.  Under the provisions of the 1983 Act and other provisions inserted in subsequent Finance Acts they have the power to require access to documentation.  A simple systematic approach, similar to the one adopted by the accountant in the case examined by the beef tribunal, will very often show that companies may well be burying income or profits which should be taxed.</P>
    <P>We would not need a provision such as this if we took the proper approach to the implementation and use of the powers available to the Revenue Commissioners. I therefore question the need for this measure and, with all respect, I question the propriety of inserting it in our tax code on the recommendation of a judge sitting in a tribunal which had a different focus and motivation.</P>
    <P>A number of other provisions in the Bill worry me because of the way they will bring other Minister into the tax system.  Section 6 provides for relief <Col N="17" /> from income tax in respect of tuition fees paid to private colleges for approved courses.  I have not thought through the full implications and how this fits with what the Government is doing about the payment of fees for third level education.  That may be a matter for another day but when I inspect section 6 I find that the courses which will benefit have to be approved by the Minister for Education.  The section does not state that all courses approved will qualify for relief from income tax; certain conditions are laid down but it will be left to the Minister for Education to designate the approved courses.  For the first time the Minister for Education is being given a direct role in part of the taxation system.  I am not saying that the Minister for Education is not a fit person to express a view on this, but it is not a good procedure in tax law to give another Minister a direct handle in the tax system.</P>
    <P>The same problem arises in the section dealing with the provision of various tax incentives for film making, under which the Minister for Arts Culture and the Gaeltacht is being given a direct say in deciding who should receive tax relief.  I am sure the Minister, who is a cultured person, is qualified to judge the merits of films but it should not be part of his job to operate directly in the tax system.  I have never believed that other Ministers should have arbitrary, discretionary powers in granting certain people reliefs.  There used to be an enormous row about whether the Revenue Commissioners were fit to decide on the literary merit of works to benefit from a tax exemption. In the case of tax relief in respect of tuition fees and film making it seems that the Minister for Education and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht are being given arbitrary and ill-defined powers in granting tax reliefs. That does not seem to be a sensible way of operating part of the tax system.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a provision under which tax relief will be provided in respect of local service charges.  This has been a controversial issue both within <Col N="18" /> the Government and between the Government and the Opposition.  I will not be impressed by what the Fianna Fáil Party will have to say about this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because it has faced in every possible way on this issue ever since service charges were introduced.  I am not alone in saying that I have the privilege of paying water and refuse charges in respect of my residence in Kildare.  Kildare County Council has taken the view that these charges should be made and I support them.  I will not pretend that I pay them gladly but in all conscience they are not excessive. Kildare County Council operates a well tailored waiver scheme and I have never had the slightest difficulty in persuading&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If I had, a more enlightened approach might well have been adopted in Dublin but I was born in Dublin county, not city.  I do not object to paying the charges and the waiver scheme in County Kildare works extremely well.  I am quite prepared to believe that Kildare is better run than most other counties but not all that much.</P>
      <P>Having paid all my charges, borne all the pain and not grumbled, as I believe I have to pay for what I get, I find it nonsensical that the Government is going to offer me a tax rebate, free gratis and for nothing.  Why does the Government not say to Kildare County Council that it will give it more money so that it can reduce its charges?  That would be too straightforward and might give the county council the option of deciding how it should use the money.</P>

Now that we have a well established system of local charges in place I find it nonsensical that, for some cosmetic reason best known to people other than myself, free gratis and for nothing people will be given a tax rebate although they have paid the charges without grumbling.</P>
      <P>It would require a great deal of study and imagination to find out what exactly the Government is doing about covenants and why.  Deputy McCreevy mentioned one case last night.  Deputy McDowell mentioned another and I would like to refer to yet another.  All three are so different they must be representative of something bigger in the population.  I am not going to make a special case but I am very familiar with it.  It involves a family where the parents covenant part of their income to a child who is seriously physically handicapped so that he can pursue his studies at third level where he is doing a great job.  They also covenant a substantial amount of income to the husband's parents who are elderly and have no income.  The provisions of this Bill will bring about a fundamental change in the circumstances of that family in terms of what it will be able to do in respect of tax relief in assisting the son and the husband's parents.  I am not sure that what the Government wants to do about the funding of third level education is a justification for interfering in the arrangements made by this family and the families Deputies McCreevy and McDowell spoke about last night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>By the time that is put into operation it will be irrelevant as some of these children will be finished. The fact that there are three different cases indicates that the problem is probably bigger than many of us realise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a provision in the Bill to give <Col N="20" /> a kind of tax relief in regard to donations to Third World charities.  This is not a tax relief in the hands of the donor; it is an addition of the amount of tax that would otherwise be payable in the hands of the donee, and in that sense it is a clever proposal to increase the amount of money to Third World donors.  Like every Member, I have received many approaches, letters and telephone calls from people involved in charities in this country who, while they do not wish any ill or lack of success to Third World charities, cannot understand what makes Third World charities deserving of this kind of treatment and what makes domestic charities undeserving of such treatment.</P>
    <P>There is a case for giving tax relief to charities.  It was my experience in nearly four years as Minister for Finance that charities made a case for tax relief, but we did not have room to introduce that measure at the time for either domestic or Third World charities.  The Minister did not explain what specifically makes Third World charities proper cases for this kind of approach that is not present in regard to domestic charities.  I am aware that Third World charities sometimes deal with issues and areas that command more immediate attention than domestic charities.  Unfortunately we have all become used to seeing pictures on our screens of, for example, the horrors of Rwanda, famine in various parts of Africa and flooding in Bangladesh, but we should not become inured by that fact to the equally dramatic problems that exist on our doorsteps, in every corner of this country where there is poverty and deprivation that need the intervention of domestic charities who do their job with great commitment and dedication and who justly feel that because they are not in as glamorous, needy and sensitive an area they do not get the attention which this Bill gives to Third World charities.</P>
    <P>Section 35 deals with the various tax measures regarding urban renewal.  The urban renewal scheme is well established, operating in a number of towns. There are several kinds of urban <Col N="21" /> renewal schemes.  There are schemes in the five county boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and there are other schemes operating outside those areas.  There are schemes operating at the Custom House docks, in Temple Bar and in parts of the north side of the city of Dublin.  I learned recently that there is an anomaly in the operation of some of the urban renewal schemes in towns outside Dublin.  The Department of the Environment, under the impulsion of the Department of Finance and with the assistance of local authorities, set out the boundaries of the areas to which these schemes would apply.  With the best will in the world, people in Departments and local authorities will not necessarily get it right the first time, and I will give one such example.  In the case that came to my attention the boundary is drawn in such a way that a development that would be desirable in the context of the use of the street in the town in question is hindered. The boundary line is drawn in such a way that it is nearly impossible to carry out the only street widening required in that area to make the back street a desirable street in which to live.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides that office buildings in such areas would qualify under the scheme.  I believed that if the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment. Deputy McManus, was contacted about this matter she would probably be able to sort it out, but imagine my surprise when I was told there is a problem because there is no provision written into the scheme for a revision or adjustment.</P>
    <P>The line set in the maps circulated the day the Minister arrived in Newbridge to announce the scheme is fixed and immutable and there is no provision by which it can be adjusted, whether in the interests of good planning or to facilitate development.  The Minister of State &mdash; I give her due credit for this &mdash; said the Department must carry out a study and examine what needs to be done and that it will take about nine months to come up with a system to provide for an adjustment, by which time it will be <Col N="22" /> nearly too late because there are only two years left in the scheme.  That is not the way to write tax law and it makes life difficult for the people involved.</P>
    <P>There is in operation and absolutely astonishing variety of schemes to assist development.  There are different tiers of the tax incentive scheme including the Financial Services Centre, Temple Bar and other areas in north Dublin, the five county boroughs and all the towns that have been designated in part as having urban renewal status.  Schemes were recently announced for urban and village renewal.  There is a plethora of schemes dealing with rural development, partnership companies, ADM, Leader Programmes and schemes operated through FÁS and its various offshoots.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is now a new scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>A new one is announced every day.  When I spoke recently to a person who is heavily involved in rural development he said a little ruefully &mdash; he was not complaining &mdash; that he is now at the point where he has to organise concerted meetings of various groups so that they can decide which part of their week fits into which project. I read a recent report issued by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry about the Leader Programme, a report which is very diplomatically written and which does not call a spade a spade, but reading between the lines it means there is now a serious problem because of the bewildering array and complexity of schemes that exist for development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we were to invite another one of the burgeoning profession of consultants we have to take our tax law, Leader schemes, the operations of the Department of the Environment, FÁS schemes and so on and to consider what scheme could replace them to favour the types of development targeted, I am sure that any half-baked consultant would come up with something much simpler with fewer parts that would probably cost <Col N="23" /> less to run and might even be more effective than the whole complex of schemes we have there.</P>
    <P>Will the Government examine all those schemes and by the time another Finance Bill is introduced next year, presented by the same Minister for Finance, could we have some sense and reordering of the system?  Instead of adding new complexities to our system we should remove some of the complications that need teasing out in 159 section Finance Bills.  Let us stop creating problems.  We should get out of the hair of people who want to carry out the development and give them something simpler to work with.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> The Minister's speech yesterday outlined the benefits and advantages that will accrue to the people during the coming year.  In many ways the Finance Bill adds to the confusion among the public as to what the Minister intends to do during the year.  We hear much talk of transparency, accountability and openness and it is time consideration was given to the manner in which we deal with the budget and the Finance Bill.  As Deputy Dukes pointed out, there are 159 sections in the Bill, all of them dealing differently with expenditure and, I hope, the advantages that will accrue to the public during the coming year. Many measures have been taken to deal with the issues in the Bill, but how effective will those measures be?  Serious consideration must be given to how the Finance Bill and the Budget Statement are drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was on the other side of the House I had many discussions with people in the Department of Finance and Ministers about how we do not appear to be in a position during the year to respond to good ideas, but have to wait until budget day or until the Finance Bill is introduced to implement some of the ideas put forward by pressure groups.  I do not agree that every idea put forward by a pressure group should be taken up by the Minister, but <Col N="24" /> we do not appear to be in a position to respond to some worthwhile suggestions to assist job creation and help people secure a better standard of living.  We wait and hope that the Minister for Finance will implement some of those ideas when he announces the budget or introduces the Finance Bill.  The Minister for Finance of the day has a difficult task and it is not possible for him to cave in to the demands of every pressure group unless he intends to dramatically increase taxation.</P>
    <P>I understand 12 or 14 new measures are included in the Bill and at the end of the year I would like an audit carried out on how effective and advantageous those new measures are for the public. It might be more beneficial if three or four worthwhile measures rather than a large number were introduced.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the budget and the Finance Bill are presented causes confusion among the public and in this House and perhaps a more open, transparent and simplified way of debating and implementing the Finance Bill might be considered in future.  I am aware the Minister has said on different occasions that he wants to move away from long-winded speeches on budget day and when introducing the Finance Bill.  In some respects he achieved that this year as his budget speech was shorter than the usual speech delivered by a Minister for Finance.  The Minister's budget speech was available to Members long before budget day and that caused difficulties for the Minister.</P>
    <P>Some of the measures introduced are welcome and will be beneficial.  Taxation is one area every Minister for Finance tries to address and every year we hear of an increase in tax free allowances, but they never appear to have a real impact in terms of substantially increasing people's take home pay and we still have the problem of a lack of incentive to work.  People get little encouragement to take up employment and prefer to remain unemployed and work the odd day.  The previous Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern and the present Minister, Deputy Quinn, tried <Col N="25" /> to redress that problem by increasing tax free allowances taking certain categories of people out of the tax net.  I, as I am sure many other Deputies, have been contacted by people in the past few days whose tax free allowances have been adjusted under the new allowances which apply for the 1995-96 tax year, but at the end of the day there is no difference in their take home pay.  In the past week people who have been taken out of the 48 per cent tax bracket and now pay 27 per cent tax have told me the amount they are allowed earn before tax has been dramatically reduced.  Those people, who are on a relatively low income, are no better off in the lower tax bracket than they were in the higher bracket.  Major changes must be made in tax reform to ensure that people will have an incentive to continue to work or to take up employment. The former Government and this one tried to do something about that, but the tax reform is moving too slowly. We need to seriously consider how we can take many more lower income families out of the tax net.  When people in the middle income bracket take into account the amount of tax they pay and their transport costs to and from work, they find very little encouragement to continue working because generally they do not qualify for a medical card or any other benefits.  I urge the Minister for Finance to increase tax free allowances for the lower paid and, where possible, take many of them out of the tax net.  I welcome the increases in tax free allowances, but we are moving too slowly.</P>
    <P>The number of incentives introduced to encourage people to create jobs and to take up employment must be welcomed. I had many discussions with Ministers in the previous Government about creating new bureaucracies to assist job creation and like Deputy Dukes, I am concerned about them. There are, for example, the Leader and Partnership programmes, county enterprise boards, county development boards, FÁS and other schemes, all welcome. However, I sometimes wonder <Col N="26" /> whether there is a need of an office to administer these various programmes and schemes, providing well protected jobs for their administrators.  One must question ultimately how valuable are such officers.  Would it not be preferable to have a one-stop shop where people could avail of those services, talk to those administering them and obtain all the information they need?</P>
    <P>As the Minister of State, Deputy Avril Doyle, will be aware, in County Wexford there is the administration office of the Leader programme located in Johnstown, another for the county development board team located in the Wexford County Council office premises as well as the county enterprise board across the corridor.  Why are both needed?  In addition, the Partnership programme is being extended across the county, with new offices being established. This means that if the provisions of the Leader or Partnership programmes do not suit one's purposes, one may have to drive from, say, Enniscorthy or Gorey to Johnstown Castle to obtain the requisite advice whereas one office where people could avail of such advice would be infinitely preferable.</P>
    <P>These schemes are vital to the continuance of economic life in rural areas. The Leader programme in County Wexford has achieved considerable success, as has the South-West Partnership Board.  I hope that others coming on stream will be equally successful in helping people to reintegrate into the overall working environment.  Many such people have very good ideas but lack of finance has prevented them from establishing their own businesses.</P>
    <P>I have been the subject of much criticism by the administrators of the Wexford Leader programme because of my views on this matter.  I have said I do not want to see 30 per cent or 40 per cent of the available funds tied up in the administration of offices, in recruiting development officers and the like, each doing his own thing.  There must be overall co-ordination within that area to provide jobs for the people for whom these schemes were devised.  We have <Col N="27" /> too many long term unemployed.  Tax incentives must continue to be given to employers to encourage them to recruit people once trained.  Certain provisions of this Bill should deal effectively with that matter.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tax relief for tenants in private rented accommodation, something with which the previous Government endeavoured to grapple through the stipulation that such tenants retain rent books.  Much rented accommodation in our towns is of questionable standard.  Many tenants are ripped off by exorbitant rents, particularly in smaller towns such as my own, of £60 or £70 weekly for one and two-bedroomed flats of questionable standard.  This overall issue needs to be seriously examined by the Department and relevant local authorities to ensure that accommodation of appropriate standard is available to tenanats paying high rents. This problem arises whenever there are insufficient local authority houses in an area and people must resort to rented accommodation.  Many of them are exploited by unscrupulous landlords who do little or nothing to maintain their properties to the requisite standard.</P>
    <P>The tax relief on fees for third-level private colleges could lead to some confusion. While welcome in one sense, it is questionable whether any Minister for Education should have power to designate courses for tax relief purposes in private colleges.  I question why any Minister for Education should decide who should or should not receive a tax break for education purposes.  It could lead to abuse and to wholesale lobbying for the inclusion of certain courses for tax breaks, while others without lobbying power but perhaps in greater need of such courses would be excluded.  I hope the Minister will inform us how he proposes to implement this relief.  While the principle is good I have considerable reservations about any Minister for Education having a say in which courses should qualify for tax relief.</P>
    <P>I am sure all Members will have <Col N="28" /> received numerous representations from people administering charities on the domestic front.  While I have no problem with tax relief on donations to designated Third World charities &mdash; all of us witnessing the horrendous events occurring from time to time, such as the wholesale massacre in Rwanda last weekend &mdash; charities at home are doing excellent work, dealing with real poverty and the many social problems.  I cannot see any reason donations to such charities should be excluded from the same tax relief.  The Minister should seriously examine this matter to ascertain how both can be accommodated.</P>
    <P>There is total confusion on the matter of covenants for educational purposes. Perhaps the Minister for Finance will inform us when his colleague, the Minister for Education, will decide who will be eligible for free third level fees.  The total elimination of covenants will cause many families severe hardship.  The Minister for Finance should be much more selective when deciding which covenants will no longer qualify for tax relief.  This matter will be further examined on Committee Stage when my party will be tabling a number of amendments.  The free fees for third-level purposes will not be of much advantage to some families not eligible for maintenance fees who had been availing of such covenants to maintain one, two or, in some cases, three or four children at university simultaneously.</P>
    <P>I have serious reservations about the new proposal requiring accountants to squeal or provide information about client's finances.  I do not think accountants should be placed in that position. The provision would appear to emanate from the recommendations of the sole member of the beef tribunal.  The Revenue Commissioners are capable of carrying out this task.  However, I do not agree with some of their tactics, for example, putting pressure on small businesses and people to be up front in regard to their taxes.  It is not acceptable to the business community that in future accountants will be able to put additional pressure on them and I hope <Col N="29" /> the Minister will re-examine this proposal. Deputy Dukes, a former Minister for Finance, also has serious reservations about this measure.  Accountants who have always played their part in this area are up in arms, so to speak, about this measure.  There might be a question mark over a few accountants but 95 per cent of them are honourable and decent and they should not be forced, through a Finance Bill, to enforce measures which are contrary to everything they do.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome the measures for seaside resorts.  While I welcome the inclusion of Courtown, the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, and I would have liked to have seen Rosslare included.  There was no reference to Courtown in the budget and following representations by us and the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, it was included. In recent days people have contacted me about the decision to exclude Seaview, a densely populated area in Courtown. Much of the beach has been included and perhaps there could be a trade off in this area.  I will make representation to the Minister for Finance today and I am sure the Minister of State will also take this issue on board. This scheme is a major incentive for the development of seaside resorts.  Courtown is adjacent to Dublin and many people from the city spend their holidays there.  I would like Courtown to be developed as an attractive holiday destination for people from cities who more than likely will visit other areas in the county while on holidays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The urban renewal scheme has been of benefit in the counties where it has <Col N="30" /> been implemented.  There is a lack of urgency in some areas in getting urban renewal projects up and running and I am concerned at the Minister's adamant statement that three years is the maximum term and that there will be no extension.  I hope that towns which have been included in the scheme during the past year and have had launches since Christmas will ensure that projects are started as quickly as possible to gain the maximum advantage from the scheme. There is enormous job potential in many of these projects.  In some cases up to 500 jobs can be created in the building and development stages and other jobs are created when the project is completed.  There should be no undue delays in starting projects and pressure should be put on local authorities to ensure that projects get underway as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The local service charges are a major bone of contention in every county.  As Deputy Broughan said, people in Dublin who do not pay charges will not be able to benefit from the new tax relief.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> That is questionable and we will have to wait and see.  While I welcome this new tax relief, as other speakers said the money could have been paid directly to the councils to reduce the service charges.  This new relief will give rise to much bureaucracy and red tape in the Revenue Commissioners which could have been avoided if the money had been paid directly to local authorities.  I welcome the relief but its implementation could give rise to problems.  We will keep this issue under review to see how it develops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local service charges have given rise to much controversy and successive Governments have tried to implement a system which is fair and equitable.  The waiver system is reasonably fair and equitable but no one likes to pay charges and perhaps the time has come to introduce one charge to replace the multiplicity of charges and to either give <Col N="31" /> a tax free allowance to those people who pay charges or pay the money direct to local authorities so that they can reduce the charge.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to the 2.5 per cent increase for social welfare recipients. IBEC is concerned about the level of Government spending and the increases in interest rates in recent months.  The increase of 2.5 per cent &mdash; the lowest given by any Minister in recent years &mdash; has probably been offset by the increases in inflation and interest rates. The Minister should consider giving a further increase of 2 per cent or 2.5 per cent to the most vulnerable and less well off people in our society to make up for the extra charges which have arisen in recent weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time has come to give serious consideration to the way in which the budget and Finance Bill are presented in the House.  We should have a more simplified, more open and transparent system.  The Minister shortened the Budget Statement by approximately <Col N="32" /> half an hour and this is welcome as the general public are not very impressed by lengthy speeches.  We will have to wait until Fianna Fáil returns to Government to have major changes implemented, and I am sure that will be sooner rather than later.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Quinn, on introducing the Finance Bill which is his first effort and indeed the first effort of a Labour Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is a positive step towards creating an atmosphere for business entrepreneurs to proceed in playing their part in the revival of our economy. While it caters for the underprivileged sections of our community, it also caters for business entrepreneurs and gives them an opportunity to benefit from any investment they undertake to promote business activity in the country.  While I compliment the Minister on the introduction of a number of new and specifically focused reliefs to assist people in rented accommodation, to provide tax relief on local authority service charges and to encourage donations to Third World charities, I emphasise the necessity to extend tax relief to national charitable institutions similar to that which he outlined for Third World charities. Charity begins at home and while there may be pressing demands on Third World charities there is also a huge demand on national charities.  An individual or firm which contributes to a recognised national charity should receive similar concessions to a person or firm which subscribes to the Third World charities.  While I accept the degree of poverty here is not as great as in many Third World countries, it must be recognised that it is a problem in our community.  I appeal to the Minister to <Col N="33" /> be generous in meeting my demand and that of others to include national charities in the same category as Third World charities.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that the beef tribunal report pinpointed the necessity to increase the powers of the Revenue Commissioners to counter tax evasion and to secure their traditional powers in the excise area.  However, the Minister has gone a little overboard by placing a duty on auditors and tax advisers generally to report tax evasion.  This is a null and void proposal because tax evaders will not confide in their auditors or tax advisers if they intend evading tax payment. The duty of auditors and tax advisers is to adjudicate on the figures supplied to them and I fail to understand the role auditors and tax advisers can play in any procedure to counter tax evasion.  A computer is only as good as what it is fed and the same applies to an auditor or tax adviser.  I appeal to the Minister not to make it mandatory on those professions to get involved in the question of tax evasion.  All reputable auditors and tax advisers carry out their duties in an exemplary fashion and under no circumstances should additional pressure be put on those professions to counter tax evasion.</P>
    <P>I welcome the refocusing, on the other hand, of certain anti-evasion measures such as the VAT monthly control statement and the easing of penalties for late filing under self-assessment. This is a step in the right direction.  I also welcome the introduction of the new VAT rules for dealing in secondhand goods agreed by the European Union and the removal of competitive distortions in the application of VAT to certain sporting facilities.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the increase in the personal allowance by £300 for a married couple and £150 for a single person, it is very harsh for a Minister for Finance to subject to income tax a pensioner with a gross pension of only £79 per week.  A pensioner whose pension is £100 or less per week should not be subject to income tax.  The Minister should <Col N="34" /> realise that such pensioners probably enjoy a packet or two of cigarettes, a pint or two or a glass of whiskey per week, all of which are taxed directly.  In his wisdom, surely the Minister should see fit to exempt such people from income tax.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of rent relief for tenants in private rented accommodation, which will be a welcome boost for people in that category. The Minister introduced tax relief on fees in certain private colleges.  This will have a dramatic effect on hard pressed parents in the middle income group who are trying to give their children a third level education, to which they should be entitled.</P>
    <P>The tax allowance on service charges operated by county councils is a major breakthrough.  I congratulate the Minister on providing this tax allowance at the standard rate up to a maximum of £150 per year which will be credited to every individual who qualifies for the allowance.  I also welcome the introduction of relief from income and corporation tax on heritage buildings operating as bed and breakfast facilities. Those buildings would have no hope of being preserved or becoming a viable proposition if they could not avail of income from facilities such as bed and breakfast.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to continue stock relief for farmers at 25 per cent for a further two years to 5 April 1997.  I also welcome the provision for stock relief at a rate of 100 per cent for four years for young farmers who first become chargeable to income tax in respect of profits or gains from farming for the year 1993-94 or any subsequent year of assessment up to 1997-98. This is a tremendous breakthrough for the agricultural community and I am sure farming bodies will welcome it. I welcome the clause in section 22 which provides for particular tax treatment for farmers in respect of profits arising where cattle herds must be disposed of because of statutory disease eradication measures.  The Minister was wise to <Col N="35" /> allow deferral of the profits for tax purposes over two years and the application of 100 per cent stock relief to the profits so deferred.  This is an outstanding achievement by the Minister and I hope it will be welcomed by the farming bodies.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the pilot renewal scheme for traditional seaside resorts.  I would be pleased if it were extended to areas other than those mentioned.  I understand the Minister has taken into consideration the needs of Achill, Ballybunion, Bundoran, Courtown, Kilkee, Lahinch, Tramore, Westport and Youghal, but similar needs exist in towns in my constituency such as Kinsale, Clonakilty, Bandon, Rosscarbery, Skibbereen, Baltimore, Timoleague, Courtmacsherry, Castletownsend, Union Hall, Glandore, Ballydehob, Schull, Goleen, Crookhaven, Durrus, Kilcrohane, Bantry, Dunmanway, Drimoleague, Drinagh, Glengarriff, Adrigole, Castletownbere, Allihies, Eyeries and Ardgroom.  The people living in those areas of my constituency rely on the tourism industry for their principal incomes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Those areas are crying out for development similar to that taking place in districts now benefiting under the scheme.  I hope the Minister will see fit to extend this scheme which is so valuable to rural Ireland, particularly the tourist areas of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I am a little dubious about the phasing out of the bank levies from £36 million in 1994, to £24 million in 1995, £12 million in 1996 and to nil in 1997.  I cautiously welcome the decision of the banks to agree to a compensatory cash flow arrangement whereby in 1995 they <Col N="36" /> will make an earlier payment of corporation tax of £12 million in order to recover the £12 million reduction this year, thus the Exchequer will not be at a loss.</P>
    <P>It is well known, however, that banking institutions here have enjoyed immense profits in the past three decades. While they are very conservative in their business they seem to forget that rural Ireland exists.  Some of the major banking institutions have closed their sub-offices in rural areas in order to concentrate their operations on areas of high population.  We cannot all live in an urban area and the Minister should compel those banking institutions to provide the same service in rural areas as they do in our major towns.</P>
    <P>The banks should play a greater role in facilitating the industrial revolution here.  I understand that in the United States a business entrepreneur who produces a business proposition is vetted by a board operated by a financial authority.  If that business proposition is considered viable the money is advanced to the entrepreneur to set up a new business or extend an existing one.  The United States Treasury acts as security for that entrepreneur.  The banks do not lose any money on such a proposition.  In the ten years that this system has been in operation in the US there has been a considerable increase in the number of new industries established and the rate of default is less than 2 per cent.  If such a system can work in the United States it is worth trying it here.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for introducing the £1,000 vehicle registration tax relief scheme.  This will be an incentive for people to get rid of their old &ldquo;bangers&rdquo; and buy a new car.  I welcome the concession in regard to road tax whereby if a vehicle is registered within the last seven working days of a month, and where an application for road tax is made the following month, the tax disc will be effective from the beginning of the month of licensing rather than from the month of registration, which is currently the case.  Also, where there is a prolonged delay between the first registration of a vehicle the subsequent road <Col N="37" /> tax will be effective from the month of licensing on a payment of the sum of £20.  That major concession was urgently required because many people found themselves in difficulty in that they had registered their vehicles but were not in a position to tax them until several months later due to repair costs, etc. This is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>While there are anomalies in the budget it represents a good effort and I congratulate the Minister on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is a good expression of the Minister's ambitions in this first budget introduced by a Labour Minister for Finance.  He stated he wanted to reward people at work, promote enterprise in every conceivable way and, most important, strengthen social solidarity among those dependent on the economy. He has succeeded largely in doing that both in the budget and in the Finance Bill which implements so many budgetary provisions.  The Minister described the budget as a growth dividend for the nation and the Finance Bill carries that through.</P>
      <P>Last night we had to listen to a fantastic dissertation from Deputy Michael McDowell on the cost of the White Paper on Education and other outstanding costs of Government.  It is fair to say that this Minister for Finance is ruthlessly determined to keep public spending under control.  There is no conceivable way that the Government will breach the Maastricht guidelines on the expansion of debt and to fantasise about developments in education over the next 15 to 20 years &mdash; which are welcome and for which my colleague. Deputy Bhreathnach, deserves great credit for bringing them forward so speedily &mdash; is quite ludicrous.  That is an indication of the real aim of the Progressive Democrats which is to viciously slash current public spending in such a way as to cause real social hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the moves to reform the tax system, particularly in relation to <Col N="38" /> abuses.  A leaflet issued by the Department of Finance recently indicates that of every £1 of income tax collected 84.5p comes from the PAYE sector, 3p comes from DIRT, 9p comes from the self employed, 2p comes from withholding tax and only 1.5p comes from farmers. That clearly indicates that the greatest personal taxation burden continues to rest on the shoulders of the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>Unlike Deputy O'Dea, I welcome section 153 in which the Minister implements the recommendations of the Hamilton inquiry which seemed to find <i>prima facie</i> evidence of huge irregularities and evasion of tax.  Lest any aspersions be cast on the integrity of the auditing and accounting professions.  I believe it is appropriate to have such a section in the Bill.  I note the Minister has granted a major concession where the amount involved is less than 5 per cent of the tax liability and he has also allowed the auditor or accountant who discovers tax evasion the facility of first notifying the company concerned.  In many respects, the Minister has tried to address the understandable concerns of the auditing and accountancy professions.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the tax reliefs to tenants in private rented accommodation. It was an extraodinary anomaly that landlords could get major reliefs under our urban renewal schemes while their tenants had no such relief.  The Minister has tried to deal with major abuses that crept in recent years.  He has attempted to close loopholes by requesting public bodies such as health boards to make returns on rent subsidies to ensure the Revenue Commissioners are informed of the names of landlords.  He implemented provisions in section 70 to deal with weaknesses identified in the Glackin Inquiry into the sale of the Johnston Mooney &amp; O'Brien site.  All Deputies are aware that workers in the building industry, in particular, have been dissatisfied for a very long time with the way the C45 system operates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="39" /> People who effectively are PAYE employees were employed on a contractual basis which the majority of them did not want and under which they had no rights to sickness benefit or any of the other normal rights of workers.</P>
    <P>Section 18 provides for making declarations so that at least workers will realise from the start that the C45 system is applicable and we may find that young building workers, particularly plasterers and bricklayers, will not be driven from their trade by the ruthless harshness of a minority of building contractors.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has rewarded work by increasing the standard rate tax band and increasing significantly the thresholds at which people enter the top tax rate.  I agree with Deputy Browne's contribution and I would have liked if the Minister had significantly increased the basic tax allowances. The Irish National Association for the Unemployed identified this as the most significant way to lift people from the tax net, encourage people to work and a means to get away from the low paid syndrome.  I ask the Minister to look at this again.</P>
    <P>Tax relief on service charges is welcome. Dublin, in common with Limerick city, does not have service charges but obviously local government funding is not satisfactory.  These two great cities need more significant funding to do the things we want to do.  The <i>ultra vires</i> rule has been removed and local authorities could become development corporations. We cannot do that now because we are just balancing the books. The reason people objected so vehemently to service charges is that they regarded them as double taxation and they were aware of the figures I read out from the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The Minister has granted relief for those on unemployment and disability benefits.  I am opposed to taxation of those benefits as people who pay social insurance should have the satisfaction of knowing that there will be provision for <Col N="40" /> them and that each member of the family has an independent economic existence. We should look at this again.</P>
    <P>Section 16 significantly increases the existing limit on the value of shares which can be allocated each year to employees under approved profit sharing schemes.  This is a very worth-while development.  The Minister, in his former role as Minister for Enterprise and Employment, showed a tremendous understanding of small and mediumsized businesses.  He has brought this to bear in the budget and in the Finance Bill, for example, in the seed capital scheme.  He has increased the level of investment that qualifies for relief from £75,000 to £125,000 by extending the &ldquo;look back&rdquo; period to five years.  The Dublin exchange facility will benefit from the seed capital scheme.</P>
    <P>In trying to root out abuses in the tax system the Minister has used the carrot and stick approach.  The Minister recognises the great strides made by business in recent years in voluntary compliance and has introduced more gently compliance requirements such as the direct debit facility, the fixed date of 30 April and lower surcharges.  The Minister has tried to assist business to comply with its obligations.</P>
    <P>One of the great success stories of recent years has been the dramatic development in Irish film-making. Everyone in the former and present Government associated with this deserves great credit, none more so than the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and I certainly have great confidence in his certification procedures. I have no doubt that he and his advisers are aware of the basic investment that is necessary.</P>
    <P>The urban renewal and enterprise areas relief are welcome.  The Minister extended the period of relief for the Custom House Docks site to January 1999 and for Temple Bar to April 1998. I am unhappy that Dublin Corporation does not have total control over the redevelopment of those areas but it will have control over the area being designated on the northside.  The tax reliefs <Col N="41" /> for urban renewal since the mid 1980s have been very successful and one only has to walk half a mile in the city to realise that this has brought about much needed renewal.  However, I ask the Minister to ensure that Dublin north-side and the Dublin Airport zone, where we are trying to create a new enterprise zone modelled on the development in Shannon be included to a greater extent under the newly designated enterprise areas.  We have always had a fear that some of the new apartment blocks in the urban renewal areas will become the slums of the future because the apartments are so small and tend to be rented out.  Our fears have been allayed somewhat because the Minister having listened to representations from all sides of the House, made provision to increase the floor space from 90 to 125 square metres.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also introducing an amendment to support the work of his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to increase research and development.  He has also reduced corporation tax from 40 per cent to 38 per cent which is a great encouragement for business.  In reply to my parliamentary question on corporation tax, the Minister told me the banks were paying net corporation tax of £102 million.  With the phasing out of the bank levy over a two and a half year period the banks will contribute increasingly to corporation tax.  However, I strongly support further competition in the banking sector and am still in favour of a third banking force.</P>
    <P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Bhreathnach on phasing in the abolition of third level fees and I welcome the moves she has taken to translate this into action by changes in covenants.  I think the cost will not be as great as Deputy McDowell said last night but it will have a huge psychological impact. The late great Donogh O'Malley opened up second level education, we will now see this in third level education.</P>
    <P>The previous Minister made a big mistake in changing the residential <Col N="42" /> property tax.  This was basically a Dublin tax.  It was outrageously unfair and as a Deputy in one of the Government parties at the time I told Deputy Ahern that he should change it as soon as possible. Many houses in the Dublin area are worth a fair amount of money but they are still people's homes.  I am glad the Minister for Finance rectified the mistake made by Deputy Ahern and that a market value of £94,000, income exemption of £29,500 and a flat rate of 1.5 per cent now apply.</P>
    <P>The tradition in my party is one of social solidarity and the Minister endorsed this in all the measures he took particularly those relating to education. He has tried to encourage people to get back to work.  In the last two years 60,000 new jobs were created. He is a Minister deeply sympathetic to business and has provided it with a more even playing field in the Finance Bill.  Over the next two years he will do more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>We are debating the Finance Bill, 1995 which seeks to implement the tax changes announced by the Minister in the budget.  Unfortunately the budget must rank as one of the most reckless, aimless, confused and disorientated budgets ever introduced. For hundreds of thousands of people and the weakest and the most vulnerable in society &mdash; old age pensioners without child dependants &mdash; it was a callous and cruel budget, perhaps the worst since the infamous budget of the late Ernest Blythe.</P>
      <P>Some provisions in the Bill are welcome. There are some improvements. infinitesimal though the space they occupy in the total budgetary landscape may be, and I acknowledge them in the interest of fairness and balance.  The limit for relief on the value of shares which can be allocated to employees under an improved profit sharing scheme has been raised from £2,000 to £10,000.  I welcome that as I believe in the expansion of industrial democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="43" /> It will have tremendous economic benefits as it has in other economies throughout the civilised world.  The limit has been increased fivefold and I unashamedly welcome it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in business and agricultural relief for capital acquisitions tax purposes and heartily welcome the introduction of an instalment system for capital acquisitions tax at the sensible 9 per cent interest rate.  There are some improvements in the roll-over and retirement relief for capital gains tax purposes.  Though they may represent a minimalist approach I welcome them in so far as they are an improvement on the present system and are proenterprise.</P>
    <P>As regards the change in the seed capital scheme, the amount qualifying for relief has been increased from £75,000 to £125,000 and I welcome that. However, we should not remain unaware of the fact that only 30 entities have availed of this scheme since its introduction two years ago.  It is a good, imaginative scheme designed to encourage people to invest money to create jobs.  It enables people to claim substantial tax relief yet only 30 applications have been received under the scheme. Why?  Perhaps it is because when the Revenue Commissioners assist in the drafting of a Finance Bill they are inclined to regard every tax allowance, incentive and attempt by Government to direct investment into an area of activity which could create employment as a potential vehicle for tax avoidance.</P>
    <P>When a scheme is introduced, the Revenue Commissioners say it could be used as a vehicle for tax avoidance and so many rules, regulations and restrictions apply to it that the scheme is practically unworkable.  This is a continual feature of tax incentives which successive Governments and Ministers have given in Finance Bills over the years, imaginative and well thought out though the original idea may be.  I do not blame the Revenue Commissioners exclusively for this.  The accountancy and tax advisory professions must also <Col N="44" /> bear some responsibility.  We all recall the business expansion scheme and the ludicrous uses to which it was put by some tax advisers and accountants to write off taxes &mdash; uses which were never dreamt of in their wildest flights of imagination by those who drafted the legislation.  The tax advisory profession have much to answer for but the Revenue Commissioners are unduly cautious.</P>
    <P>Some attempt is made to simplify the scheme and I wholeheartedly endorse that but the approach is far too minimalist. There is room for much greater simplification of the scheme and I hope our spokesperson will bring that to the attention of the Minister on Committee Stage.  This is a good, imaginative scheme and people should be allowed avail of it.  There is no point in having complicated schemes.  Too many rules and restrictions apply to this scheme and there is no logic behind them.  I hope the Minister will be amenable to any suggestions made to further simplify the scheme.</P>
    <P>I note that from 1 May the requirements to issue a VAT control monthly statement to VAT registered customers is being abolished.  I welcome that.  It was unnecessarily bureaucratic, expensive and time wasting.  As a result of the success of the Revenue Commissioners' audit procedures in certain areas of the economy their fears have been allayed and they have allowed the Minister to make this change.</P>
    <P>I scrutinised the Finance Bill from beginning to end in an effort to find things to welcome in the interests of being constructive.  However, there is little else I can welcome.  I thought I might be able to welcome section 29 but the more I read it the more intriguing I find it.  If my interpretation of the section is correct, it proposes to exempt from corporation tax and capital gains tax the profits of a foreign branch of an Irish registered company which creates substantial new employment and capital investment here.  There is a strong rumour, which I have every reason to believe is correct, that it was introduced <Col N="45" /> to attract a particular investor to the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify if that rumour is correct.  It is bad in principle to introduce specific legislation to cover one project or investor regardless of how valuable the investment. It might be of immense value to the economy and, if so, let the Minister state that and give the reason for bringing in legislation to accommodate one project.</P>
    <P>Second, I imagine if any Government introduced something similar it would operate in the normal way but there is one vital difference.  The people in question would have to satisfy the authorities that they would make the requisite capital investment and create the requisite employment in the State.  The Revenue Commissioners would be the people who should be satisfied. However, the section states that the person who gives the certificate and who is to be satisfied is the Minister for Finance, who is a political figure.  I cast no aspersions whatever on the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, whose integrity is above reproach.  Nevertheless, we must bear in mind the considerable controversy not long ago about the passports for investment scheme.  The cry from the Opposition &mdash; now the Government &mdash; was that there was no transparency or accountability and that a person who was well heeled was lodging a huge sum of money and gaining a substantial economic benefit in return. A politician makes a decision in secret with no transparency, no openness and no accountability to anybody.</P>
    <P>The people who caused that outcry are supporting a provision which will enable any Minister for Finance in the future to make a decision in secret without accountability, openness or transparency which could be worth hundreds of millions of pounds to an Irish resident company.  Is that correct?  Is that consistent?  Is it consistent with the outrage about the passports for investment scheme when a passport was given in return for investment in a particular company?  I appreciate that the Minister <Col N="46" /> proposes to draw up guidelines but these guidelines could be changed unilaterally by the Minister.  There is no provision to debate them in the Dáil or for the Dáil to be consulted about any amendments.  A Minister for Finance could be tipped off in advance about a potential proposition and he could change the rules unilaterally.  Where is the openness and the transparency?  A politician will, in secret, without accountability to anybody make a decision &mdash; if this section goes through unamended &mdash; which could be worth any amount of money to any potential investor.  The money which will be foregone as a result is taxpayers' money.  At least in the passports for investment scheme, the taxpayers did not lose money.  I grant that an Irish passport was given out, which I do not regard as an inconsiderable thing.  Here, literally tens of millions of pounds which would normally come into the coffers of the Irish taxpayers can be foregone by a decision taken in secret by a Minister for Finance.  That should be looked at.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broughan and other welcomed the rent allowance scheme.  I have looked at that scheme and I welcome it as far as it goes, which is not very far.  It is designed to bring landlords into the tax net rather than to benefit tenants in any way.  It is infantile for Government speakers to pretend it will represent a boon to tenants or that it represents any realistic attempt to put tenants on a similar playing pitch with people who are purchasing their own houses.  The allowance is limited to £500 at the standard rate of tax, 27 per cent, for a single person.  I know many single people in Dublin and in Limerick who are paying rent of £400 or £500 per month for an apartment.  The person in question will benefit from this provison to the tune of 27 per cent of £500.  That amounts to £135 which is not even one week's rent.  It will not be worth the hassle of applying and filling out forms, obtaining receipts and getting the land-lords's tax reference number, which may not be forthcoming in each case.  I welcome the provision if it succeeds in <Col N="47" /> bringing more landlords into the tax net. I believe people should declare their income and pay their taxes.  To represent it as a boon to tenants is a gross misrepresentation.</P>
    <P>Section 32 provides for the expansion of the urban renewal tax incentives for the Custom House Docks area in Dublin. I have no particular hang up one way or the other about that.  There is no similar incentive for the other financial zone in Shannon.  There is no urban renewal tax-based scheme for Shannon. Because of the totality of the operations being carried on at Shannon it may not be of great value but due to the problems we have had since the removal of the compulsory stop over, now compounded by the crisis at Shannon Aerospace, we can use whatever we get.  Representations have been made to me that a similar scheme operating in the Shannon area would be welcome and would generate revenue and investment in that region.  God knows we badly need it.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to covenants, as I understand it, is that as from 6 April 1996 covenants in favour of people over the age of 65 will be restricted to 5 per cent of the total income of the covenantor unless the person is permanently incapacitated.  Who will decide the question of permanent incapacity?  This is not an academic question.  This will be vitally important financially to many families.  Presumably the person's doctor will sign a certificate to say they are permanently incapacitated which will go to the Revenue Commissioners. Will the Revenue Commissioners have their own doctor to examine the certificate and will he go so far as to examine the patient?  It will mean the difference between survival and non-survival financially for many families.</P>
    <P>What is the position about elderly relatives who cannot look after themselves but who are not permanently incapacitated?  The amount a person can covenant to them will now be restricted to 5 per cent of gross income.  I was Minister of State at the Department of <Col N="48" /> Health when the nursing homes regulations were introduced.  The reality is that those regulations are not working. Nursing home owners have increased the fees to accommodate themselves as regards the extra subvention.  I came across a case recently of a pensioner who has another small source of income and who is paying £130 per week for his wife in a private nursing home.  The subvention he is being granted is £21 per week.  It is no empty hyperbole on my part or on the part of any Member from this side of the House to state that amendments in relation to covenants, which are to finance something which has nothing to do with elderly people living in nursing homes, if carried through into law, will cause unendurable financial hardship for many families.</P>
    <P>What is the position about a covenant in favour of a cohabitee?  I am not asking the Minister for Finance to change the tax laws to favour cohabitation.  In some cases people are living together because divorce is not available.  Deputy McDowell referred to a good example of a person who had written to him about their situation.  What is the position about covenants in favour of children who do not qualify for Minister Bhreathnach's unexpected benevolence because their parents income is not sufficient to bring them into the fee paying category?</P>
    <P>The main core of the Bill concerns allowances.  The general exemption limits are increased by less than the rate of inflation.  In real terms the general exemption limits for tax purposes are reduced in the first year in which this country has had a budget surplus and at a time of almost unprecedented economic growth.  The paltry increases in tax allowances will be halved in real terms. The same applies to the extension of the tax band which is chargeable at the standard rate.</P>
    <P>I welcome even the 2 or 3 per cent increase in real terms in so far as it goes, but it is certainly not consistent with the Minister's claims to radicalism with which his budget speech was prepared. <Col N="49" /> It should come as no surprise that there is no real tax reform in the budget or in the Finance Bill, no real diminution in the tax burden, and that is because of the Government's abject failure to control expenditure, that monstrous weight borne exclusively by the traded sector of this economy.  Control of public expenditure, as anybody with even an elementary grasp of arithmetic will know, is the <i>sine qua non</i> of real tax reform and real tax reduction.  When public expenditure is allowed to grow, as it has been by successive Governments, at four or five times the rate of the price index, any notion of tax reform simply evaporates.  At the moment we have a deadly combination of a weak fiscal policy and a strong exchange rate policy which, if it goes unchanged, will lock this country for many years into an ever decreasing circle of high tax, high spending and high unemployment.  Since the political events of last November and the formation of the new Government people have told me that the Government will last the two years and is working.  It is something of a misstatement to say that the Government is working if over 20 per cent of the labour force is not.</P>
    <P>According to Deputy Broughan and others section 153 is based on a recommendation of Judge Hamilton in his beef tribunal report.  In many cases it will achieve the opposite of what was intended &mdash; if people trying to fiddle the system are engaged in tax evasion and know their auditor is now compelled to blow the whistle, they will use every device to keep the relevant information from the auditor.  It must also be remembered that the beef tribunal dealt with malpractices in the mid to late 1980s.  The world has moved on since and much has happened in the interim which considerably reduces the necessity for something like section 153.  For example, since the events reported on in the beef tribunal report, the Revenue Commissioners have been given sweeping powers under the revenue audit scheme, on top of the powers they already had, to conduct VAT and <Col N="50" /> PAYE inspections.  In addition, the accountancy profession's code of conduct has been amended to oblige its members to report any offences they find in the course of their auditing work.</P>
    <P>My fundamental objection to the present proposal is that it goes infinitely further than Judge Hamilton intended or, I am sure, anticipated.  The section provides that anybody involved in the preparation of the company's accounts must alert the company if he suspects an offence as defined is being committed. If the problem is not rectified within 30 days, he must then inform the Revenue Commissioners.  The list of offences about which the auditor must blow the whistle ranges from serious tax evasion at one end of the scale to the most minor transgressions at the other.  These include late filing of returns, an error however minor in the returns submitted, failure to keep detailed records.  For example, if a VAT return is one day late the reporting procedure is triggered.  If an auditor notices any irregularities in the manner in which a huge multi-million pound corporation operates its petty cash or pays the cleaning lady, he will be obliged to report.  If the auditor does not report, he or she has committed a criminal offence for which the maximum penalty, if prosecuted on indictment, is up to two years imprisonment. It is hard to imagine a more absurd proposal in a country where the prison system cannot hold the perpetrators of the most vicious crimes for more than a few months, sometimes only for weeks, because the system is bursting at the seams.  This legislation will, if implemented, alter irrevocably and fundamentally the relationship that traditionally existed between client and adviser.  It will create a climate of suspicion and, in many cases, hostility between the wealth creators of this country and their advisers.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered by the Minister and others advising him that auditors' fee income here expressed as a percentage of GDP is one of the highest in the world.  This proposal, by creating <Col N="51" /> a great deal of unnecessary unproductive extra work will oblige auditors to increase fees considerably.  This increase in costs will be particularly marked in the case of small and medium sized companies because the auditors' work will become more extensive when reviewing clients' accounting systems and financial results.  To put it in a nutshell, auditors and tax advisers are being compelled to do work which the Revenue Commissioners are paid to do anyway, but because they are being compelled to undertake this extra work, somebody will have to pay them.  Unfortunately, the people they will fall out with because they are compelled to do the work in the first place are the very people we as a nation are depending on to create employment and wealth.</P>
    <P>The public servant who is responsible for this legal Frankenstein must have left his intellect elsewhere on the day he conceived it, because the net effect of section 153, if it goes through in its present form, will be to turn every accountant's office into a downtown branch of the Revenue Commissioners. It will transform auditors from watchdogs into bloodhounds.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to change it.  I had correspondence this morning from the Institute of Taxation asking the most serious questions about the constitutionality of this provision, and I share its concern.  The provision is unworkable and tilts the balance dangerously. The most interesting thing I have discovered from my research on section 153 is that the Revenue Commissioners, the experts working at the coalface, do not want it.  What Deputy McDowell called &ldquo;some amateur from the Department of Finance&rdquo; has taken it upon himself to expand the fairly mild suggestions of Judge Hamilton into this legal monstrosity which will strangle many parts of the business sector and poison relationships between the people we are supposed to be encouraging to invest their money and create jobs and the people they employ to advise them.  The Revenue Commissioners, the people <Col N="52" /> who will have to work the section, do not want it.  I can say that without hesitation. Several tax officials have told me they do not want it.  It should not be forced through to satisfy the conscience of Democratic Left.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy, who is now in the House, is particularly interested in the provision relating to VAT on golf clubs. The VAT distinction between green fees to commercially operated golf courses and member-owned clubs has been abolished.  However, similar VAT distortions arise in the provision of other sporting facilities and in the health and fitness area generally.  This provision will be a powerful temptation, almost an invitation, to commercial providers of such services, not only there but in other sectors of the economy, who feel they are disadvantaged by the VAT exemption afforded to the nonprofit making bodies providing the same type of service and the same facilities.  It is hardly necessary for me or anybody else to point out that the removal of any such distortion will involve imposing VAT where it was not imposed before rather than removing it.</P>
    <P>Section 10 involves the removal of certain unemployment and disability benefit payments from the calculation of the total tax bill.  When this measure was introduced and tax extended to unemployment and disability benefit there was considerable angst among the members of Democratic Left, but what members of Democratic Left who expressed objection to this fail to recall is that for many years invalidity pensions were reckonable for tax purposes &mdash; invalidity pension is simply disability benefit expanded into book form where somebody has been on disability benefit for a year and is permanently incapacitated. I have come across many people who qualify for invalidity pension but prefer to stay on disability benefit even though it amounts to less money, because disability benefit was not reckonable for tax purposes.</P>
    <P>The view was taken that there was no logical distinction.  If disability benefit is included there will be no distinction <Col N="53" /> between disability and unemployment benefit.  Unemployment benefit is payable for a maximum period of 15 months while the payment of disability benefit may terminate before that period expires.  There is a powerful argument for including it as income should be taxable.  If a person is in receipt of £100 per week from unemployment and £100 per week disability benefit one would logically say they should pay the same amount of tax as the person in receipt of £200 per week from employment whose marital and financial circumstances are the same.  One is either in favour or against.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the position of Democratic Left on this issue.  It does not go one way or the other; it has not said that it will stand over the budgetary provision, as there are powerful arguments in favour of it or, because its colleagues in Government are not in favour, that it will abolish it.</P>
    <P>Child dependant allowances are excluded when reckoning unemployment and disability benefit.  What is the position regarding the payment of injury benefit, occupational injuries benefit and so on?  It seems that they have not been dealt with.</P>
    <P>In regard to the second concession another distinction is made whereby the first £10 per week of unemployment benefit is disregarded.  This is a ludicrous compromise and has been designed to try to convince people that what Democratic Left is doing is consistent with what it said it would do in office.  This is a delusion and will not work.  I doubt its constitutionality and cannot see any logical reason people whose circumstances are the same should not be treated in the same way. There is no logical reason for discriminating between disability and unemployment benefit.  It is a ludicrous and nonsensical monstrosity.</P>
    <P>The taxation system is a mess.  There are 3,000 pages of tax legislation bearing down on those who have to create wealth and employment in the economy. Many provisions in the tax code have achieved the opposite effect; they <Col N="54" /> are profoundly anti-enterprise and work.  The best we can do on Committee Stage is to make the best of a bad job.  I hope the Minister will be amenable to accepting reasonable amendments to eliminate the anomalies which are both glaring and obvious.</P>

      <P>If I did not speak the debate on the Finance Bill would not be complete.  It is extraordinary that there is no one on the Opposition benches.</P>
      <P>As is normal, the Finance Bill alludes to many interesting areas some of which are dealt with in great detail while other are mentioned in passing.  The Bill contains some excellent proposals and I do not think anyone could find serious fault with it or the budget.  One of the most welcome aspects of debate since the Government was formed is the responsible attitude taken by Democratic Left and its Minister and Ministers of State.</P>

      <P>A considerable number of people would have doubted its intentions and resolve to solve the country's problems but its performance to date has been excellent.  It has shown an ability to take tough decisions.  This would not have been the general view of the public six months ago.  It has been a shining example and I pay tribute to it for this.  It has agreed to measures which single party majority Governments did not have the guts to implement 15 to 20 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill contains some welcome measures.  I refer in particular to the urban renewal scheme under which provision is made for tax incentives to encourage the continued development of the five cities within the country &mdash; Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway.  The scheme is now being expanded to include a number of provincial towns, including my home town of Dungarvan, County Waterford.  In the past week the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, announced that villages and small towns will be able to avail of the <Col N="55" /> scheme to renovate a streetscape or historical and attractive dwellings.</P>
    <P>Measures were announced in the budget, under the aegis of the Department of Tourism and Trade, to promote the revitalisation of the traditional holiday resorts.  These are extraordinarily innovative and welcome.  Under this scheme the seaside resorts of Tramore and Youghal will benefit.  Both towns badly need a stimulus as the trend has been for people to take their holidays in scenic areas and areas which are sparsely populated such as the Ring of Kerry, the Dingle Peninsula and Connemara. That is another welcome phase in the development of the tourism industry but the traditional holiday resorts need an injection of capital to ensure a return to the levels of activity and prosperity they enjoyed in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.  I am sure that millions of pounds will be spent in each of these resorts.  There is tremendous enthusiasm in the towns of Tramore and Youghal where business people and the owners of tourist related facilities are delighted to have an opportunity to invest and attract outside capital.</P>
    <P>The days of the hurdy gurdy are gone as this kind of activity is no longer considered acceptable.  People now want to see something more meaningful in a tourist resort.  They do not want to be ripped off in amusement arcades containing slot machines which offer poor value and cost parents a huge sum of money if they have a number of children.  In other words, they want value for money and to engage in activities which are enjoyable, healthy, useful and productive. There should be sufficient facilities for outdoor and indoor activities.  The facilities have not been available on the scale needed in a country with such a variable climate as Ireland.  That was illustrated last summer.  When the south-east of England which is close to us was basking in sunshine for three months we had three months of dismal weather, with cloud and rain almost every day.</P>
    <P>Expensive amenities and facilities <Col N="56" /> should be made available to cater for people travelling to traditional holiday resorts.  People are no longer willing to sit indoors in guesthouses, hotels and caravans; they prefer to be involved in activities and if the facilities are not available the obvious alternative will be to go to a foreign holiday destination such as Spain, Italy or France.  It behoves us to ensure our people stay at home so that the badly needed revenue stays within the State.  Tourists who come here from abroad should also have the opportunity to enjoy themselves irrespective of weather conditions.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea referred to a statement in the Minister's speech about the recommendations of the beef tribunal. There is an angry mood among the public with regard to the lack of action on the recommendations of that tribunal, particularly considering that the taxpayer will have to pay more than £100 million in fines to the EU because of malpractices in the beef industry.  To compound the anger, to date nobody has been charged as a result of the irregularities that came to light during the course of the tribunal.  Although there are certain tax reliefs in the budget, taxpayers are overtaxed and they become particularly annoyed when an imposition such as this is placed upon them.</P>
    <P>A senior Government Minister, whether the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry or the Minister for Justice should state whether action will be taken against people who were clearly in breach of the law, as we illustrated in the beef tribunal.  People are infuriated that they are expected to pay for the sins of others.  That sense of injustice is widespread and it is justified.  People must be answerable for crimes and malpractices that occurred.  Although the malpractices took place during the course of previous administrations, the time has come for somebody in high office to make a categoric statement on what will be done about the people who <Col N="57" /> perpetrate frauds, for which the taxpayer is expected to pay.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago when I was a member of a previous Government a subsidiary of the Allied Irish Bank, namely, the ICI Insurance Company, found itself in massive financial difficulties and the Government of the day had to underwrite the losses of the institution in the tune of approximately £400 million. That money did not have to be paid out of public coffers but it was just a stroke of good fortune that the business of the companies in question improved and the losses were not very great.  Nevertheless nobody was prosecuted or answerable for putting at risk £400 million of taxpayers' money and the banking system.  To add insult to injury, two weeks ago the directors of the AIB gave themselves enormous salary increases which outraged the public and even the employees of the bank in question.</P>
    <P>The ordinary person believes that the bigger the crime the better the chance of getting away with it.  People who are caught are often generally law abiding citizens who do little out of the way but are soft targets easily apprehended perhaps for staying in a public house ten minutes after closing time or exceeding a speech limit by ten miles per hour. The laws must be implemented, but it appears that the bigger the crime the less likelihood there is of action being taken against the perpetrator.</P>
    <P>While reliefs in the income tax code are to be welcomed, they are not sufficient. We are one of the most, if not the most highly taxed country in western Europe.  Our rates of taxation are far too severe and the level at which income tax becomes payable is far too low.  In continental countries such as Germany and France people earning very good salaries, professional people and civil servants, enjoy a much better lifestyle because their level of taxation is much less than ours.  They earn a much greater amount of money before being subject to income tax and the levels of taxation are low in comparison to ours. A more serious effort is needed to ensure the levels at which income tax <Col N="58" /> apply and the rate of income tax payable are reduced.  That should be our primary concern because it will give hard working people a sense of fair play and it will give people who are not working an incentive to work.  Some people, particularly those with large families, find it more profitable not to work because they derive fringe benefits which bring their incomes up to a level superior to what they would earn if they were in jobs.</P>
    <P>I have referred publicly to the item in the Finance Bill which refers to the payment of VAT on specific activities in golf clubs.  Golf clubs do not get much sympathy because it is considered they cater for the better off sections of society and can afford to accept additional levels of taxation, but I do not agree.  Golf has now become a game for people of all classes.  There has been an explosion in the number of golf courses and clubs over the past five or six years and we may have more courses and clubs than are needed.  That means additional taxation will create severe problems for clubs competing in an overcrowded market.  It is a retrograde step to consider imposing 12.5 per cent VAT on green fees because golf is not just a leisure pastime for our people, it is also very much involved in our drive to increase tourism and any additional taxation in that regard would have a negative effect.  I do not see why we should encourage leisure activities, like golf, while at the same time increasing taxation on them; that seems contradictory. I do not see the sense in imposing 12.5 per cent VAT on green fees.  Many clubs have endured financial difficulties in the past few years.  As newly created clubs encountered growing pains and unexpected expenses and it is not helpful to impose 12.5 per cent VAT on them.  During the past winter some golf clubs were unable to operate for three to five months because of bad weather. They had large overheads and bills and had to retain and pay staff during that period while their income was virtually nil.  After that period of huge loss making it is insensitive to impose 12.5 per cent <Col N="59" /> VAT on them.  It is ill-timed, retrograde and contrary to the concept of tourists and the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>Regarding tax evasion and tax collection, it has always been my belief that the Revenue Commissioners have far too much power.  Their autonomy is envied by politicians and others, but it is not healthy.  Politicians should call the shots regardless of governmental activity.  I remember when I was appointed Minister for Agriculture being given advice by the then Secretary as to what I could or could not do and what it was inadvisable to do.  He made the point that the then three Land Commissioners were totally independent and could not be politically influenced.  That seemed a reasonable point because the division of land involves huge amounts of money and it would be wrong if political influence could affect the distribution or allocation of land.  My discussion with the Secretary was educational because I did not realise that was the case.  Over the years I have heard that various Ministers had been instrumental in giving away farms to their party political supporters.  It was something of a culture shock to be told that I could not have any hand, act or part in such decisions, but I was not annoyed or concerned because that is as it should be.  The Revenue Commissioners have almost a God given right to act independently and can go to extremes in some cases.  I appreciate that political influence might possibly affect their activities, but today I do not think that would be the case.</P>

      <P>We are not the masters of our own destinies or of the system of Government, we are very much the boys.  There are far too many institutions above and beyond the control and influence of politicians and I do not believe that is correct.  Politicians are elected by the people who expect them to be in charge, but we are not.  That applies not just to the Revenue Commissioners, but to all State and semi-State bodies.  We have a committee to investigate the activities of State and semi-State bodies.  The Minister is supposed to have control of State bodies under his jurisdiction, but that does not alter the fact that many people in authority in those bodies do what they like without reference to this House to which Members are elected and which is supposed to be in control of all activities within the State.  I do not believe that type of autonomy should be tolerated. There is a need for a basic change in our political system whereby politicians will again take control of all activities within the State; that is what we are elected for.  If ordinary members of the public realised what little influence is held by an elected Member of this House, they would be appalled.  If they thought that a politician was influencing day-to-day decisions on running State or semi-State bodies, they would be rightly appalled, but if there is interference people should be brought to book, made responsible and have to answer charges which would amount to fraud and corruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the worst of all worlds at present.  The public come to us with problems they believe we should be able to resolve.  We know we are not capable of resolving them because, whenever we ask a parliamentary question about such State or semi-State bodies we receive the stock reply that the relevant Minister has no responsibility, it is a matter solely for the State or semi-State body in question.  That is not the way to run any Government or country.  It is about time we politicians reasserted ourselves and administered the country.  We have delegated power to a number of other <Col N="61" /> people not answerable to the public which is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>Control of public expenditure goes hand in hand with taxation provisions and, until we control public expenditure, taxation will not be reduced to satisfactory levels.  Until we bite the bullet on overspending by State or semi-State bodies, taxation cannot be reduced realistically.  Any overspending State or semi-State body which could reasonably be expected to break even if in private hands, should be privatised. For far too long politicians have been afraid of pressure groups, of the influence of unions and other groups who do not have a mandate from the people. The privatisation of the majority of State and semi-State bodies could save us millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>I listened yesterday to the President of Hungary address the meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Joint Committee on European Affairs in the Seanad Chamber.  It would embarrass people here to realise that a country such as Hungary, recently freed from the shackles of communism, is privatising many of the services which remain nationalised here.  I can see no justification for burdening people with huge taxation while individual companies that should make a profit lose hundreds of millions of pounds.</P>

      <P>The Minister's introductory remarks yesterday revealed his very peculiar understanding of his role in that ministry, amounting as it does, to squandering public money and using KGB-type tactics to collect taxes, which is how I would describe the provision of section 153.  The role of any Minister of Finance is critical in any Government, a post cited specifically in our Constitution. An effective Minister for Finance needs to have a mature sense of proportion and a prudent approach to public finances, if he is to strike a balance between short term needs and sound, long term policies.  He must also communicate to the public the reasons for his long term policies in order to retain their confidence if our economy <Col N="62" /> is to prosper.  He cannot succeed if he engages in short term operations using ruses to conceal decisions and resorts to thoughtless comments which are taken seriously by those in the marketplace, in response to taxpayers' legitimate concerns.</P>
      <P>Lip service along to long term policies is not acceptable.  The Minister said repeatedly he would not go beyond his budget parameters and will control public spending.  We agree with what he says but we disagree with his doing nothing about it.  This State cannot afford the luxury of a Minister for Finance who enunciates the right policies, whose speeches are correct, but whose actions do not mirror them.  Any objective analysis of the Minister's speeches, when viewed against the most recent figures available, must indicate that the Minister is in favour of controlling public expenditure but in speech only; he is not in favour of actually doing so.</P>

      <P>The Minister's speech yesterday was significant both for its failure to deal with the Government's lack of control of public spending and for seeking to defend an unprincipled proposal to punish some people for the crimes of others.  Were it not that the Government does not know what it is doing, one might believe the Minister introduced section 153 in this Bill to detract public and investor attention from that lack of control of our public expenditure and the lack of any realistic foreign exchange rate policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was criticised on a number of fronts having introduced his first budget.  I might recall some of the criticisms I made a day or two afterwards because, unfortunately, what I predicted has happened in the intervening months.  I pointed out that the 6 per cent increase in spending in the year 1995 over that of 1994 was not possible and his claim was misleading, which is exactly what has been proved.  I also pointed out that the accounting was creative &mdash; it was in the National Housing Finance Agency with the Loan <Col N="64" /> Fund.  I pointed out that the Minister would not be able to hold public expenditure at 6 per cent, that it would head towards 10 per cent.  Unfortunately the figure produced by IBEC yesterday is approximately 10.4 per cent.  Public expenditure now appears to be heading to four times the Minister's predicted inflation rate of 2.5 per cent rather than twice that rate which he himself predicted in this House.</P>
    <P>I made it clear that the Minister's plan to limit spending to 2 per cent in real terms this year over the 1995 budgeted levels was not possible.  It has now become clear that it is not possible in that proposals already adopted by the parties in Government involve additional expenditure above the 2 per cent of approximately £177 million.</P>

      <P>I most certainly intend to avail of the opportunity of my visit to Moscow to raise that matter.  There is an enormous human tragedy unfolding in Chechnya.  The Government believes that the indiscriminate use of force in this case is disproportionate to the problem. There have been serious abuses of human rights and fairly significant numbers of unnecessary killings of civilians, particularly in the village of Samashki.  At the very outset of the conflict the Government appealed to the Russians to desist from this approach to the solution of the difficulties in Chechnya and it has supported the European policy of not signing the interim trade agreement with Russia until four conditions are met. These are as follows: first, there should be full co-operation with the OSCE permanent mission to deal with the situation in Chechnya and to provide mediation services and human rights monitoring services on the ground; second, there should be a ceasefire; third, there should be negotiations and, fourth, humanitarian aid should be allowed to flow into Chechnya unhindered.  To date the Russians have only taken steps to meet the requirement in regard to the OSCE monitoring group which I understand is travelling from Moscow to Chechnya today.</P>

This is a very serious issue and I will avail of the opportunity when speaking with President Yeltsin in Moscow to raise it.</P>

      <P>I expect the sanction to be given urgently.  I will do everything I can to ensure that the sanction for the recruitment of the two additional draftsmen is given speedily.  It is important for the House to understand that one cannot recruit four or five draftsmen at the same time as each of them has to be inducted over a two-year training period in a form of apprenticeship with the <Col N="67" /> existing draftsperson so that the knowledge is passed on.  The office simply could not accommodate more than two recruits at any one time during the training phase.

      <P>The issue of this invitation, in English, was not contrary to the guidelines in question.  These guidelines are general in nature.  The guidelines, issued in 1993, are intended as a basis for action programmes to be drawn up by Government Departments and State agencies to implement Government policy as set out in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997.</i> The Government is <Col N="70" /> committed under <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to continue the availability of State services through Irish and bilingually generally, and especially for the people of the Gaeltacht.</P>
      <P>My Department has formulated an action plan documenting the practical steps to be taken to implement this policy in so far as it is concerned.  Pursuant to that plan a committee is being established in the Department of the Taoiseach to oversee the promotion of Irish within the Department.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach not accept that the document published in 1993 states clearly that forms being sent to the Gaeltacht &mdash; some Members of this House live in Gaeltacht areas &mdash; should be bilingual or in Irish only?  Furthermore, as that document states there should be a move towards bilingualism, does he not accept it was a serious omission and an insult to a linguist minority to issue the invitation in English only?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter should be put in context.  We are talking about an invitation to a ceremony to commemorate the Holocaust and the end of the Second World War and to pay tribute, in particular, to the 10,000 Irish people who died in British uniforms during that war.  As a result of their sacrifice the continent of Europe was liberated from fascism and the Holocaust was brought to an end.  The Deputy will be aware that there were time contraints involved <Col N="71" /> in issuing the invitations because the commemoration had to take place within the timeframe of the anniversary. It was, therefore, a matter of issuing the invitations with reasonable speed and practicality and this was approached in a spirit of reconciliation and inclusiveness. While the Deputy could argue that he has a point, it should be put in the context of a commemoration designed to be as inclusive as possible, to bring together Irish people of different political traditions, some of which are more used to the use of the Irish language than others.  In that context the manner in which the invitations were issued was reasonable.  However, I will bear in mind the Deputy's concern that in so far as possible bilingual invitations should be issued.</P>
      <P>The invitations to the 1916 commemoration are bilingual and an advertisement in today's paper from my Department relating to the strategic management initiative appears in both Irish and English.  This indicates a reasonable degree of commitment in this area, but obviously there is room for improvement and we will continue to seek to achieve improvement in this area.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach not accept that in an era when we are trying to be all-inclusive, particularly in regard to minorities, and at a time when we are trying to show the people in the North that we are an inclusive State, it is very important to consider the linguistic minority, namely, Irish-speaking people?  Does he agree that the cavalier treatment of the linguistic minority in the issuing of these invitations would be of great concern to other minorities? Does the Taoiseach not agree that anybody with a basic knowledge of Irish could have translated the card involved in five minutes?  If he has a difficulty in having such invitations translated in the future, I will do it for him.</P>

      <P>We should keep a sense of proportion in these matters.  I <Col N="72" /> am not sure if the cause of the Irish language is served by making a federal case of a matter such as this.  Any questioning of my commitment in this area would be misplaced.  I am sure the Deputy will acknowledge that in so far as the place of the Irish language in Northern Ireland is concerned, in my very first contact with Prime Minister John Major I raised the issue of Meánscoil Feirste and as a result of my intervention and representations by others funding has been offered to that school. This is a practical endeavour to improve the position of the Irish language in Northern Ireland.  We must recognise, however, that while many from both traditions in Northern Ireland are enthusiastic about the Irish language, unfortunately others hold a different attitude towards it.  It is my earnest desire that both traditions are represented at the war memorial at Islandbridge on Friday.</P>

However, is the Taoiseach concerned that because of the second mix-up of the arrangements for the dates the forum will not be held next Friday morning?  I accept the day is important but if it is so important why were the arrangements not made in both languages and why was a proper date not sought on the first occasion?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware I announced in this House last February that it was intended to hold a commemoration of the liberation of Bergen-Belsen on 15 April this year. That was widely reported and it was in the Official Report to all Members of the House who wished to avail of it.  It was only two months later, when the first of the invitations were issued, that any query was raised about the appropriateness of that date which had been in the public domain for the previous two months.  As soon as I heard that there was difficulty from the point of view of representatives of the Jewish community in regard to that date, I had it changed immediately because I was anxious to ensure that this commemoration would be one with which everybody would feel happy.  I make the point, however, that by putting it on the record in this House two months previously I gave very full notice to the Jewish community and indeed to members of that faith in this House that 15 April was the intended date.  I regret it was not until the invitations were issued that the difficulty was drawn to my attention but, as soon as it was, we changed the date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Deputy O'Rourke's point about the postponement of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, perhaps the Deputy and I have a different view about this.  I believe that a commemoration in this State of the sacrifice of people in British uniforms in ending Nazi tyranny in Europe, and a commemoration for the first time by a Taoiseach of this State at the Irish war memorial in Islandbridge &mdash; a place which has not been visited frequently by <Col N="74" /> Taoisigh of previous Governments &mdash; is probably a more effective means of saying to those of the Unionist and British tradition in Northern Ireland that we value their sacrifice too.  This is an important practical demonstration of reconciliation by this Government and I hope it will be supported.  I am glad this has been facilitated by the arrangements in regard to the forum.  I understand there were no great difficulties in making the rearrangements on that basis. Obviously, one had to select a date and was limited in that regard by diary considerations&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right to commemorate these tragedies.  However, is the Taoiseach perhaps taking too much credit because my understanding is that the national day of commemoration, which we have instituted here for many years now, is a one day commemoration to commemorate all those who died in various struggles?  To an extent, therefore, we have always honoured those people through the national day of commemoration and perhaps the self-congratulatory nature of the Taoiseach's reply might be a little over the top in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy was here when I answered questions on this matter in February he would know that the national day of commemoration will continue.  Indeed, I made it clear in answer to questions in March that specific references to the end of the Second World War would be included in the speech to be made at this year's national day of commemoration.  This is the 50th anniversary of the ending of the Second World War; it is not the 51st or the 49th anniversary and it is appropriate to commemorate those who gave their lives to free Europe from Nazi tyranny. If they had not done so there is no guarantee that this country would have been free of that tyranny either.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach deserves to be complimented because, despite our national day of commemoration, we have turned a blind eye to one section of our community and have felt ashamed of honouring what they did. The Taoiseach said that he wanted the ceremony on Friday to be as inclusive as possible.  Has he extended invitations to the leadership of all the parties on this island?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have done so.  The invitations have been extended quite widely.  The ceremony will be open to all members of the public but it might be of interest to know that the following have been invited: the representatives of all political parties on this island; Members of the Oireachtas; members of the Irish War Memorial Committee; the British Legion; the Jewish Representative Council; the D-Day Association; all Holocaust survivors living in Ireland that we were able to identify; the survivors of the North Strand bombing; former Taoisigh; senior members of the Judiciary, Army, Garda and Defence <Col N="76" /> Forces; representatives of ONE; the veterans of foreign wars of the United States; the American Legion; UN veterans; the Irish-Jewish Museum Committee; the Irish-Israeli Friendship Association and the British and Israeli Ambassadors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. G. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I informed the House of the areas designated under the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development and the basis on which these areas were chosen in reply to written Question No. 40 of 15 February 1995.  These were objective and measurable criteria such as indicators of disadvantage. feasible operational boundaries and viability in terms of size and <Col N="77" /> economic base.  I announced the boundaries, based mainly on district electoral divisions, of the Dublin areas on 14 March 1995, and a map has been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. District electoral divisions are used as the basis to describe the boundaries for their precision but also because statistical data has been gathered on the basis of district electoral divisions and this facilitates comparison and measuring the success of the programme.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of a risk that part of a designated area could include an area or community which might not be considered to meet all the criteria of disadvantage. However, I think that this is more likely to be the case in rural areas, and it was recognised that this was the case, because disadvantage tends to be far more dispersed in rural areas.  I do not think I could accept that there are inconsistencies in the case of the partnership areas in Dublin.  In fact, a great deal of thought was given to considering how disadvantaged areas surrounded by otherwise affluent areas could benefit from the programme.  Hence the designation, for instance, of pockets of disadvantage in Dún Laoghaire and south County Dublin where individual estates have been identified to be targeted in what amounts to an urban region.  I doubt that these particular circumstances are replicated elsewhere.</P>
      <P>A point to bear in mind also is that the programme refers to the development of areas and enabling people to have greater access to employment opportunities within those areas.  The involvement of those who provide employment or service opportunities is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendations for the boundaries of the designated areas were based on assessment of the area and wide local consultation which was undertaken by the national co-ordinating team.  The recommendations were to the interdepartmental policy committee on local development and myself.  There may be some changes to these boundaries. though I am satisfied that the existing <Col N="78" /> boundaries make sense.  However, if the Deputy has a serious concern about any area I would ask him to let me know and I will consider the matter.</P>
    <P>Partnerships in the designated areas are among the eligible groups under the operational programme.  The others are sectoral organisations such as those representing or working on behalf of travellers or with the capacity to contribute to achieving the objectives of the programme and communities in other areas.  These can be assisted in the same way as partnerships if they meet given criteria.  Funding for the latter category is in the range of 17 per cent-22 per cent of that available under the sub-programme on integrated development of designated disadvantaged and other areas.  This category was included specifically to enable communities outside designated areas to have access to the provisions of the programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the Minister of State's reply dated 15 February setting out the criteria.  I wish to comment on the extension of the boundaries.  I am not an expert on the south side of the city but the newly designated Drimnagh-Crumlin partnership area seems to be centred in the Minister's constituency. How does the Minister justify the extension to the Coolock-Darndale partnership area?  The new boundaries extend to Sutton Cross and include properties in the £250,000 bracket &mdash; I am sure people such as the former Attorney General, Eoghan Fitzsimons, did not ask that his area be designated a disadvantaged area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as well as middle class Raheny and pockets of Clontarf and Griffith Avenue, where the Taoiseach's brother, Deputy Richard Bruton, lives and which we look on as one of the most exclusive avenues in the Drumcondra area.  There seems to be no logic to the way the map is drawn.  The scheme is about trying to give a leg up to the long term unemployed who live in areas of high unemployment.  Surely <Col N="79" /> it nullifies the scheme to give the same advantages to areas all over the place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The boundaries were drawn on the advice of people who went out and measured the difficulties people face in the community.  The Deputy could have mentioned also that Áras an Uachtarán is in a disadvantaged area. The designation of disadvantaged areas is based on district electoral divisions.  If the Deputy wants an area designated, and it can be included in a partnership area, I will do that.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach is the Deputy for Dún Laoghaire which is obviously an area of great advantage but there are pockets of disadvantage. In that area we literally designated housing estates but it was not possible to use that formula in other parts of the city.</P>
      <P>The boundary in my area of Crumlin-Drimnagh leaves out Terenure, Templeogue and Harold's Cross but I am aware that parts of Harold's Cross would meet the criteria.  The boundaries have to fall somewhere.  They were not drawn by me, although I examined them.  If the Deputy wishes to have the boundary redrawn in an area contiguous to an existing area he should let me know and I will be happy to have the matter examined. We should not throw out the baby with the bath water.</P>

      <P>This is an integrated programme and I think there is a great deal of misunderstanding about it in the House.  People need to read more about local development.  I believe that the role of local development in job creation will be similar to that of the credit union movement in the financial sector.  It will not replace the IDA or any jobs agency but it will have an important role for a certain segment of the community.  I forecast, based on advice I have received, that we should be able to create 8,000 jobs from local development projects in one to five person micro-enterprises.  I would not be surprised if over the next five years that target is exceeded but it is what I have set for the five-year period.  Those jobs will largely be created in areas of great need.  We will be integrating educational opportunities in the programme for those who are most likely to leave school early and who inevitably become long term unemployed.</P>

      <P>The Minister has announced that up to 8,000 new jobs will be created under the local development scheme and has suggested that we should try to learn more about it.  How can he do that and not address the fact that the Government has savagely cut 7,000 people from the community employment scheme?  It is one thing to issue press releases setting out what the Government will do but now people are being turned away from very valuable schemes from which 4,000 people benefited last year.</P>
      <P>What is the Minister going to do about it?  Is he concerned that there are a number of agencies &mdash; I understand in the Cork-Kerry area there are 30 &mdash; dealing with unemployment?  That is not necessarily bad but there are four Ministers &mdash; two Fine Gael Ministers, Deputies Bruton and Mitchell, one Labour Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald and one Democratic Left Minister, Deputy Rabbitte &mdash; dealing with unemployment and there are many new schemes.  Who is co-ordinating the effort?  The Minister should state if he is responsible.  The key question is what the Government is doing about the 7,000 people who are not allowed participate in the community employment scheme.</P>

      <P>The report of the Government task force on <i>A Crusade for Survival</i> was published in April 1994.  The report made a large number of policy recommendations. They cover issues on agricultural and rural development, social welfare incentives, manufacturing industry, tourism, marine development, infrastructure and sustainable development and institutional issues.  These issues span a number of Government Departments.  Considerable progress has been made under each of the headings by the Departments concerned.  I will forward to the Deputy a detailed statement outlining the main developments in each area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal recommendation of the task force was that an outline plan of the region should be prepared by a new <Col N="86" /> body, the Western Development Partnership Board.</P>
    <P>The commitment of this Government to the west of Ireland is well illustrated by my own appointment.  In my capacity as Minister of State responsible for western development and rural renewal, I have responsibility for the Western Development Partnership Board, for the establishment of a pilot programme on an integrated approach to the delivery of public services in remote rural areas and as chairman of the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development, I am also responsible for the development and improvement of living conditions on our off-shore islands.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of general legislative and regulatory structures for broadcasting in EU states reflects each state's history and experience and it is difficult, if not impossible, to make a meaningful comparison between institutions in one State and those in another.  In each state one can find institutions with broadly similar functions in the broadcasting field, such as Departments with responsibility for culture, communications, or radio frequency management. There are also broadcasting authorities, licensing authorities and standards authorities which have different relationships with central Government and regional authorities where they exist.  In France, for example, I understand that there is a broadcasting regulatory authority &mdash; Conseil Superior de l'Audiovisuel &mdash; which can <Col N="89" /> be said to be responsible for licensing television and radio stations and which also governs cable and satellite television. However, there is also a Ministry of Culture which has responsibility for broadcasting law.</P>
      <P>In contrast, in the UK, apart from the Board of Governors of the BBC there is a separate regulatory authority for private television broadcasters and an authority for private radio operators. There is also a Department of National Heritage which is responsible for developing broadcasting law.  These are the arrangements which exist in other jurisdictions and they reflect the history of each individual country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Is the Minister interested in considering the establishment of the supreme broadcasting regulatory body here?  If so, would he consider that the establishment of such a body would be nothing more than another quango, albeit a super quango?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I found the wording of the question exotic.  I was asked whether there exists in other EU countries one supreme broadcasting regulatory body, which has a certain resonance. I have not suggested one supreme body for anything but I think the Deputy may be referring to newspaper speculation in relation to future institutional arrangements for the management of broadcasting which will be discussed on the occasion of the publication tomorrow of the Green Paper on Broadcasting.  In that sense the future structures will be discussed.  There never was a suggestion of one supreme body but the future institutional arrangements and structures can be discussed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amused by the Minister when he said this was an exotic question.  If that is so the Minister has not disappointed us in giving an exotic answer.  This question refers to one supreme broadcasting regulatory body for the entire broadcasting sector.  I referred to the other member states also &mdash; not simply for comparison purposes <Col N="90" /> but to ascertain how appropriate such a body is for the whole question of broadcasting. Perhaps the Minister would enlighten the House by giving his personal option as to how broadcasting should be undertaken with regard to any such proposed regulatory body?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be as fair as I can.  Unfortunately, it is exactly as I have said.  Throughout the European Union member countries reflect their own history and their own institutional arrangements.  I gave examples from France and the BBC.  In preparing the Green Paper I looked at broadcasting considerations in the European Union and Scandinavian countries but there is no single model available.  On the occasion of the publication of the Green Paper on the future of broadcasting a number of issues and choices which have to be faced will be listed in that document.  I offered my thinking in favour of some of them.  There were also opportunities for professionals, practitioners and other interested parties to offer their views.  It would have been wrong to have invented an abstract notion and to have made a broadcasting consideration fit into it.  At the end of the day this is Question Time in the Dáil and I am responsible for broadcasting. From that point I depart both in my considerations today and in the Green Paper tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 21 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to my reply to Questions Nos. 2, 6, 12, 17 and 24 on 2 March 1995 &mdash; columns 102 to 105 of the Official Report.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in that reply, the question of funding of local and community radio is one of many issues raised in the Green Paper on Broadcasting which will be published tomorrow.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Radio and Television Act, 1988, it is a matter for the Independent Radio and Television Commission to arrange for the provision of sound broadcasting services other than those operated by RTE. There is no provision under the Act for public funding of non-RTE broadcasting stations.  Any proposals to change this situation which might be developed will be informed by the debate and discussion generated by the Green Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to preempt the debate.  Two points are clear and there is no difference of opinion about them.  Those who applied for licences under the 1988 broadcasting legislation dealing with the commercial sector did so in expectation of a commercial advantage.  At that time they did not seek public funding.  The second point is that there are certain kinds of infrastructural costs referred to in the document circulated to Deputies and Senators by the Association of Independent Radio Stations.  It refers to the infrastructural costs of news gathering, transmission and whatever.  The appropriate way to discuss this is in a full debate over the six months which will follow the publication of the Green Paper which addressed this issue.</P>

      <P>I am interested in the Minister's reply.  Many of these questions will hinge on the debate that will ensue on the Green Paper.  I would be interested to hear the personal view of the Minister with specific responsibility for broadcasting.  In that capacity does the Minister intend to fund local radio to help the provision of facilities he has mentioned, particularly training and development for local radio, transmission costs and the provision of specialised programming?</P>

I have suggested that those wishing to comment on the Green Paper should do so before the end of September.  I certainly have my views and I discussed them with representatives of AIRS on more than one occasion.  In addition to that it falls to me to respond to the debate on the Green Paper and prepare necessary legislation, and I hope to do that during the lifetime of this Government.</P>

It is laudable that the Minister should put his views forward to a particular organisation, and it is his right to do so.  By the same token it is equally the right of this House to hear the Minister's views on this issue in regard to which he has already admitted to preparing to discuss in committee, as it were, with smaller groups and organisations.</P>

Why does he object to giving a personal opinion on these issues?  It is all very well to say these matters will be discussed in a Green Paper.

I have views on broadcasting and the Deputy will have no difficulty discovering them.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always been committed to a planned, strategic, approach to the development of the arts.  With the formation of the previous Administration in January 1993, I secured practical expression of this objective when that Government's programme indicated that An Chomhairle Ealaíon would be asked to operate on a co-ordinated three yearly plan for funding of the arts.  The Government's programme goes even further by stating that the three year plan will be the basis for a programme of action.</P>
      <P>
        <i>The Arts Plan 1995-1997</i> drawn up by An Chomhairle Ealaíon which was the subject of statements in this House on 6 April last, will soon be considered by Government.  It represents an excellent basis for the elaboration of public policy on funding and development of the arts. My statement to the House on 6 April set out additional funding structures for the capital funding of new arts and cultural infrastructure up to the year 1999. These clear public elaborations of public policy lead me to conclude that preparation of a White Paper on the Arts is not a necessity at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that since the Arts Council was established there has been a major increase in the number of bodies now supporting the arts in one way or another?  For example, there is a full Government Department of arts and culture, a section of that Department dealing with cultural tourism, and local authorities involved in promoting and disbursing moneys to the arts in a manner not done previously.  All these bodies between them disburse hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money.  Will the Minister accept that the time is now ripe to define the respective responsibilities of those bodies, the relationship they have one to the other, and their relationship to the art-promoting world, put in place new structures that reflect the progress that has been made and work for future progress in arts and culture?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I deeply appreciate the Deputy's interest.  There is no fundamental difference between us except in regard to ordering priority in terms of where a White Paper might fall.  The Deputy has referred on numerous occasions, as have I and others, to the number of reports that exist, Deaf Ears, Dancers and the Dance, Access and Opportunity and the Benson report in 1979.  From that period in 1979 to the present there have been a number of very fine reports which gathered dust. In the preparatory period for the publication of the plan for the period 1995-99 a number of strategic studies were commissioned by the Arts Council, Temple Bar Properties and others.</P>
      <P>I have been concentrating on trying to get the capital funding co-ordinated with the planned provision of current funding so that the two would run together.  I have also been trying to negotiate the lateral strengthening of the arts by negotiating with the Departments of the Environment, Education, Foreign Affairs etc., and have been giving that priority.  I do not want my answer to be misconstrued as saying there is a case against a White Paper but that I have been concentrating more recently on this.  At this stage the quality of the reports that have accrued since 1979 and the specialist reports carried out in the last two years is good enough for us to operate on.  However, I am willing to tell the Deputy that I will keep the question of a White Paper under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that despite all the reports he has received, all of which are appreciated, we still have a situation in art development that is unacceptable in that there is grave disparity of funding between Dublin and the regions, and we have areas of art discipline, like dance, which are grossly underfunded and grossly underdeveloped.  Despite all the studies to which the Minister referred, whole areas need further attention, the kind of attention that can only be given in the context of a White Paper well prepared, <Col N="97" /> based on the information we now have, openly and democratically debated in this House and the provisions of which are then put in place both in terms of policy making and funding and of giving assistance to the arts bodies, some of which are confused by the proliferation of funding bodies and which do not see clearly how they can advance their own agenda from now on.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the years I mentioned was 1979, the year of the publication of the Benson report.  It is important to remember that was 16 years ago.  What we must do is compare the last two years with the previous 14. The Benson report was published in 1979, Dancers and the Dance has been in existence for nearly ten years as has the study of music, Deaf Ears.  What is needed is action in regard to making capital provision and integrating current provision for that.  I am sympathetic to what the Deputy has to say, if we can get to that point, but I do not see it as the top priority.  There has been a tidal wave of creativity in the arts, which I welcome, which has unleashed demand. The reports of the last year and a half point to people on inadequate wages, in insecure positions, and the need to integrate these into more permanent structures. That is the work that I and the Department are doing.  I will keep the question of a White Paper under review, if I find needs have changed.  I have been devoting most of my energies to integrating current expenditure and having the plan implemented.  I will bear the Deputy's views in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a saying in Cork that we are always one plan away from action.  I hope the three year arts plan is not the one which keeps us away from it.  Having read the plan in great detail I have grave fears that some of the weaknesses highlighted will remain throughout the next 14 years.  A strong case can be made for the publication of a White Paper to ensure that we build on the progress made throughout the country in the different disciplines of the arts.</P>

      <P>An area of some 180 acres adjacent to the lake has been offered for sale and the purchase was considered by the National Parks and Wildlife Service.

      <P>Given his interest in this area I am sure the Minister is aware that Tullagher Bog is the last remaining natural raised bog in County Clare. Clare and north Kerry are unique in that they are the only places where the midland bogs reach the west coast.  They have been replaced everywhere else with blanket bog.  That reference is taken from <i>Bellamy and Bellamy,</i> 1966. If he so desires, I can give a copy of the full statement to the Minister after Question Time.  The Doonbeg community in particular wish to see this bog preserved, given its importance in ecological terms, and would like to know <Col N="99" /> when they can expect to receive support from the Office of Public Works in the form of road improvements within and on the perimeter of the heritage zone, the development of small scale parking facilities, directional signs from main population centres, the signposting of individual attractions within the zone, interpretative signs and brochure and the construction and placement of bird hides.  They would like to see the Minister encouraging the Office of Public Works, if it is in need of such encouragement, to provide such facilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that Tullagher Bog is of interest and I do not dispute its significance as a raised bog. The criteria which the Office of Public Works uses are availability &mdash; this has been met &mdash; the degree of threat and its place in relation to other competing projects within the annual budget set aside for projects.  We are not disputing its ecological value; because of its ranking it has not been possible to consider it for purchase now but the appropriate section will keep the matter under review.</P>

I commend the local community for their interest in ecological integrity and for wanting to <Col N="100" /> preserve this bog.  Perhaps others could follow their example.  It is not being left aside; I will ask the National Parks and Wildlife Service to keep me advised about the possibilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate adjourned I said the speech of the Minister for Finance revealed that he has a very strange understanding of his role. Given his central role in Government he needs to maintain public confidence. One sure way of not doing so is to lay out policies in a number of scripts and then ignore them.  His speech yesterday was significant because it did not deal with the Government's lack of control over public spending and it sought to defend an unprincipled proposal to punish some people for the crimes of others. Section 153 is not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the budget speech in February I made a number of predictions which angered the Minister, and it gives me no great pleasure to say that they have come to pass.  The Minister claimed in his budget speech that there would be a 6 per cent increase in current spending in 1995 over 1994.  I pointed out that was misleading because there was no way he could meet that target.  I also pointed out that the creative accounting recently used in the case of the Housing Finance Agency would, no matter how he <Col N="132" /> juggled it, add to the overall national debt, and that has happened.  I said that spending for 1995 would be about 10 or 10.5 per cent, and it seems that figure will be realised.  It was made clear to the Minister at the time of the budget that spending would be about four times the rate of inflation, which is now the case.</P>
    <P>I pointed out to the Minister at the time of the budget that he had ignored the huge reduction of EU transfers to Ireland, which amount to in the order of about £500 million, and possibly twice that figure.  No account was taken in the budget or in the Finance Bill of the fact that after 1999 we will be without those significant transfers.  The Minister must urgently build those sums into his calculations for the future.</P>
    <P>I pointed out to the Minister in February that his budget policies would lead to higher interest rates, and that too has happened.  If he had retained the policies pursued since 1987 of steadily reducing income tax and the current budget deficit, the recent increase in interest rates would not have been necessary.  Thankfully the rates seem to have stabilised.  When it is believed in the marketplace, which is extremely sensitive, that the Government is not serious about its budget targets, domestic interest rates are adjusted accordingly. It gives me no pleasure to remind the Minister that the predictions made by this party a few short months ago appear to be coming to pass, although from the nation's point of view it would be better if some of them did not come about.</P>
    <P>Since the budget the Minister has continued to allow expenditure to increase.  He tried to pretend that spending was not increasing by using creative accounting gimmicks, such as the National Housing Agency mortgage sale, the selling of a State asset from one to another part of the State and requiring the other part to borrow the money to buy it from the first part.  That is simply creative accountancy and I do not believe anybody is taken in by that type of financial misbehaviour.  The additional expenditures which have <Col N="133" /> come to light since the budget was announced will lead to excessive spending in 1995-96.  The Minister said that in 1996 he would be able to restrict borrowing to 2 per cent, but it is clear he will not be able to do that.  In 1997 we will be dealing with substantially greater figures being off-line in budgetary terms.</P>
    <P>Based on the record to date, according to my calculations, it is likely that the Minister's lack of control in this area will result in current spending being at least £200 million above the 1995-96 expenditure levels set out in the 1995 budget.  The Minister predicted certain figures when he introduced the budget but it appears that when the final tally is made at the end of the year he will be at least £200 million off his high target. The increased expenditure level without increased taxation will bring Government borrowing to more than £1 billion, more than 3 per cent of GDP, unless the Minister decides to collect additional revenue by way of taxation or from the sale of assets.  He cannot come into the House on the next budget day and tell the country that he needs to borrow £1 billion.  He is likely to try to sell other assets in the course of the year to reduce that figure or to consider taxation increases.  I do not believe he would be so politically unwise as to consider direct taxes, but I am sure he will consider indirect ones in a number of areas, perhaps in the motoring area.  I heard earlier that taxes may be imposed on radios, walkmans and other such goods. It seems the Minister will take that course unless he wants to announce to the House on the next budget day the need to borrow £1 billion.  It is a long time since this country had to borrow £1 billion as a result of one year's budgetary provisions.  It is tragic that we have been brought back to the position where we are into a four figure borrowing level when it had been reduced to a manageable three figure level.</P>
    <P>The markets have become extremely <Col N="134" /> concerned by the Minister's lack of control in this area.  Yesterday IBEC released a critical commentary on the state of and outlook for public finances. Irish exporters have complained bitterly about the exchange rate policies being pursued by the Government.  Unfortunately, there has been little or no response from the Government on that issue other than to reiterate it is monitoring the position, but that is not an exchange rate policy.  We require clear explanation and exposition of what strategy we are following on exchange rates.  It is not enough just to monitor the situation because real exporters must deal in the marketplace and need to know the Government's policy in this area.  The Minister has ignored these problems either because he does not know how to deal with them or does not want to keep a grip on public spending. I notice whenever he is cornered into answering a question on this issue he tries to lay out the responsibility for doing the job, but the figures keep on rising.  There is a type of rake's progress operating here.  The Minister appears to want to do something without finding the courage to do so.  I am not sure where he is getting his political advice. but he needs to think out the position again.  The Minister's lack of control in this area of public spending is matched only by his lack of any recognition of the increased cost of his policies in higher interest rates and higher exchange rates.  Like all good socialist intellectuals the Minister for Finance can rationalise whatever action he takes, including maintaining contradictory policies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">

      <P>I thought the Deputy was going to suggest he was one of the socialist intellectuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but one out of two is not bad.  The Minister has convinced himself that he is managing the Government's finances well, although current spending this year will be well above comparable 1994 levels.  He will try to conceal this further by creative <Col N="135" /> accounting to hide the extent of the spending spree.  The off balance sheet Government decisions of recent days are among those creative accounting mechanisms to which I referred.  As long as the country is made aware of those, it will not be taken in by them.</P>
      <P>The second major failure of the Minister is his proposal to make it a crime for certain people not to inform the Revenue Commissioners when they have reasonable grounds for believing that a company has not complied with the tax Acts.  Our legislative system has developed steadily and solidly over many years.  It is designed to provide a reasonable balance between the rights of individuals and the needs of society. In spite of major difficulties in ensuring our society functions properly and that the authorities get proper support from citizens, the Legislature has properly believed that there were set limits beyond which citizens should not be required to take action.</P>
      <P>Under our system of democracy citizens are not the policemen of the Government, the agents of the State or the agents of institutions even where they have reasonable grounds to believe a serious crime has been committed by a particular person or persons.  This snitch section 153 purports to turn citizens into agents of the State and they are open to criminal prosecution if they do not advise the Garda of any belief they may have that a particular person committed any crime, including that of murder.  It is not a crime not to report one's suspicions except in the tax area.  There are good reasons why our system has been so structured.  The Minister believes that he knows better and seems to consider that our system should be changed in order to force our citizens to be agents of the Revenue Commissioners.  That is socialist intellectualism at its best.  He has promoted section 153 without any regard to past thinking on the role of the citizen in a democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's proposal is an outrageous attack on our citizens' rights. The heart of the proposal is to make it <Col N="136" /> a crime for some person not to advise the Revenue Commissioners that somebody else has committed a crime.  That is turning our democracy on its head and the populace at large into agents of the Revenue Commissioners, breeding hate and all sorts of tension in our society.  It is an outrageous attack on citizens' rights and should be withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Even if one accepted the principle of section 153, which I do not, it is oppressive that certain small tax advisers, others who give tax advice and professionals generally must report their suspicions to the tax authorities.  Even if one accepted that principle, is it not extraordinary that the employees or management of a company, who may have cheated the tax man, are exempt from the proposal?  It seems to be all right not to require the management or employees of a company to be responsible for reporting suspicions within the tax area but a tax adviser must do so, which is most unfair.  It is also extraordinary that the Revenue Commissioners did not take prompt action where and whenever tax irregularities were identified. I agree with Members who complain that action was not taken on alleged tax irregularities within beef companies.  Have the Revenue Commissioners or others taken administrative action to guard against this being repeated?</P>
    <P>The Minister claims that the proposal in section 153 is justified by virtue of the findings of the beef tribunal.  In the course of our debates on that tribunal I called specifically for action against those engaged in tax fraud; there is no excuse for not taking action in such cases.  Any tax fraud identified by the findings of that tribunal should have been acted on by the Revenue Commissioners, Director of Public Prosecutions or any other person authorised to take action.  Failure to act is simply not acceptable.</P>
    <P>Neither do I accept that the section constitutes the proper or appropriate reaction to the findings of the beef tribunal since there is more than adequate <Col N="137" /> legislation to ensure that companies provide proper tax returns and records if the Revenue Commissioners utilise the powers available to them.  After a decade of tax Bills giving the Revenue Commissioners, in many cases almost draconian powers, nobody can be in any doubt about the need for tax compliance. To go a step further and tell the electorate it is not enough that the Revenue Commissioners have very strong powers, perhaps stronger powers than the Garda, to inquire into every aspect of one's financial dealings to ensure tax compliance is going too far.  I object to an addition to that very strong code by requesting, not merely the Revenue Commissioners to do their job but citizens to bring stories to the Revenue Commissioners in an organised manner.</P>
    <P>In the good old days there may have been a £100 reward for information advertised on a telegraph pole.  Perhaps the Minister should have considered such a reward system if he wanted information about people's tax affairs. The Revenue Commissioners have extremely strong powers and should use them.  They do not need the assistance of three million citizens to furnish them information through tax advisers.  It does not create a healthy atmosphere to make it a criminal offence not to report on one's neighbours' financial affairs. That introduces a whole new concept in law.  The public find this proposal so distasteful, not because they are in favour of tax evasion but because they are against the concept of reporting on their neighbours when the Revenue Commissioners have plenty of power to make any inquiry about tax evasion in any area.</P>
    <P>If the Revenue Commissioners decide to investigate the financial affairs of any individual or company here, there is none they cannot tear apart.  I can only conclude that the Minister has introduced the section, in a desperate effort to devise any measure that might advance the date of payment, thereby reducing the cost of excessive public spending.  Perhaps he hopes to obtain extra revenue from the provisions of <Col N="138" /> this section, thereby reducing his deficit problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been less than frank in suggesting that the section applies to companies only.  I fear the Minister's arguments on the need for this section will be recycled by him in order to extend its provisions to individuals.  I abhor his proposal as oppressive, an attack on our civil liberties; indeed, the KGB would have been proud of it.</P>
    <P>The Minister will not be forgotten for upsetting what people believe is the prudent balance reflected in our legal framework which constitutes the proper relationship between individual citizens and the State.  This section is fundamentally wrong and should be withdrawn. The Minister has failed to prudently manage the nation's affairs and to exercise a mature sense of proportion in the conduct of his office.  While he may be the first Labour Party Member to become Minister for Finance, based on experience to date, that is a luxury this country cannot afford a second time.  It is very obvious that there is now no possibility of any tax cuts being implemented in 1996.  Following ten years of steady reductions in tax rates it is tragic that policies are being reversed, ruling out any tax cuts in 1996, even to the extent of considering tax increases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>While many sections of this Bill are welcome, there are others where I should have liked to have seen significant improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in Democratic Left are very conscious that a rising tide no longer lifts all boats.  In this respect I have in mind some constituents, lone parents, who asked me to calculate their net benefit from the social welfare budgetary changes.  While the increase in social welfare benefit for lone parents is real, constituting a step in the right direction, <Col N="139" /> it is rather small.  Does the Minister agree that the lone parent's benefit being increased by 60p a week is not sufficient, bearing in mind that lone parents must bear considerable expenses and hardship?  While conceding that the Government is going in the right direction, the increases are meagre.</P>
    <P>I am concerned also about another constituent, a woman recently widowed, who invested money in a special savings account in a building society for two years, believing she would benefit from not having deposit interest retention tax levied on the proceeds.  Then the Minister's budgetary proposal interfered with her planned income over the following year, as a result of which she has lost considerably.  With regard to deposit interest retention tax and special savings accounts I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that there are some innocent people, with small, limited incomes, who had anticipated a yield from their small investments which has been affected somewhat by his budgetary proposals.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to address this issue.  While it may not be appropriate to the Bill before us it has implications for many people, including the innocent woman standing at a bus stop in O'Connell Street who was shot in the leg &mdash; 18 pellets were removed from her leg &mdash; during a bank robbery and who was awarded £224.49 by the criminal injuries compensation tribunal.  This issue needs to be addressed as many people are making substantial claims for relatively minor accidents.  My school friends and I suffered more serious accidents when we were growing up yet we never thought of making claims for compensation.  This issue is particularly interesting when one considers the compensation paid to farmers for setting aside their land.  In 1994 approximately 16,000 farmers were paid up to £10,000 each for setting aside their land while 31 better off farmers were paid in excess of £50,000 each for not working their land. This highlights the anomalies in the <Col N="140" /> system which, hopefully, can be rectified by the Government.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the new radom audits carried out by the Revenue Commissioners, an issue which is of particular relevance to this debate.  In reply to a parliamentary question tabled by me the Minister said that no new random cases were selected for audit in 1993 and that he was advised by the Revenue Commissioners that certain factors made it impractical to include an element of random audits in the overall audit programme for 1993.  One of the reasons given was the need to give taxpayers the opportunity to avail of the amnesty and to release staff to undertake amnesty related work.  Many people who are supposed to be pillars of our society benefited to the tune of hundreds of million of pounds from this amnesty.  I hope the Minister will ensure that the random audits of professionals, the middle class and the self employed which are supposed to be carried out will be carried out.</P>
    <P>I find it very interesting that a person can be sent to prison for social welfare fraud while a person has never been sent to prison for defrauding the taxation system.  In the past two years 79 convictions were secured, yet none of these people ended up in jail.  Consideration should be given to the English and US systems under which people who defraud the taxation system have very severe penalties imposed on them.</P>
    <P>I am a carpenter by profession and I have worked on many building sites in Ireland and Africa.  I have been contacted by large numbers of building workers, painters, carpenters, tradesmen and general operatives who are caught in what I think is called the C2 taxation system.  I am not 100 per cent familiar with the system but it seems to leave building workers in an unenviable position.  These people are engaged in dirty, heavy and dangerous work and further consideration should be given to the way they are caught by the tax code.</P>
    <P>I listened on the monitor to the contributions by Deputies from the Progressive Democrats Party which does <Col N="141" /> not seem to be content with breaking the mould of Irish politics but which now seems set to break its own mould. This party of probity has criticised the provisions in the Bill which will make it incumbent on accountants, lawyers and others to report tax dodgers.  I thought that everyone would applaud this wonderful provision.  According to reports in the newspapers, Deputy McDowell believes that these provisions could seriously undermine the status of auditors as well as undermining Ireland's position as a location for industrial development.  One expects that type of language from members of the Progressive Democrats but does Deputy McDowell seriously believe that Ireland's position as an investment location can only be maintained through the pay-as-you-like tax regime which was the hall-mark of previous administrations? The proper function of solicitors, accountants and auditors is to advise their clients on the correct application of our tax laws and in that regard on one in this House should argue that they should divulge the affairs of their clients.  Section 153 seeks to ensure that advisers do not become accessories to crime.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a perception on the Fianna Fáil benches that tax evasion is not really a crime.  This perception was most evident in the granting of the 1993 amnesty.  At least Fianna Fáil has always been consistent in its position, it has always viewed tax evasion as a mere breach of manners rather than a breach of the law.  However, the Progressive Democrats stands accused of rank hypocrisy; the pay-your-way party has been transformed into the pay-if-you-wish party.  For far too long the ordinary PAYE worker, whose taxes are deducted without the benefit of specialist advice, has been held to ransom by the &ldquo;dodging classes&rdquo;, the self employed and big ranchers for whom tax evasion has become a profitable way of life. Before anyone contradicts me, I am not in any way suggesting that all self employed people and farmers indulge in tax evasion.  However, there are rotten <Col N="142" /> apples in every sector and it is up to us as legislators to weed them out.  Tax evasion is not a mere misdemeanour, it is a crime.  It should be remembered that every pound in tax evaded is an extra pound on compliant taxpayers, ordinary citizens and small businesses who pay their taxes in full and on time.</P>
    <P>My colleagues opposite take a different view on this matter.  Fianna Fáil has gone on record as championing the right to confidentiality of those who break the tax laws.  This was a central aspect of the infamous 1993 tax amnesty when secret offices were set up in Harcourt Street so that the beneficiaries could slip in and out without being seen.  Fianna Fáil seems to think that that amnesty was progressive.</P>
    <P>Yesterday Deputy McCreevy clarified his view of tax offences when he referred to the &ldquo;myriad of Mickey Mouse offences, some technical, envisaged by this section&rdquo;.  I recall three or four years ago Deputy McCreevy happily boasting that he did not have to pay taxes at race meetings, it was one of those annoying little Mickey Mouse regulations with which the State was trying to make recegoers comply.  In the Disneyworld of Fianna Fáil politics Deputy McCreevy plays Goofey to the tax evaders' Mickey Mouse.  Unlike Deputies opposite I do not believe that failing to pay one's fair share of tax amounts to a Mickey Mouse offence.  It is quite offensive.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision of the Bill expands on the recommendations in the beef tribunal report.  I am sure Deputies will not have forgotten that the beef tribunal unveiled what was probably the largest tax scam in the history of the State. <Col N="143" /> which in large part might have been averted had section 153 of this Bill been in place during the relevant period. There has been a great deal of deliberate misinformation on this matter in recent days emanating from Fianna Fáil Members.  In particular, we were told that the provisions of section 153 could apply to Members of the House.  This is the kind of irresponsible scare-mongering that goes far beyond the normal give-and-take of democratic politics. Having read the relevant section in some detail I can only presume that the Opposition has stretched my colleagues' imagination to hitherto unimaginable lenghts.</P>
    <P>My only criticism of section 153 is that it does not go far enough.  A person found guilty under the terms of section 153 (5) should be debarred from practising as a solicitor or accountant for a specified period.  Professional classes should not be deemed to be above the law or more protected by legislation than others.  While Deputy McDowell focused on section 153, Deputy McCreevy poked around in the threadbare cupboard of Fianna Fáil rhetoric and gave vent to indignation about increases in spending.  Deputy McCreevy's indication, and that of his colleagues, is little more than a smoke-screen designed to avoid taking political responsibility for their Government's mismanagement.  After all, it was Fianna Fáil's failure to implement European Union law which led directly to the State footing a bill of £260 million in equality arrears.</P>

      <P>Now the taxpayers must pay the money to which those women are entitled.  The issue was deplorably mismanaged by Fianna Fáil when in Government.  It was its negligence, to put it politely, which led to Ireland being fined in Europe in respect of irregularities in the beef industry, and the taxpayers may have to pick up another bill of £75 million to £100 million because of Fianna Fáil's mismanagement in previous Governments.</P>
      <P>The bills faced by the present Government in respect of past mismanagement come as no surprise to most observers.

By the same token, it has been apparent for the past ten years that equality payments owed to married women would eventually have to be paid.  Yet successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Social Welfare refused to pay, and instead put married women through the legal hoops.  It was the same concept of government by decree which led Fianna Fáil to lay the foundations for interpretative centres in the face of public protest.  Today the taxpayer and the environment are being asked to pick up the tab for Fianna Fáil's heedlessness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What about the Blood Transfusion Service Board scandal?  As it unfolded, our first thoughts were with the women whose lives were altered forever by <Col N="145" /> what can only be called criminal negligence. I am glad Deputy O'Hanlon is in the House because, as a former Minister for Health, he will know what I am talking about.  I congratulate the Minister for Health on his openness and on moving swiftly to establish an unbureaucratic mechanism through which women can be compensated.  In this regard, I wish the chief executive officer of St. James's Hospital well in the task of sorting out the mess.  Mr. Dunbar is a particularly astute and talented public official.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Noonan, like many of his colleagues, inherited an unholy mess and someone somewhere must take responsibility for it.  It is just less than three weeks since the Heder-man-O'Brien report was published which I read with a sense of increasing horror and bewilderment.  How did the ongoing problems in the Blood Transfusion Service Board go undetected for so long?  Why, in 1991, was no action taken on the test results from the Middlesex Hospital?  The Hederman-O'Brien report answered many questions and its author is to be congratulated for distilling the facts in so short a period.  One question, however, remains unanswered which was outside the report's remit.  Who carries the political responsibility?  Not so long ago we witnessed the spectacle of French politicians being forced to carry the political can for a similar scandal.  Power carried with it obligations.  The buck must stop somewhere and where better than at the desks of those elected to exercise power on the citizens' behalf.</P>
    <P>Successive Fianna Fáil administrations adopted a hands-off approach to the business of Government which is only now coming home to roost.  One cannot help wondering what unpaid bills will flutter on to the Government's table next week, next month or next year.  It is little wonder that Fianna Fáil has carried the disarray which surrounded the collapse of the last Government to the Opposition benches.  Fianna Fáil is in a political hole of its own digging. I appeal to it to throw away the <Col N="146" /> shovels, pause for reflection and provide this nation with good Opposition.</P>

      <P>I will concentrate on one aspect of the Finance Bill which should be altered or extended.  I am not the only one to have put forward arguments in this regard and I hope the matter is altered in a way that will satisfy everybody concerned.</P>
      <P>This week an advertisement was placed in the newspapers by 75 domestic charities who came together as the national charities of Ireland to sponsor an open letter to the Minister for Finance requesting that he amend section 8 of the Finance Bill.  There were several Cork-based charities involved, for example, aid for cancer treatment, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Rehab, Unfortunately, the number of charities was limited on the basis that some of them could not afford the cost of placing the advertisement, which is understandable.</P>
      <P>Recently I and a number of other Deputies from the Cork area attended a hastily convened meeting at the Guide Dogs Centre.  People in contact with blind or partially sighted people will be familiar with this centre and the work it does.  It is the only centre in Ireland that trains blind people in mobility skills and trains guide dogs to restore to blind and partially sighted people a degree of independence and dignity to which we are all entitled.  Despite that, this centre is in dire financial straits.  My colleagues and I are working on this problem from a different angle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8 allows people who donate to Third World charities to obtain tax relief on donations and I would be the last person to say that tax relief should not be allowed on them.  One only has to look at pictures on our television screens and read reports in our newspapers to be convinced that tax relief should be given to people who donate to Third World charities.  The current crisis is in Rwanda but one can think of many other Third World crises over the years, including Biafra.  Irish people abroad are trying desperately to give <Col N="147" /> care and sustenance to people who urgently require it and, in that context, this tax relief should remain.  It should have been introduced years ago, as it was in other countries.</P>
    <P>If we believe in the concept of charity beginning at home &mdash; and nobody believes that more than the Irish because our people travel abroad to administer care to those who need it &mdash; how can we say that the charities that administer to people in need here must be treated differently?  The Lotto has adversely affected domestic charities in a major way and we all accept that. However, we are providing tax relief on donations to Third World charities but not on donations to Irish charities.</P>
    <P>This problem can be rectified.  We cannot say that donating to Third World charities is better than donating to domestic charities.  People who believe in those charities will continue to donate money but people trying to decide which charity to donate to will be discouraged from donating to an Irish charity.  It will be the easier option to donate to a Third World charity and obtain tax relief.  That will happen and we must be conscious of it.</P>
    <P>In Cork a charity called the Chernobyl Children's Project does not spend money on the construction of buildings or on work in other countries, it sends aid abroad and it brings children to Ireland thereby enhancing their quality of life.  I am sure everybody is familiar with the work undertaken by this charity yet it will fall outside section 8. I am asking the Minister to include in section 8 charities that operate in Ireland.  It is not a measure that will cost money; there will simply be an administration cost.  I do not believe anyone in this House would disagree with the implementation of such a measure.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill deals with the technical aspects of the budget and there are areas within it with which people will either agree or disagree.  I am sure people will want to refer to the sections dealing with the tax code, social welfare or personal benefits.  It is necessary that <Col N="148" /> all areas are addressed and it would be remiss of us to allow a small section such as section 8, which has an enormous bearing on people's lives, to be passed without highlighting the need for its improvement.  The improvement required is minimal but it would mean a great deal to people affected by it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>While the two Democratic Left Deputies are still in the Chamber I will comment on some of the points made by Deputy Byrne in his contribution.  I was surprised at his veiled attack on his Labour Party colleagues in Government because, as Deputy Byrne is well aware, the equality legislation was the result of a European Union directive in 1979 and the payments should have been made before 1984.  In 1984, the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government was in power but it did not make the payments. As a result of rulings in subsequent court actions, the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, decided to pay the moneys.  The decision in those court cases was made since this year's budget and the money will be paid, but it is an attack on the Labour Party when Deputy Byrne says the money should have been paid in the past although I agree with Deputy Byrne that the money should have been paid.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  I agree with Deputy Byrne that this is a serious problem but he referred to information the board received at the end of 1991.  I had left the Department when that information became available but in the intervening period, up to the time when Deputy Noonan became Minister for Health, a member of the Labour Party was the Minister for Health.  It is unfair for Deputy Byrne to come into this House and blame the Minister for Health for inaction on information received by the Blood Transfusion Service Board which was not passed on to the Department of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to what Deputy Byrne said about Deputy McCreevy, it is grossly <Col N="149" /> unfair of him to come into this House and quote half a sentence from any Deputy.  When Deputy McCreevy referred to the &ldquo;Mickey Mouse bits&rdquo; that accountants were being asked to report, he was referring to such items as late filing of returns.  The reason given by him why accountants should not have to do that was the Revenue Commissioners already have access to that information through the sophisticated information technology system.  It was grossly unfair of Deputy Byrne to accuse Deputy McCreevy of supporting tax evasion.  Nobody on this side of the House supports tax evasion and the Deputy knows that.  If he read the Finance Acts from the time when Fianna Fáil Ministers were in power from 1987 to date he would know we are totally opposed to tax evasion.  Indeed, some Deputies have called for consolidation of the finance legislation because so much legislation was introduced over the past seven or eight years much of it dealing with tax evasion.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill will give effect to the measures announced in the budget.  The first announcement made in the budget about which we must all be concerned was that the Government intends to engage in a spending spree.  This Government was given a budget that was, for the first time in approximately 25 years, £15 million in surplus. Although the economic indicators were favourable, the Government decided to go off on a spending spree similar to the Fine Gael-Labour Government spree from 1982-87, which resulted in serious problems for the country.  I condemn the Government for that because, having been handed the finances in a healthy state, it went down the road of borrowing.  I am sure all Members believe that no one has the right to provide a level of public services for ourselves for which we are not prepared to pay, leaving the bill for our children.  We all accept that and we have to work around it.</P>
    <P>The problem as I see it is the different ideologies of Government parties.  We had a classic example in the days before <Col N="150" /> the Democratic Left Party conference when they had to get a little sweetener to take to the conference, which was the tax relief on service charges.  This was the first transparent action of the Government since it took office.  The Democratic Left Party won on that issue but lost very heavily on the question of payments to social welfare recipients as the Minister granted only a 2.5 per cent increase to social welfare recipients, the second worst in the history of the State. If the late Ernest Blythe, a former Minister for Finance, had not taken a shilling from the old age pensioners it would have gone down in history as the worst budget in the history of the State for the unemployed, old age pensioners and lone parents.</P>

      <P>A great deal of work was done between 1987-94 to correct the country's finances.  Between 1983-87 when Fianna Fáil was in Opposition it talked at length about the need for restraint in public spending and when it formed a minority Government in 1987-89 it implemented the necessary measures it had talked about in Opposition.</P>
      <P>When the members of the Government were in Opposition, the Fine Gael Party used to talk about the need for restraint and how necessary it was to control public expenditure.  However, the Democratic Left Party wanted to spend all the time, it did not matter to them where the money came from.  This shows the different ideologies between the two parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all agree with a number of measures in the Finance Bill, the changes in PRSI for example.  It is unfortunate that the Minister did not concentrate on one issue in the current year and with the same money he could have given a substantial benefit, which would have been more effective than spreading the money on different benefits, where the results are not seen to the <Col N="151" /> extent they should be.  The tax system has to be fair and equitable but I echo the concern expressed by my colleagues on this side of the House in regard to section 153 of the Finance Bill &mdash; I will always express concern about State interference in the relationship between a professional and his clients, between a doctor and patient, the priest in confession, the solicitor and accountant and their clients.  That type of relationship is sensitive and confidential.  It is built on mutual trust.  I have serious reservations about section 153 because it breaks the trust which should exist between a professional and his client, it will be counterproductive and will not achieve the objectives the Minister wants. People on PAYE now use the services of an accountant and nobody welcomes that more than the Revenue Commissioners because it ensures that they get what they are entitled to.  If people lose confidence in the profession and decide they will no longer use them the situation will become much worse from the point of view of revenue collection and add to the work-load of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate that the vast majority of professional people have very high standards and their own code of ethics.  I accept that in every walk of life people will go off the rails and not do what they are supposed to do.  I think these people should be dealt with in the first instance by their professional body and if not, the law should deal with them but we do not need something as draconian as section 153 to deal with them.  The Revenue Commissioners have very substantial powers and are very effective.  With the aid of sophisticated information technology they have been effective in keeping track of taxpayers and ensuring that they collect what is due to them.  Deputy McCreevy pointed out that as a practising accountant he had a vested interest but I do not as all my income comes from PAYE.</P>
    <P>The tax relief designated for Third World charities is welcome but there is a case to be made for Irish charities as <Col N="152" /> many people give substantial amounts to them.  This should be looked at before Committee Stage.  The question of covenants should be looked at again. While there has been some relief which is welcome as a result of contributions in this House at budget time when it was decided to abolish covenants, I do not think the Minister has gone far enough. There is a case to be made for leaving an escape hatch so that if a worthy cause comes to his attention where a person would be able to benefit from a covenant, the Minister should have the power to so decide.  It would be most unfortunate to close the provision to make covenants when we could find that people could benefit tremendously from a covenant but could no longer do so because of a decision taken in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>It was disappointing that the Minister did not refer to the cessation of violence on this island and to the implications it will have in economic terms for the Border regions.  We should refocus the national development plan.  Because of the cessation of violence the situation has changed totally in the six counties on the southern side of the Border which have a great opportunity for economic development but also facing more competition from the Six Counties. It is important that the appropriate infrastructure is put in place to ensure that we are able to compete on an even pitch.  The money we receive from Europe whether through the Delors package, Structural Funds or the IFI should be seen as additional money.  We were very disappointed that the INTERREG money was not used as additional money for road repair.</P>
    <P>The issue of cross-Border workers and double taxation was raised before. Workers residing south of the Border but working in the North pay tax at UK rates and are also taxed at the Irish rate on top of that.  The question of cross-Border workers should be raised at EU level.  I understand different rules apply in Belgium and Denmark.  Nursing <Col N="153" /> homes north of the Border are recognised by health boards here and I do not understand why they are not recognised for tax relief purposes.</P>
    <P>A conference was held in the Slieve Russell Hotel yesterday at which an official from the Department of Finance said EU funding for peace and reconciliation would be additional money.  I ask that all money received from outside the State be treated as additional money as is intended by those who give it.  There was a sense of anger at the fact that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Social Welfare both arrived at the hotel within one hour of the closure of the all day conference.  One or both of them should have attended earlier and addressed the conference or at least addressed it when they arrived.  That is a further indication of the Government's lack of commitment to the problems in the Border areas both North and South.  I wish to share my time with Deputy Andrews.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what my colleague the former Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, said in his extensive contribution.  In his speech the Minister neglected to mention the consequences of the cessation of violence.  On Committee Stage the sections mentioned by Deputy O'Hanlon, and the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party, will be dealt with. I strongly support the view expressed here and elsewhere that section 153 dealing with the confidential relationship between a solicitor and client or an auditor/accountant and client should be broached.  I anticipate a long struggle on this section to get the Government to abandon its intentions.  That is not to suggest for a moment that this party condones or seeks to condone tax evasion or tax avoidance.  We have been in Government from 1987 to almost the present time and our record speaks for itself in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am the Opposition spokesman on tourism and trade and my contribution to the Bill will relate to that brief.  The provision of a pilot renewal scheme for seaside resorts is a welcome development although the list of locations reads <Col N="154" /> like a Fine Gael and Labour constituency canvass.  Hopefully the measures will boost the tourism industry in Achill, Bundoran, Courtown, Kilkee, Lahinch, Tramore, Youghal and Westport.  There are two interesting and welcome inclusions in the list, Westport and Courtown.  Westport is in the constituency of the Minister for Tourism and Trade and while not being a seaside resort it has a magnificent sea view from some places.  It is important to place on record my appreciation of the hospitality I have received from time to time in this excellent western town.  It is a beautiful location and place.  It is just a coincidence that it is in the Minister's constituency.  I do not fault him for that. I would do anything I could for my constituency.</P>
    <P>Courtown is also a welcome inclusion. It was not in the original list of designated resorts and its inclusion no doubt follows intensive lobbying since February by the Minister for Finance's Cabinet collegue, Deputy Howlin, an excellent Minister, who represents the sunny south-east.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the proposal does not go far enough.  There are many other traditional seaside locations which would benefit from the scheme and urgently need to be renewed and updated.  The accelerated capital allowance provided in the Bill in respect of the construction of hotels, holiday camps, cottages and other tourist accommodation would be the fillip required for these resorts, many of which are located in some of the worst unemployment blackspots along the south and west coasts and in parts of the east.  There has been a mass exodus of young people from these areas.  By widening the tax designation to other resorts now rather than waiting until 1996 the Minister would increase employment almost immediately.  There would be jobs in construction and seaside ghost towns would become hives of activity.  By designating more seaside resorts the Minister would prepare the industry for a future filled with potential <Col N="155" /> which is recognised by the Minister for Tourism and Trade.</P>
    <P>Up to 50,000 new jobs could be created in the industry by the end of the decade.  In the past five years 25,000 extra jobs were created.  By combining domestic initiatives such as the special designation and the peace process with the EU's operational programme for tourism we could easily double that number of jobs by the year 2000. This level of tourism activity would bring in an extra £3 billion in foreign exchange earnings.  That would be good for the Department of Finance coffers and for the unemployment crisis.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, should also give consideration in his Finance Bill for tourism and trade initiatives that could help rebuild links between North and South.  I pay tribute to the Minister for his recognition of that potential and possibility.  Potential and possibility is one thing, reality is another.</P>
    <P>The peace initiative will establish tourism as the major force in economic growth and the spin off will be worth huge sums of money to the Exchequer in the long term.  Peace also provides increased opportunities for greater inward investment and cross-Border trade as articulated by Deputy O'Hanlon who has a special knowledge of that area having represented that constituency for a number of years.  He would recognise the problems and the solutions.</P>
    <P>I was pleased that an all-Ireland tourism programme was announced recently in the Netherlands.  Initiatives such as this must be fostered and encouraged. The Minister for Finance should consider giving assistance in his Finance Bill to groups and organisations that have a special role in assisting the development of tourism and trade between North and South.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also consider giving a financial incentive to promote St. Patrick's Day.  While St. Patrick's Day here is not exactly a non-event the <Col N="156" /> St. Patrick's Day parade in Dublin has effectively lost its bite.  The national festival is not exploited as it should be.  It happens at a time that is normally quiet for the tourism industry.  Marketing St. Patrick's Day internationally, especially if the holiday was transferred to a weekend as proposed in a discussion paper on holidays legislation, would draw a major influx of visitors and the early burst would set up the tourism industry for the year.  The Minister for Finance could assist in several ways in pushing this proposal.  He could give a special tax break to companies who make a donation to the organisation of St. Patrick's Day parades and events.  In recent years the Dublin parade has lost some of its glitz and glamour and needs a radical new structure.  Many of the traditional supporters of parades such as State companies are no longer in a financial position to assist with contributions. With some special tax or financial measures, parades could be upgraded and new events launched to make Ireland a tourist destination.  My colleague, Deputy McCreevy, complained yesterday that this Government is just tinkering at the edges of tax reform.  I agree with that and I will highlight what needs to be done for tourism.</P>
    <P>A national strategy needs to be set with the tourism industry identified as a key sector for creating employment and wealth.  Tourism must also be a ladder in rural development and a priority focus for enterprise initiatives.  Ireland is located just off the largest and wealthiest tourism market in the world, Europe, which accounts for over one-third of world tourism.  Tourism also expands trade, food, drinks and services and helps agriculture and many other areas of enterprise.  It is a vital prop for rural Ireland.  This must be recognised and addressed by the Minister for Finance. There must be reward and support for risk takers.  There must be reasons for making investment available.  There must be help for green tourism, in which we can be the world leader.</P>
    <P>Tourism is part of the dynamic services sector.  Tax reform could create <Col N="157" /> more than 250,000 jobs in the sector over the next decade, according to the National Economic and Social Forum. Services and tourism are the only sectors that offer the potential for substantial employment growth and they have been neglected.  While moves have been made on PRSI further work needs to be done on income tax.  Consideration must be given to an extension of the lower 10 per cent corporation tax to a wider range of services such as tourism which has proven employment potential. Only in this way can we charter a course for Ireland for the next decade. We need vision based on the potential of tourism and services.  Tinkering at the edges is not enough.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased, as Minister for Tourism and Trade, to have this opportunity to speak in the House on the 1995 Finance Bill which delivers on the detail of the taxation proposals announced in the budget.  As the Minister for Finance has indicated, this Bill is the first in a series which this Government intends to present to create a climate of taxation which rewards work, promotes enterprise and creates social solidarity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested in a number of the comments made by Deputy Andrews. I agree with his comments on St. Patrick's Day parades.  This should be the national showcase of a modern Ireland at an important time in our development.  I have examined this matter in the Department.  I have received a number of representations from Members and various other interest groups.  I can give a guarantee that he will not again see the kind of St. Patrick's Day parade to which people have become accustomed.  At a recent meeting of the tourism council I approved an allocation of £50,000 to employ an artistic director to look at the range of possibilities in respect of the St. Patrick's Day parade to project Ireland as a modern enterprising young country. I hope the artistic director together with the various interest groups, particularly <Col N="158" /> in the Dublin region, where some appointments will be made to a special committee, will ensure that the St. Patrick's Day parade becomes the showcase of the modern Ireland to which Deputy Andrews refers.</P>
    <P>Tourism and trade have crucial roles to play in furthering the objectives of rewarding work, promoting enterprise, creating social solidarity and in particular in stimulating employment opportunities. As a Deputy representing County Mayo in this House for the past 20 years, I am more acutely conscious than many of the haemorrhage of our young people emigrating which has beset this country and especially the west.</P>
    <P>In the coming months we will commemorate sensitively the millions of people we lost as a result of the Famine 150 years ago, those who died and those who had the strength to flee.  One hundred and fifty years on, many are still going but the circumstances are not as tragic.  Many are now well educated, get good jobs and manage to get home for Christmas or for holidays but the void in their families is still great.  The void in their town or village is still great as is the loss to the community of young strong minds and bodies.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Tourism and Trade I have a responsibility to those young emigrants and their families.  I must pursue policies and initiatives which make it possible for them to get good employment opportunities in our towns and villages.  We all know there is no simple solution to the problems of unemployment.  There is no simple quick fix.  The problem has to be tackled on a broad front with a range of policies and initiatives.</P>
    <P>I intend to frame my remarks generally in the context of tourism and trade development and how this can assist in tackling unemployment.  The importance of tourism to the Irish economy is directly linked to the potential to create badly needed and sustainable employment. It is a highly labour intensive sector with a low technological base and a predominance of small enterprises.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="159" /> Most inputs are home-produced and tourism has a high multipler in terms of national income &mdash; the direct content of tourism is in fact only about 10 per cent. Each £1 million of foreign tourism revenue therefore contributes the equivalent of 55 full-time jobs.</P>
    <P>Tourism is a particularly powerful instrument of regional policy because it helps to raise incomes and provide employment in the more remote and less developed regions.  Many of our major tourist attractions are located in less developed regions whose very remoteness is a powerful attraction.</P>
    <P>The significance of tourism to the regions will become even more important over time as the numbers directly working in agriculture decline. As well as the purely economic considerations, tourism also has the important effect of energising and raising the morale of local communities which have been adversely affected by emigration and depopulation.  Since becoming Minister for Tourism and Trade, I have been pleasantly surprised at the amount of local effort and initiative which is being put in all around the country on local tourism projects.</P>
    <P>Recognition of the vital role that tourism plays in the economy and the potential to increase that role, must be at the heart of our plans to develop the industry.  Tourism now represents 7 per cent of GNP, compared to 5.4 per cent in 1988 and accounts for 8 per cent of employment.  In some parts of the west and north west tourism accounts for more than one in ten local jobs.</P>
    <P>Between 1988 and 1993, 25,000 new jobs were created by tourism or 40 per cent of the total number of new jobs in the Irish economy.  This Government is fully committed to continued, planned development of the sector and ambitious, but realistic, targets have been set up to the year 2000.  Foreign exchange earnings are set to rise to £2.25 billion or an average annual increase of 9 per cent with jobs to increase by 5 per cent annually from 91,000 to 120,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="160" /> Last year was a good year for Irish tourism on a number of fronts: overseas visitor numbers were up by almost 11 per cent; we had particularly strong growth from both the British and North American markets; the review of Bord Fáilte's role was completed and we are well on our way to its recommendations being implemented; the Operational Programme for Tourism was agreed and published &mdash; already over £13 million has been approved in 39 projects throughout the country, involving a total investment of over £35 million and last, but by no means least, the ending of violence on the island has opened up new opportunities for tourism throughout the island, opportunities which we are setting out to exploit in close cooperation with our colleagues in Belfast. We have lived with the Northern troubles for so long that we underestimate the harmful effect they have had on the international perception of this island, either as a place to visit or as a place in which to invest.  How many of us would consider going to Bosnia or Palestine for our holidays?  For many people abroad, that is what they believed we were asking them to consider. Lifting that yoke from the back of Irish tourism opens up great possibilities for economic development and job creation, North and South.</P>
    <P>We have made a particular effort to associate ourselves both North and South in the marketing of this island as an all Ireland/all island entity.  I have met my counterpart from Northern Ireland, Baroness Denton, on a number of occasions to publicly give solidarity to that commitment.  We were happy that the Northern Ireland Tourist Board accepted our invitation to attend in America, and in New York in particular, at the St. Patrick's Day celebrations this year.  It is important to understand that it is now so easy to market Ireland as a single entity and we intend to continue to work and strengthen that part of our development.</P>
    <P>This year's budget, and the Finance Bill before us today will help to strengthen the Irish tourism industry <Col N="161" /> throughout a variety of both general and specific measures.  The pilot renewal scheme for traditional resorts is the most significant single initiative in this Bill which I believe will have a revitalising effect on a number of traditional resort towns.</P>
    <P>I expect that there are few Members of this House who have not as a child, spent an annual week, fortnight or month in one of the traditional, small holiday resorts around the country and remember them, as I do, with fondness and a degree of nostalgia.  With the increasing availability of cheap foreign holidays in the sun, however, many of these resorts have fallen on hard times.</P>
    <P>The combination of declining visitor numbers and shortened season have resulted in a lack of investment in both planned renewal and new product development, thereby accelerating the downward spiral.  This in turn has lead to a situation where many resorts are unable to respond to a renewal of interest in home-based holidays and even less to play a part in attracting overseas tourists and contributing to Government objectives.</P>
    <P>If these resorts are to increase their appeal to domestic and foreign tourists, it is essential that the visitor accommodation and other tourist facilities are extensively improved to meet the demands of the modern holiday-maker and that new tourist facilities, appropriate to the character of the individual resort, are provided to attract a new and growing tourist trade.  Accordingly, the provision under this year's Finance Bill for a new pilot tax incentive scheme specifically designed for the improvement of certain traditional resort areas is particularly welcome.</P>
    <P>The scheme is based on the very successful urban renewal scheme model which has been instrumental in promoting the renewal and revitalisation of cities and towns around the country and in encouraging development in areas where it would not otherwise have taken place.</P>
    <P>It incorporates many of the features of that scheme, notably, accelerated <Col N="162" /> capital allowances, double rent allowances and rented residential accommodation relief.</P>
    <P>Accelerated capital allowances will be available in respect of capital expenditure incurred on the construction of eligible buildings or structures and, subject to conditions, on the refurbishment of such buildings.  The allowances consist of an initial allowance, available to both lessors and owner-occupiers, of 50 per cent, annual allowances of 5 per cent and accelerated annual allowances, commonly referred to as free depreciation, available to owner-occupiers only of up to 75 per cent.  Where an initial allowance is claimed there will be no entitlement to free depreciation.</P>
    <P>A double rent allowance will be available as a deduction in computing trading income for the first ten years' rent arising under new leases of certain buildings or structures, again subject to conditions in the case of refurbished buildings and structures.</P>
    <P>Finally, rented residential accommodation relief will be available in respect of construction expenditure incurred on the provision of certain rented residential accommodation, the expenditure incurred on the conversion of certain buildings into rented residential accommodation, and the expenditure incurred on the refurbishment of buildings of multiple residential accommodation.</P>
    <P>These reliefs which will apply where the accommodation is available primarily for letting to tourists may be offset only against Irish rental income, and may not be availed of in addition to capital allowances.</P>
    <P>Clearly this scheme will provide Achill, Ballybunnion, Bundoran, Courtown, Kilkee, Lahinch, Tramore, Westport and Youghal with a most useful complement to the support available under the Operational Programme for Tourism. As this is a pilot scheme, it was not possible to include every area in the country in the initial allocation. However, I hope that the motivation that exists among the business community will be reflected in very significant investment in these areas. <Col N="163" /> Although the scheme is being promoted between the Departments of Finance and Tourism and Trade, I have no doubt but that the Minister for Finance will be amenable to looking at the question of an extension of this scheme subsequent to a review of the success of the pilot scheme.</P>
    <P>The legal definition of the precise areas to be designated is described in the Third Schedule to the Bill.  As far as possible, entire townlands and urban districts have been included in the interest of simplicity and clarity, although this did not always prove practicable. I am satisfied that the coverage is as generous as could reasonably be expected.  For the convenience of potential investors, my Department has requested the county managers in the seven relevant counties to prepare large-scale maps outlining the designated areas and to make these available for inspection in appropriate locations.</P>
    <P>The Bill already proposes that all Bord Fáilte registered and approved visitor accommodation, i.e. registered hotels, guesthouses, caravan and camping sites, holiday hostels, youth hostels, holiday camps, holiday cottages and holiday apartments, and approved bed and breakfast establishments in the designated areas, may benefit under the scheme.</P>
    <P>It is also intended that other tourism buildings or structures which I approve will be eligible for the incentives.  While these have yet to be agreed between me and the Minister for Finance, I envisage that most Bord Fáilte or Shannon Development approved tourism products and services will be included with a number of other facilities used by visitors to these areas.  My aim is to include all facilites which have a genuine tourism dimension and I hope to be in a position to publish a list of the categories of eligible buildings and structures shortly.</P>
    <P>My Department, with Bord Fáilte, Shannon Development, the regional tourism organisations, the local authorities and others, has a role to play in <Col N="164" /> promoting this new scheme, although ultimately it will depend on individual investors and entrepreneurs to capitalise on the marvellous opportunity that this scheme represents.  I am confident, however, that it will help to create a favourable climate for private sector investment in the designated resort areas, that it will contribute significantly to their regeneration and that it will enable them to play their part in meeting Government targets for overseas tourism revenue and job creation.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland possess a rich heritage, including both our natural and built heritage.  Bord Fáilte surveys confirm that almost half of all holidaymakers to Ireland visit places of cultural or historical interest.  Country house tourism is an important subsector of the heritage tourism sector and section 20 of the Bill extends certain tax reliefs to significant houses of historic or architectural importance which operate as guesthouses for at least six months in the year.</P>
    <P>At present, transfers of heritage properties like historic houses, gardens or works of art are exempt from capital acquisitions tax provided, <i>inter alia,</i> that reasonable access is afforded for public viewing.  The relief is, however, not available for shares in a company holding heritage property.  Section 147 of the Bill provides for the granting of relief to shares in existing companies to the extent that the value of the shares is attributable to heritage property.  This measure will help to preserve the heritage properties of long-established family-owned companies following their transfer to the next generation.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides in section 157 for a scheme of tax relief on donations of items of national heritage.  This is another measure which will help the preservation and enjoyment of our national heritage.</P>
    <P>The tourism industry stands to gain significantly from the general taxation provisions contained in the Bill.  With the PRSI changes announced in the budget, the income tax reliefs set out in this Bill will provide additional reward <Col N="165" /> to those at work, especially the low paid.  As a highly labour-intensive industry, the cost of employing extra staff is a major issue with many tourism employers and these changes will improve their situation significantly. The reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax from 40 per cent to 38 per cent represents a first and very welcome step on the road to securing a standard rate of corporation tax which is comparable with our overseas competitors. The extension of various capital gains tax and capital acquisitions tax reliefs in this Bill will be of assistance to tourism businesses while the improvements in the reliefs available to new entrepreneurs under the seed capital investment scheme will encourage more new business start-ups.</P>
    <P>The year 1995 promises to be the best ever for Irish tourism.  In addition to the £6.3 million which will be spent on this year's overseas tourim marketing initiative and Bord Fáilte's normal spend, I have recently allocated Bord Fáilte an additional £1 million for complementary marketing and promotional activity in 1995.</P>
    <P>The prospects in our main markets overseas are generally good.  The immediate impact of the peace dividend may well be seen in a big increase in British visitors.  We can again expect significant growth from north America and further recovery from continental Europe.  Investment in tourism infrastructural projects, marketing and training will pick up as the pipeline of EU-supported projects continues to flow and as we continue to enjoy generally favourable conditions for investment.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the contribution which trade is making to our economic regeneration. The year 1994 was one of the best on record for Irish exporters with an excellent performance, once again, by our indigenous companies.</P>
    <P>Given the economic upturn in many of our key markets, good trade figures were anticipated but the actual out-turn was well ahead of expectations.  An Bord Tráchtála focuses most of its <Col N="166" /> resources on assisting indigenous companies to build their export sales and market share and, in recent years, the pay-off has been significant.</P>
    <P>Indigenous export growth is all the more beneficial to the economy when one considers that indigenous exporters are major job creators because, in the main, they operate in sectors which are twice as job-intensive as those dominated by the multinationals and purchase more of their inputs in the Irish economy, giving a further employment spin-off.  Last year indigenous exporters increased employment, as measured by the ESRI, by 1,200.</P>
    <P>The picture in each of our main markets last year was one of recovery from recession, buoyancy and growth, but the most striking feature of the sales achieved by Irish exporters in 1994 is that they ran well ahead of the upswing in the markets.  The increase chalked up by them was well ahead of the 7 per cent growth in total world trade.  Britain, for example, increased its total imports by less than 5 per cent last year while our exports to Britain rose by 18 per cent. Germany's import growth was 5.5 per cent; our exports increased by nearly 9 per cent.</P>
    <P>This means that Irish companies are not only winning increased sales abroad, they are also winning increased market share which is the real measure of our performance.  It explains why Irish exporters have been able to increase their sales consistently in the 1990s, in both the difficult and recessionary markets of recent years and in the better times we are now experiencing.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note, from last year's figures, that our market diversification is continuing and, specifically, we are selling more in continental Europe.  This is not to understate the continuing value of the British market where we are doing very well.  For example, more Irish clothing is sold in Britain than in Ireland.  Last year, indigenous exports to Britain were worth almost £2 billion and we anticipate a further significant increase this year, notwithstanding the appreciation of the Irish pound against <Col N="167" /> sterling.  While this peformance is very good, I do not need to tell our exporters that the British market cannot be taken for granted.  It may seem like an easy market but many a first-time exporter has come to grief there and this is why we will continue to offer significant State support.</P>
    <P>The year 1995 must see a significant intensification of our drive to seize the enormous new business opportunities in continental Europe.  The time is right for an accelerated Opportunity Europe programme.  A number of factors are converging this year.  The European Union has been enlarged to 15 members, giving Irish exporters greater access to affluent markets in Austria, Sweden and Finland.  Economic conditions across the Continent are better than they have been for some years, with all economies, and Germany in particular, showing growth.  The International Monetary Fund's most recent World Economic Outlook bears this out.  Following a process of major restructuring, European industry is increasingly pursuing a policy of outsourcing, which gives Irish suppliers valuable potential new business; this year, the impact on trade growth of the recent GATT Agreement will begin to be felt and Europe is likely to be one of the big beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>For all of these reasons and, perhaps most importantly, because the groundwork has already been laid, Irish industry must focus on Opportunity Europe in 1995.  This will involve a dual strategy of providing the fullest support to the 800-plus Irish companies already selling in Europe and, at the same time, encouraging Irish exporters who are successful in the British market to expand their market reach into other markets in Europe.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a word of congratulations and appreciation to the many small and medium-sized Irish companies whose individual efforts and successes lie behind the excellent aggregate figures achieved in 1994.  Amid the welter of facts and statistics, it is all too <Col N="168" /> easy to forget the reality that Ireland's indigenous export sector is made up of thousands of companies and men and women who are the risk-takers and the achievers.</P>
    <P>People often bemoan the low visability of Irish products in the shops of Europe and, of course, they are right in that we can always do better.  However, they very often forget that Irish firms are succeeding in other sectors, which are low-profile and less glamorous but just as valuable, such as automatic components, printing and software.  This effort does not go unrecognised and unsupported by the State.  The marketing element of the Industry Operational Programme envisages a total spent of almost half a billion pounds by 1999 from national, EU Structural Fund and private sources.  The three main components of the plan are: giving information to industry on market opportunities; support in exporting those opportunities; and direct financial assistance.</P>
    <P>Recently, I gave An Bord Tráchtála the target of doubling indigenous exports by the end of that period and I would like to conclude with a brief comment on this.  It is not, perhaps, a target in the conventional sense.  Neither my Department nor An Bord Tráchtála actually exports anything and I would not presume to set sales targets for individual Irish companies.  The target of doubling export sales is based on an analysis of opportunity, potential and capability.  It indicates the scale of the result which we can attain with an allout effort.  While it as an ambitious target, if Irish exporters continue to perform as well as they are doing at present, there is every likelihood that, come this time next year, I will be revising that target upwards.  This Finance Bill is part of the Government's support for greater investment, greater competitiveness and greater employment.  From my work in this Department in recent months I am convinced that if we maintain the levels of motivation and effort being applied in the tourism and trade areas, our country in general stands to <Col N="169" /> benefit.  Our economy will strengthen and there will be greater opportunity for our young people to stay at home and earn their livelihoods here.  We can together, in the context of the new Ireland emerging from the peace initiative, create a society of which we can be justly proud.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Trade and the Government on the measures introduced for urban renewal and the designation of seaside resorts.  European funding has played a major part in the rejuvenation of the tourism industry.  That money has been spread without fear or favour and has had an enormous impact on areas throughout the country.  While I welcome the designation of certain resorts, I see no logical reason for excluding others.  The aim should be to include all resorts irrespective of their location. Although small resorts do not attract as many people as big resorts, the impact of the smaller numbers is equally great on the well-being of communities. People are now looking for quieter holidays with activities such as walking that do not require major facilities and it is a pity this welcome measure was not extended to other areas to encourage communities to spend money and expand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I received a letter from people in one area who believe that because the area is not designated they are being punished for doing their best.  I speak about Ardmore in my constituency, with which the Minister will be familiar. Incredible efforts have been made in that area down the years, with the whole community working together to beautify the area with a view to winning the national Tidy Towns Competition, which they eventually won.  That area needs encouragement to go on to the next stage of development, but now finds it is not one of the areas designated. The people there ask me what did they do wrong.  They did everything that those involved in tourism, local authorities and Departments told them <Col N="170" /> to do.  They worked together and achieved success, but they need the type of opportunity such as that presented by the scheme of capital allowances to cottages and hotels.  It is important that small accommodation facilities benefit from this scheme also.  I am sure there are cases similar to that of Ardmore.  I do not wish to be parochial about the issue but I mention Ardmore because it is an area that has achieved national and international recognition.  There is enormous frustration that this area is excluded from designation after years of striving to improve.</P>
    <P>I listened to the Minister's comments on tourism and I have no doubt the figures in terms of employment and bringing foreign currency into this country are accurate.  It is incumbent on us to encourage Irish holidaymakers to stay at home.  This country is losing enormously by the increase in the number of Irish people taking holidays abroad.  While we welcome measures to attract foreign visitors to the country, we must also provide opportunities for people on the greater island of Ireland. For many years visitors travelled to Tramore from Northern Ireland and those tourists were the mainstay of that resort. The peace process has contributed greatly to opportunities for people to visit Northern Ireland.  Many years ago as a child I visited with my family the Glens of Antrim, the Mountains of Mourne and other areas in the North and enjoyed those holidays immensely. We must ensure that investment in tourism is aimed not only at foreign tourists but at our home market also.</P>
    <P>We will put down amendments on Committee Stage to deal with this matter.  It would cost little to include other areas in this scheme.  At a time when we are probably receiving the maximum amount of Euro funding under the current round of the Community Support Framework &mdash; the next four to five years is the crucial period &mdash; the Minister should consider projects, some of them tremendously exciting, which he has received from all over the country.  If other areas are not included <Col N="171" /> soon, the opportunities for investment and to restore confidence to those areas may diminish.  Everything possible must be done to maximise those opportunities. I ask the Minister to discuss the issue with his ministerial colleague before Committee Stage because by making such a move we will gain much more than we could possibly lose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the European Regional Development Fund funding is the second leg of assistance given with this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am including it all in the broadest sense of what is happening.  I am not saying that one is all the time interdependent on the other, but people are conscious of the benefits that may be derived from such funding, that gives them a lift and encourages them to be involved in whatever schemes are appropriate.  I know I am generalising, but the point is still valid.  I encourage the Minister to consider opportunities under the urban renewal scheme.</P>
      <P>I, and I am sure all Members of the House and independent commentators, considered that this year presented the greatest opportunity a Minister for Finance had in many years to move forward and make substantial and radical changes to the manner in which we operate.  However, it is bewildering that the Minister for Finance could only best be described as: &ldquo;Do not believe what I say because it does not matter; it is what I do that really matters&rdquo;.  Those two lines are not converging.  That is not being caused by myself, my party or outside forces, but by decisions wilfully taken by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the day the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, was appointed and he was justly proud to be the first Labour Minister in the history of the State to hold that office.  He stood firmly on the plinth and outlined what he would achieve.  The pedestal on which he stood has not just been chipped away, it has been effectively removed <Col N="172" /> from under him over the last few months.  If confidence is lost in a Minister for Finance at an early stage, the chances of him recovering it in the wider markets is very difficult.  I have no doubt that confidence has now been replaced by despair which all comes down to the Minister setting spending targets of 6 per cent on the current supply side.  At the time I considered it was too high and that he was allowing himself no room to manoeuvre.  It was a figure that could only be sustained if everything worked to the best advantage for him which I doubted and, clearly, that has not been the case.  We now know, and the Minister has admitted in the House, that if the exceptional items are excluded spending will now be in the order of an increase of 10 per cent.  That is unsustainable and harks back to what happened in the mid-1980s, the last time Labour and Fine Gael parties, now joined by the Democratic Left, had an opportunity to be in Government.</P>
    <P>Matters on the financial front are disintegrating with extraordinary speed. Clearly, the Minister for Finance does not have the individual strength to hold off all the demands that will be made by Government Departments and individual Ministers regarding their spending requirements.  The Minister is trying to give the impression that he is in control of matters in the public domain, but clearly he lost control within weeks of taking office.  I was surprised because from what I had heard and seen of the Minister when I was in Opposition and in Government over the years I thought he would have had the capacity to be a strong Minister for Finance, but he is hoisted on ideologies that are split three ways within the Government.  Clearly, there is not a cohesion and he has not been able to maintain control over what is happening.</P>
    <P>The Minister not only set himself a 6 per cent spending target, he also decided to return to a current basis on borrowing.  For the first time in 25 years after the hard work particularly since 1987, undertaken by succesive Fianna <Col N="173" /> Fáil Ministers for Finance the position had been brought under control and at the end of 1994 we had a surplus in that area.  Not only did the Minister set a spending target of 6 per cent, he set a current borrowing requirement of £310 million, leaving himself no room for manoeuvre if things went wrong as they certainly have.  He has in effect exceeded his own spending limits and is the first Minister for Finance since the last Fine Gael-Labour Government to embark on such a disastrous course of action.  It is tragic after the efforts of the past six or seven years that gains, in economic growth, low inflation and low interest rates made after much political pain, pain taken on board by industry, the State sector and in the public domain should be frittered away.  It should not be accepted especially since it was unnecessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister reduced corporation tax overall from 40 per cent to 38 per cent in the budget.  No report over the past number of years recommended that course of action.  The question of corporation tax and the debate in that area has been centred on the services because it was clearly seen there was a bias in the manner in which our taxation was structured <i>vis-á-vis</i> manufacturing as against the services sector.  As a member of the National Economic and Social Forum, working on this issue with all parties in the House for the past 12 months, I am aware that the issue is that the level of corporation tax in the services sector is too high and should be seriously addressed.  I am not suggesting that because the rate was 10 per cent for the manufacturing sector the corporation tax for the services sector should be automatically reduced to that rate.</P>
    <P>I hoped that the Minister could have taken a tiered approach to corporation tax because the small industries are providing the greatest amount of employment and showing economic and employment growth.  They are not the companies making huge profits, they make small profits, but they employ a large number of people.  However, what <Col N="174" /> happened?  Those who make the multimillion pound profits will get the benefits. Two per cent of a £200 million profit is a significant amount of money but 2 per cent of a profit of £20,000 or up to £100,000 is negligible in the context of a 2 per cent tax reduction.  The Minister could have considered what has been said to him and what I have heard him preach on umpteen occasions over the past number of years, that we must direct taxation cuts towards those that can generate the jobs.  We should not direct it towards foreign industries, but to small domestic industries that have a substantial impact in small communities and recognise the tremendous social impact made on small communities by keeping domestic industries in those areas.</P>
    <P>The Minister totally forgot all he had said and ignored all that has been submitted to the National Economic and Social Forum and ESRI and OECD reports.  It is extraordinary that a Labour Minister reduced the tax from 40 per cent to 38 per cent, thus favouring the big profit earners, such as the banks and the multinationals, and did not consider nurturing small Irish industry which is providing the greatest amount of sustainable employment.  We are aware that the big corporations are shedding jobs, technology is racing ahead and they are managing by redundancy, but their profits are growing while the numbers employed by them are dropping and, therefore, they certainly will not create employment.  That begs the question: from where will such employment emanate?  The answer is within the services sector.  We know from the figures available worldwide that the real growth is not in manufacturing but rather within the services sector.  Therefore, we should be attempting to create a genuine, indigenous services sector here.</P>
    <P>In the budget the Minister did nothing in regard to corporation tax, highlighted in most reports and discussions in recent months.  I have heard the Minister's colleagues who sit with <Col N="175" /> me on the National Economic and Social Forum expound at length on this issue.  Yet, extraordinarily, the Minister proposed a 2 per cent reduction.  Shame on him, he missed the point, he did not adhere to the sentiments expressed in his numerous speeches in recent years but rather favoured his pals &mdash; which his party would not admit to being pally with &mdash; and clearly demonstrated this by his favouring the big corporations and multinationals.</P>
    <P>While the issue of PRSI rates is not the sole fault of the Minister, on my calculations, and those of others, there are 126 different PRSI categories.  For example, in Class A there are six subcategories, with six rates applicable to each subcategory, Class J has 12, Class K, 4, and so on, in addition to which there are all the special levies, exemptions and so on that must be calculated.  This means the calculation of such PRSI contributions has become a nightmare for companies, involving costs, time and energy lost in a wholly unproductive way tying up staff in accountancy practices and company offices endeavouring to revise their calculations as rates shift and change.</P>
    <P>This is presented as constituting some simplification of the taxation system, which I find extraordinary.  It is time we cried halt to this escalation of rates within the PRSI system.  No other country would sustain such a system.  It constitutes a paper chase, keeping people running around in circles, changing in each budget when everybody has to start from scratch.  The revised rates have to be calculated within companies whenever employees' circumstances change.  When employees break pay barriers the contributions change and must be rechecked.  The exercise is ludicrous from the point of view of the employee but is equally so for the employer.  Certainly, it does not encourage enterprise in any shape or form.</P>
    <P>I have spoken and written to the Minister on the issue of covenants, as have others.  Another Member instanced a specific case yesterday, <Col N="176" /> which happens to be in my constituency and concerns people I know extremely well.  They are a classic example of the real tragedy brought about by the proposed elimination of covenanting by the Government.  The initial move in this area was dictated by the great desire of the Minister for Education to emulate the late Donogh O'Malley, a former Minister for Education.  I doubt that the present Minister could ever don that mantle.  She announced to the world that henceforth third-level education here would be free, which is very far from being the case.  Indeed, she totally discriminated against a whole segment of the student population in that move.</P>
    <P>As I understood it, the original proposal on covenanting was to be divorced from education in order to fund the abolition of third-level fees.  What has happened is that covenanting has been abandoned except in regard to the maintenance of the old, the infirm and those suffering from Alzheimer's disease, which is to be welcomed.  Of course, the Minister has not been listening to what has been taking place in the real world.  The case referred to yesterday is very straightforward.  That constituent of mine had a very short first marriage and has been living with his common law wife &mdash; I had thought they were married until they informed me they were not &mdash; for the past 20 years, with four children.  He does not pay maintenance to his former wife, a decision made by the courts.  He has the allowances of a single person only, cannot qualify for married allowance, and earns £22,000 annually.  He has a mortgage on his house and must maintain his common law wife and four children.  He has covenanted £10,000 of his annual earnings to his common law wife, enabling them to purchase the home, to educate their children, the net benefit of which was an extra £75 per week to the family.</P>
    <P>The effect of the Minister's abolition of such covenants for education purposes is a tragedy for that family.  That man, to all intents and purposes is married. His four children, are all practically <Col N="177" /> teenagers and there is a need to spend a considerable amount of money on their education.  He wants to further their education, yet he cannot avail of any State grants as he is above the income ceiling.  It is outrageous that he has the allowance of a single person and I believe the Minister agrees with me.  I know he is famliar with the case but I want to know what he will do about it because the abolition of covenants for educational purposes is absolute discrimination and should never have been proposed.  This is but one effect of this rushed proposal to abolish them.  I have no doubt but that other Members could cite other examples in their constituencies. The Minister cannot implement this proposal without replacing it with some benefits.  The family to whom I referred will have to sell their home and the children's education will be put in jeopardy. I await the Minister's reply on this issue with considerable interest.</P>
    <P>The gem of this Bill is section 153 to which practically all Members have referred.  The Minister appears to have forgotten that this State in recent years introduced some of the toughest taxation legislation in Europe, resulting in increased revenue buoyancy, all of which has not stemmed from economic growth.  If any Member asks any inspector of taxes or Revenue Commissioner he or she will be convinced that compliance with our tax code has increased greatly.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants people to comply with taxation laws, or any others, he must encourage harmonious working relationships.  People must work together and trust one another, which is what occurred in recent years between the taxpayer, accountants and Revenue Commissioners &mdash; a good, solid, trusting, compliant working relationship based on very good law.  It has worked exceedingly well and the Revenue Commissioners are very satisfied.  While accountants will always grumble, the reality is that the relationship has worked well.  However, the Minister for Finance proposes to criminalise practising auditors if they do not report cases <Col N="178" /> of fraud.  It does not relate to just any fraud, it can relate to nonsensical matters. The Minister has not properly defined the type of fraud to which this provision applies.</P>
    <P>The section is totally unnecessary and the Revenue Commissioners do not see any need for it.  I reject the growing belief that nobody can be trusted any more.  This stems from the Labour Party's view that we must have laws to keep an eye on us, that people cannot be trusted to act in a proper manner.  Legislation on ethics in public office is another example of how the whole world is wrong in the eyes of the few.  I strongly reject this attitude.  I accept that the recommendations were made in the Hamilton judgment but the reality is that much of the law put in place since then has worked extremely well.  The Minister will drive a wedge between auditors, their clients and the Revenue Commissioners at a time when the system has begun to work in an effective way.  Any tax inspector will tell you of a high level of compliance in all areas. This issue will be dealt with in further detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to service charges. Democratic Left has said one thing in regard to this issue while the responsible Minister has said something completely different and has put rates back on the agenda.  Regardless of the system that is agreed there will still be an onus on the local population to pay local charges of some description.  This difference of opinion undermines the ability of local authorities to raise the funds which are of vital importance to them in drawing down moneys under the Structural Funds.  The attempt by the Government to engage in double speak on what will happen is simply undermining local Government and the opportunities which exist.  If this is allowed to continue it will be tragic.  Nevertheless there are some of us who will continue to voice our views.  In my constituency the proud record of Democratic Left is that it has never voted for an estimate for 15 years. Where would we be today if we had all sat back and adopted that approach? <Col N="179" /> There would be no funding for local government and the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, would not be talking about all the Euro funding she has to distribute.  Where does she think the money came from?  Does she think it fell off the trees?  Local authorities got the funding because people like me had the guts to stand up and be honest and ask people to pay a small charge which would be used to help their communities and areas to develop and prosper. It is about time the Government clarified its position in regard to local service charges before further difficulties are created.  I look forward to the Committee Stage debate.</P>

      <P>I support the general thrust of this Bill.  As he has said, the Minister's aim in both the budget and this Bill is to reward work, encourage enterprise and strengthen social solidarity, to look after those in the social welfare sector.  It is not an easy task to realise those aims and the Minister has gone a long way in achieving these in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the provision which has grabbed newspaper headlines and been the subject of much comment in recent weeks, that is, the provision which requires auditors and tax consultants to report certain tax offences to the Revenue Commissioners.  This provision is both fair and appropriate.  I welcome the inclusion in the Bill of this provision which was recommended in the beef tribunal report.  During the debate on that report last summer the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs gave a clear commitment that he would follow through on that recommendation.  The revelations in the report of widespread tax abuse horrified most people, particularly those in the PAYE sector, <Col N="180" /> as well as the fact that certain individuals benefited to such a large extent from it.  They were shocked that very little had been done about this problem and that people who regard themselves as professionals had assisted in this abuse.</P>
    <P>This provision is concrete evidence that the Government believes low standards can no longer obtain in high places and that they are not acceptable any more.  I am very surprised that this provision has met with such strong and vocal opposition from people both inside and outside the Chamber.  Auditors regard themselves as a professional body and they, accountants and consultants claim to have the highest regard for professional integrity.  They are entitled to do that but it is professional not to respect the laws of the land on tax compliance? I do not understand the objections to this provision.  These people owe it to the institutes which awarded them their accreditation, their clients and the vast majority of the tax paying public to take on board the provision in the legislation.  I am very glad that the Minister for Finance has clarified this procedure in law.</P>
    <P>I think it is true to say that we have a thriving culture of tax evasion.  The beef tribunal report brought this into the open in a way not previously done.  Our laws in this area will have to be changed before there can be any change in attitude. In some sectors people who manage to get away with paying little or no tax are admired.  We owe it to those in the PAYE sector and those who pay their fair share of tax to ensure that there is a high level of compliance in the taxation system.  Hopefully any change in the law will lead to a change in attitude and culture.  Turning a blind eye to abuses of the tax system is wrong and if nobody blows the whistle the abuse will continue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes in the covenant system.  These rightly give special consideration to those covenanting money to incapacitated people.  In these cases there is no upper limit on the amount covenanted, but in other cases <Col N="181" /> the tax relief is subject to a limit of 5 per cent of the covenantor's income. Eliminating tax relief on covenants from next year, except for those in favour of the incapacitated, those aged 65 years or over, to colleges and universities and certain human rights bodies, is a worthwhile move.  I am sure we are all aware of the widespread abuse of covenants. We have all heard of the so-called dinner table covenants where one person covenanted in favour of another's child for a certain amount of money and that person covenanted in favour of another and so on around in a circle and it was practically impossible to detect irregularities.  Such practices were widespread and cost the Exchequer a great deal of money.  They cannot be defended on any grounds.  I welcome the closing off of that significant loophole.</P>
    <P>I share the previous speaker's concern regarding common law couples.  As many people will be adversely affected by this measure I would like the matter teased out on Committee Stage.  It should be examined in a much broader context because, for tax purposes, common law couples should be treated in the same way as married couples.  This is the case under the social welfare code and our tax legislation should adopt a similar approach.</P>
    <P>The revision in the residential property tax provisions will be widely welcomed, particularly in Dublin.  I was one of those who criticised the changes introduced last year principally on the basis that they militated against people living in Dublin where house values are higher than elsewhere.  They also militated against those in the PAYE sector.  While I accept that much of the criticism last year was over the top, it is important to bear in mind that the question of taxation is a sore point for those living in Dublin, many of whom are on low and middle incomes and believe they are carrying an unfair share of the tax burden.  There is a perception that taxation is not applied fairly throughout the community and that Dublin people take the brunt of it.  The residential <Col N="182" /> property tax was seen as a further example where those living in Dublin and the PAYE sector would have to pay more than their fair share.</P>
    <P>We must examine the possibility of shifting the burden of taxation away from earned income and moving it towards wealth.  This was the thinking behind the changes in the residential property tax last year.  There are many different types of property and modest family homes should be the last type of property to be hit for tax purposes.  We must examine honestly the various forms of wealth, such as large land holdings, wealth, art treasures, rented property, privately owned boats, aero-planes and so on.  If we are serious about widening the tax base and bringing about greater equality we must examine the matter honestly.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provisions for rent relief covering tenants in private rented accommodation.  This measure will reduce the burden on tenants but, more importantly, it will improve landlord compliance.  The Bill also includes an important amendment to the Income Tax Act, 1967.  Until now the Revenue Commissioners did not have access to information on private landlords whose tenants received rent allowance from health boards.  Substantial amounts of public money are paid to private landlords under this scheme.  Last year in the Eastern Health Board area alone a sum of £25 million was paid to private landlords by way of rent allowance.  Health Boards will now be obliged to provide the Revenue Commissioners with a return of payments to landlords in relation to rent or rent subsidy.  This is long overdue and very welcome because of the serious loophole in the law.</P>
    <P>Section 18 amends section 17 of the Finance Act, 1970 and deals with payments made to subcontractors in the construction, forestry and meat processing industries.  This will permit the Revenue Commissioners to make regulations covering such contracts.  These measures will introduce a level of transparency into those industries so that <Col N="183" /> contractors will know exactly the conditions under which they are being employed.  I am sure all Members are aware of the widespread abuse that takes place regarding employment in those sectors.  In view of the scale of abuse, the penalty of £1,000 set by the Minister for failure to comply with the regulations should be revised upwards.</P>
    <P>Another important section in the Bill covers tax relief on fees for third level private colleges.  Population trends, combined with more demanding job markets, have brought about a large increase in the number of young people seeking places in third level institutions. A number of private colleges are now in operation and I welcome the provision to allow tax relief at the standard rate on tuition fees paid to approved colleges. I note the Minister for Education will approve the college courses and the level of fees eligible for tax relief and that the courses will have to be full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration.  The current system of administration for third level grants denies the children of many PAYE workers assistance towards maintenance costs and has caused hardship in a number of cases.  I congratulate the Minister for Education on taking the radical step of abolishing third level fees for State funded institutions, a measure that has been widely welcomed.  This further provision aimed at people whose children were unable to secure places in State colleges and have opted for private colleges will also be much appreciated.</P>
    <P>I would welcome a debate in this House, and indeed nationally, on the question of tax reform.  Listening to the previous speaker, Deputy Cullen, commenting on the need for tax reform and our complex system, one would not believe that a Minister from his party was in charge of the Finance portfolio for the past few years.  The Progressive Democrats, where Deputy Cullen spent his previous incarnation, refer a great deal to tax reform, but what they are talking about is reducing the top rate of <Col N="184" /> tax for the big earners.  All of us mean different things when we talk about tax reform.  There is need for an open and honest debate in the House on the question of tax reform and on what we want our taxation system to achieve.  The first step in reforming the system would be to ensure a good compliance rate.  This is another sore point with many people because of the perception that many are getting away with paying little or no tax. Nobody likes paying tax, but for a taxation system to have the public's general acceptance it must be seen to be fair. Unfortunately, this has not always been the case and the revelations of the beef tribunal did nothing to help the public's perception of the rules.  While I welcome the provisions of the Bill, I am somewhat concerned that the system remains incredibly complex and as long as this is the case there will always be tax shelters and loopholes.  Our aim in reforming the taxation system must be greater simplicity.  We must strive for equity in taxation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>This year's budget brought good news to most people and the Bill before us gives legislative shape to it.  The various changes in income tax rates and the exemptions for low paid workers are welcome and long overdue, but much remains to be done in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main thrust of the budget was to make it a little more logical, feasible and desirable for people to come off the dole and to take up and keep a job.  If our economy is to move into top gear we must tilt the balance in favour of people who want to work.  We must use imagination, flair and common sense to show that it pays to work.  Policies should be geared towards getting people back to work and this should manifest itself in a two pronged attack on unemployment. There must be something for employers.  It should not cost an arm and a leg to employ a person.  The decision to increase the income tax threshold, below which the lower rate of employers PRSI of 9 per cent applied, <Col N="185" /> from £9,000 to £12,000 is welcome.  It gives the employer some respite.</P>
    <P>The reduction in corporation tax from 40 per cent to 38 per cent will have some effect, particularly for bigger companies.  From the worker's point of view, particularly the lower paid worker, comparisons will always be made between what they earn and what they would receive on the dole.  There is nothing more soul destroying for a person who has a job and wants to work, than to realise at the end of the week that he is worse off than he would have been if in receipt of unemployment assistance.  For unemployed people who genuinely cannot get work &mdash; unfortunately there are thousands of people in this category &mdash; it is not a bed of roses to rear a family on our level of social welfare.  Our priority must be to get as many people as possible off the dole so that there will be more money for the fewer number of social welfare recipients who should get more in an ideal world.</P>
    <P>The services industry will become the largest provider of jobs in the future. Every effort should be made to help people come off the dole and employ themselves.  In recent times I met a number of people in my constituency who made that transition.  It was a painful experience for them because numerous obstacles were placed in their way. This budget will remove only some of those obstacles.  There should be much greater flexibility and liaison between the Department of Social Welfare, unemployment exchanges, FÁS and other interested parties.  I look forward to greater integration and streamlining in this regard, particularly when European Union funds are used to encourage initiative and enterprise.</P>
    <P>I am amazed at the number of little empires in every county where people seem to work to an agenda drawn up for a single purpose but which is not user friendly.  The people delivering specific services are doing the job they are paid to do, but until some overall group ensures there is flexibility in the system, <Col N="186" /> many people will not have jobs who could otherwise have them.</P>
    <P>The decision in section 10 to provide for special measures aimed at improving the position of those most adversely affected by the taxation of short term social welfare benefits is welcome. However, many people are genuinely bitter that their disability and unemployment benefit is being taxed.  Many people in my area are angry about what they see as a tax on sickness.  I welcome the first £10 of unemployment benefit being exempt from tax from 6 April 1995.  The tax on disability benefit is a great bone of contention in families where there is much illness and it is extremely difficult to explain to them that it is in the interests of all concerned that all income be assessed for income tax.  That is one of the main problems with the whole system.  I understand it is important to stremline it but it is difficult to explain the system to people who are extremely ill.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government and the Minister for Education on the decision to abolish third level fees. Third level education is a right for our young people and this is a signal that the State is interested in their educational welfare.  I am somewhat concerned and cannot understand why some private colleges such as the Mater Dei Institute are not included in this proposal especially as graduates from that college and others go directly back into providing education.  Will the Government consider that aspect because it is unfair to exclude such colleges?</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision in section 21 to provide for the continuation of stock relief for farmers at 25 per cent for a further two years up to 1997.  The decision to provide for stock relief at a rate of 100 per cent for four years for young farmers who first become chargeable to income tax in respect of profits or gains from farming for the years 1993-94, or indeed any subsequent year of assessment up to 1997-98, is also to be welcomed.  The many young farmers I meet particularly welcome this measure which sends a signal to them that we care about them and we want to see them setting up a business.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="187" /> On section 22, I would like the Minister to explain on Committee Stage the tax treatment for farmers in respect of profits arising where cattle herds must be disposed of because of statutory disease eradication measures.  This is an important section because heretofore, if a farmer had his herd depopulated because of brucellosis or TB before 6 April, and if he had subsequently received compensation from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the salvage value from the meat factory, he had much more money in his bank account than he normally would have.  That money had to be declared to the Revenue Commissioners and was taxable.  However, a farmer must have the tools with which to work.  A livestock farmer whose herd has been cleared of TB must begin all over again and the process is normally financially painful because one usually buys more expensive stock.  The farmer was taxed in a year during which he was not on a level playing pitch and he could not even claim back that tax the following year.  If the meaning I take from section 22 is correct I greatly welcome it but I hope that people who have gone through the trauma of herd depopulation because of animal disease will not have impediments placed in their way.  I look forward to the Minister explaining this measure in great detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In his contribution Deputy Cullen made many remarkable statements, perhaps because he has not been a member of Fianna Fáil for very long.  The Deputy need look no further than the party he has now joined to see large scale tax evasion.  I do not know where the fault lies but one can consider the Goodman débâcle, the passports for sale scandal and so on.  The public wants greater accountability.  People paying their taxes should not be unnecessarily hindered but it is important to eliminate the type of fraud we have experienced with its consequent cost to taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The allocation for county roads this year was the second highest since the <Col N="188" /> foundation of the State but less than last year's allocation which included an additional £10 million from the amnesty. County Galway gets almost £6 million of the £102 million allocated for county roads.  However, that is not enough.  We did not get enough last year, the year before or at any time in the past ten years.  Rural Deputies will have to make people understand that 85 per cent of the journeys made by people in rural areas are on roads with huge potholes and that is not a proper environment. We all accept that we need the by-passes to conduct trade but many people in rural areas may only travel on the by-passes four times a year.  As a community we must acknowledge that more money will have to be siphoned off to the county road network.  The review of this matter is nearing completion and I hope the Government will do something in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>People who pay service charges are now entitled to an allowance at a standard rate of tax up to £150 for charges paid in full and on time.  There is really no difference between this and the imaginative schemes initiated by the local authorities to get people to pay their service charges on time.  It is vital that the message goes out that people have to pay their service charges.  We would all like not to have to pay service charges but successive Governments have found that they have insufficient money to fund local services.  It is incumbent on everyone to pay for services such as water or refuse collection unless the charges are waived.  If the message has to go out that those who fail to pay their service charges will be served with a court order, so be it.  I have no great problem with that.  I agree with Deputy Cullen that we have no other way of funding local services as central Government has failed to find the extra money required to fund what we have to do locally.  It is against that background that tax relief at the standard rate of tax on service charges is welcome and I hope the people will react positively to it.</P>

      <P>I was disappointed on two fronts with the Minister's speech. First, he did not mention the peace process or how his Department could support it and, second, he did not refer to the currency exchange rate against sterling and how this is affecting our exports to the UK.  The punt is valued at £1.02 sterling and when bank commission is taken into account the punt is worth £1.04 sterling.  A textile factory in my constituency, employing 150 people, exports 45 per cent of its production to the United Kingdom.  It is a niche product. They do not have alternative markets in the European Union for it.  During the last currency crisis the company lost very heavily but it was bailed out by the market development fund.  The management of the company claim that unless interest rates are reduced firms such as this cannot survive.  This industry has continued through thick and thin over many years and employs a substantial number of workers.  The mushroom industry is also feeling the pinch.  I believe interest rates will have to be reduced if jobs are to be maintained, especially in firms which have borrowings.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted in the Border region that if the exchange rate for the punt goes over 95p sterling we face difficulties. If we are not to have a real problem in maintaining jobs in export industries the Minister will have to have a policy to deal with this.</P>
      <P>I am a member of the County Monaghan Enterprise Board.  We have targeted the food industry and tourism as areas where jobs could be created.  It was hoped that food products such as poultry could be exported to the UK but the currency rates problem puts that on hold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I would not question the sincerity and support for the peace process <Col N="190" /> of any political party it is hard to reconcile the Government's attitude to funding for development in the Border region.  Following the peace initiative public representatives, including myself, called for a review of the operational programmes, in particular the operational programme for transport, to take cognisance of the additional traffic which has built up and the increasing tourist numbers as a result of the peace process.  The allocation of funds under the operational programme 1994-99 for national primary roads was drawn up prior to the cessation of violence.  Out of a total budget of £1,000,099,000, only £14.5 million was allocated to the two main arteries, the N2 from Derry via Monaghan with 45 miles of national primary route through my county and the N3 from Enniskillen via Cavan.  The allocation in respect of those routes represents 1.3 per cent of the total and most of the work was carried out before 1995. There is an increased volume of traffic on the Dublin-Derry road resulting in lengthy delays in towns from Aughnacloy to Ashbourne.  There are delays of up to 30 minutes in Monaghan town at peak periods.  A few years ago we were promised additional funding for road alignment and by-passes.  Instead we have been allocated 0.5 per cent of £1 billion.  The Departments of Finance and the Environment must look at this if they are serious about cross-Border business and tourism.</P>
    <P>I put down a question asking the Minister if he would provide funds in 1995 to commence work on the proposed Monaghan town inter-relief road in view of the traffic hold-ups on the Dublin-Derry primary route.  The Minister replied that the matter was one for the National Roads Authority but someone must take responsibility and distribute the available funds in a more even-handed way.</P>
    <P>I also put down a question to the Minister for the Environment asking what proposals, if any, he had to review the operational programme for transport 1994-99 in view of the peace process which has generated additional <Col N="191" /> cross-Border travel.  We put it to Mr. Poulsen, Assistant Deputy Director, that these programmes should be reexamined in light of the peace process. The answer I received stated there was provision in the operational programme for a mid-term review in the first half of 1997 and that this would provide an appropriate opportunity to thoroughly assess the permanent impact of the peace process on cross-Border travel. Does the Minister mean that if the peace does not hold money will not be allocated to that region?  In his reply he stated that in the meantime there would be substantial investment under the operational programme and the Cohesion Fund for cross Border road and rail links.  He also stated that £6 million had been provided under the INTERREG programme.  However, that money was substituted for Exchequer funding of £6 million and was not in addition to it.</P>
    <P>In that region there are also national secondary roads, the Belfast road to Monaghan and Cavan and the link to Galway.  Money has been allocated for the Ring of Kerry, Cork, Killarney, Galway, Clifden, the Shannon Estuary, Athlone, Boyle, Kilkenny and Clonmel. The criterion used to select areas is improved access for economic development, industry and tourism and to reduce road accidents.  However, the Border region does not receive one penny and this position must be reviewed immediately.  We are not looking for preferential treatment but after years of neglect by various Governments we do not wish to return to the Coalition Government days of 1983-87 when the economy of the region was devastated by a greedy Government and Minister for Finance taking the easy option of collecting revenue through increased excise duties.  Not only was the region devastated, the national debt doubled from £12 to £24 billion in those four years.</P>
    <P>When the Book of Estimates was published a few months ago I realised that the grant-in-aid for the task force <Col N="192" /> on special housing aid for the elderly which is administered by the health boards was cut in half.  I raised that matter on the Adjournment.  In 1994 the health board of which I was a member received £355,000, some of which was a result of the tax amnesty.  We thought that since the finances were in a healthy state this year we would receive the same amount.  Out of that money 530 old people's houses were repaired at an average cost of £660 per house.  In some areas water and sewerage facilities were provided, in others minor repairs such as draught proofing were needed.  Some repairs cost £2,000, others £200 or £300. I thought the Minister would have restored this funding and I ask him to do so now as this scheme represented great value for money.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker mentioned the problems regarding county roads.  From 1987 onwards Fianna Fáil increased the allocation for non-national roads but during that period many county councils drastically reduced funding from their own resources.  As a result, roads in many areas are substandard and inadequate for the needs of industry and tourism.  Community groups play their part in revitalising areas but roads are a basic infrastructure and additional funding must be secured.</P>
    <P>The Washington Trade and Investment Conference will be held shortly.  I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the steps he had taken to ensure that agencies in the counties south of the Border made a well documented submission. He stated that the conference was a matter for the relevant US authorities but it was his understanding that representatives from each of the Border counties would be invited.  In the last month or so it has been very difficult to get any information on that conference. At the Forum I asked that foreign organisations with major investments in the US would use their influence to secure joint ventures for the Border region but I am disappointed that more work has not been done as time is running out.  That provides an opportunity <Col N="193" /> for co-operatives and businesses who have contacts in the US to suggest proposals and ensure that the counties south of the Border will be in a position to secure for themselves the funding we have been told will be available.  Under that programme employment, urban and renewal regeneration, cross-Border development, social inclusion, productive investment and industrial development will be assisted.  I hope a greater effort will be made over the next few years.</P>

I regret the Minister is not present but I am pleased the Minister of State has arrived.  I was amazed at the incredulity of the Minister at our putting down this motion.  Both he and I are long in the tooth politically &mdash; we came into the House together a number of years ago &mdash; and we have seen many Governments and many political parties, including our respective parties, come into Government and go into Opposition.  The records show that when parties go into Opposition they have to be vigorous and robust in their critical analysis of Government performance, even though the Government may be in office only a short time. Sometimes the zeal of both our parties was, perhaps, in excess and at the expense of constructive criticism. Indeed, all parties in the House occasionally stand condemned on that score.  I am not excluding my own party from that criticism because that is in the nature of Opposition.  We have made it clear that while we intend to be a vigorous, robust Opposition and to analyse all issues on an ongoing basis, for the short time we will be in Opposition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tried to convey the impression that there is not a crisis in the health service.  I will confine my <Col N="195" /> remarks to the Dublin area, I have a few examples to illustrate the crisis.  I am not saying it all happened over night or over the last three or four months but there is a crisis and it must be addressed.</P>
    <P>The central question in the Private Members' motion is whether there is a crisis.  The Dublin hospital scene is rapidly approaching crisis, if not already in crisis.  The symptoms that demonstrate the problem have been succinctly articulated in Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's motion, in her contribution to the House last night and by my other colleagues.  I wish to refer to my constituency of Dublin North-East where the problems are ongoing.  They did not commence yesterday, 1 January 1995 or when this Government took over but, having spoken with professionals who work at the coalface and people in the health board, the problems relating to casualty in the Mater and Beaumont hospitals have worsened.</P>
    <P>Patients are unable to obtain beds. They have to remain on trolleys for too long and there is queue jumping.  I understand a trolley is a short stay bed. Some of my constitutents have spent between 24 and 48 hours on trolleys in the Mater and Beaumont hospitals. That has been refuted by hospital managers but it is true.  I believe the people who have told me.  I have also been in debate with constituents who have used the accident and emergency departments for queue jumping.  They explained the reason they were concerned and the reason they felt under pressure to do that.  I pointed out it is not right but the problem exists and it must be addressed.</P>
    <P>There are solutions.  In the Dublin area three hospitals are to be closed.  I suggest one should be kept open either to deal full time with accident and emergency or, alternatively to deal with the step down category.  That would have much merit.  There is much discussion on that issue and I ask the Minister to consider it seriously within his Department.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the generosity of the Fianna Fáil Party in sharing time with me.  It is unfortunate for the Government that this motion has been tabled so early in its reign.  The Government is in office only four months. Many of the problems which face the health services, particularly the hospitals, have not grown up over the last four months, they have been growing for a number of years.</P>
      <P>In the late seventies and eighties the idea was that the smaller hospitals would be closed and that we would end up with a few bigger and better hospitals.  The thinking was that bigger meant better which it does not.  That policy was exercised by the Fianna Fáil led Government of the day and also by the Fine Gael led Government of the day.  Roscommon Hospital was no exception.  Fortunately towards the end of 1989 and 1990 the thinking changed somewhat in connection with that hospital.  Instead of being downgraded it has played a major part in the health services not only of Roscommon but of the surrounding counties, some in the North-Western Health Board area and one Mid-Eastern Health Board area &mdash; Longford and Leitrim.  Instead of being downgraded, money was allocated and the position was reversed.  Since then the hospital has grown and new services have been developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1991 the number of patients discharged from Roscommon Hospital was 3,350.  In 1994, three years later, that figure had grown to 4,500, an increase in excess of 30 per cent.  With the increase in patient turnover there were further increases in drugs, food, x-rays and general administration.  Unfortunately there was no extra allocation of funds for the continuation of the hospital services. In 1994 the number of patients had increased by 14 per cent but still no extra funds had been provided.  The shortfall last year amounted to £250,000. Unless that shortfall is made up the services cannot be maintained at their present very high level.  That would result in downgrading the hospital, lowering morale among the staff and <Col N="197" /> confidence among the local people in their hospital.  That would be to the detriment of the health services in that area.</P>
    <P>Most of the admissions to the hospital are emergency admissions and there is no fall back position for when an emergency arises when elective patients could be sent away because their condition was not serious.  It is, imperative that there be no further cutbacks.  Any attempt to pare expenditure further would make a bad situation worse.  A partial answer might be to provide a day care centre in some hospitals where patients who are no longer termed acute could be treated.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the shortfall of £250,000 be made good to enable the hospital to maintain the excellent services it provides.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Boylan, Frances Fitzgerald, Breda Moynihan-Cronin, Eric Byrne and Kathleen Lynch.  This obviously limits my time, but I wish to support the Minister's amendment to the proposal we are now debating.  The Minister has done an extremely good job in some very delicate situations, for example, in regard to the Blood Transfusion Services Board, the travel Bill and other issues which had been put to one side for many years.</P>
      <P>As a relative newcomer to this House it surprises me that the Opposition can in a few months try to make out that they are not responsible for any of the problems, the potholes, unemployment, housing or even the beef tribunal and its costs.  This Minister has gone about his job in the best possible way, utilising the funds provided to him.  I pay tribute to his predecessor who reduced the waiting lists in many acute hospitals.  The Minister for Finance also played a role by providing an extra £8 million in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a few months this Minister has made every effort to consult many groups.  He has begun a tour of the health boards to meet personnel and <Col N="198" /> deal with problems.  He has made tremendous strides in a very short time.</P>
    <P>In my area he has provided much needed funds for the appointment of ten joint consultants to the hospitals that most concern Deputy Boylan and me. There had been talk of appointing consultants but this Minister provided £810,000 in this year's budget to make those appointments.  He has also provided funds for CT scanning unit in Cavan Hospital.  There is a financial allocation for the development of a satellite dialysis unit in the North-Eastern Health Board which also services Cavan-Monaghan and I have no doubt that the Minister will shortly open the cardiac unit in Monaghan.</P>
    <P>In my area there is a problem with the hospital waiting lists.  I want to make the Minister fully aware that there are still people on waiting lists.  However, to try to blame him for the problem is unrealistic.</P>
    <P>The Minister allocated an extra £585,000 for the dental services in my region and £800,000 for child care in the North-Eastern Health Board region.  In my immediate area of Monaghan the Minister has given £450,000 for the mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>We want many more things and I am satisfied this Minister will do everything in his power to ensure that waiting lists are cut and much needed day care services are provided in Monaghan Town, the biggest town in my constituency. These have been promised for many years and will become a reality.</P>
    <P>I want to give my colleagues an opportunity now to make a contribution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night the Minister showed a realistic and detailed grasp of the difficulties facing the health service, particularly in Dublin.  I am glad the Opposition parties acknowledge that these problems did not begin in the last four months but have a long history.  In the last four months the Minister grasped <Col N="199" /> the nettle and started to take action to put in place a good plan to deal with the difficulties.</P>
    <P>I am concious of the difficulties facing the Dublin hospitals and I acknowledge what the Minister has done in those hospitals.  These are not the actions of a man who is not in touch with what is going on in hospitals.  In my constituency the Meath Hospital has been supported. The Adelaide Hospital got £230,000 for development this year.  The National Children's Hospital in Harcourt Street got £100,000.  The Coombe Women's Hospital got a welcome £125,000.  Millions of pounds have gone to St. Luke's and St. Anne's in my constituency and also St. Vincent's Hospital just outside my constituency where a major programme is being put in place. I see real efforts to solve the problems facing those hospitals.</P>
    <P>There has been an acute problem in the last few weeks and months, not just in Dublin but in other European capitals where there has been a huge demand on accident and emergency services. Because of the harsh winter elderly people have made more demands on hospital services.  It is important to realise that we need an integrated plan and a complex reaction to solve the problem.</P>
    <P>How we develop the appropriate use of GP services is critical.  It will not be easy because there is a culture and tradition of going to the accident and emergency services.  People, when they are upset, frightened and in crisis, want to know they can walk into an accident and emergency service that can receive them well.  However, we must examine the supports we give to GPs to provide appropriate cover, particularly outside working hours and at weekends, so that people are not put under pressure to attend inappropriately at accident and emergency services.  I look forward to hearing the results of the project work being done at the moment because that is extremely important and part of solving the pressure put on our hospitals.</P>
    <P>We must also examine the integration <Col N="200" /> between the services offered by the health board in Dublin and the voluntary hospitals.  We should ensure there is co-operation and that management structures are put in place.  I welcome the important decision announced by the Minister last night to allow nursing staff to be represented on the management committee which monitors the needs of the Dublin hospitals and considers the various management issues which arise.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made money available to reduce waiting lists.  Some of the waiting times outlined are unacceptable. In a number of areas the waiting lists are too long but there have been dramatic improvements in recent times &mdash; some have been reduced by 47 per cent and others by 57 per cent, progress by any standard.</P>
    <P>It is not helpful to the general public to engage in scaremongering about the health services as people's health is far too precious.  There is a need for a quality debate on the problems facing the acute services which will not be easy to solve.  An integrated approach is required.  It is not just a question of providing money for the services although this forms an important part and is being done.  The amounts quoted last night are impressive.  An additional £17 million is being provided for the acute hospital services in one area and an additional £70 million in capital funding. We need to address a variety of areas, including management issues, access to general practitioners, hospital structures and how hospitals are coping with the heavy demands on them.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing their time and giving me this brief opportunity to publicly endorse the amendment to the resolution tabled by the main Opposition party.  I am disappointed but not surprised that it has moved this motion.  The Minister, who has been in office for less than three months, should be given an opportunity to correct the faults in the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The waiting lists did not appear during the past three months; I have <Col N="201" /> received much correspondence from constituents about them and although they were getting longer and longer the main Opposition party did not bother trying to reduce them.  Its attitude was &ldquo;come day, go day, God send Sunday&rdquo; but that was no way to run the country or the health service.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, is only one of the fine men and women in the Government who are tackling the issues and coming to grips with the problems.</P>

      <P>The health care services are the most important we can provide because if people do not have access to such services they will have no quality of life.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the many services he has provided in the North-Eastern Health Board area, including the dialysis unit in Cavan General Hospital to which my colleague, Deputy Crawford, referred.  Prior to this unit being established patients from County Cavan had to travel to Dublin twice weekly. This was allowed to continue year after year without any attempt being made to rectify the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>That service has been provided at Cavan General Hospital at a cost of over £100,000.</P>
      <P>I also compliment the North-Eastern Health Board for the approach it has adopted towards the care of the elderly. I do not want to be too critical as the doctors, nurses and general staff are trying to provide the best service possible in the conditions under which they have to operate but St. Felim's Hospital in Cavan is outdated.  Despite this an excellent service is being provided for over 400 elderly patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The elderly like to be cared for at home or as close as possible to it but in many cases this is not possible.  With finance provided by the Minister the <Col N="202" /> North-Eastern Health Board is now setting up small nursing homes.  To an elderly person 30 miles is a long distance but they will now have an opportunity to be cared for within their own locality. This is a marvellous development and I publicly thank the Minister and the health board for providing these facilities which will come on stream before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>There have been many other developments and people can rest assured that the long waiting lists for cataract and hip replacement operations and for orthodontic treatment will be reduced. In the case of children it is essential that they receive this treatment before the problem becomes difficult to correct. The waiting lists are being cut and children and the elderly are now being operated on in a matter of months rather than years.  This is a major step forward.</P>
    <P>The main Opposition party should quit scraping the barrel and try to come up with realistic solutions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>When I was elected in 1992 the health services were in crisis.  There was no overall health strategy, hospital waiting lists were getting longer and longer, the health boards had huge debts, the dental services were inadequately funded and many building projects were still on the drawing board.  I compliment the previous Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, for taking action to deal with the matter.  In 1993 he made £20 million available to the health boards for the waiting list initiative to reduce in-patient waiting lists.  It was the first of its <Col N="203" /> kind and proved highly successful as there was a dramatic reduction in waiting lists.  I am glad that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, is providing £17 million to tackle the problem.</P>
      <P>It is important that there are preventive services and in this regard the dental and orthodontic services were badly nelgected.  The Minister is providing £9.5 million this year to allow the health boards to extend eligibility for services to children up to the age of 14 years. Many of my constituents have complained that because their children did not receive treatment at an early age they ended up in hospital.  Services for the mentally handicapped were also neglected.</P>
      <P>Under the Child Care Act an additional £10 million is being provided this year for preventive services.  With these funds new services and facilities for abused and neglected children will be provided.  There is a need for improved monitoring of children in residential care and an expansion of facilities for homeless young people.  Most importantly, there is a need to strengthen the preventive services.  The incidence of child abuse in the past three years is frightening.  If these could have been prevented the waiting lists for these services would not be as long.</P>
      <P>We now have a dialysis unit at Tralee General Hospital.  For many years patients had to travel to Cork two or three times each week to receive renal dialysis treatment.  Many of these people now have to travel only 25 or 30 miles to Tralee where that service is provided and the cost and hardship for the families concerned is drastically reduced.</P>
      <P>Another matter of concern to me relates to the rape crisis centres.  I am glad the previous Minister and the present Minister have dealt with this matter.  In 1992 the Rape Crisis Centre in Tralee was glad to receive £300, but it is now receiving £45,000 per year.  The extension of this service results in fewer people needing hospital care.  I compliment both Ministers for providing funding in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> Because the health services were neglected for many years, waiting lists are long, but this problem cannot be dealt with overnight.  Deputies on the Opposition benches have very short memories. It was only when Deputy Brendan Howlin became Minister for Health that this issue was tackled.</P>

      <P>The facts speak for themselves.  The issue of hospitals and medical care is a very serious one, an issue of life and death.  As a Democratic Left Deputy there is no point in me standing up and saying something that is not factual.  The reality is there are difficulties and crises in certain areas of the health service and it would be a foolish politican who would beat his breast and say that everything is rosy in the garden when we know that is not the case.  I will be happy if in the next two years the Government attempts to put right the mess Fianna Fáil left behind.</P>
      <P>Like my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, I shared responsibility in the past for the health services in the Eastern Health Board region.  We are aware of the problems in the delivery of the health service, particularly the difficulties in accident and emergency departments.  Fianna Fáil's attempt in the past to resolve that problem was to close half the hospitals on alternative nights, but it quickly had to reverse that policy because it was unworkable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An increasing number of elderly people who are admitted to hospitals through accident and emergency departments are inappropriately placed. These people should be placed in appropriate accommodation such as nursing homes or other facilities provided by health boards, thereby alleviating the problems of acute general hospitals. This is a problem that must be addressed because it is causing tremendous difficulties in the delivery of the health service.  For example, patients often have to undergo rigorous fasting before attending hospital for an operation, but when they arrive at the hospital they may be told the bed is occupied by a person who was admitted through the accident and emergency unit.  This is a complex area and I am not sure where the problem lies but I hope it will be addressed by the Minister. Successive Governments are to blame for the reduction in bed numbers &mdash; perhaps in amalgamating hospitals <Col N="206" /> the total number of beds was not maintained. I appeal to the Minister to address the inappropriate admission of elderly people to acute general hospitals.  He should use his good offices to facilitate the Eastern Health Board in developing a facility to which elderly patients may be transferred.</P>

      <P>The motion refers to the unacceptable hardship being caused to hospital patients and their families due to appointment and admission cancellations, long waiting lists and continuing overcrowding in hospitals and also erosion of morale among hospital staff, but I take it these appointments were made some time last year when Fianna Fáil was in office.  I take a middle line on most issues and if I were in Fianna Fáil I would be extremely concerned about the health service and about one matter in particular, that is, schizophrenia, because that appears to be what Fianna Fáil Deputies are suffering from.

      <P>I come from Cork city where we witnessed the closure of the North Infirmary under a Fianna Fáil Government.  In dealing with the health cuts we must consider Fianna Fáil's position at the time the cuts were made. In politics we are inclined to have short memories, but at that time Fianna Fáil was in Government with the Progressive Democrats.  That Government, which was driven by the Progressive Democrats, promoted cuts in the public service, but now that Fianna Fáil is on its own it is floundering and has forgotten entirely what happened at that stage. For the past seven years Fianna Fáil has been known as the party of cuts, particularly in health care &mdash; Fianna Fáil knows that, we know it and the public knows it.  It is shameful for that party to introduce this transparent motion and the public will quickly see through it.

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion on the health services tabled by Fianna Fáil.  All of us as public representatives are very conscious of the need to provide the maximum level of health care for our citizens.  Not a day passes that we do not receive letters or telephone calls from anxious constituents who are generally concerned about the delay in obtaining some particular health care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over many years the range of health care has been extended considerably at major national centres in Dublin and in <Col N="208" /> general and regional hospitals.  Nobody can minimise the large annual financial investment needed in our health services. I am aware that in my health board area the health board's non-capital allocation in 1995 is more than £95 million.  I compliment the chief executive officer of the North Eastern Health Board, the deputy chief executive officer and their colleagues for their work, particularly over the past few years, in expanding and consolidating the range of services available in Cavan and Monaghan.  Alongside those developments and additional services the board has been extremely prudent in managing its income.  That is borne out by the fact that the audited 1993 accounts show a negligible excess in an expenditure that almost totalled £100 million.  I understand the same position will pertain regarding the audited 1994 accounts.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the General Hospital in Cavan, established by Fianna Fáil in Government, is a noted medical centre and that the range of services provided there continues to expand.  We have been fortunate that excellent specialists have taken up senior positions in the hospital and I am glad that more newly appointed consultants will take up positions at an early date.  Those appointments were approved in early 1994.  The provision of a dialysis unit and the future commissioning of a CAT scan machine will add considerably to the status of the hospital and such services provided locally eliminate long, tedious and difficult journeys for many people who are ill.</P>
    <P>For the information of my colleagues Deputies Crawford and Boylan, I recall that on 8 February 1994 the then Fianna Fáil-Labour Government approved the provision of a dialysis unit in Cavan General Hospital and in May 1994 the same Government approved the provision of a CAT scan at that hospital. The letter I received from the then Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, pointed out that I had been in touch with him regarding the development of a satellite kidney dialysis unit in my area <Col N="209" /> and that he was glad to inform me that this year he will be providing funds for the development of a dialysis unit in Cavan General Hospital.</P>
    <P>Reference has been correctly made to the extreme pressure exerted on accident and emergency departments basically of the shortages of beds.  The difficulties arising from that overcrowding caused strikes at two hospitals in this city and I am certain that the nursing staff who took that industrial action did not do so lightly, they were forced into it.  I hope all the parties involved, including hospital management, consultants, the Department of Health, doctors and nurses can address those issues together and put the days of overcrowded, unsuitable and dangerous casualty departments behind us.</P>
    <P>It is well accepted that the shortage of acute hospital beds is one of the major contributory factors to the difficulties experienced in casualty departments.  It must be borne in mind that a sizeable percentage of those beds are occupied by patients who could obtain sufficient medical care in district hospitals or nursing homes.  There is an urgent need to provide step down facilities and an adequate community support service throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The fact that a sizeable proportion of acute beds are used for non-critical patients in hospitals, such as the Mater, Beaumont or St. James's, has a multiplier effect in causing delays at regional or general hospitals dependent on the referral of some patients to those major hospitals for specialist medical or surgical care.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, and his Department, to change the criteria for deciding on the number of hospital beds to be provided at a general hospital such as Cavan.  I understand that the Department used the criterion of 0.8 per thousand of the population per medical bed, but I believe there is no factoring in of the medical needs arising in an area where there is a higher than average elderly population.  In Britain and in Northern Ireland such a criterion exists <Col N="210" /> and the Minister should give urgent consideration to a better medical bed allocation to an area, such as Cavan, which has a unique density of an elderly population. The allocation of beds under the present criterion poses serious problems for Cavan General Hospital due to the density of an elderly population, attendant medical needs and lack of non-acute hospital beds, nursing homes and community support services.</P>
    <P>Allied to that, problems also arise due to delays in having patients referred to Dublin hospitals for coronary angiograms, MRI or CAT scans and other medical and surgical attention.  Many problems arise from delays in having people referred for non-life-threatening treatment whether medical or surgical. There is an urgent need to develop nursing units in west and east Cavan and I hope the Department will give favourable consideration to the health board's proposals in this regard and that it will be possible for the work to commence on those projects before the end of 1995.</P>
    <P>The respite care programme is beneficial and I hope that service, along with the convalescent care programme, will be expanded further by the Department. Such developments facilitate the discharge of patients from the acute hospital system.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the benefits of the provision of extra services and facilities at hospitals throughout the country.  A dialysis unit has been established in Cavan and a CAT scan is to be commissioned at an early date.  Both those services are available due to the generosity of the people in Cavan-Monaghan and the voluntary organisations involved in raising hundreds of thousands of pounds to buy the necessary equipment.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Irish Society of Medical Oncology prepared a major report on the delivery of services in the oncology area.  Among the many proposals in its report, it recommends the establishment of cancer units at a number of centres including Cavan.  It is proposed that such a centre should have <Col N="211" /> one medical oncologist and a linked haematology post in each centre.  I hope the Minister gives that report urgent consideration and puts in place at regional level the appropriate medical service for people suffering from cancer.</P>
    <P>I am glad co-operation exists in the health area between North and South. Ear, nose and throat outpatient services and day procedures are provided for the Cavan-Monaghan catchment area by the Western Health and Social Services Board at the South Tyrone Hospital in Omagh.  There is obvious potential for further cross-Border co-operation and I hope the hospital facilities on this island will be made available to all citizens.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate on this important motion.  It is one which all of us on this side of the House would support.  The motion condemns the Government's failure to recognise the crisis in the hospital system and to adequately address the problems facing all those involved in operating the system and the patients who have to depend on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The former Labour Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, now Minister for the Environment, recognised that there were going to be problems in the health services in this and coming years and he successfully extricated himself from the Department and has left Minister Noonan to face the problems.  That is, of course, the action of a caring Labour Party.  Since the beginning of this year, the crisis has led to industrial action by nurses, a group of caring workers, who seldom take to the streets without serious cause.  This was highlighted in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> yesterday by a member of the Labour Party who drew attention to the fact that strikes were looming at St. Stephen's Psychiatric Hospital in Sarsfield's Court and Our Lady's Hospital on the Lee Road caused by a shortage of staff, utterly unacceptable in this day and age.  I wonder what the person was doing to ensure sufficient moneys were made available <Col N="212" /> to the Southern Health Board to recruit many available, well-equipped people into the workforce.  It is unacceptable for members of a Government party to be clamouring in the media for extra funds for this and that project when they should be talking to their Ministers on the issue.</P>
    <P>A problem becoming ever more common in all our hospitals is the clogging up of our accident and emergency departments especially in Cork hospitals, through general practitioners being unable to have their patients admitted to hospital through the normal channels.  In fairness one has to acknowledge that the weather was so inclement over the past year or so that people's health was adversely affected. More beds should have been made available but the accident and emergency departments were resorted to as a source of entry to hospital.</P>
    <P>Another problem becoming ever more prevalent in those accident and emergency departments is that of violence by people entering at night. Doctors, nurses and other staff are being physically threatened, beaten and abused resulting in hospitals being forced to employ extra security staff to protect their workforce.  The Minister must allocate funding for such security personnel to protect doctors, nurses and patients.  One of the main reasons for this increase in violence is the greater abuse of drugs, especially ecstasy.</P>
    <P>The North Infirmary in Cork city was closed some years ago and the Mercy Hospital which catered mainly for people residing in the county is now being associated with the population on the north side of Cork city.  The Mercy Hospital throughput multiplied out of all proportion to its ability to cater for the number of patients presenting, the pressure on its staff being tremendous, forcing many almost to breaking point. The then Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon, recognised the problem and commenced the process of upgrading and enlargement of that hospital.  The former Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, allocated funding for a new <Col N="213" /> building and, thankfully, the present Minister confirmed that funding recently.  That will be of tremendous benefit to Cork city and county and the needs of the people.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless there are other needs in County Cork.  For example, in Fermoy local funding of approximately £500,000 is available for an old folk's home, St. Patrick's, an old hospital, for the provision of a new building to replace the former which has been condemned. Plans were submitted to the Department by the Southern Health Board some time ago, seeking additional funding of £100,000 to £200,000 to complete the work on this building.  It would be a crying shame if the Minister's Department did not match the very considerable local funding being made available. In Midleton a collection is being taken up for a day care centre in respect of which I hope the Minister will also provide between £100,000 and £200,000, as he did in his constituency in recent days. There is no other day care centre in the east Cork area to cater for its large elderly population.</P>
    <P>Democratic Left, through their spokesperson, Deputy McManus, was a very vociferous contributor to the debate held on health charges imposed in March 1993, contending that there had been a huge decline in spending on health care.  She wanted our health services to be improved, to be more equitable and, at the same time, to provide jobs for more highly trained young people.  It would appear that that same Member, now a Minister of State, and her Democratic Left colleagues, have forgotten the crisis in our hospitals, in their accident and emergency departments and in other aspects of health care.</P>
    <P>In the past two years money was made available through the yield from the tax amnesty and the improved overall national finances wrought by the Fianna Fáil Government in office since 1987, helped for a short period by the Progressive Democrats, which was untilised on the improvement of health services. This Government has foregone <Col N="214" /> moneys needed and available for the improvement of our health services, as in many other areas.  For example, it abolished the bank levy of £12 million, which would have been available, and proposed a 2 per cent cut in corporation tax to benefit large corporations and multinationals already making massive profits.  It was from such sources the Government would have received the requisite funds to improve our health services.  This Government, including Democratic Left, knows how to look after big business but has forgotten those dependent on our health services. The claim of the former Fine Gael spokesperson on health, Deputy Owen, now Minister for Justice, that the most important individual is the patient rings hollow against current Government action.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now generally recognised worldwide that health budgets in all modern economies constitute big spenders; health and possibly social welfare are the continuing, progressively big spenders in all administrations, having an insatiable need for more resources.</P>
      <P>Rather than engage in routine political condemnation of the Government, it would be more helpful and practical to ascertain how existing resources allocated to health and social services are being expended, how they could be better utilised within the health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the matter of overcrowding in hospitals, especially within their accident and emergency departments, should there not be instituted an assessment procedure so that, rather than patients having to wait three and four hours, it could be established quickly whether they might not more appropriately be treated by their general practitioner. Are there any statistics available from consultants in casualty departments on how many patients presenting themselves would be better served going to their general practitioner, in terms of their comfort, time and overall cost to the Exchequer?  It <Col N="215" /> must be remembered also that such patients tend to take up acute hospital beds whereas they might well have been properly treated at primary level by their general practitioner.  The Minister must examine the possibility in a broad strategic way of enhancing primary care. With better general practices, treatment nurses within the community, many people would receive better treatment at primary level rather than attending accident and emergency departments and occupying acute hospital beds.  We must divert more of our resources to enhancing primary care at all levels within our community, thereby reducing the insatiable rush for high-tech expensive treatment, resulting in better deployment of our available resources.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister intend carrying out a review of bed management in the various hospitals?</P>
    <P>Even though there are inefficiencies in the system if we properly managed the money ploughed into hospitals and insisted on good management practices then the overall level of service could be improved.  What is the status of the strategy for health care published by the former Minister for Health?  This glossy document contained a four-year plan for health care and a specific promise in regard to women's health, where a plan is urgently required, particularly in the area of cervical and breast cancer. We have a very high level of breast cancer compared to other European countries, and the Eccles Street pilot project was set up to examine the results of the screening process.  I understand the plan is on the Minister's desk and that a decision is awaited from him on a national screening policy.  It is worth repeating that every year 70 women die needlessly from cervical cancer.  Many of these women were never screened and we should be doing everything we can to put in place a screening programme for women.</P>
    <P>The hepatitis C disaster may turn out to be dynamite in terms of its cost to the Exchequer.  The tribunal will decide the <Col N="216" /> level of compensation to be paid to the women affected by anti-D.  There are also the men and women who were tragically affected as a result of blood transfusions.  The Hederman report did not deal specifically with this issue and all of us &mdash; it is our money &mdash; will have to face up to the fact that there is another unquantified category of women and men who have been affected as a result of blood transfusions. This disaster will also pose a headache for the Exchequer.  Many people were surprised that criminal proceedings were not initiated as a result of the revelations of that excellent, courageous and open report.  Some people feel that justice has not been done in this case and I would like to know if the Minister has referred the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions or whether it is open to someone else to refer it to him.</P>
    <P>Little attention has been paid to the area of preventative medicine.  Successive Governments have let this area of medicine slip down their list of priorities. They have adopted a sympathetic approach to preventative medicine, yet a very small portion of the health budget is directed towards early intervention to try to keep people healthy and to teach people, particularly young parents, how to lead healthy lifestyles. Given the decrease in extended family support structures, young parents are in danger of not properly feeding or looking after their children.  The Minister must give further consideration to the use of existing funds.  Much of the funding is directed towards acute hospital care and high technology techniques and there is a definite imbalance in the level of funding directed towards alternative health care.  Consideration must be given to the fact that many people have opted out of traditional medicine and now use alternative medicine.  As in the case of the green agenda, many people are way ahead of the policymakers in the health area.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the delays in hospitals and the shortage of beds.  These problems are mainly caused <Col N="217" /> by the allocation of beds to elderly people who could be much better looked after in low cost nursing home accommodation in their communities. Many elderly people do not require acute hospital care; rather they need management, therapy services, etc., which are also available in nursing homes.  Consideration must be given to the use of existing beds and the formulation of a strategy to deal with our ageing population.  Many elderly people who have had strokes do not need to be in hospital and they could be look after sympathetically and compassionately in small nursing homes in their communities. Reference has been made to an initiative in this area.</P>
    <P>I have particular interest in the Child Care Act, 1991, and it is worth noting that this splendid Act has a gestation period of 20 years.  If we implemented all of its provisions we would be going a long way towards putting in place very good standards of care for children. However, four years after its enactment only 17 of the 79 sections of that Act have been signed into law.  This is a terrible indictment of successive Governments who have failed to put children first in terms of using resources. Budgets are about choices but unfortunately, unless it is a high profile child abuse case, child care is at the bottom of the budgetary and political agenda. My party would support the implementation of the remaining sections of the Child Care Act.  Given that only 17 of the 79 sections have been implemented, we cannot say that we have even minimum standards of care for children, the most vulnerable of our citizens.  What preventative strategies does the Department have to deal with the very high suicide rate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to people who present themselves at casualty departments rather than attending their GPs. St. James's Hospital has set up an innovative pilot project under which GPs are employed in casualty departments to <Col N="218" /> screen patients.  The Department is examining the possibility of extending this project.</P>
      <P>In the course of this debate we have heard Opposition speakers raise a great many issues and without doubt many of them need to be addressed; none of us would claim that the health service is perfect.  However, it is also fair to say that many of these issues date from a time when those now on the other side of the House were in Government and had an opportunity to deal with the issues they now complain about.  It is, therefore, a matter of regret that Opposition speakers could not have taken some of the time which has been spent outlining in great detail the shortcomings of the health service to give us their views on how they would go about solving these problems.</P>
      <P>The Opposition contributions have been long on criticisms of our health service, but lamentably short on constructive debate about how we can go about making improvements.  We are well aware that there are infinite demands for the limited available resources.  It is, however, misleading in the extreme to suggest, as some Opposition speakers have done, that nothing is being done to remedy the deficiencies. An additional £17 million revenue and £70 million capital funding is being provided for the hospital service this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of providing appropriate care for patients who no longer require an acute hospital bed has been raised by a number of Opposition speakers.  This is an important element of the health service, particularly as our population begins to age and we find ourselves more and more in need of such facilities for elderly patients who are not ready for discharge into the community.  I am glad of this opportunity to highlight the importance of such services.  As Deputy Callely mentioned last night, the need for such facilities, particularly in the Dublin area, has been acknowledged for some time.  However, I have to take issue with the Deputy's contention that nothing has been done in this area.  Over <Col N="219" /> the past few years, the development of appropriate services for the elderly has been one of the Eastern Health Board's top priorities and significant progress has been made in this area.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the allegations, which were so callously thrown out to this House, concerning the lack of facilities for the elderly and the allegations that things had become stagnant. The Opposition tried to suggest that very little had happened in the Eastern Health Board in the last few years, but when we come back to reality we see that the situation is quite the opposite.  For example, I have been informed by the Eastern Health Board that in the past five years a number of developments in services for the elderly have taken place.  An additional 667 places for intermittent-respite, rehabilitation and extended care have been put in place.  In 1994 in excess of 500 elderly people who were medically assessed as requiring long term care, and who had completed the acute phase of treatment, were discharged from acute general hospitals to step down facilities.  There additional consultant physicians in medicine for the elderly have been appointed in Dublin north, Dublin south and Kildare-West Wicklow.  A fourth post is currently being processed in respect of Dublin South East-East Wicklow.</P>
    <P>New departments of medicine for the elderly have been developed at the Mater and the Meath hospitals.  These developments interlink between accident and emergency services and services for the elderly in those hospitals and are in line with the requirements set down in the health strategy document. Shaping a Healthier Future, in that each acute general hospital in the Eastern Health Board area will have a designated department of medicine for the elderly.  Day hospitals, which are an integral part of departments of medicine for the elderly, have been developed at St. Columcille's, Beaumont and the Mater hospitals.  Further such facilities are currently being planned for Naas <Col N="220" /> General, St. Vincent's and St. Michael's hospitals.</P>
    <P>District care units have been developed in each community care area to provide outreach care services for the elderly in their homes.  In excess of 200 additional staff of various disciplines including staff nurses, care assistants and paramedical personnel have been employed in this area.  This cannot be bad for staff morale.</P>
    <P>Also, in 1994, in excess of 5,000 elderly patients were admitted into the district care units from the acute hospitals and general practitioners.  This facilitated earlier discharge of patients from the acute hospital service and negated the need for referral of patients by general practitioners to hospitals in the first instance, with the obvious significant impact on the appropriate use of acute hospital beds.  It will be seen, therefore, that a system of relieving the acute accident and emergency hospitals was in place before the Opposition raised it during this debate.</P>
    <P>A register of elderly at risk has been established throughout the Eastern Health Board's community care areas and multidisciplinary care teams have been developed in each community care area to ensure that the needs of the elderly are identified and addressed.</P>
    <P>I ask the Dáil to reject this negative and unconstructive motion proposed by the Opposition and commend the Government amendment to the House.</P>

      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister's contribution tonight but, unfortunately, I heard only references to the Eastern Health Board area, the Dublin area and its surrounds. There are many problems in the health area outside of Dublin.  While I wish those in the Eastern Health Board well, I must underline the many difficulties <Col N="221" /> that face the Mid-Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>As one of their public representatives, a number of people from that area contacted me concerning their elderly relatives who have difficulty getting a bed in St. Joseph's Geriatric Hospital in Ennis.  There appears to be a shortage of beds in that hospital and when patients are not accommodated there, their families are forced to pay for them in private nursing homes, often with very little subvention to back up costs. Subvention should be increased to ease the hardship on sons and daughters who are forced to pay for the care of their elderly relatives while providing for their young families and paying mortgages and other financial responsibilities.</P>
      <P>The elderly in my area do not wish to burden their families and their feeling of helplessness is merely exacerbated by the fact that they believe, having worked hard all their lives, that they should have access to St. Joseph's Geriatric Hospital and not have to pay for private accommodation.  There is now a waiting list for St. Joseph's, something which was not heard of up to now.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments on statements made recently by a Member of the House about the ill treatment of elderly patients.  That caused much anxiety among the elderly population.  I want to know the Government's position on those unfortunate remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night Ennis General Hospital was full to capacity, one patient had to be accommodated in casualty, there was no bed for him.  There is also an immediate need to provide funding for a specialised unit to care for Alzheimer patients in Carrigoran Nursing Home in County Clare.  The staff in Carrigoran are waiting to hear from the Department in this respect and I take this opportunity to impress on the Minister the need for him to allocate funds immediately for the provision of such a service.  I am sure the Minister would admit that those suffering from mental <Col N="222" /> handicap need more sheltered workshop facilities in County Clare.  We are grateful for the improved facilities in Kilrush, but many more places in sheltered workshops need to be provided, not least in the Dulick centre in Ennis.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the continuing good work of the Brothers of Charity at Gort Road, Ennis but their efforts need ongoing financing.  I look on their position sometimes with despair when the moneys I would like to see allocated to the institution are not provided to assist it in its very necessary work.</P>
    <P>The dispensary in Kilmaley, County Clare, does not have toilet facilities or a heating system.  Together with other representatives I have made renewed representations to the Minister in the hope that this issue can be addressed immediately.  It is ridiculous in 1995 to ask patients to attend that dispensary and endure what could be described as Third World conditions.  I hope this debate encourages the Minister to make further progress on this matter and the other matters I referred to in my contribution. I wish to share the remainder of my time with my colleague, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera raised an important point when she asked the Minister to clarify whether he, or the Minister of State in this case, supported the comments by a Member of this House in regard to the treatment of geriatric patients in the Mid-Western Health Board.  It is important to clarify that the Member who made the remarks is a member of the party of the Minister of State and employed by the Mid-Western Health Board as a consultant psychiatrist.  Perhaps when the clarification is being made all those issues will be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be an important meeting in Dublin tomorrow.  A summit has been called to examine the crisis in the capital's accident and emergency departments. At that meeting there will be hospital managers, representatives of <Col N="223" /> trade unions and consultants and the Eastern Health Board will also be represented. However, even though the serious crisis at the city's hospital accident and emergency units will be under discussion, representatives of the Department of Health will not be present.  The other parties have been told that the Department will not be represented as it does not see any role for itself.  It appears that the Minister for Health believes that the crisis is not his Department's responsibility and is a simple inter-hospital problem.</P>
    <P>With the summit, the Minister, and indeed the hospitals, have been given an important opportunity &mdash; a last shot that should not be missed.  If it is missed, I believe we face a summer of unrest. Nurses have said that enough is enough. They are not taking action for pay; they just will not tolerate the constant overcrowding and overwork.  They want to provide a quality service to patients and want to do their work without being constantly abused about overcrowding.</P>
    <P>There could be industrial unrest quickly if tomorrow's summit does not find a resolution to the crisis in hospitals.  Already there have been days of action in Beaumont and the Mater Hospitals.  This will spread to the Meath and St. James's Hospitals and other Dublin hospitals unless results are achieved.  There could also be further action at Beaumont and the Mater Hospitals.</P>
    <P>There are also serious problems in the health services in other areas, which was referred to by Deputy de Valera.  Strike notice has been served at St. Stephen's Psychiatric Hospital in Cork.  There is a dispute over the redeployment of staff at Our Lady's Hospital also in Cork.  In County Wexford, protests are planned for St. John's Hospital in Enniscorthy and in St. Fintan's Hospital in Portlaoise strike action has been threatened over assaults.  There are many other disputes brewing but the Government is failing to recognise the crisis in the health services. I blame the Minister for not insisting that representatives of the <Col N="224" /> Department of Health are present at tomorrow's meeting.</P>
    <P>Regardless of what Minister Noonan might think, the Department of Health has a role in the crisis and the Department also believes it has a role.  If the Minister will not accept that his Department has a role at the micro level involving hospital managements, the Department certainly has a crucial role at the macro level.  There is a need for the formulation of a cohesive plan to deal with overcrowding in emergency departments in major Dublin hospitals. There is a need also for the co-ordination of the city's two ambulance services. The lessons learned at tomorrow's summit could then be implemented in macro form in other parts of the country if the Department of Health representatives were allowed to participate by their Minister.</P>
    <P>As I emphasised last night, there is also another reason for the Department of Health to participate in the summit. At present, while the Department of Finance, in continuation of the policy implemented by the last Government, has provided money to deal with people on hospital waiting lists, separate new waiting lists are now developing because local hospital managements around the country are cancelling elective admissions and operations because of overcrowding and bed shortages.  These patients go on a new queue or return to the same hospitals as emergencies.  The Minister, with his Department, must address this issue.</P>
    <P>Last night, and again tonight, Members of the House, including the Minister, expressed surprise that Fianna Fáil raised the crisis in hospitals in the Dáil because we had been in Government up to recently.  When we were in Government we supported the Labour Minister for Health in tackling the problems in the health services head on and in recognising the crisis and difficulties associated with it.  The Government took action.  We did not shirk responsibility and hope that the problem might go away.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="225" /> I am glad that Minister Noonan, in his address to the House yesterday evening, recognised and acknowledged that the last Government led by Fianna Fáil provided £30 million to tackle waiting lists in 1993 and 1994.  As we know, that action programme led to the most dramatic reductions in waiting times for treatment and reduced waiting lists.  In 1994, the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government action led to an additional 16,669 procedures being performed.  These were in addition to the normal levels of activity.  By December 1994 the waiting list for specialties had been cut to 23,835 from over 40,000 in 1993.  This was a cut of 41 per cent and it was achieved by Government action.  Real progress was made on children's waiting lists because of a commitment and a recognition of problems by the last Government.  With the Minister, I also compliment and congratulate medical and nursing staff for their tremendous efforts during the period of action.</P>
    <P>All this is in complete contrast to the response by the Government.  Minister Noonan is trying to hide behind his short service at the Department.  That is his excuse for lack of action.  He also tried to say that some of the problems arose because of the lack of co-ordination of services in Dublin and the lack of accountability of health boards.  He was very critical last night.  He told me that it was most unfair of me to criticise his Department and he seemed to be particularly sensitive about that &mdash; I am not sure that his Department officials were as sensitive to the criticism.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the management of hospitals &mdash; with a few exceptions &mdash; in the Eastern Health Board area is outside the remit of the Eastern Health Board and that because the hospital management had been devolved, responsibility went with that devolution.  If the Minister is unhappy, as he seems to be, why is the Bill dealing with organisational structures of health boards not even on the list the Government published this week of Bills expected to be published this session?  If <Col N="226" /> the Minister feels there is a problem and a difficulty with accountability, why did that legislation, which is intended to reorganise the health services, including the replacement of the Eastern Health Board, not appear on the list published by the Government?  There does not seem to be any urgency in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister also insisted on defending the Department of Health in this crisis.  The Department stands accused of contributing to the crisis because it failed to look at the recurring problem of high admissions at the beginning of each year.  The only strategy appears to be to ignore the crisis and to hope that things will return to normal.  That is not good enough.  It is also unacceptable, as I said last night, that patients have been blamed for somehow causing the problem by getting themselves improperly admitted through accident and emergency departments.</P>
    <P>If the Department had any sense of responsibility it would have taken two kinds of action within the past three months.  First, it would have allocated emergency funding to the hospitals under pressure to allow for the opening of more beds and, second, it would have moved quickly to examine the problem and develop new systems to cope with it.  There is a need to increase the level of funding to address the problems and this could be done by the Government giving priority to health care instead of giving breaks to the banks in its budget each year.</P>
    <P>It is a serious mistake for the Department of Health not to be represented at tomorrow's health summit meeting as it has an important role to play in this crisis.  I appeal to the Minister for Health.  Deputy Noonan on the eve of this very important summit to allow his Department's representatives be present at tomorrow's meeting.  All other parties will attend the meeting in good faith and the trade unions involved have suspended industrial action pending the outcome.  It is imperative that <Col N="227" /> the Department of Health is represented in the interests of actively supporting a resolution to the problems of the &ldquo;first quarter curve&rdquo;, as I referred to it last night.  The resolution blueprint <Col N="228" /> could then be implemented in each of the other health board areas that have similar problems.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Dublin Drug Problem.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shorthall Ms Shorthall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shorthall</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise the important matter of the need for a high level co-ordinated response to the drug problem in Dublin. I am glad to see the Minister for Health in the House to respond to this motion but I am surprised it is that Minister rather than the Minister for Justice who has primary responsibility for this area.</P>
      <P>In calling for a drugs task force for the Dublin area I am not denying the existence of the problem in other areas, particularly in cities.  However, as a Dublin representative my principal concern is about the major drugs problem in the capital city.  There is overwhelming need for a task force which would operate on a Dublin wide basis.  I understand there is an existing national coordinating committee which, in theory, should deal with the problem on a countrywide basis but, in practice, this body does not function and I understand it is some time since it met.  A more local response is required.</P>
      <P>A new task force should be made up of the highest level representatives from all the relevant agencies.  The drug problem could be said to be out of control and the official response is unco-ordinated and ineffective.  Flat complexes and housing estates are being taken over by a drugs culture.  Many communities which made great progress in community development in recent years  see their efforts undermined by the scourge of drug abuse.  As we know, drug abuse is most likely to flourish in areas of social deprivation and high unemployment.  Increasingly we consign young people in these areas to a life of addiction, crime, ill-health and sometimes death because of our failure to tackle the problem.</P>
      <P>The law abiding public feel increasingly threatened by the high level of urban crime, the vast bulk of which is drug related.  We are failing them also. When we consider there are at least 5,000 drug addicts in the Dublin area each of whom needs to raise between £40 and £100 a day to feed their habit that represents an enormous number of muggings, house break-ins and other crime, all leading to heartbreak.</P>
      <P>The drugs problem can only be efficiently dealt with in a co-ordinated way with all the agencies involved.  The Garda has a major role in reducing the supply of drugs.  This must be the key approach in stemming the problem. Vast quantities of opium such as heroin and morphine as well as ecstasy and cannabis are now available in the city and pushers are dealing openly in many areas.  If time permitted I would give details of how that is evident in my constituency and in many Dublin areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the Department of Justice must tackle head on the problem of drugs in our prisons, both in terms of supply and treatment.  The Eastern Health Board is providing a number of treatment programmes for drug abusers but these are totally inadequate.  There are long waiting lists for the treatment clinics and the number of detoxification <Col N="231" /> beds can only meet a small fraction of the demand.</P>
    <P>On prevention, there is a need for an input from the Department of Education. A number of education programmes of varying quality are in operation. Unfortunately, there is little evidence of their efficacy.  Some may even exacerbate the problem.  There is a glaring need for co-ordination and, ideally, the establishment of a life skills programme for all schools which would concentrate on children's self-development and encourage a sense of self-worth which would offer the best safeguards against being drawn into the drugs scene.</P>
    <P>Other agencies who would be involved are the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare who should have access to information which would enable them to clamp down on the big dealers. In addition, Dublin Corporation should be involved as its policy on dealing with anti-social behaviour and intimidation can play a vital role in tackling the crime of drugs dealing.</P>
    <P>Given that the drug problem in Dublin is now at crisis point there is an urgent need for a major political initiative to establish and drive the fight against the drugs problem.  Without doubt the drugs problem now poses the most serious threat to the city of Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I thank Deputy Shortall for raising this important matter on the Adjournment of the Dáil and for giving me the opportunity to outline Government policy for dealing with the scourge of drug misuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy in the area of drug misuse is based on the Government Strategy to Prevent Drug Misuse which was published in 1991 and was based on the recommendations of the national coordinating committee on drug abuse. <Col N="232" /> The strategy recognised that the problem is complex and difficult one to which there is no easy or instant solution. It proposed, a multi-disciplinary approach requiring action in the areas of supply reduction, demand reduction and increased access to treatment and rehabilitation programmes, together with co-ordination mechanisms geared towards their effective implementation. The strategy, while recognising the validity of a multiplicity of treatment and prevention programmes, advocated a drug free lifestyle as the ideal.  It is also recognised that various drug treatment options are required to deal with the needs of individual drug misusers.  Such options would include methadone maintenance, needle exchange, detoxification and rehabilitation provided by statutory agencies working in close collaboraton with the voluntary sector.</P>
    <P>Because of the high incidence of intravenous drug use among those who are HIV positive, the strategies for dealing with drug misuse and HIV/AIDS are closely interlinked. Methadone maintenance programmes have been introduced as a means of stablising the behaviour of drug misusers and preventing the spread of HIV through the use of contaminated needles.</P>
    <P>Since 1992 special funding has been allocated each year to allow for the development of extensive prevention and treatment services by the Eastern Health Board, which together with the Drug Treatment Centre in Pearse Street and voluntary organisations, provides such services in the Dublin area where the majority of drug misusers reside.</P>
    <P>To date three satellite clinics have been established by the Eastern Health Board at Baggot Street, Ballyfermot, and Amiens Street.  The clinics provide a range of primary services for drug misusers, including methadone maintenance, needle exchange, urinalysis, HIV testing and counselling and free condoms.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="233" /> A total of 420 drug misusers are on methadone maintenance programmes at the satellite clinics and a further 190 patients receive methadone at the Drug Treatment Centre, Pearse Street.  The satellite clinics have become victims of their own success to some extent, since although they treat over 400 patients, they have substantial waiting lists.  I regard it as an urgent priority to provide services for those on the waiting list.</P>
    <P>In line with the policy of treating drug misusers in their own community to the greatest extent possible, general practitioners are being encouraged to take on responsibility for the treatment, including the provision of methadone, of drug misusers.  At present, about 240 patients are on methadone maintenance with general practitioners.  Some general practitioners are reluctant to become involved in this area and this is perhaps understandable.  The Protocol for the Prescribing of Methadone, which was circulated last year provides a framework of support for general practitioners willing to become involved. Any practitioner who was so willing would be asked to take on a stabilised patient from a satellite clinic and continue with the treatment.  The services of the satellite clinic would continue to be available, where required, together with the right to refer the patient back should any problems develop.  The discharge of patients in this way from the satellite clinics would free-up spaces for patients on the waiting list who are currently not in receipt of any service.</P>
    <P>In line with the policy of continuing with the development of services I have allocated additional funding to the Eastern Health Board for the establishment of two additional satellite clinics during 1995.  Other plans on progress to further develop Eastern Health Board services during 1995 are as follows: the opening of a ten bed detoxification unit at Cherry Orchard Hospital; the expansion of the rehabilitation service for drug misusers; the establishment by the Eastern Health Board of a committee which will co-ordinate services at a local level in the Dublin area.  This committee will <Col N="234" /> be representative of the Eastern Health Board, the Garda, the prison service, the education sector and voluntary organisations.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the combination of measures I have outlined will go a long way towards tackling the problem of drug misuse in Dublin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>When this matter was announced as one of the items for discussion on the Adjournment I noticed a ripple of laughter.  It is not a laughing matter.  It may not be a bread and butter issue, it may not be as tragic as the drugs problem but it has a relevance to our way of life and it is something to which we do not pay sufficient attention.</P>
      <P>Spring is the time when wildlife, animals and birds, breed.  Little attention is paid to protection of the breeding habits of these animals and birds.  There is little explanation and public awareness of how these creatures can be protected.</P>
      <P>Since the Office of Public Works had its responsibilities shared out among different Departments it is difficult to know which Minister is responsible for this item of wildlife.  I hope it is the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht who is present, but I am not sure.</P>
      <P>I am alluding to the need to draw attention to the fact that every day of the week hedgerows containing birds' nests, where eggs have been laid and, in some cases, young birds have been hatched out, are being cut down.  No regard appears to be had for their welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A tragic photograph appeared in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> three weeks ago showing a rookery in Cork which had been cut down by Iarnróid Éireann.  It is difficult to imagine a State body cutting down trees upon which there was a substantial rookery.  The small birds which had just hatched out were shown lying in their nests.  That type of activity <Col N="235" /> should not be condoned, it should not be accepted.  When driving to Dublin on Thursday last I noticed a few miles outside Callan notices on the road which read: &ldquo;Slow, hedge cutting in progress&rdquo;. I presumed at the time that the notice had been put up by Kilkenny County Council.  The hedges had just been cut along quite a stretch of road.  On Saturday last, 22 April, I noticed a mountainside on fire.  The idea at this time of year is to burn the undergrowth to make way for new growth and provide fresh grazing for sheep.  However, no cognisance is taken of the fact that game birds or song birds may be nesting in such environments.  It is not unusual to see whole mountainsides alight at this time of the year, and God knows what damage is done and what suffering endured by the creatures living on the mountainsides.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the nesting season varies with the weather, but there are no public pronouncements to tell us when to watch out for it.  Breeding habits are complicated.  Pigeons and crows will begin nesting in the month of February whereas song birds may not nest until April and game birds until May.  If the spring is particularly good, as it has been this year, bird nesting will take place much earlier than normal &mdash; it could be a month in advance of last year when we had a particularly bad spring.  However, there have been no notices in the paper and no warnings to people not to burn undergrowth or cut hedges.  Whose responsibility is it to issue such notices and why has it not been done?  Has any action been taken against people who have broken the law?  I presume there are laws &mdash; that is what I would like to elicit &mdash; to safeguard creatures that are breeding.  If there are not, there should be.  I would like to know if there has ever been a prosecution and if there is a prosecution pending in the case which was so graphically described in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> three weeks ago.</P>
    <P>It appears that we are not fulfilling our duty to protect wildlife, particularly <Col N="236" /> the breeding grounds of wildlife.  I would like specific answers from the Minister as to why we are neglecting such a valuable asset.  Our wildlife is a tremendous tourism asset, a natural asset, something we should cherish, not destroy.  There is a callous disregard for wildlife in this country at times.  Creatures are particularly vulnerable at this time and should be protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins) Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me first thank Deputy Deasy for raising this important matter and assure him that, even in the nature of things where we are discussing matters with few Members present, I do attach importance to it.  I appreciate the Deputy's raising it.  As a result of two orders, one made in December and one in March, matters relating to heritage are now my responsibility and I intend to act accordingly.</P>
      <P>In the absence of native woodlands, hedgerows form important features in maintaining wildlife diversity in particular for birds.  The commonest nesting birds found in hedgerows such as wrens, bunnocks, robins and willow warblers depend almost entirely on insects during the summer months.  In general untrimmed, thorned hedgerows containing species such as blackthorn, whitethorn and holly are favoured by birds as they serve as a protection against predators.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of Ireland's important wildlife species are associated with traditional, low intensity, mixed-farming.  This, combined with the retention of semi-natural habitat provides a wide range of niches and food resources.  Modern farming threatens these micro-habitats.  I am hopeful that my programme for the designation of natural heritage areas (NHAs) together with the rural environment scheme (REPS) being administered by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, will go a long way towards protecting these types of habitats.  Measures are provided in both of these programmes to maintain existing features that make up <Col N="237" /> farmland habitat &ldquo;mosaics&rdquo;, such as hedgerows, fields edges, areas of scrub and unmanaged vegetation, drainage ditches etc, which are so valuable to farmland birds and animals.</P>
    <P>Under measure 4 of the REPS programme farmers must not remove habitat such as field boundaries, margins, woodlands, wetlands, natural and semi-natural vegetation or damage any of these features on their farms.  Under measure 5 farmers will have to carry out specified maintenance or repair work on hedgerows in the interest of wildlife.</P>
    <P>We need public education and encouragement to shoulder responsibility in these matters.  As to the legal position, measures preventing the burning and destruction of vegetation are covered under sections 39 and 40 of the Wildlife Act, 1976 which I will amend shortly.  Provisions are made within these sections for certain exceptions necessary for agriculture, forestry and other developments.  If people report to my Department breaches of sections 39 and 40, I will take action to implement the Act.</P>
    <P>As to the proposed legal provisions, I have arranged for regulations to be drafted to transpose Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild flora and fauna into Irish law.  This is commonly known as the Habitats Directive.</P>
    <P>Under Article 10 of the Habitats Directive members states will be obliged in their and use development policies to encourage the management of features of the landscape which are of major importance for wildlife.  An example of this would be hedgerows which act as ecological corridors for the movement of wildlife.</P>
    <P>It is widely accepted that the most effective way to conserve wildlife is through habitat protection and management. There are limited resources available and it is necessary to be highly selective when determining priorities and managing resources for wildlife conservation.  The main actions being undertaken by me and my colleagues are as follows: research and monitoring <Col N="238" /> of priority habitats and species; proposed designation of natural heritage areas; designation of special protection areas for wild birds under the Birds directive; specific protection measures e.g. the corncrake grant scheme; conservation legislation such as regulations to bring the Habitats Directive into effect and amendments to the Wildlife Act 1976 are being drafted.</P>
    <P>I have no notice of the case in Cork to which the Deputy referred.  I will have it investigated.  I listened with great care to what the Deputy said about putting notices in the papers to advise people of changes is nesting habits brought about by the weather.  I will have that examined and see what action is necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is promoting the rural environment protection scheme.  The European Nature Conservation Year 1995 programme that I am bringing to a wide and diverse audience will contribute to an increased awareness of these issues.  I should also mention the ongoing educational activities being undertaken by the staff of the National Parks and Wildlife Service in promoting nature conservation.  I use this opportunity to appeal to the public for their assistance and co-operation in improving the regime and in addressing this issue to which the Deputy has drawn the attention of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the person against whom I wish to vent my anger, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, is not here.  In saying that I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State who is here.  It is with the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, who has overall responsibility for the travelling community, that I am extremely angry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear from a reply given to a question tabled by me yesterday to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform that he has abjectly failed to inject any <Col N="239" /> urgency into the need for a national programme of halting sites and the general accommodation of the travelling community. The Minister seems to be totally unaware that the failure to deal on a national basis with the politically sensitive and controversial issue of travellers and their rights possibly represents a fatal blow to the continued and sustained goodwill of the settled community. I refer in particular to communities in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Shortly after he was appointed with responsibility for the travelling community the Minister established a task force chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, which published its interim report in January 1994.  Its first recommendation was that a national body should be established to monitor the national accommodation programme. Such a body would have statutory powers to require local authorities to meet their responsibilities.  The objective was to achieve an integrated approach between all local authorities. Clearly there is an imbalance in the provision of halting sites throughout the country, it is done in an <i>ad hoc</i> way. While some local authorities have a policy others do not.  This has led to an unfair burden being placed on my constituency of Dublin South, particularly the part for which South Dublin County Council has responsibility.</P>
    <P>The number of travellers nationwide is 25,000 made up of 4,000 families. According to the last census 25 per cent of the total live in the greater Dublin area.  My constituency of Dublin South is 22 square kilometres in size and currently caters for the housing needs of 270 traveller families.  Dublin Corporation caters for 331, Fingal County Council for 194 and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for 90, giving a total of 885 families in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>In the South Dublin County Council area there are six ten family halting sites, 14 families in group housing, 42 families in standard housing and three large temporary sites.  A total of 101 <Col N="240" /> families are being catered for, 159 families, 97 of which are living on temporary sites are in need of accommodation and, sadly, 62 are on the roadside.  It is estimated, on good information, that the natural increase in the travelling community between now and the year 2,000 will be 4 per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>It is clear from any analysis of the figures that the electoral area of South Dublin County Council is overburdened. It caters for 270 families compared with a figure of 284 for Fingal County Council and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council combined. In other words, South Dublin County Council is carrying half the burden in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Dublin South, particularly in the Rathfarnham area, sites are being chosen not because they are suitable &mdash; far from it, some are unsuitable not only on planning grounds but also in terms of safety &mdash; but because they are available and there is a dearth of space in the horribly rezoned south county area.  Because of bad planning decisions there are few sites available.</P>
    <P>The Minister must reconsider the decision to provide 15 bay halting sites given that 15 traveller families can constitute up to 150 people, not to mention their animals and visiting relatives.  It is much too difficult to integrate this level comfortably in a halting site among the settled community.  No guarantees are given in relation to the proper maintenance of sites or the control of animals.</P>
    <P>Everyone who knows me since my election will vouch for the fact that I have never opposed the provision of a halting site in my constituency.  At enormous political and electoral risk to myself I have refused to sign petitions and requests to the county manager to stop the provision of halting sites. Responsible Dáil Deputies should support the legitimate social policy objective of looking after those families but we have to be fair and the figures indicate an unfair burden is being borne by my constituency.</P>
    <P>I have run out of patience.  At an <Col N="241" /> early stage I made it clear to the Minister, who will have been three years in office in November, that unless a national strategy was devised the goodwill of the settled community would be exhausted.  I am angry with him for his inactivity and his total abdication of his responsibilities in this area.  It appears from his reply yesterday that there is no intention to redress the imbalance.  He is putting the matter on the long finger and hoping that before the final report of the task force is published it will be time for a new Government and the matter will be out of his hands.  This leaves me with no option but to withdraw my support for the provision of any further halting sites in my constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to set the record straight.  As Minister of State with responsibility for housing and urban renewal I have a duty to meet the accommodation needs of the travelling community.  As the greater Dublin area has a larger percentage of the settled population it also has a larger percentage of travellers.  We are living in an era of greater urbanisation and it would be remarkable if this applied only to the settled community Clearly, it does not.</P>
      <P>Because of my particular knowledge and experience I would give the provision of accommodation for travellers a high priority but this cannot be done unless everyone in the local authority system and Deputies accept their responsibilities.  Hard decisions have to be made.  It is not good enough to abdicate responsibility and state that one will not support the provision of halting sites in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to set out the present position on the provision of accommodation for members of the travelling community.  Each local authority is responsible, as the housing authority for its area, for the planning, initiation and construction of housing and serviced caravan parks for travelling people <Col N="242" /> assessed as in need of such accommodation and unable to provide it from their own resources.  The authorities carried out an assessment of the accommodation needs of members of the travelling community in 1993.  In addition, the authorities carry out a count of traveller households in November each year and details of each are published in my Department's Housing Statistics bulletin. My Department's responsibility is to provide the funding required by the authorities for the provision of such accommodation and a general advisory and supervisory service to ensure that technical standards and cost control procedures are observed.</P>
    <P>A separate financial allocation is provided annually to local authorities for the construction of serviced caravan parks for travelling people and the authorities have been informed over the years that additional resources would be provided, in any year where needed, for the construction of such parks.  The original annual provisions in each of the last four years were exceeded.  The 1995 provision has been increased to £4.5 million which also includes provision for the construction of new group housing schemes for travelling people.  This approach has been taken in the light of the interim report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community which recommended that a specific capital allocation, separate from the general housing construction allocation, be made for the construction of group housing schemes for travelling people.</P>
    <P>Local authorities were advised in September 1994 that they should initiate proposals for serviced caravan parks, where they are required having regard to the 1993 assessment of need, for inclusion in their 1995 housing programme. When notifying authorities of their new housing &ldquo;starts&rdquo;&mdash; acquisitions for 1995 on 23 February 1995 &mdash; I asked them to let me know the serviced caravan parks and new group housing schemes they propose to start this year. I will be reviewing the overall proposals when all the returns are received from the authorities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="243" /> Apart from serviced caravan parks and group housing schemes members of the travelling community are allocated local authority houses and they, like others, should benefit from the increasing number of dwellings now becoming available for letting because of the expansion of the local authority house building programme since 1993.  In 1994, over 150 houses were let to members of the travelling community.</P>
    <P>As regards the establishment of a national programme, I will await to see what the Task Force on the Travelling Community says on the subject and I understand that its final report will be ready within the next few months.  In calling for a national programme, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the section in the <i>Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997</i> which states that the Government commits itself to the target of providing permanent, serviced caravan site accommodation for all traveller families who require such homes by the year 2000. Lest there is any misunderstanding on this matter, this is also the policy of the present Government.</P>
    <P>It is Government policy that in framing new legislation appropriate functions should be devolved to local authorities and unnecessary controls removed.  In 1991 local authorities were given full responsibility for the various new schemes in the plan for social housing and requirements for departmental approval in housing construction were reduced.  Local authorities should be providers of a comprehensive and cohesive housing service, including halting site accommodation, to persons in need of acommodation to meet their requirements in this regard.  There are some elements of a national programme there at present &mdash; for example, Government policy, national funding and national standards.  What we need now is action on a national scale by all the local authorities so that traveller households are provided with suitable accommodation whether in housing or on halting sites.  I would like to stress <Col N="244" /> that while a few authorities have discharged their responsibilities in this respect commendably, performance overall has been very uneven.  I am committed to ensuring that real progress is made on this provision.  With that objective in mind I will be considering very seriously the recommendations of the task force on receipt of its report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this issue at this time because it is usually at this time of year that parents whose children are being expelled from school are informed of this decision by school principals. This is sometimes the first indication to the parent that their child is troublesome and they have only the summer period in which to get their child into another school.  When other schools hear that a child has been suspended or expelled they do not want to take in that child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that 27 per cent of all school-going children may be affected, either actively or passively, by bullying. Much work has been done in schools to counter this problem but much remains to be done.  All too often both the victim and the perpetrator end up outside the school system in that the victim may decide to leave school and the bully is very often suspended or expelled.  We must deal with this problem rather than push it aside.  Currently the only method of dealing with badly behaved children is to suspend or expel them.  This method does not serve the child, his family or the wider community.  Many children who are expelled, particularly those with behavioural problems, are unable to find alternative accommodation in other schools and receive no support or treatment for their problems. Suspensions and expulsions are not the solution and we should not consider them as such because the child is merely moved from one community to another. Badly behaved children often experience greater problems later in life.  It is <Col N="245" /> unacceptable that we should as a society treat children with behavioural difficulties in this way.</P>
    <P>As a short term measure school principals should be required to inform the Department of Education on a monthly basis of all children suspended and expelled.  That would deal with the problem as it arises.  Such notification would enable us for the first time to compile figures and proceed from a factual basis.  The Department of Education and the Department of Justice must adopt a co-ordinated approach to dealing with children whose behaviour may put themselves and others at risk. Such cases are often reported in newspapers and the problem should be dealt with in a worthwhile way.</P>
    <P>The first step towards such an approach would be the establishment of an interdepartmental review group.  In the longer term we must establish specialised classes with teachers specially geared towards the problems of children with behavioural difficulties. Such children should be treated as having special needs in the same way as children with learning difficulties or mental handicap.  In a recent court case the Department of Education was told it should provide places for mildly mentally handicapped children with behavioural difficulties.  These children need special attention within the school system.</P>
    <P>I hope that many of these problems will be dealt with by the juvenile justice Bill.  It is regrettable this legislation has not been progressed by the Government. These problems should be dealt with before the start of the new school year rather than waiting for the introduction of legislation.  All children with behavioural problems will not, and should not, come under the remit of the juvenile justice Bill.  Unless the problem is addressed we will continue to hear stories such as that of the young Waterford boy.  There are cases of bullying in every county and unless we address the problem we will continue to expel difficult children as a first rather than a last resort and we will continue to export <Col N="246" /> the problem from our schools onto our streets, where it will have to be dealt with it at some stage.</P>
    <P>A co-ordinated effort must be made by the various agencies.  The Minister should set up an interdepartmental review group while the problem is manageable, before we get to the stage where the only solution will be imprisonment.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Lynch for raising this important matter.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that the report of the Department of Education's working group on truancy was published in April 1994.  One of the issues highlighted in that report was the absence of mandatory reporting by school principals of suspensions and expulsions from schools and the working group made a number of recommendations on this matter.  The working group also made several recommendations on the enforcement of the School Attendance Acts on a national level.  It is very evident from the report, that truancy is a complex issue and demands a comprehensive solution.  This solution can best be achieved by a mix of legislative, administrative, educational and social measures.</P>
      <P>Since the publication of the truancy report the Department of Education has received a range of submissions from interested parties on the measures which should now be taken to address this very difficult area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In keeping with its commitment to address the problems of truancy and early drop-out the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, was given special responsibility for this area by the Government.  The House will be aware that as a first step in the process of addressing this problem the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, recently announced the establishment of a task force within the Department.  The terms of reference assigned to that task force are to examine the submissions received from interested parties in response to <Col N="247" /> the report on truancy and consider and make recommendations as to future action required to address the problem of truancy at first and second level.</P>
    <P>The task force was asked to furnish its report to the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, as soon as possible.  At that stage it may be necessary to broaden the forum in which the issues involved are discussed and to involve a range of Departments and agencies in addressing the problem.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education has a wide range of strategies currently in place to help prevent early school leaving and under achievement.  At primary level these include early intervention measures which provide additional supports for young people at risk.  These measures are aimed at optimising their participation in and benefit from the education system.  These include major initiatives such as a pre-schooling, remedial and home-school-community liaison services, co-ordination with other agencies, guidance and psychological services and ancillary services and resources for schools in disadvantaged areas.  A number of youth encounter projects are also provided for young <Col N="248" /> people who have either become involved in minor delinquency or are at risk of doing so and who have become alienated from the mainstream school system.</P>
    <P>The strategy at second level includes curricular reform such as the junior certificate schools programme, the leaving certificate vocational programme and the applied leaving certificate programme which are all designated to encourage an improvement in retention rates to completion of senior cycle up to 90 per cent of the total cohort of second level pupils.</P>
    <P>There is a significant emphasis now on second chance education and training through the provision of Youthreach for unqualified early school leavers over the age of 15.  This programme is provided jointly by FÁS and the vocational education committees in community training workshops and vocational education committee Youthreach centres. A total of 1,600 Youthreach places are provided in the education sector at present, and an additional 400 places were provided before last year.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.35 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 27 April 1995.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 15, 31, 41 and 42 together.</P>
      <P>To date, sums of £2,109,755 and £1,800,233 have been expended in relation to the Burren and Wicklow National Park Visitors Centres respectively. Included in these amounts are the cost of site purchase, construction and associated costs, costs associated with interpretative material and disruption costs following the suspension of works in February 1993.</P>
      <P>The cost of reinstating the sites at Mullaghmore and Luggala to their original condition are estimated at between £0.5 million to £1 million and from £0.4 million to £0.9 million respectively depending on whether sites have to be restored to their original condition or whether the structures can simply be covered over and rendered unusable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to European Regional Development Fund expenditure on <Col N="104" /> these projects, amounts of £937,500 and £1,011,750 respectively were allocated under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1989-1993 for the Burren and Wicklow National Park Visitor Centre projects.  I understand that there has been no request from the European Union for the repayment of any contribution granted towards either project.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies may be aware, planning permission for the Wicklow National Park Visitor Centre was refused by An Bord Pleanála and the planning application for the Burren National Park Visitor Centre was withdrawn on 31 March 1995.  I am not aware that there were any impending legal issues which might have come before the courts which would have warranted a postponement of the withdrawal of the planning application.  Final decisions as to what use, if any, is to be made of the works already carried out will not be determined until draft management plans for the Burren and Wicklow National Parks have been prepared and the public given the opportunity of contributing to them.  At that stage planning permission will be required for any proposals that emerge in relation to those sites.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department are putting in train proposals for the preparation of the management plans.  I envisage that consultants will be appointed to undertake the preparation of the management plans.  The work of the consultants will be overseen by steering committees and I have invited the respective country managers or their nominees to be members of the committees. My officials are also in discussion with officials of the Office of Public Works in regard to the work to be carried out at the two sites in the interim. It is my wish that the direction of the management plans should not be influenced by the controversies of the recent past but that they should be carried out as objectively and as fairly as possible. The steering committee and the consultants will clearly not be able to ignore the existence of the partially completed <Col N="105" /> structures at the Mullaghmore and Luggala sites but I do not wish to give any signals to them as to how I consider they should proceed.  Pending the outcome of the consultation process, I have instructed the Office of Public Works, subject to obtaining the permission of the courts and after discussions with the Clare County Council to proceed with the clearing of the Mullaghmore site. This will initially involve the removal of building materials from the site, the dismantling of certain structural steelwork and the preparation of the remainder of the site for backfilling.  I do not propose to proceed with the backfilling of the site until the outcome of the consultation process on the draft management plan and conservation strategy is known.  This approach is being adopted so that if any proposals emerge from the study which are acceptable to the public and to Government we may yet be able to salvage some benefit from the previous investment in the site.  In the meantime I have instructed the Office of Public Works to ensure that the site is safe and secure.</P>
    <P>My officials will of course be presenting details of the interim proposals in relation to the Mullaghmore site to the High Court for its consent.  In the interest of accuracy I should point out that while the High Court injunction of 12 February 1993 remains effective, the injunction of the 29 July 1993 lapsed following the judgment of Mr. Justice Lynch in the High Court on 8 June 1994. Therefore, the question of vacating the Order of 29 July 1993 does not now arise.  The earlier injunction by Mr. Justice Costello still places a restraint on proceeding with development work at Mullaghmore as long as it remains unauthorised under the Planning Acts hence the need to seek the permission of the High Court to carry out any work at the site.</P>

      <P>During the years 1990-1994 An Chomhairle Ealaíon, the body with primary responsibility for community arts, has funded many projects in this area under four principal headings, professional community arts resource organisations; artists in the community projects; arts festivals and policy and training.  Details of the project for the years 1990 to 1993 are available in the annual reports of An Chomhairle for those years and the 1994 report will be published later this year.</P>
      <P>It is estimated by An Chomhairle Ealaíon that the total number of jobs created in community arts was as follows: 1990 &mdash; 15 jobs; 1991 &mdash; 21 jobs; 1992 &mdash; 22 jobs; 1993 &mdash; 31 jobs; 1994 &mdash; 41.</P>
      <P>I should stress that these figures are full-time equivalent jobs, as many jobs in the arts are not permanent and it is more usual for artists to work on contract for the duration of a particular project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the above activities promoted by An Chomhairle Ealaíon, I decided to provide funding of £84,500 last year for two community arts projects which fall outside the conventional support structures for the arts, £75,000 of this amount went to the group CAFE &mdash; Creative Arts for Everyone &mdash; and was in respect of a community intervention to promote arts awareness in centres for the unemployed.  The objective of this intervention was to provide opportunities for practical involvement in a number of arts activities for people who are unlikely to have had any direct contact with the arts, either through the educational system or in their early adult years.  The funds were utilised to <Col N="107" /> organise 12 taster/research pilot sessions with experienced performers/ practitioners in various art forms in recognised centres for the unemployed. An allocation of £9,500 was also made by me last year to the Westside Unemployment Centre, Galway, to fund twice weekly workshops for 28 unemployed persons.</P>
    <P>I am awaiting an evaluation of these activities and will be happy to consider further funding for similar initiatives in 1995 on the basis of this evaluation and within the limits of available resources.</P>

      <P>The term of office of the present members of the RTÉ Authority expires on 31 May 1995. The number of members of the authority shall be not less than seven and not more than nine.  Section 7 of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993, which will come into operation on 1 June 1995, requires that, where the members of the Authority number seven, not less than three shall be women and not less than three shall be men and where the members number eight or nine, not less than four shall be women and not less than four shall be men.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the good practice of successive Governments, each member of the Authority will be selected on the basis of his or her personal capacity to discharge the duties of a member of the Authority in the public interest.</P>
      <P>It has been the practice generally of Governments to appoint a member of the RTE staff to the Authority.  I am of the view that the selection of this person should be made more democratic.  To this end the Government has agreed with my proposal to request RTE to make the necessary arrangements for RTE staff to nominate two staff members, one man and one woman, of which one will be selected by the Government for appointment to the Authority.  This process is now in train. I should stress that the RTE employee appointed to the Authority will be required to serve in his or her personal capacity in the public interest rather than in a representative capacity.</P>

      <P>Section 3 of the Arts Act, 1951, already obliges An Chomhairle Ealaíon, by such means and in such manner as they think fit, to, <i>inter alia,</i></P>

      <P>&mdash; promote the knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts.</P>
      <P>I have no plans at present, therefore, to amend the Act since it already addresses the issue raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>It is this legal framework which has informed the decision of An Chomhairle Ealaíon to make access to the arts one of the key Strategic Objectives of <i>The Arts Plan 1995-1997.</i> The plan makes it clear that the objective &ldquo;is to encourage real participation in the arts in terms of availability and access, with particular reference to young people, children and people with disabilities and taking account of social as well as geographical barriers&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In this context, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, in order to underline the inclusiveness of the plan's objectives and the major emphasis which it places on access, an Irish language version of the plan will be published shortly.</P>

      <P>I am happy <Col N="112" /> to assure the Deputy that I place a particular emphasis on the need to increase arts linkages between the North and South of this island.  It was in recognition of this that I met the Northern Ireland Arts Minister, Michael Ancram MP, on 3 December 1993, with the express objective of stepping up North-South co-operation in the arts.  The outcome of that meeting was an agreement to establish a joint committee of the two Arts Councils on the island to explore and develop a variety of further cross-border initiatives, with particular emphasis on the involvement of youth. A new director's forum was also established to facilitate cross-Border co-operation between museums.  Both these fora are now in operation.</P>
      <P>My meeting with Minister Ancram also gave recognition to the considerable linkages which have already been achieved between North and South in the arts and cultural areas and urged their continued development.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the two Arts Councils on the island propose to jointly appoint an arts co-operation officer with the brief of initiating, broadening and encouraging collaboration in all forms of arts activities with particular emphasis on cross-Border touring and exchanges.  This post was recently advertised in the press and should be filled shortly.</P>
      <P>In addition, there will also be a significant involvement from the North of Ireland in the &ldquo;L'Imaginaire Irlandais&rdquo; project, which will involve a wide range of contemporary artistic and cultural events taking place in France from April-August 1996.  In fact, five of the 17 artists to be featured in the core visual arts exhibition in Paris next year are from the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that, through the INTERREG II programme for Ireland and Northern Ireland, an opportunity exists for the stimulation of cross-Border activity in the provision of enhanced arts and cultural infrastructure. Some funds under this programme are directly at my own disposal and I was pleased recently to allocate <Col N="113" /> £344,400 to the Hawkswell Theatre in Sligo which has developed strong links with drama groups in the North.</P>

      <P>The working group is made up of officials of my Department, the Department of the Environment and the Office of Public Works and has now met twice. Its terms of reference are to examine the commitments contained in the policy agreement for <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, which commits the Government to improving the protection for listed buildings, including placing the system of listed buildings on a statutory basis, introducing incentives for the proper upkeep and maintenance of such buildings, undertaking a full national architectural audit and reporting back with recommendations to myself and the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>I expect that the report will be completed before the end of this year.  In conclusion with the Minister for the Environment, I will give careful consideration to the report and to the introduction of any necessary new policy initiatives in this area.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy's question refers to game development grants which were introduced in 1961 and paid to regional game councils and affiliated gun clubs with a view to assisting them with local game development programmes entailing the rearing and releasing of game birds, mainly pheasant and mallard, the establishment of local sanctuaries, habitat improvement works and some educational projects.  The objective was to, hopefully, provide a surplus of game stock which would provide hunting for tourists.  The surplus did not materialise, however, and the grants were withdrawn, in 1983.  I have no proposals to re-introduce them at this time.</P>
      <P>I recently received a deputation from the National Association of Regional Game Councils and discussed with them, <i>inter alia</i>, the questions of pestvermin control and game development and the funding thereof.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the designation of centres of excellence in the arts in certain centres of population has been mooted by An Chomhairle Ealaíon in &ldquo;The Arts Plan 1995-97&rdquo; which was published recently and was the subject of statements in Dáil Éireann on 6 April 1995.</P>
      <P>While the plan does not suggest the designation of Cork as a centre of excellence for music, page 52 argues for the city's designation as a centre of excellence for the visual arts on the following grounds:</P>
      <P>To correct this imbalance and building on the reputation and achievement of the College of Art in Cork and the development of such a significant resource as the Crawford Art Gallery, Council intends to develop the city as a centre of excellence in this art form through a framework of support for the infrastructure which comprises the aforementioned Crawford Art Gallery; Triskel Arts Centre; the National Sculpture Factory, with a membership of 170 artists; Cork Printmaking, which aims to cater for 50-60 artists; the bronze casting foundry, proposing to cater for a similar number; Cork Arts Society; studios such as Backwater (22 artists), Cork artists' Collective (eight artists), Arthive, a venue which accommodates up to 30 artists as well as an exhibition space, and which offers a community programme, and the Sirius Trust in Cobh which currently administers an international residency programme.  In addition, Cork Corporation has appointed an officer to promote the 1 per cent scheme and UCC has both an exhibition space and an arts officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the concept of the designation of centres of excellence for particular arts disciplines in centres of population. I am happy to assure the Deputy, however, that the designation of Cork as a centre of excellence for the visual arts will in no way restrict the dynamism and growth of music as an art from in <Col N="117" /> that city, as articulated most forcefully by the Cork College of Music, the Cork Choral Festival, Cumann Náisiúnta na gCór, the Cork Orchestral Society, Eigse na Laoi, the Cork Music Resource Co-operative, the Irish Operatic Repertory Company and West Cork Chamber Music, all of which are assisted by An Chomhairle Ealaíon.</P>
    <P>I am happy to take this opportunity to inform the House that the designation of centres of excellence is not intended, nor will it be, either elitist or exclusive.  The designation of one arts discipline in a particular town or city will not preclude arts activity flourishing in other disciplines in the same location. Nor will it preclude the designated arts discipline for, say, Cork, being developed in other locations.  &ldquo;The Arts Plan 1995-97&rdquo; is essentially aiming to enhance the overall cultural infrastructure of Cork city by placing a new and timely emphasis on the visual arts which, over time, will complement its rich tradition in the area of music and represent a further major attraction to Cork as a centre for tourism, for gainful employment, and for artistic expression of the highest quality in its own right.</P>

      <P>The disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' tax concessions scheme, which is operated by the Revenue Commissioners, provides for the remission or repayment of taxes payable on the purchase of a vehicle for use by a qualifying applicant, and for repayment of excise duty on fuel used in the vehicle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Disabled Drivers' and Disabled <Col N="118" /> Passengers' (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994 which came into effect on 1 December 1994, introduced a number of improvements to the previous scheme.  Provision was made for the remission of taxes on the purchase of a new vehicle, while applicants who had purchased a used vehicle would also now be able to benefit under the scheme.  The scheme was also extended to include organisations responsible for the care of qualifying disabled persons.</P>
    <P>Under the old scheme, in order for a disabled person to reclaim the taxes on a vehicle, the vehicle had to be brought to a Garda station for examination and certification.  To claim refunds of excise duty paid on fuel purchased for use in the vehicle, the vehicle had to be brought to a Garda station to have the mileage certified.  The Revenue Commissioners considered that these arrangements were proving unsatisfactory from an administrative point of view and, when the new scheme was being introduced in December 1994, took the opportunity to introduce revised arrangements.  One of the changes introduced was to require that the vehicle be examined by Revenue officials at the local vehicle registration office (VRO).</P>
    <P>It has become evident that the requirement to visit the VRO is causing inconvenience to some disabled persons. The Revenue Commissioners have reviewed the operation of the new scheme and have decided, with effect from 1 May 1995, to introduce fundamental changes to the way claims are processed.  In future, claims will no longer need to be certified at either a VRO or at a Garda station.  Instead, applicants will post their applications directly to a central Revenue office for decision.  The central office will select a small number of claims for further audit and this may involve a Revenue official visiting the applicant by appointment. The selection of a claim for audit will not result in a delay in processing the claim.  A letter has issued to all disabled drivers advising them of the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> I am satisfied that the new procedures now being introduced represent a considerable improvement to the operation of the scheme and will be welcomed by the disabled community.  The Revenue Commissioners are committed to providing the best possible service to the public and, where problems are identified, are pleased to make every effort to arrive at a satisfactory solution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the assertion contained in the Deputy's question that there is a hazard arising out of the alleged proliferation of transmission masts.</P>
      <P>In licensing the use of the radio frequency spectrum, I have regard to the best international practice, in particular, the guidelines of the International Radiation Protection Agency, the IRPA.  I understand that the limits which have been established by the IRPA are limits within which it is safe to work and live on the basis of all expert knowledge.</P>
      <P>I have no evidence before me that transmission facilities licensed to operate by my Department are operating outside the IRPA guidelines, or that there is any need to make them subject to those guidelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="130" /> Accordingly, I have no plans to give the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland additional powers in relation to non-ionising radiation, or to set up an independent body to further investigate the matter.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to extend the free port area at Ringaskiddy, County Cork; if he has satisfied himself with the present level of activity at Ringaskiddy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no plans to extend the free port area at Ringaskiddy, County Cork.  The fact that no new industry has located in the free port area in the recent past is disappointing but with the advent of the Single Market the advantages of free ports are much reduced.</P>
      <P>However, I am satisfied with the present level of port related activities in Cork Harbour in general and at the Ringaskiddy Ferry Terminal and deep-water berth in particular.  These activities are not, of course, dependent on the free port concept.</P>
