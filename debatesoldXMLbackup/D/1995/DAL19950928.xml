      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) the following arrangements shall apply in relation to No. 7: (i) statements shall be confined to the Taoiseach and the main spokespersons for the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats Party and shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; and (ii) the Taoiseach may be called upon to make a concluding statement not exceeding five minutes; and (2) the Dáil, on its rising today, shall adjourn until 12 noon on Tuesday, 3 October 1995. Private Members' Business shall be No. 13.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that at the United Nations yesterday the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs set down the Irish position on decommissioning and the starting of all party talks?  This position is very <Col N="294" /> close to what I and my Fianna Fáil colleagues have been arguing for the past six months.  The Tánaiste set down the position in a clear-cut fashion and that is what I sought to get a reply to here yesterday from the Taoiseach rather than the wishy washy answers he gave on the decommissioning question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the Tánaiste has posed a clear challenge to the British Government and when he is next talking to Prime Minister Major, will he make it clear to him that what the Tánaiste said yesterday is both his position and that of the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, rather than the unclear line that has been given?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I asked about the third banking force.  I am now asking about the sale of the Local Loans Fund to make money available for the equality payments.  I understand securitisation legislation is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">

      <P>The tradition over the past ten years has been that on the week the session commenced the Opposition was given a legislative programme.  In <Col N="295" /> the absence of any document this week, can I take it the Government does not have a legislative programme or cannot agree one for this session?</P>

    <Title>EU Heads of State Meeting: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to make this statement. This was an informal meeting and not one where decisions were taken or recorded.  The transactions of the meeting were confidential and, therefore, Members will not expect me to speak <Col N="301" /> other than in general terms and certainly not to represent the positions of others in what I say.</P>
      <P>The informal meeting of EU Heads of State and Government which I attended in Majorca on 22 and 23 September was not a European Council.  No specific decisions were taken nor were conclusions adopted.  The meeting was, however, a very valuable and constructive exercise and it provides a focus for what I hope will be useful and informative statements on European issues in this House this morning.</P>
      <P>As the Heads of State and Government gathered in Majorca they were acutely aware of the challenges facing the European Union.  These challenges can be set out by way of the following series of questions.  First, how can the Union ensure that it is relevant and accountable to its citizens?  Second, can the Union deal with all the issues arising from prospective future enlargement in a way which protects its achievements to date and also satisfies the realistic aspirations of those countries that wish to join?  Third, can the Union realise its full potential in contributing to the achievement of European and world security in the broadest sense?</P>
      <P>Achieving the right answers to these questions poses a most formidable task for the Union.  The answers will flow in part from a number of key upcoming events notably the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference and subsequent enlargement negotiations.  The response of the Union to its ongoing day-to-day agenda will also play a key role especially in meeting the current needs and aspirations of its citizens.  We cannot simply wait for the Intergovernmental Conference to deliver a panacea for all the Union's ills.  Action must continue to be taken to respond to those issues of greatest concern to the citizens of the Union.  That is a political task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my intervention at the Majorca meeting I laid great stress on that point. The citizens of Europe are first and foremost concerned with economic and personal security, with jobs and with crime.  Matters such as institutional <Col N="302" /> issues and the decision making balance between various institutions, fascinating and important though they may be, are secondary.  The Union must not become fixated on debate on such matters at the expense of citizens' real concerns.  Practical issues which make an impact on people's lives must be addressed at European level if the European Union is to be a continued success.</P>
    <P>Jobs are the first concern.  Undoubtedly the employment issue has exercised the Union in recent times especially since the publication of the Delors White Paper in December 1993. Detailed follow-up work and analysis of the problem has been undertaken by the relevant ministerial councils.  The 1994 Essen European Council set out a number of prescriptions for member states in regard to the formulation of employment policy.  What has been lacking, however, and this is a point which I underlined at the Majorca meeting, is closer co-ordination of member state policies on employment.  We need to make a concerted effort to reduce the cost of creating employment in Europe relative to the cost of creating employment elsewhere.  That can best be done on a co-ordinated basis whereas if individual states attempt to tackle it they may get into fiscal or competitive difficulties.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are different views in the Union both as to the cause of European Union unemployment and as to the appropriateness of increasing community competence in this area. What is not in doubt &mdash; and I also made this point at the Majorca meeting &mdash; is that the employment performance of Europe is considerably poorer than that of the other great trading blocks, namely the United States and Japan. Unemployment in the European Union is almost twice the American rate and three and a half times higher than in Japan.  More importantly, unemployment represents a huge waste of human resources and a crushing burden on the already fragile public finances of many member states.</P>
    <P>The December European Council <Col N="303" /> meeting in Madrid will look at the employment issue in some detail.  There will be an expectation of action among the European public especially those who are unemployed who see the workings of the European Union as having very little to do with them.  In short the employment issue is the key test of the relevance of the Union to its citizens.</P>
    <P>The other key area of public concern which I focused on in my intervention at Majorca relates to the citizen's personal security, that is the issue of crime, including drug trafficking.  Organised crime especially in the area of drug trafficking does not respect national boundaries. Crime is a problem which impacts on the citizens of all member states. They expect a co-ordinated and effective response to the crime problem from the Union.  I questioned whether the current arrangements based largely on intergovernmental co-operation under the Justice and Home Affairs pillar of the Treaty were appropriate for the tasks of fighting trans-national crime.  I indicated that we need to look at the Justice and Home Affairs provisions of the Treaty and to consider what aspects should be brought under pillar one of Community competence; and giving the Commission a right of initiative in this key area.  Even without Treaty changes we need to consider what can be done under the current provision.</P>
    <P>In the specific case of drug trafficking I repeated my view that consideration should be given to the establishment of a European Coastguard to counter trafficking in illegal drugs at sea.  Ireland is especially vulnerable to such trafficking. As Deputies are aware countering the drug menace is a major priority of the Government and the Minister for Justice has recently unveiled a package of domestic measures in this area.  We are also focusing on what can be done at European Union level and the Government has established an interdepartmental committee chaired by the Department of Justice to investigate and come forward with recommendations on all the available options at <Col N="304" /> European level to counter the supply of and demand for illegal drugs.  This will be a priority issue for the Government at European level both up to and during the Irish Presidency of the European Union.</P>
    <P>As evidenced in referenda in various countries there is a sense of alienation among sections of the public <i>vis-á-vis</i> the European Union.  Probably this sense of alienation extends to all other political institutions, such as national and local institutions but it is only in respect of the European Union institutions that the people are asked to pass judgment in a referendum.  If the European Union is to command support from the public in referenda on any changes that may be made to its founding treaties, it must be seen to deal not with abstract problems of concern to administrators and European politicians but the concerns of real people.  That is why I have stressed that for its own sake as well as the importance of those issues, European Union must be seen to be capable of tackling problems such as unemployment, crime, personal security and the drugs menace.</P>
    <P>The second main theme of my contribution at the Majorca meeting was the need for the institutions of the Union, especially the Commission to become more visible and accountable to the citizens of member states.  It is generally accepted that the citizens of the Union see the decision making process in the Union as remote and one in which they do not participate.  The turnout in European Parliament elections has been very low in comparison with National Parliament equivalents.  This feeling of remoteness leads to apathy which in turn can lead to ambivalence and disillusionment. Ways must therefore be found to make the Union more visible on a localised basis throughout member states.  One option I postulated in this regard at Majorca was appearances by individual Commissioners before relevant committees of national parliaments and also indeed at local authority level.  This could be an especially feasible proposition in an enlarged Union <Col N="305" /> with additional Commissioners from new member states.  A separate option would be to look at the possibility of trans-national lists in the European Parliament elections.  I have no doubt this whole area of what might be termed the democratic legitimacy of the Union will feature high on the agenda of next year's Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the future key agenda items facing the Union.  Our discussions in Majorca proved especially valuable in allowing for a frank and wideranging exchange of views on the key agenda items.  Naturally the discussion revealed differences sometimes of emphasis and sometimes of substance in the approach of individual member states.  Deputies will appreciate that the nature of our discussions were such as to debar me from attributing specific positions to individual Heads of State or Government.  I can, however, give the House my impression following the Majorca meeting as to the general current position in regard to the strategic agenda items, namely, the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference, enlargement of the Union and economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>In regard to the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference there was no desire in Majorca to pre-empt the work of the reflection group on which Ireland is represented by the Minister of State for European Affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell. The reflection group will report to the European Council in Madrid.  The group is currently engaged in an intensive round of negotiations and I anticipate that its report to Madrid will set out the issues which it believes the Intergovernmental Conference should address as well as sketching out options on how these issues should be dealt with.  In these circumstances, Majorca wisely avoided the temptation to negotiate Intergovernmental Conference issues in advance.</P>
    <P>I expect that the commencement of the intergovernmental conference will take place during the Italian Presidency and will be announced at the Madrid <Col N="306" /> summit.  The Intergovernmental Conference will continue in session during Ireland's Presidency.  The date the Intergovernmental Conference will conclude will depend on the substance of the agenda and the willingness of member states to reach consensus on the issues involved.  If consensus can be forged the Irish Presidency will be able, if required, to conclude the Intergovernmental Conference during its tenure.</P>
    <P>I have previously set out, in this House and elsewhere, the general Irish approach to key Intergovernmental Conference issues especially in the institutional area.  Our approach, while naturally protective of Irish interests, will also be guided by what is right and realistic for the Union as a whole.  The objective of being relevant and accountable to the citizens of the Union must also guide the work of the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>A primary concern of the Intergovernmental Conference will be to prepare the Union institutionally for the next round of enlargement.  Ireland fully supports the right of the central and eastern European countries &mdash; CEECs &mdash; Cyprus and Malta to membership of the Union.  As has been made clear in the conclusions of both the Corfu and Essen European Councils, negotiations on the next enlargement of the Union will take place after the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference. The Majorca meeting did not alter this timetable.</P>
    <P>The next round of enlargement will undoubtedly be more difficult for the Union than was the previous one.  The central and eastern European countries are well below the EU average in terms of economic development.  This will obviously raise difficult questions as to how existing common policies should be applied in the aspirant countries.  It will no doubt be advocated in some quarters that the state of development of these countries will require radical surgery and, indeed, dilution of existing common EU policies such as the CAP if the Union is to absorb the newcomers.  I strongly advised against such a course <Col N="307" /> at the Majorca meeting.  The European Union is based not just on economic efficiency but on the principle of social solidarity between the strong and the weak, be they countries, sectors or individuals. That essential political commitment to social solidarity is expressed in policies such as the Structural Funds and the Common Agricultural Policy and if they were lost as a result of enlargement the Union would lose something essential.</P>
    <P>Naturally I am motivated in this by a desire to protect Ireland's interests in areas of core national concern such as agriculture.  I am equally motivated by a desire to preserve and build on the deepening process that has taken place to date.  The Union must retain policies like the internal market and CAP which have contributed so much in economic and social terms to the Union.  Enlargement must not be used, therefore, as a pretext to dismantle what has been already achieved.</P>
    <P>The enlarged Union will extend to the borders of Russia.  At Majorca the Heads of State and Government had a long discussion on the current and future security architecture in Europe. A significant feature of this discussion was a recognition on all sides of the need for sensitivity towards Russian concerns as regards security.  The unanimous view was that the Union's partnership with Russia should be developed to the maximum extent possible.  Russia has an important role to play in Europe, for instance, in bringing peace and reconstruction to the former Yugoslavia. We should use the OSCE, which links all of the European states, together with the US and Canada effectively to provide a focus for security concerns that Russia and its neighbours may have.</P>
    <P>I also hope that Russia's membership of the Council of Europe can be achieved at a very early date.  I will ask our parliamentary delegation on the Council of Europe and in the parliamentary assembly to do everything it can on behalf of Ireland and in Europe's <Col N="308" /> interest to speed up the application of Russia for membership of the Council of Europe.  The Council of Europe plays a particularly important role in fostering respect for human rights.</P>
    <P>With regard to economic and monetary union, Deputies will recall that the Majorca meeting commenced against the background of comments attributed to the German Finance Minister, Theodore Waigel, as to the eligibility of certain countries for economic and monetary union.  In our discussions on this topic at Majorca we firmly committed ourselves to the convergence criteria for European Monetary Union as set out in the Maastricht Treaty.  There was no desire to reopen this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>Our discussions also focused on the question of monetary cohabitation or the relationship between the single currency zone and the currencies of those outside European Monetary Union. Concern was expressed at the potential inherent in this situation to distort competitiveness and to disrupt the operation of the single market.  The Cannes European Council mandated the Commission to produce a report on this issue and it is clearly a matter which will have to be addressed in the context of the move to European Monetary Union.  I expect we will discuss it in Madrid.</P>
    <P>As far as Ireland is concerned our intention is to be among the first group of countries eligible to join European Monetary Union whenever it commences. Government fiscal policy is based on this tenet.  Ireland has always supported a strict interpretation of the convergence provisions in the treaty and of the timetable and procedures set out in it.  Speculation at this stage as to which countries will or will not qualify tends to generate uncertainty which is not helpful to realising the agreed European Union goal of economic and monetary union.  I counsel people who wish to speculate for domestic political reasons about who might or might not be on the list not to do so and to recognise that in so doing they are damaging the convergence and cohesion that is <Col N="309" /> necessary to achieve our shared objective as set out in the treaty.</P>

      <P>In company with a number of colleagues I expressed my concern in Majorca at the resumption of nuclear testing in the south Pacific by France.  I underlined my view that this action made rational and calm discussion of the security options in Europe extremely difficult.  Ireland does not subscribe to a security policy based on nuclear deterrence and our view of recent suggestions by France about adjusting the scope of and access to its nuclear deterrent should be understood in that light.</P>
      <P>As I indicated when reporting on my meetings in Majorca with Prime Minister Major, I raised with the British Prime Minister the strong concern in Ireland at the presence of nuclear power stations on the west coast of the United Kingdom.  I stated that the 1993 incident at Wylfa power station in Wales was a matter of particularly grave concern to the Irish Government.  The Prime Minister undertook to revert back to me on the points which I raised.  In the EU context I raised with the Prime Minister the question of the proposed sale and 100 per cent disposal of Irish Steel to Ispat International and, in light of the forthcoming discussions on this issue at the Industry Council in November, I asked the British Prime Minister to support the Irish Government's proposals in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was an informal and useful meeting. I compliment Prime Minister Gonzalez on the way in which he chaired the meeting because he did so extremely well.  All the participants would agree with me in saying that they did not <Col N="310" /> recognise the headlines in the newspapers the following day which indicated that the meeting was a high noon type situation where many strong views were expressed and people appeared to be in conflict with each other.  On the contrary, the atmosphere was quite different.  People certainly expressed their concerns freely.  However, theirs and contrary views were heard with respect and the atmosphere was extremely good.  It gave me more confidence in the future of Europe than any other meeting I have attended in recent years in terms of the cohesion that plainly exists at the highest level between the relevant countries.  If our partners consider it useful that Ireland host a similar informal gathering during our Presidency, we will be more than willing and anxious to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The informal European Council meeting in Majorca was supposed to provide a quiet reflection period in the lead up to important decisions at the intergovernmental conference next year.  It highlighted the frailty and the sense of possible crisis looming for the whole European enterprise.  The Taoiseach has stated that the meeting was confidential and private and we cannot expect to know what happened at that meeting but, judging by the comments made to the international media and to our own media who were there, it certainly seemed to be about a crisis looming in Europe.  It highlighted disunity and also real problems on the way ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union does not present a happy picture at the present time.  There are a number of factors involved in that: the profound disagreements about eligibility to participate in economic and monetary union, which were barely papered over; the deep unease about the French Government's unilateral resumption of nuclear testing, without any consultation with its partners; the stalling of the Schengen agreement because of the terrorist attacks in France &mdash; in effect we have long had our own Schengen agreement with Britain; <Col N="311" /> the humiliating impotence of Europe in Bosnia, where the Dutch UN troops felt unable to intervene to prevent the massacre of Muslims; the disharmony between France and Germany, who have provided much of the leadership in the past; a Commission that does not, for the moment, enjoy the extraordinary prestige and authority it had under Mr. Jacques Delors and the continued damaging and corrosive effects of the British Euro sceptics, who have been reflecting on the results of the recent European Parliament elections in Sweden.</P>
    <P>A weakened Europe faces the prospect of further substantial enlargement, which may dilute its cohesions, partly because some existing larger members are finding it difficult to adjust to the new member states and the effect that they have on their influence over the running of the Union.  The challenges are formidable, as the Taoiseach has stated, and a concerted will is needed to overcome them.  I am glad to hear the Taoiseach, who was quite critical and disillusioned after his first meeting, feels more confident.  I know from experience that when officials are left outside the door and statements are put away, one tends to get a more frank exchange of views of where people think they are going, rather than what they say to the media in fixed press conferences.  The statements are usually circulated the day before the meeting or are, at least, outside Ministers' bedroom doors when they get up on the morning of the meeting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is getting used to how it happens.  I see the point that, while people are away, they may at least give directions and give a lead of what they say outside.  The challenges are formidable.  The experience of the currency crisis in 1992-93 should teach us that there is no room for complacency about the road to economic and monetary union.  There is battle on <Col N="312" /> to determine who will be the initial participating countries.</P>
      <P>Debate itself, as we have seen, is capable of having damaging economic effects right now through its impact on currencies and interest rates and not just in a few years time when the actual decisions have to be taken.  The markets will continue to involve themselves in that speculation.  They thrive on that type of business and, no matter what the Taoiseach, I or anyone else says, that is the way it will be.  They will hang on every speech and every little line on a Reuter screen.  When the currency of countries not able to participate suffer from depreciation, higher inflation and lost investment, will countries outside the EU benefit and gain competitive advantage?  Will the markets be able to exploit the doubts and the lack of confidence and vision to wreck the European Monetary Union before it ever gets off the ground as, in effect, they did for a while during the last currency crisis?</P>
      <P>There is a huge uncertainty facing the entire project which needs to be resolved by an objective and impartial approach.  On objective criteria, countries like Italy and Belgium have a huge public debt ranging from 110 to 140 per cent of GDP which shows no sign, so far, of coming down.  Other countries, including France, have public deficits at least 2 per cent above the Maastricht criteria, with the markets sceptical of recent budget proposals.  There has been considerable acrimony between Germany and Italy, in particular, which was effectively written out of the scenario by the German Finance Minister, and less obviously between Germany and France.  We have had our own problems with Germany in the past in this regard with, in many respects, much less cause given our strict observance of the Maastricht criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time, the German Government is under pressure from the opinion of its own public, as European Monetary Union involves giving up the Deutschemark, the symbol of post-war German success and the bond of reunification. This is seen by Germans as the <Col N="313" /> greatest sacrifice of all.  I regard the present uncertainty as deeply worrying for Europe and not just from an Irish perspective.  Of course our future prosperity is bound up with the success of the European Union.  My party continues to hold that view and will continue to hold it regardless, but we have to be careful of the way ahead.  Currency turmoil can be economically damaging, as we know to our cost.</P>
    <P>The problem with European Monetary Union is that we seem likely, at the moment, to be creating a two-tier Europe.  If one studies the statements of various people who are in the know, one will see that they continually advert to this position.  I try to stop myself from stating this, but the fact of saying we hope to be a country going forward in the first round is, in itself, an acknowledgment that everyone will not be in the first round.  This is used by the markets unfairly to say who will be in or out.  Everyone, including Finance Ministers, uses that phrase.  It is then seen at all times that we are talking about a first tier and second tier, or a two-speed &mdash; which is more damaging &mdash; Europe. This is potentially divisive unless certain countries succeed in improving their economic performance, which, by far, would be the best solution.  A closeness of the economies will get over the problem better than anything anyone can say.  If the economies genuinely harmonise, there will not be a problem about European Monetary Union.  The problem arises when the economies are separated and there are huge divergencies between their level of debt.</P>
    <P>We have had a good financial record to date since we turned the corner in 1987.  Next year's budget has to be credible and must live within this Government's self-imposed parameters.  This will involve Ministers making hard choices and accepting, in effect, a pause in real terms in the growth of public expenditure and maybe even some cutbacks. It will be interesting to see if the Government will have the political will to do what it has promised.  It failed its first test this year.  It must succeed in <Col N="314" /> 1996 and this will require clear leadership from the Taoiseach.  No Finance Minister can achieve it on his own.  The drop in Ireland's position in the world competitiveness league from ninth to 22nd in three years shows that the outside world is watching critically.  There has already been some loss of confidence and there will be costly penalties attached to a failure to improve our performance and the competitiveness of our tax system.</P>
    <P>The great unknown quantity in our situation is whether, perhaps under a new Government, Britain will decide to participate in European Monetary Union.  This is a live debate on every financial programme in the UK.  If it does our position should be relatively easy, provided our public finances are kept on the rails.  If it does not there could be serious costs attached both to going into European Monetary Union without Britain or staying out of European Monetary Union with Britain.  We are committed in principle to European Monetary Union participation by the Maastricht Treaty.  I am glad to hear the Taoiseach state there is no intent by member states to start rewriting the Maastricht Treaty and no intent to do that at the intergovernmental conference. That was a fear earlier in the year.  We must ensure that our economy is in tiptop competitive condition by 1999 so that we can make the final decision about European Monetary Union from a position of strength.  As our participation in the EMS showed, we are not automatically dependent on what Britain does or what decision Britain takes, but we would nevertheless have to take the possible economic consequences of joining without Britain seriously into account, just as France would if it were to join without Spain and Italy.  I am glad that our European partners now recognise that this is a problem with European dimensions and not just one peculiar to Britain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>I will raise parliamentary questions on this issue later in this session and maybe the Taoiseach will take action on <Col N="315" /> it.  However, I still believe we should be undertaking a fundamental examination of the options because, if we do not do that, we will run out of time on the issue.  That work must be undertaken, but whether it is done internally by the Government &mdash; and the Taoiseach knows my view on that &mdash; the Government would need outside consultants to see what are the policy options.  Even if it was done confidentially, I would be happy to see it.</P>
    <P>It is argued outside the House that a White Paper should be prepared to address the issues associated with European Monetary Union &mdash; such as how it will affect our banking system and our vulnerable exporters.  These issues should be addressed but this has not been done.  Some European groupings and people in the academic world have done excellent work but this is not a substitute for a fundamental examination of the consequences of European Monetary Union, a single currency and the states which will and will not be part of such a currency.  We should undertake such an examination.  The Taoiseach knows from talking to his EU colleagues last week that several countries have done so or are in the process of doing so.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the next round of Structural and Cohesion Funds should have as one of its objectives the underpinning of European Monetary Union, both with regard to countries which are able to join and those which are not. The long term benefits of a strong and stable single European currency are potentially huge.  A small country like Ireland should particularly benefit provided the common currency does not render us totally uncompetitive <i>vis-á-vis</i> our immediate neighbours.  These factors cannot be conclusively assessed but they need to be closely monitored.</P>
    <P>There is a worrying tendency for large member states to try to lay down the law for smaller ones.  Perhaps this is a symptom of the fusion of big countries' power and influence in a further <Col N="316" /> enlarged Union.  In my view, interpretation of the treaties and the obligations they place on member states is much better left to the European Commission, the European Council and the European Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>The French unilateral decision to resume nuclear testing in the Pacific sits ill with aspirations for a common foreign and security policy.  Most member states do not want to turn the EU into a nuclear superpower which would fundamentally alter its character.  Nuclear weapons are absolutely irrelevant to the resolution of the vast majority of conflicts likely to arise, if not all.  They would, for example, be no solution to the problems in Bosnia.  The type of impotence which consists of standing by while massacres are carried out within earshot does no credit to Europe. Peace-keeping troops must be mandated to prevent such massacres.</P>
    <P>My party is willing to support more active participation by Ireland in European peace-keeping efforts on a flexible case by case basis without entering into existing formal alliances based on cold war doctrines of nuclear deterrence to which we do not subscribe.  At the Rome European Council in 1990 and in Article J.4 of the Maastricht Treaty, Ireland effectively negotiated an opt out clause from NATO and the Western European Union and protection for its continued policy of military neutrality with regard to existing alliances.  Article J.4.4 of the Maastricht Treaty states that &ldquo;The policy of the Union...shall not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of certain Member States...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We do not accept the linkage which members of the Christian Democratic Union Party in Germany try to create between our participation in European Monetary Union and participation in a military alliance.  Austria will certainly participate in European Monetary Union but it will not be told by Germany to give up its military neutrality. Full Western European Union membership is not one of the Maastricht criteria. We have suffered too long from opinion <Col N="317" /> makers in this country who have been unnecessarily ready to sacrifice our ideals to our interests.  Fianna Fáil is more tough-minded in its approach, ready to make a constructive and developing contribution to security consistent with our traditions and ideals and not based on a wholesale abandonment of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I detect no similar clarity and consistency on the Government benches.  The Minister for State at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for European affairs has advocated full Western European Union membership, the Tánaiste is flirting with the ideal of membership of the NATO associated Partnership for Peace but he is frightened of exposing his political flank and the position of Democratic Left fluctuates between a shadowy adherence to former principles and a kick over the traces style of pragmatism. Perhaps the long delayed White Paper will provide enlightenment about where the Government stands collectively on this.</P>
      <P>A great deal of nonsense is spoken by larger countries about not all member states being able to appoint EU commissioners. Most of the larger countries at present appoint two commissioners and have not suggested giving up one. Most European cabinets, such as the French Government, consist of about 25 or 26 members.  The membership of the present European Commission &mdash; there are 19 commissioners &mdash; is way below this.  If the EU is to retain democratic legitimacy, each member state must be directly represented at Commission level.  The President of the Commission is from the smallest country.  Ireland is the next smallest member and our last three commissioners, Mr. Peter Sutherland, Mr. Ray MacSharry, and Mr. Pádraig Flynn, have made an outstanding and disproportionate contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>European Union is about solidarity, cohesion and integration between the nation states of Europe.  While political <Col N="318" /> leadership is needed &mdash; we should be grateful for many of the Franco-German initiatives of the past &mdash; Europe will not work on the basis of formalised big power directorates while the rights of some nations are less equal than others.  These are clear messages which must be conveyed at all levels.</P>
    <P>The EU seems to be going through a worrying phase.  The Commission has not settled down to the high levels it had over the last few years.  It has ambitious plans which would put European vision, solidarity and determination to the test. We all look forward to the Irish Presidency and the constructive part we have always played when we held the Presidency in developing the way forward. The intergovernmental conference which will, in part, be handled by the Irish Presidency, will make sure we can constructively keep the agenda moving forward.  The European Council informal meeting in Majorca raised more questions than it answered.  Ireland must look after more than its narrow interests and we all accept this.  It must contribute to finding European solutions which will take account of different situations and interests.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach briefly mentioned the initiative on coastal security with regard to drugs; perhaps he will expand on it in his reply.  Many countries share our position on this issue.  Without informing us of what happened at confidential meetings, will the Taoiseach tell us whether there is only talk about this matter and if countries are still avoiding making decisions?  The decision to be made, which has been discussed for about three years at meetings of ECOFIN and meetings dealing with security, is whether Europe will provide funds on a centralised basis for countries in peripheral locations where there have been major drugs finds.  I accept this was an issue when Fianna Fáil was in power.  If Europe is serious about crime, drugs and co-operation in an area where this can easily take place, it should bring this matter to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>We look forward to the summit later <Col N="319" /> in the year and we hope that the confidence with regard to some of the issues held in private by the Taoiseach will become public at that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>When we debate European issues which are of importance to this country we tend to concentrate on neutrality, how much money we might receive from the EU and the institutional arrangements which need to be made, particularly whether we have a commissioner.  Important as these matters are, I do not believe that, for the foreseeable future, they are the fundamental issues as far as this country and the EU are concerned.</P>
      <P>On the last occasion we had a debate of this kind I stated that there is an urgent need to streamline the decision making procedures of the Union.  I say this as somebody who attended Environment Council meetings for nearly three years.  I found these procedures extremely frustrating and disillusioning and I often thought that if the citizens of Europe could see how Ministers made decisions they would despair.  Council meetings always began around 9 a.m. but it was frequently midnight or later before decisions were made.  Although it was clear in the mornings what the decisions would be, the level of bureaucracy and the lack of clear procedures made it impossible for them to be made in a reasonable fashion.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach with regard to institutional change.  However, I will not concentrate on these matters but on European Monetary Union, enlargement and nuclear power.  I also wish to speak about Northern Ireland, which the Taoiseach did not mention but which was discussed at important meetings on the margins of the informal Council in Majorca.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are proceeding apace to join European Monetary Union.  Any briefings I read from Government sources, usually non-attributable, seem to suggest that Ireland is going to join regardless of what the British do.  While the Taoiseach did not say that this morning, <Col N="320" /> he did say that we would be eligible to join and I support that.  We should meet the Maastricht criteria not necessarily because we wish to join an economic and monetary union but because it would be good for industry and the economy generally.</P>
    <P>It is unrealistic for us to proceed down the road to European Monetary Union when there has been insufficient public debate on it.  This economy is not ready for European Monetary Union. We have not analysed the implications or even looked at the terms on which we might join.  The Government should put forward a paper outlining these factors.</P>
    <P>Our biggest trading partner is the United Kingdom, although official statistics under-estimate the extent of our trade particularly as it affects the labour intensive, indigenous manufacturing sector.  If this country joined the European Monetary Union and Britain stayed out it would have enormous implications for employment and would be catastrophic for the economy.  The UK is an important market for our exports.  On our domestic market virtually any product that is transportable can easily be brought here and, in addition, our industry must compete with the UK.</P>
    <P>The UK is also our biggest source of tourist revenue and invisible exports.  In third markets since Irish industry frequently has to compete with the United Kingdom, the value of the Irish pound <i>vis-á-vis</i> sterling is a key determinant in how we perform as a trading nation.  It is unrealistic for anybody to suggest that we can go on regardless of what the United Kingdom does.  If we join a currency union we may force industry to compete with a devalued sterling. Unlike 1993 when we had the option to follow sterling downwards, we will not have that option if we belong to a currency union.</P>
    <P>Besides the trade implications there are also major implications for the creation on this island of a single economy which is the wish of many Members as well as many industrialists <Col N="321" /> and business people.  If Northern Ireland belongs to a free floating currency and we belong to a currency union where decisions will be made in Frankfurt and Brussels, it will not be possible to create a single island economy here.  For that reason alone it would copperfasten partition.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons the Government should set out the options.  If we join a union as I envisage it at the moment, it will probably be a German monetary union.  The Taoiseach does not like us to refer to this but I will mention it anyway because we can see that the German Finance Minister has questioned the ability of Italy to participate in the European Monetary Union.  A member of the Bundesbank's council has questioned France's capacity to participate.</P>
    <P>Are we realistically saying that Ireland and a few other hard currencies will join in what essentially will be a German monetary union?  Remember the Germans' commitment to low inflation.  They will preserve the Euro-currency with the same integrity as they preserve the Deutschemark.  They will force participating countries to have a budget deficit of about 1 per cent of GDP.  No Irish Government in a generation has been able to come near that. This year it will be 2.5 per cent and that is when we take into account the £2.4 billion coming from the European Union.</P>
    <P>Looking at the Government's present policies, does anybody in this House suggest that we might realistically achieve that kind of budget deficit?  Of course we will not.  If we look at the unseemly row going on between the Minister for Finance and some of the high spending ministries, we can see just how difficult that might be.  Over the last 15 years our national debt has grown by £22 billion.  During that period, Labour has added £1 billion to the national debt every time they have been in Government.  Are we seriously suggesting that the Labour Party and a Labour Finance Minister, with that record, will be able to join the German <Col N="322" /> school of fiscal discipline?  I do not believe we are.</P>
    <P>On the issue of enlargement, I am impressed with how fast the former communist countries are liberalising their economies.  For example, Hungary's privatisation authority is currently asking a London based bank to privatise their country's entire electricity generation and distribution system.  They have broken the company up into 13 subsidiaries.  Such economies are loosely regulated with low labour costs, and Ireland will have to compete with them whether we like it or not.</P>
    <P>The former communist countries are also major food producers so that part of the EU budget which currently goes to agricultural support will have to be much more thinly spread.  Ireland will not receive anything like the £2.4 billion that we will get from the European Union this year.  We have four years before that kind of money runs out so we need to start using it very wisely indeed.</P>
    <P>That Euro money should not go towards current spending, it must go towards once-off projects to boost our competitiveness for the development of sustainable infrastructure.  I feel strongly about that but it is not happening.  A little is being spent here and there on ongoing financial commitments which is very unrealistic.</P>
    <P>We must address the issues and consequences for this economy, and for the EU, of enlargement and of the European Monetary Union.  I am not a Euro sceptic.  I like to think that I am a Euro realist having formerly been a Euro enthusiast as were most Members of this House.  It is time for a bit of Euro realism.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach raised the problems of the Wylfa nuclear plant with the British Prime Minister.  For many years most Members of this House have been calling for the closure of Sellafield. However, no matter how often we call for it to be closed, we all know in our hearts that it will not happen because 10,000 people work there and it creates <Col N="323" /> millions of pounds for the British economy.</P>
    <P>We should seek the establishment at international level &mdash; perhaps in the first instance at European level &mdash; of an appropriate nuclear agency with powers of inspection.  The International Atomic Energy Agency only has such powers when the sovereign government involved invites them.  Of course, that is an inadequate inspection system.</P>
    <P>The Irish Sea is the world's busiest sea lane for submarines carrying nuclear weapons.  This country has a huge vested interest in ensuring the creation of an international nuclear inspection agency because we know that Chernobyl and other places well outside the EU have the capacity to affect us just as much as nuclear plants closer to home.</P>
    <P>The idea of an agency with powers to inspect and set down safety standards should be on the agenda for Ireland's EU Presidency.  It should be an agency that can inspect when it wishes, as well as ensuring that the concerns of member states affected by these nuclear plants are taken on board.  The creation of such an agency needs to be high on our agenda since our two nearest neighbours, France and Britain, are not just military nuclear powers but also use nuclear power to generate a substantial amount of their electricity.</P>
    <P>When I was in Opposition with the present Taoiseach and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, there was never an occasion when I disagreed with their approach on Northern Ireland, and I do not say that lightly.  It is a subject about which many of us in this House have deep concern and a huge interest.  However, the emphasis placed on Northern Ireland by the Taoiseach and that Minister seems to be very different from the emphasis put on the matter by the Tánaiste.  When it comes to the North we must all choose our words carefully.  I read what the Taoiseach said at Dublin Castle on 8 September and what the Tánaiste said to the British-Irish Association the following day.  You do not need to be a <Col N="324" /> genius to see that there is a different emphasis and approach in what they said.</P>
    <P>I support the Taoiseach when he rightly says that the two Governments may well, and could, move on without Sinn Féin.  I was delighted to see that that was the Government's approach because I was beginning to get worried. In a very forthright interview in <i>The Sunday Times</i> last week it was clear where the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, stood.  However, the comments by the Tánaiste in relation to preconditions and so on are unhelpful.  Talking about decommissioning as being unpractical and unrealistic does not make a worthwhile contribution to the current debate.</P>
    <P>The Downing Street Declaration is clear.  In paragraph 10 the two Governments reiterate that the achievement of peace must involve a permanent end to the use of or support for paramilitary violence.  They continue to say that it is only on that basis that people can take part in talks.  Threatening violence is not compatible with paragraph 10 of the Downing Street Declaration.  We must make it clear that anyone who threatens violence if the two Governments establish an international commission to look at the question of decommissioning is not living by the terms of paragraph 10 of the Downing Street Declaration as negotiated between the two Governments. I continue to ask the Taoiseach questions in the House because the public is entitled to know where the different parties stand on the fundamental questions which affect us in relation to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Giving up arms should not be done for the sake of the British Government because it does not matter what the British Government thinks.  Arms in the hands of the paramilitaries were used to kill fellow Irish people and it is for them that they should give them up if they are committed to peace and democratic principles.  Every right thinking person knows that keeping Semtex and armaments of that kind is not compatible <Col N="325" /> with a commitment to peace and democratic politics.</P>
    <P>It may be the case that talks will begin without all the parties being there.  That would be regrettable but it may be necessary.  What is important is that the Governments create the environment or the circumstances where it would be foolish for parties to stay away, where it would be clear that they are staying away and where it would be unreasonable for them to stay away because the environment is right for them to participate. I believe that the overwhelming majority of people in the North and South would support both Governments moving ahead in that context.  I hope that is the context on which the Government moves ahead.</P>
    <P>We listen too much to the words of Sinn Féin.  The Church of Ireland's submission to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation was forthright and direct. It lodged its strong objection to the use of the Constitution to deal with any social legislation.  However, the Government proceeds to ignore it.  If Sinn Féin had made such a declaration, it would not have been ignored.  It angers me and many other people that legitimate groups can be ignored in the Government's approach on certain issues but that we go out of our way sometimes to take on board those whose <i>raison d'être</i> I must question when I hear what went on behind the scenes during the last summit.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to make the problem more difficult for the Government because I know how difficult it is and I will give as much support as is necessary. However, I want the Government to speak with one voice on this matter because if it does not, it will send the wrong signals and cause confusion and uncertainty which will create more difficulties for it.</P>
    <P>I hope we have an early summit between the two Governments and that they will be able to be at one on decommissioning. It is not the only issue but, as the Taoiseach said, it is a key issue if we are to build trust between the two communities.  After 25 years of violence <Col N="326" /> one cannot expect democratic politicians to sit down with others who have armaments, such as Semtex, around the corner or down the road.  No democrat could be expected to take part in talks in that context.  We all need to see a gesture from the paramilitaries on both sides and I made that clear to the party I met last week.  We want to see movement on both sides and we do not want a chicken and egg situation where one will not move unless the other does.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The list of problems mentioned by Deputy Bertie Ahern which the European Union faces is an accurate one, but the consensus at the meeting I attended for two days was to overcome these problems.  Europe or anywhere else has not reached the end of politics.  As long as there are problems, there will be a need for politicians. There is no situation in Europe which will not need politicians to fix things. There will always be problems but we should not speak about Europe in terms of crisis, despair or alarm because there is every reason to believe that these problems will be overcome as were previous ones.  It requires restraint in the use of language about the eligibility of other currencies.</P>
      <P>The same consideration also applies to the matter to which Deputy Harney referred in the latter part of her speech. The peace process on this island also requires restraint in the use of language. Talking about crises and using the language of alarm may give some form of reassurance to one's own supporters, just as the remarks of Theo Waigel, Germany's Finance Minister, gave solid reassurance to the Bundesbank committee he was addressing.  However, it does not help to solve the problem; it creates problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I offer the same advice about the use of language to Theo Waigel as I offered to Mr. Gerry Adams &mdash; cool it.  If we want political <Col N="327" /> solutions we should not use the language of confrontation.</P>
      <P>It is important to understand republican concerns about the peace process. They are worried that it might be suggested that they are involved in a form of surrender.  That is not what is being asked.  They are being asked to meet the requirements of the Downing Street Declaration and to give trust and assurance to others.</P>
      <P>It is equally important to understand the concerns, for example, of the German people about the Deutschemark.  It is important to point out that the Deutschemark existed before the Federal Republic; it is older than the state. It is the symbol, more so than the Federal Republic's constitution, of what post-Germany is.  It is not easy, therefore, for them to give it up, which is why they want strong assurances and I hope they get them.</P>
      <P>I was interested in Deputy Ahern's characterisation of his party as dewyeyed idealists on the matter of European defence &mdash; the only people who are willing to protect the holy grail of sanctified national views on this matter. Fianna Fáil was more realistic about such issues when it was on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>Politics is a matter of give and take; one cannot take without giving.  We should look at all the problems we face, including our personal, physical and political security in Europe as part of the process of give and take.  While we must preserve our ideas, we must recognise that it is in concert with others, not in isolation, that we have the best opportunity of fulfilling our ideas.  The agenda in Europe is not an <i>a la carte</i> agenda, but a <i>table d'hôte</i> one.  We can negotiate the composition of the menu.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the concept of opt outs in Europe is wrong.  It is important to negotiate a collective agreement and if it means that all we or others can get is 50 per cent of what we <Col N="328" /> want, that is what we should aim for. The Maastricht Treaty was structurally unsound in the opt outs it granted to individual member states on social policy. If we must temper our ambitions to ensure that everybody comes with us, that is what we should do because it would be an aberration in European constitution making if we were to have a culture of opt outs in the future.</P>
      <P>I said in Majorca that I believe the social policy opt out by Britain was wrong and corrosive.  I do not believe that course should be followed in future and I hope it will not be sought by Ireland in other areas of activity in the Union.  We should seek to build as much as we can together.  If we cannot reach the desired level, we should be satisfied with what we can reach together.  Let us not place any member state in a position where it feels the need to opt out.  This is also the approach we should apply to the peace process on this island.</P>
      <P>We should understand the reservations some people have about coming to the table and we should seek to meet them.  We should not characterise the decommissioning of arms as a problem for one Government.  The problem is people trusting one another.  It is a problem for people who have lost limbs and the families of those who have died. They are not yet willing to trust that the arms which injured them will not be used again.  The problem is to find a formula &mdash; everybody's ideas on this are welcome &mdash; to give those families the reassurance they need to allow their political representatives to sit in the same room with the political representatives of those associated with the people who did them an injury.  It is not a problem of Government or preconditions; it is a practical problem of trust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask any Member who has doubts about this matter to put themselves in that position.  If Deputy Brennan's brother or sister had been injured by a paramilitary organisation, would he be keen to see Fianna Fáil sit down with representatives of that organisation without some assurance that the arms were not going to be used again?  Of <Col N="329" /> course he would not but it would be legitimate for him to seek such a reassurance.  If that applies to Deputy Brennan, Deputy Harney or myself, it equally applies to nationalists in Northern Ireland who have been injured by loyalist arms and to unionists in Northern Ireland who have been injured by republican arms.  Together the two Governments are seeking to wrestle with and solve the problem of reassurance and trust.</P>
    <P>Let us put this in its true context and let us not, as we so often do in this country, seek to project our problem on to somebody else's shoulders and say it is their problem.  This is our problem more than anyone else's.  I urge Members to reread the Downing Street Declaration which was negotiated by my predecessor, Deputy Reynolds, and towards whom I have been frequently generous in my praise.  I ask them to look at paragraph 6 of that document which imposes, not on the British Government but on this Government or any of its successors, an obligation to build trust between the two communities in Northern Ireland.  That requires us to do many things in this State to make people happy about dealing with us.  It also means that the question of arms, while not the main problem, is one of the problems that most certainly must be dealt with if we are to achieve trust. Without trust, we have no settlement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I said last night, somewhat in jest, that divorce would not be introduced in this country because no Irish person wants to pay two ESB bills. My point was that many people would look at divorce in economic terms.  It is not necessarily a church issue.  I believe that social and constitutional arguments <Col N="331" /> will gain much credence over the next two weeks.</P>
      <P>I have been a public representative for ten years.  In all that time I was never canvassed by a single person for the introduction of divorce.  I have witnessed marital breakdown but even then those involved never thought of asking me my views on the right to remarry.  There is a view that the Government is attempting to hand down divorce from on high to the people even though there does not seem to be a grassroots majority opinion demanding it.  The perception is that divorce is only being promoted by the politicians.  The real issues, as communicated to me by my constituents, are unemployment, crime, drugs and, more recently, the peace process.  Nevertheless, for whatever reason, divorce is now on the agenda and we have to deal with it.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to clarify his proposal to spend £500,000 of public money on an information campaign.  Ministers seem confused on this matter and the electorate have a right to know the position. At this stage it seems that an unspecified amount of money will be spent on the national distribution of a leaflet and another unspecified amount will be used to pay an advertising agency selected by the Government to undertake a national advertising campaign advocating a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.  I respectfully suggest that the use of taxpayers' money to persuade the electorate to vote a particular way in a constitutional referendum is an abuse.  The Government is attempting to bribe the electorate with its own money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishment of fair referenda procedures should be a priority for the Oireachtas.  It is beyond belief that the Government believes an advertising campaign can be regarded as information.  There can be no neutral presentation of information when it comes to divorce.  The Government is underestimating the strength of feeling on this issue and, even at this late stage, I call on the Government to abandon its plans for this expenditure or, alternatively, fund both sides of the campaign equally.  The referendum should be seen to be free, fair and balanced.</P>
      <P>My greatest concern in this debate is the welfare of children.  All statistical, sociological and psychological evidence suggests that children whose parents separate and go on to divorce are socially, economically, psychologically, educationally and even physically damaged by the experience.  Their self esteem and self confidence are badly affected.  In an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 30 April 1994, Professor Anthony Clare stated that all the evidence now suggests that generally children are far better off when their parents stay together, however unhappily, than when families are splintered by divorce.  He went on to say that modern society should insist that couples who have children should be compelled to stay together for at least the first 16 years of the children's lives.  It is suggested that the State should not get involved in individual choices when people decide to marry, separate or divorce. This view has much merit in today's society.  However, when there are children involved I fully agree with Professor Clare that the State has an obligation to intervene.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="333" /> When children are involved, divorce is not just a private choice.  I know many married couples who have chosen to stay together for the sake of the children, even when the marriage was not ideal.  This should be encouraged by the State.  Unfortunately, we do not live in an ideal world.  I accept that children should not be forced to stay in a marriage where there is physical violence. However, these cases are in the minority and can be dealt with by separation or through the health boards.  The welfare of parents is not the concern of the State but the welfare of children should be its priority.  Irish people might support some form of limited divorce but I regret that the current Government proposals to amend the Constitution do not adequately deal with the welfare of children.</P>
    <P>I hope there will be a meaningful debate in the Dáil on this Bill in which all sides of the argument will be articulated. I also hope that, in the interests of democracy, there will be a vote on this Bill.  I will be voting Tá to facilitate the holding of the referendum.  The issue will then be decided by the people.</P>

      <P>It is my view that the all party consensus in the Dáil, the spending of £500,000 on a partisan information campaign and concern for the integrity of the Constitution will militate against a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote.

I also said last night and I reiterate here again today that using dramatic language such as <Col N="334" />&ldquo;drastic&rdquo;, &ldquo;disastrous&rdquo; and &ldquo;devastating&rdquo; does not help the arguments or help people make an informed choice.

      <P>Deputy Haughey says that he is opposed to divorce and he quotes Professor Anthony Clare in support of his position.  I happen to know and believe that Professor Clare's position is not quite as black and white as the quotations, which Deputy Haughey read, imply.</P>
      <P>Leaving that aside for the moment, Deputy Haughey's argument is that divorce would damage children and that people should be obliged to stay together in the interest of the children yet he goes on to say that some marriages will inevitably break down and that people should be enabled to separate &mdash; and we provide for separation.  I want Deputy Haughey at some stage, either in this House or outside, to kindly explain the difference between separation and divorce.</P>

      <P>That can and is occurring in a separation.  We have thousands of cohabiting couples who were formerly married to other people and had children with their spouses and who subsequently have further children in their cohabiting situation.  There is an important issue to debate here because the Deputy has got to the crux of this issue, that is, the difference between separation and divorce.  That is a key point.  We need to sit down in a calm atmosphere and debate the detail of that.</P>
      <P>Divorce is nothing new in Irish society.  A cursory glance at Irish history, from Brian Boru through to Parnell, shows that.  The break with historical continuity in recognising marriage breakdown as a fact of Irish life was the 1937 Constitution.  That strange product of its time locks together an excellent set of protections on fundamental rights with a misty-eyed vision of society in which women knew their place in relation to men and men knew their place in relation to the real power of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the first four decades of its existence, independent Ireland largely dealt with its social problems &mdash; poverty, inequality and restricted access to health and education &mdash; by ignoring them.  In a society ruled by such a mind set, it is not surprising that there was no honesty in how we dealt with family conflict and marriage.  Long before we coined the term &ldquo;deserted wife&rdquo;, we had the problem of wives and children <Col N="337" /> living in Ireland, husbands living in England, whereabouts known or not known, with maintenance paid to the family regularly, irregularly or not at all. For many families, the absence of a father in England meant heartache.  For some it meant relief from a violent, drunken presence.  For some, the absence was known to be temporary and born of economic necessity; for others, absence for apparently economic reasons was a convenient and socially acceptable cloak for concealing a broken marriage.</P>
    <P>The reality is inescapable.  <i>De facto</i> separation has existed since the foundation of the State, despite the directive counselling of the 1937 Constitution.  It was a very cruel kind of separation, one which merely reinforced the poverty and lack of rights of the women and children involved.  I pose the questions: is it better to deal with a problem by trying to keep the lid on it or by trying to tackle it?  Is it better to deal with domestic violence by ignoring it or by giving women access to barring orders? Is it better to deal with cases of child sexual abuse by relocating the perpetrators than prosecuting them?</P>
    <P>Over the past few years, we in Ireland have had a painful coming to terms with the realities that underlie both our secular and religious pieties, but we still have to go the distance in how we deal realistically with marriage breakdown. Yes, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, has sorted out the critical questions of division of assets, custody of children and maintenance of dependent spouses and children when couples separate.  That sacred cow of the previous divorce referendum, the family farm, is considered by the court as one among other assets when it makes its decision in judicial separation, and still the sky has not fallen which suggests that the courts are making sensible pragmatic decisions for farming families, who are no more immune from marriage breakdown than any other occupational group.</P>
    <P>Even with the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, the <Col N="338" /> women and men involved are left in a legal limbo.  Let us not forget also that many of the more amicable separations take place not on foot of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, but in the context of separation agreements.  What becomes of you when separated?  Of course, you have the right to form a second relationship if that is your choice but you do not, as of now, have the right to legitimise this relationship in society.  This is not just a matter of legal recognition, although that is important in itself; it has material consequences for tax and inheritance treatment as well as the self esteem and social recognition for relationships which is very important to many people too.</P>
    <P>The anti-divorce lobby would have us preserve Ireland as a divorce free zone, a kind of traditional values theme park but theme parks are by nature places of fantasy; nice to visit but not to live in.  It is not as if we have been able to proof society in this country against divorce. Take a very typical Irish situation.  A couple separate and the husband goes to England to live and work there.  He divorces, remarries and eventually resettles in Ireland.  Meanwhile his first wife remains in Ireland and &mdash; ironically &mdash; the divorce is recognised here.  She is free to remarry if she chooses.  Let us say she does not so choose.  According to English law, recognised here in those circumstances, she is no longer his wife and has no longer an entitlement to derived pension rights based on his social insurance.</P>
    <P>How would the introduction of divorce in this country worsen the situation of that not untypical woman?  Members might assume that there would be no change in her circumstances.  In fact they would be wrong, because the Government, in preparing for a reasoned consideration of the divorce issue, has recognised that dependent spouses and children must be protected and provided for in the determination of the divorce judgment.</P>
    <P>For the poorest people, those living on social welfare, we have, through the <Col N="339" /> Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1995, ensured that the provisions of the social welfare code will apply equally to those in need, whether their status is deserted, separated or divorced.  Simply put, an individual will not lose out on their social welfare entitlements &mdash; such as deserted wife's payments, widow's pension, etc. &mdash; just because they divorce. The fact that a former, as well as a current spouse, could qualify for a contributory widow's or old age pension has been mocked as a form of social welfare polygamy.  The concept of secure provision is not mocked, I can assure Members, by the vulnerable people, mostly women, who will benefit from it.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks the anti-divorce lobby has predictably tried to scaremonger about the costs of divorce.  Wild, untrue claims have been made that divorce will result in an additional social welfare bill costing hundreds of millions of pounds.  There has also been a rather more subtle effort to associate the costs arising from the introduction of divorce with the estimated cost of completely eliminating poverty from Irish society, as though they were one and the same thing.  My own views, as to the adequacy or otherwise of all social welfare payments, have been torn out of context in an attempt to equate the cost of eliminating poverty with the cost of providing social welfare guarantees for divorced people.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat clearly that the estimated cost of implementing the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1995, which guarantees social welfare entitlements for divorced people, based on 1991 figures, will reach £1 million in the fifth year of implementation and £2 million in the tenth year.  Members might ask why the figure seems so low.  The answer is that the Department of Social Welfare has been supporting families and dealing, for many years, with the reality of marriage breakdown.  The reality is that this State supports families to the tune of 30 per cent of the £4,000 million we are spending this year.  These <Col N="340" /> are families of all types: settled, unmarried and separated.  We already have marriage breakdown and we are dealing with its consequences.  People's real needs, rather than their legal status, determine social welfare support.</P>
    <P>With regard to the conditions for divorce, I believe we have struck the right balance between ensuring that reasonable grounds are established and avoiding the risk of treating it as a mere formality. I am particularly satisfied that we settled on the term &ldquo;living apart&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;separation&rdquo; as the precedents generally suggest that the courts will understand that a couple can and do live apart under the same roof.  It would be reprehensible if there was a <i>de facto</i> means test to secure a divorce.  I am also pleased that the four out of five year formula will not penalise a couple who attempt reconciliation.</P>
    <P>During her contribution yesterday, Deputy Keogh stated that she felt it inappropriate to insert these conditions into the Constitution and likened the process to using an articulated truck to deliver a letter.  I believe that if there is no other way to deliver the letter, it should be delivered by an articulated truck.</P>
    <P>There has been a degree of speculation as to the likely divorce rate in Ireland.  We simply do not know what it might be.  Common sense suggests it would be closer to the rate in southern European countries, such as Italy and Portugal, than the British or US rate. The relatively low rate of divorce in Northern Ireland also seems a good indicator.  However, whatever the rate of divorce, it will simply be a reflection of the rate of marriage breakdown with which we deal now and will have to deal with in the future.  The question of what the rate might be is, to a significant extent, of little importance.  It will simply reflect marriage breakdown and nothing else.  The Government is not dealing with the issue of divorce in isolation. There has been a great deal of progress on family law issues generally and on such matters as addressing the <Col N="341" /> causes and consequences of violence against women.</P>
    <P>We live in a society which is engaged in rapid transition.  The kind of social changes we have witnessed over the past 20 years took place in most western European societies over an earlier, but similar, period of time.  Fewer people are marrying.  Those who marry do so at a later age and the birth rate outside marriage stands at 20 per cent and shows no signs of levelling off.  The only parallels in Europe for the dramatic nature of these changes are Spain and Portugal when those countries emerged from dictatorship.  Perhaps we are finally emerging from a dictatorship of the spirit ourselves.</P>
    <P>I realise that the rapidity and scale of these societal changes have left some people perplexed and worried but, once again, the answer is not to ignore them but to try to come to terms with them. They are after all a reflection of the free choices being made by a free people. The fact that we are no longer a monolithic society has been recognised in some areas of Government policy &mdash; for example, the social welfare code and family law &mdash; more than others but it is clear that we need to re-examine our approach to families in the changed and changing socio-economic context with a view to developing an integrated policy which would facilitate all families, marital and non-marital, in carrying out their very important functions of supporting and developing their individual members and looking after the particular needs of children and the elderly.</P>
    <P>To that end the Government is setting up a commission on the family which will analyse those socio-economic needs and priorities and bring forward recommendations as to how those needs and priorities should be addressed.  My intention is to set up that commission with effect from next week.</P>
    <P>The most dishonest argument made by the anti-divorce lobby is that support for the principle of divorce can somehow be equated with being anti-child. Nothing could be further from the truth. Over the past ten years the whole thrust <Col N="342" /> of family law and social welfare policy has been to protect the most vulnerable people in our society, children and dependent spouses.  While it is incontestable that children are often victims in cases of marriage breakdown, just as they are victims of marriages in conflict and victims of poverty and domestic violence, the causes of each marriage breakdown are complex and incremental. It is a complete distortion to imply that all marriage breakdown is due to the fecklessness of both parties and it is unfair and unhelpful to try and load men and women caught in situations of breakdown with guilt as if they had failed their children.  I am convinced that before breakdown takes place most of the people concerned have worked hard at maintaining their marriage for the sake of their children, as well as for their own sakes.</P>
    <P>That said, I think we have to recognise clearly that children do have rights and needs in the context of marriage breakdown.  It is very important that the courts in their consideration of each divorce application, should have regard to the well-being and rights of any children involved.  That is why that particular need is incorporated in the constitutional change we are proposing which adequately deals with the reservation raised by Deputy Haughey regarding the needs of children.  It is obviously easier to say that children's needs must be addressed than to do it.  The desire of most children in cases of marriage breakdown to maintain contact with both parents is not always reciprocated. However, it does seem, from research, to be the case that the less antagonistic the separation and divorce, the less traumatic it is for children concerned. That is a lesson we must all take on board.  In dealing with marriage breakdown we are all &mdash; whether individuals, judges or politicians &mdash; on a learning curve.</P>
    <P>The one clear aspect is that the issue must be addressed with honesty and <Col N="343" /> compassion.  I believe the proposed referendum wording and the parallel Family Law (Divorce) Bill does this and I urge people to vote for them.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the people recognise the painful human dilemma that marriage breakdown is for tens of thousands of people and will exercise their compassion in allowing them to resolve that dilemma by passing this referendum. For, at the end of the day, when we have exhausted all the stony-faced theological nit-picking and all the political debate, this issue is about compassion. It is about recognising that some marriages do break down irrevocably with painful consequences and that the men, women and children caught in those circumstances deserve our understanding and our help.</P>

      <P>The debate over the past few weeks may have polarised views on divorce.  The legislation put in place since the previous referendum should have ensured that the current debate focused on the right to remarry as opposed to the support mechanisms which should be in place for families and the damage to families, etc.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, outlined the history of marriage breakdown.  From contact with their constituents public representatives know the trauma caused to men and women whose marriages have broken down.  The Constitution states that the family is the sole unit upon which society is based and none of us believes that this should be changed.  Rather we want to give people who live in what I would term illegitimate families the right to legitimise their position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the statements on the EU Northern Ireland was referred to.  If any situation demonstrates the need for change and tolerance it is the one in the North.  This Bill asks people to be tolerant, to give people whose marriages have broken down the opportunity to legalise their positions.  The majority of Deputies do not have that problem. <Col N="344" /> Stable marriages are achieved through hard work and a great deal of luck.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey said the electorate might agree to a limited form of divorce. We should not shy away from the fact that we are about to embark on a referendum to introduce divorce.  Neither should we put different terms on it or treat it in a manner in which it should not be treated.  If the referendum is passed, divorce will be introduced.  This will be a fundamental change.  We want to give separated people the right to remarry and we should not shy away from that prospect.  Legislators, courts and solicitors have no say in the decision by people to separate.  Couples separate because of violence, the involvement of another person, etc. and if there is a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum these people will have the right to remarry.</P>
    <P>It would be great if we lived in a perfect world where families stayed together, people were happy and there was no need for legislation, law enforcement or any of the other measures required for a stable society.  However, we do not and the world is as imperfect as the individuals who live in it.  We must legislate for those imperfections. During the previous divorce campaign Canon O'Callaghan with whom I often debated the matter said there was no such thing as a touch of a wooden leg, that we would either introduce divorce or we would not and we should not shy away from the matter.</P>
    <P>There are between 70,000-75,000 people who wish to form legitimate second unions or bury old ones.  The matter is as simple as that.  I do not think any Member is pro-divorce or would actively campaign for marriage breakdown so that people could avail of divorce.  The majority of us are tolerant and compassionate enough to want to give people an opportunity to legitimise their second relationships and put in order affairs which have not been in order for many years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I listened carefully to the contributions of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, my party spokesman and other speakers.  I agree with some of the points put forward but disagree with others.  The difference between the 1986 campaign and this campaign is that there is no longer a sense of triumph among those who say we will introduce divorce or a sense of extreme selfrighteousness among those who are anti-divorce.  This is the way it should be; we should respect other people's point of view.  I do not mean this as a pious platitude, but there is a marked difference between the two campaigns. In 1986 people who said they would vote against divorce were somehow put into outer darkness while people who said they would vote for divorce had a halo of certainty put around them not necessarily by themselves but by other people.  We have become more realistic in the intervening nine years during which there has been an inescapable increase in marriage breakdown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard many tales of great human suffering.  Deputy Haughey said the only kind of cruelty was physical. However, there is also mental cruelty which can have a more lasting impact than physical abuse in terms of how it blights the spirit and leaves people defeated and oppressed.  I hope people will continue to respect other people's views on the issue of divorce.  When this issue was last put to the people I did not vote for it, and I have no hesitation in saying so.  It would be a funny world if we did not allow ourselves to develop and change our opinions.  At the time there were no safeguards for women and children.  The Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, was filled with idealism, but the bulwarks which have since been put in place did not exist.  The voter was being asked to decide on an issue in principle, as if it were without context or consequence, and not to mind the human realities.  I could not recommend a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote.  Without safeguards the removal of the ban on divorce would at <Col N="346" /> best have been thoughtless and at worst irresponsible.  That was my view and the view of the majority of the electorate at the time.</P>
    <P>Coupled with the rejection was a mandate to various Governments to put on our Statute Book a substantial body of law to reinforce our often expressed national concern and regard for women and children, even if we were never to have another referendum on the issue.</P>
    <P>In the last ten years the thrust of Government has been to support the weak and vulnerable in society.  That first referendum probably improved our understanding of the pressures within modern marriages and of issues which until then had been mistakenly thought of as side issues.  Adequate safeguards had to be put in place so that the law could deal with the various issues that could arise following the passing of a divorce law.  That was done and my party is justly proud of its contribution to the radically changed statutory framework we now have.</P>
    <P>We have 18 separate pieces of legislation to solve the problems identified during the last campaign.  They add up to a solid comprehensive foundation for what is now proposed, and they are not the work of any single political party.  In a unique sense we have all had a hand in what we are now debating.  The legislation is reflective of a practical concern and an acknowledgment by all sides in this House that we must legislate not for the Ireland we might look back on with love and pride, not for the Ireland we might wish to create, but for the Ireland in which we are now living.  I have no difficulty in looking back &mdash; as historians it is necessary to reflect on how we lived as we reflect on the future, but as politicians our job is to legislate for the situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>Ireland's configuration is changing at every significant point whether of culture, of religion, of political affiliation or of family structure.  The old certainties are gone.  No longer do people say that they have always voted for a particular political party.  Nothing is permanent, and the temptation is to talk of loss and <Col N="347" /> breakdown.  However, it is not all loss and breakdown.  It is change, and with the change comes challenge.  There is no sudden disappearance of affection, compassion or family closeness.  It is just that the demographic and societal structures within which those things tend to be found are changing shape all around us. It is this kind of change that is hard to come to terms with.</P>
    <P>One reads articles in business magazines about conferences and courses designed to help people and companies to embrace change, to become more efficient and to cope with the European dynamic etc.  Through that one learns specific skills, how to manage one's time and other things that one can fairly figure out.  However, when a marriage breaks down one has to adapt to a different kind of change because it is very personal; it is a wider family trauma.  Some cope better than others, but I have yet to meet any couple whose marriage has foundered who &ldquo;managed&rdquo; the central pain or the consequent difficulties easily or smoothly.  Because I have never met a couple who have found a marriage breakdown plain sailing, and because I have constituents and friends who have been separated for a long time and who honestly believe that they can now, after the years of difficulty, commit themselves to a second relationship and would want that second relationship acknowledged by the State, I have no patience with the idea that good marriages need to be protected by limiting the options of those who have already suffered bad marriages.  That would make no sense.</P>
    <P>I have even less patience with the notion that having a provision to allow people to remarry will usher us all into a glitzy world of glamour and of temporary relationships.  Divorce will never be a smart or alluring option.  Under the measures currently being proposed, it will never be quick and easy.  Nor will it ever taint the way the majority of people enter marriage filled with hopes and dreams and commitment.  Deputy <Col N="348" /> Lynch mentioned everything except love, and if one did not have that, one would never enter into marriage.  If young people wanted a temporary contract there would be no earthly reason to think about marriage.  However, they do think about marriage, and when they marry, the majority do so in the expectation of hard work and happiness. Sadly, for some of them, it does not work out.  They cannot make a go of it no matter how hard they try or what help they seek, but that does not mean that they entered the married state in a cynical frame of mind.</P>
    <P>Nobody enters marriage thinking about the possibility of later judicial separation, even though we have had the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act on our Statute Book for six years.  If and when we have the right to remarry on our Statute Book for six years, I doubt that there will be people entering marriage thinking about the possibility of later divorce.</P>
    <P>Divorce is a legislative accommodation of the changing realities of this country.  I am not talking about statistics or predictions.  I am talking about parents and grandparents I know who have, over the past decade, watched in wonder and dismay as the marriages of their children broke down and sundered, who have fought the desire to control the inevitable and who have supported the couples even while hating what was happening. There are very few families in any part of Ireland which have not been touched by marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>This decision should now be made on data, which is why my party has produced this position paper and other materials indicating with great clarity where we stand, what has happened in recent years regarding this issue and why we are advising an affirmative answer in the referendum.  Once the electorate has considered the data presented to them and are in no doubt about the level of safeguards put in place since the last referendum, I am confident that they will go to the heart of the matter.</P>
    <P>This is a complex, maturing society of <Col N="349" /> great subtlety and considered compassion where most adults do not feel the need to reinforce their own life-choices by trying to control the lives of others.  They will make their decision guided by a realism based on knowledge and compassion.  All around the country people who have been blessed by happiness in marriage will stand back from their own situation and show concern for those who have found themselves in a different situation.  This referendum is an opportunity to show how far we have come in our thinking and how little we have lost of our regard for the family and for children.</P>
    <P>I very much commend the work of Deputy Michael Woods on this matter. I am not saying this just because he is here.  Within our party there are very complex and different situations and people with very strong points of view. People are entitled to state their views and I hope that the remainder of the debate will reflect the considered opinions expressed by Deputy Woods and his committee colleagues following their study of the matter and the views expressed by previous speakers.  Deputy Haughey was entitled to say that he would vote in the Dáil for the referendum to be held.  None of us is in an enclave in which we can afford to do down other people's views to which they are fully entitled.  Once the vote to allow the people to express their views is taken in the House next week, we should conduct a campaign on the basis of data, knowledge, compassion and present society rather than how we might wish society had remained or might hope it would be.</P>
    <P>I was struck by a comment made by the Minister for Social Welfare who asked if it is better to deal with a problem by trying to keep the lid on it or by trying to tackle it.  A problem is never dealt with in a material sense by trying to stifle it, or keeping a lid on it.  The only way to deal with such matters is to confront them, but not in an adversarial sense.  They should be confronted in the <Col N="350" /> true meaning of liberality, an understanding of another person's view and moving forward to express one's view.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Discussing divorce with people who hold a different view may easily give rise to emotional and religious arguments. Neither emotion nor religion should cloud the issue involved in the proposed referendum, the right to remarry. Everything else has been set up in the judicial separation legislation and this Bill provides for a right which many may never avail of.  In cases where partners have separated, one, both or neither may want to remarry.  It will not be forced on anybody.  Often dogmatic approaches do not help anyone's cause. I hope the expression of my views on the proposed divorce referendum will reflect tolerance.</P>
      <P>The argument that the introduction of divorce at any stage will give rise to quickie divorces does not stand up.  The condition that a couple must be separated for four years provides for a a cooling off period.  If a week is a long time in politics, a four year breakdown in a marriage must be an eternity.  Even a week in a marriage in which things are not going well may seem an eternity. After four years of marital breakdown there is no point in pretending that more damage could be done to a marriage because it would already be in smithereens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is being claimed that divorce will break up marriages.  Divorce follows, but does not cause, the breakdown of marriages.  If there were no marriage breakdowns there would be no divorce. The argument that once divorce is introduced there will automatically be marriage breakdowns does not stand up.  If <Col N="351" /> the absence of divorce is all that keeps 95 per cent of marriages together, they are very superficial.</P>
    <P>The idea that this legislation will introduce a divorce culture ignores the fact that we already have a marriage breakdown culture.  The incidence of marriage breakdown is the real problem. The number of marriage breakdowns doubled between the last referendum in 1986 and 1994.  We must be aware of the situation.  It is difficult to understand how some people can take such a strong line about divorce breaking up marriages.  They are half prepared to accept that marriages are breaking down, but they continue to talk about the effect divorce will have on marriage.  If we could solve the problem of marriage breakdown, we could withdraw divorce legislation.  Marriages in difficulty and partners who have split up lead to divorce.  It would be selfish if we decided that because we do not need to avail of divorce we should deny people, who may have been abandoned or battered by their spouse and who have met other partners with whom they would like to spend their lives, the right to remarry.</P>
    <P>The Government is producing an information booklet, but some question if it is information or propaganda. Propaganda and information must be like beauty &mdash; they are in the eye of the beholder or in the ear of the listener. What one may regard as information another may regard as propaganda.  It depends on how prejudiced people are or if they hold opposing views.  All the Government can do is produce a booklet outlining the information and people will have to make up their mind to reject or accept it.  It is contradictory to criticise a Government for spending money while at the same time expecting it to produce information.  The Government is being fair in that it will present both sides of the argument in a booklet that will be distributed to every household, having allowed submissions to be made by those who are for and those who are against divorce.  Both sides of <Col N="352" /> the argument will be set out and having read them people will make up their minds.</P>
    <P>More emphasis should be put on helping marriages from the beginning. Tackling divorce means we have a problem in that we are trying to tackle a problem that ended a marriage.  The Government has assisted by giving £750,000 to marriage counselling organisations which deserve our gratitude and praise for the wonderful work they do in preparing people for marriage and advising those who encounter difficulties in their marriage.  Prevention is always better than cure.  If people could be steered towards adopting a proper attitude to marriage, half the difficulties might not arise later.</P>
    <P>An appeal was made for the church to make a statement against divorce.  The church should make positive statements on marriage, its sanctity, importance and its unbreakable dimension, but I do not see any advantage in its attacking divorce to encourage people to oppose it.  It should assist by playing a leading role in helping young people to adopt a proper attitude to marriage, as it has done by setting up the CMAC where people are given advice on marriage. More such assistance should be provided. I do not share the view that young people will marry while looking over their shoulder and saying that this will last 12 months and then they will get a divorce.  Young people today are as romantic or foolish as past generations and I believe they will enter marriage with the same hopes that everything will go well for them and, if they do, more luck to them.  Anyone who enters marriage with divorce at the back of their minds when walking up the aisle is a fool.  I do not accept that young people will enter marriage with the idea of eventual divorce.</P>
    <P>The Government has set up a mediation service under the Family Law Bill which proposes to raise the legal marriage age from 16 to 18, a wonderful step.  It is questionable if people even at 18 are ready for marriage, although I know of many successful marriages that <Col N="353" /> have survived despite couples marrying at an early age.  In general, however, young people do not have the maturity to face up to the responsibility of marriage.</P>
    <P>If I accepted that all marriages will be blown apart by the introduction of divorce I would have to accept that all marriages are a sham and religion is dead.  I do not believe that.  There is not any danger that divorce will spread like a virus among people who, because of their religious beliefs, do not accept it. If we have a problem with the religious aspect of divorce, that should be tackled from a different source.</P>
    <P>I support the Government's effort to introduce divorce although I regret the reason for its introduction, namely, the breakdown of marriage.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for sharing his time with me. This Bill is all about facing reality.  We would all like to live in an ideal world where we could walk down any street without fear of being mugged and leave our doors unlocked without fear of being robbed, a world where there is no violence, conflict, social unrest or marriage breakdown.  However, the reality is that we do not live in an ideal world but in an environment where muggings, robbery, violence and marriage breakdown occur.  It is important that we face up to these realities because in so doing we can hope to improve our quality of life.</P>
      <P>It is important for us to examine the circumstances in which we debate this Bill today.  It is being debated against a background where over 75,000 marriages have ended, where 23,000 people are currently dependent on either deserted wife's benefit or single parent's allowance for their support and that of their children and against a background where the incidence of domestic violence is increasing at an alarming pace and where the number of children born outside of marriage is rapidly increasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These facts are distressing and distasteful but they are the naked truth. <Col N="354" /> They prove that where divorce is prohibited we do not have a perfect society. If divorce is allowed, we will not have a perfect society but I will vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the referendum because I sincerely believe the law and the Constitution should deal with the realities of life. One of those realities is that many people whose marriages have ended wish to remarry.  Can we deny those people a second chance?  In many cases they are living the very essence of a married life but their union does not have a legal status.  Marriages have broken down since 1986 and will continue to break down even if this referendum is defeated.  Ignoring these relationships does not mean they do not exist.</P>
    <P>In this debate, many speakers have referred to the 1986 referendum.  This is crucially important.  We can vote for or against the introduction of divorce. Rarely in such a situation do we have the advantage of knowing what the result will be if the outcome is one way or the other.  The 1986 referendum was defeated.  We know now, that that outcome did nothing to prevent marriage breakdown.  In fact, the incidence of marriage breakdown doubled.  If this referendum is defeated also, the outcome will be the same.  The defeat of the 1986 referendum did nothing to solve the problem of marriage breakdown and if this referendum is defeated, it will mean that reality will continue to be ignored.</P>
    <P>When we enter into marriage many of us do not realise it is a major commitment to live together for the rest of our lives and not all marriages break down because of violence or disloyalty.  Many marriages cannot continue because the people involved are simply incompatible. They may have great respect for each other and like each other but they cannot live together because they are incompatible.  The fact that couples are incompatible with each other does not mean they will be incompatible with everybody.  That they cannot live together as man and wife in a marriage <Col N="355" /> does not mean they should be prohibited from enjoying a happy and loving relationship with a new partner. Many of us do not know whether we are compatible until we live together.  For those of us who are fortunate, marriage is an enriching relationship but for many, it is a distressful and painful experience.  Neither party is guilty of any fault but because of their incompatibility, their marriage has broken down.</P>
    <P>I agree with many speakers who said the introduction of divorce will not affect the permanency of marriage. When a couple walk up the aisle together they intend to spend the rest of their lives together.  They believe their lives will be enriched and enhanced by each other's company as well as the lives of any children they may have. That will continue to be the case and even if divorce is introduced, couples will not make the major decision to enter into marriage unless they are determined their relationship will survive.</P>
    <P>Some people in this House do not agree with inserting the conditions for divorce into the Constitution.  I share that view but we must deal with the reality that our only hope of having this referendum passed is by inserting those conditions in the Constitution.  If we want to give legal status to people in second relationships, we must face the reality of how the voters will think.  We are not trying to develop a divorce culture and we are not allowing divorce to be freely available.  The Government took the right decision &mdash; if not the one we desire most &mdash; by inserting those conditions into the Constitution.</P>
    <P>By voting for divorce I will not do the society in which I live a great favour. However, if I vote against it I will do society a grievous disservice.  By voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, I will accept the reality that some marriages do not work and that some new relationships can and will work. Those relationships deserve to be recognised by this State.  If we continue to ignore the plight of separated, battered wives or abandoned husbands and deny <Col N="356" /> them the possibility of a future second happy marriage, we will be unable to bury our heads in the sand and pretend that we do not have a major problem with marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>Valid arguments have been made against the right to remarry.  None of us, irrespective of how we vote, can say with absolute certainty that we are right. All we can do is face the option before us and make our choice based on our beliefs.  The argument weighs heavily in favour of voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in this referendum.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister clearly identify what the Law Reform Commission said about bail?  If the Minister is adopting the Law Reform Commission report as her bible there is scope for her to accommodate the Bill and to show she has the courage to address crime.  I had two messages for the Minister yesterday: first, we are experiencing a crime wave, the like of <Col N="357" /> which has never previously been witnessed and action must be taken. Second, the message for the criminal must be that on conviction by the courts he goes directly to jail.</P>
      <P>There is much more I could say.  A new prison was proposed for Castlerea but the proposal appears to have been put on the shelf.  It is on the shelf when one considers that Government expenditure is 11 per cent yet the proposal was included in the Fianna Fáil estimates when Government expenditure was 4 per cent.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the Minister's comments on the Law Reform Commission report on bail.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing his time with me.  I welcome the publication of this Bill by my colleague Deputy O'Donoghue.  Nobody can argue that over the past 12 months the constructive contribution from Deputy O'Donoghue in bringing forward measures to combat crime has been an outstanding feature of this Dáil.</P>
      <P>If we listen to our constituents we know the one issue that is raised constantly, along with job creation, is that of crime.  Crime knows no barriers.  It is not peculiar to any section of society, it pervades all of society and touches every home and every family in some way.  It behoves us to use all our abilities to produce legislation that will ensure society is protected and the criminal is brought to book.  In ordering a society we have to make choices about what we want.  There are occasions when we may have to limit general liberty.  If we are to have the security we rightly desire, the law must ensure that the criminal faces the reality of his crimes, that he is sufficiently punished and society is protected so that we who want to rear our children in a safe environment have the opportunity to do so.  In bringing forward the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill the Fianna Fáil Party is conscious of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions have been raised by the Government side as well as by my colleague regarding the bail laws and the <Col N="358" /> need to amend the Constitution.  I cannot understand why the Minister for Justice was running with this issue sometime ago and now it has been put on the back burner.  That is unacceptable.  It is not the way to instil confidence in the Garda and those who deal with crime at the coalface.  I commend the fact that this issue has been brought to the fore by my colleague. Nobody would argue that the manner in which the bail laws are operating is satisfactory.  It is unacceptable in a modern society that criminals who are arrested and have long criminal track records who are likely to commit further crime should be allowed bail.  It would be a failure on the part of the Government if it opposed this Bill.  This Bill will create confidence among the people that we are doing all we can in this House to ensure that the law meets the requirements of society.  It will instil confidence in the Garda who want to act on crime, not the revolving door syndrome which they face every day they go to the courts.  The Garda want that confidence instilled in the people and they want the Legislature to back up their requirements by law.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution was put to the people it would be unanimously supported.  That is a reason the Government should not oppose the Bill brought forward by my colleague Deputy O'Donoghue, whom I commend for having done so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="359" /> My proposals to Government will reflect the fact &mdash; as I have stated publicly on a number of occasions &mdash; that I share the public concern that our bail laws are being abused.</P>
    <P>... Both I and the Government regard tackling crime as a key priority and we have taken &mdash; and will take &mdash; whatever steps are open to us to tackle these problems effectively.</P>
    <P>That is the first constructive statement we have had in this House for many years in relation to the ongoing problem of petty crime.  The people are fed up to the teeth with criminals, thugs, roaming the country at will and nobody being able to deal with them.  That is not good enough.  The people are entitled to protection. It is the duty of the Government to protect them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, has given her commitment and I accept it.  I wish to make a few points on petty crime.  Serious crime has been dealt with and we must commend the Garda and various Ministers for Justice who have taken a strong stand, unpopular at times, on tackling armed bank robberies and murder, warfare among thugs, and feuds among some criminal families, but petty crime has not been dealt with.  Any garda will tell you off the record that it is a waste of time, that he brings petty criminals to court and they are back on the streets before he gets back to the barracks. That is not good enough.  The Garda <Col N="360" /> must be supported.  They have the information and they know who is involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is not worth the paper it is written on.  This is only a charade.  When the Deputy was on this side of the House he should have dealt with it.  I am entitled to make my contribution. I represent the people of Cavan and Monaghan where there was an upsurge in crime in recent years and nothing was done about it.  With fast moving cars distance is no object and criminals are able to travel anywhere. The gardaí may apprehend a criminal and bring him to court but when he is granted bail he is then back on the streets.  There is a saying that you might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb and that is the attitude of the criminal. They might as well be caught with 20 televisions as with one or two.  Bail is fixed at £50 personal bail and £100 security which is a pittance to these people.  I saw on television a young girl being interviewed about her drug addiction who told how she needed £120 a day to feed her drug appetite which she had no difficulty getting from shoplifting. The criminals are well organised and have fast cars to drive down the country to break into houses.  They are prepared to commit crime against the person who gets in their way.  That is not acceptable.</P>
      <P>Statistics show the spiralling rise in crime.  Not all crimes are reported because people see little point in reporting the matter to the Garda, and going to court where criminals are being let off free and out on bail.  The bail laws are far too flexible.  A person with stolen property who has been apprehended by a garda should not be allowed out to commit similar crimes whilst on bail but should be locked behind bars until the court has time to deal with him properly. I make no apology for making that suggestion because we have to remember the rights of the victim.  It is time that we started to deal with this problem and the public will support us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> Concurrent sentences are ridiculous because it encourages the criminals to commit more crimes as they might as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb.  If a criminal is sentenced to one month's imprisonment for an offence and the sentences for subsequent offences run concurrently, he is out on the streets within a fortnight.  That is not good enough.  The concept of sentencing a person to do community work should be rubbished immediately.  A person may be sentenced to 20 hours community work.  What does that amount to?  I wonder if the Minister is aware that this scheme is not being supervised.  The people are being brought to the area where the work is to be done by the local social worker and collected in the evening but there is nobody to supervise them during the day.  I can tell you what they are doing &mdash; they are using the opportunity to monitor the area and observe when people are at home so that they can arrange to come back into the area and commit further crimes. That is hard fact and judges will tell you privately that their hands are tied.  Is it any wonder that crime is spiralling.  This serious problem needs to be tackled as citizens are entitled to be protected.  I am delighted the Minister has taken this on board and has made a commitment to deal with it.  This is the first commitment I have seen in years from a Minister for Justice to tackle this problem.  I have every confidence in the Minister and the Government to deal with the problem and I look forward to results in the short term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Fianna Fáil Justice spokesperson Deputy O'Donoghue &mdash; and am glad he has come in to hear my contribution &mdash; say that the Fianna Fáil Party is committed to returning the streets of this country to the people.  He was followed by my Fianna Fáil constituency colleague. <Col N="362" /> Deputy Briscoe, who said that this country is verging on a state of emergency, the public and the gardaí know it but very few are prepared to admit it.</P>
      <P>I agree that we have a very serious crime and drug problem, indeed a very serious justice problem.  If my constituency colleague is right and if the country is verging on a state of emergency then he, Deputy O'Donoghue and the whole Fianna Fáil Party had better quickly apologise to the thousands of victims of crime who suffered because of the ineptitude of the Fianna Fáil Party which was in Government up to 15 December 1994.</P>
      <P>It is as clear as day follows night that Fianna Fáil is in absolute disarray in Opposition just as it was inept in Government.  In case Deputy O'Donoghue is seriously proposing Fianna Fáil policy and not just playing Opposition politics it is very important to look at what Fianna Fáil is proposing as a solution to the crime problems it allowed escalate to the worrying levels at which they currently stand.  Without reading the chapter on the law of bail in the Law Reform Commission report, Fianna Fáil rushes in with a simple political approach to a complex problem.  The last thing this country needs is to spend large sums of money chasing phantom solutions when everyone can easily identify policies that should have been pursued by previous Governments and now must be pursued by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The extremely enlightened Circuit Court Judge, Michael Moriarty, first attempted to quantify the incidence of crime committed by drug abusers in Dublin and estimated that 80 per cent of crime is committed by drug addicts. It is therefore logical that we must tackle the drug addiction problem first if we are to reduce the level of crime. There are 7,000 drug addicts in Dublin, of whom only 900 have access to a methadone maintenance programme. The others are robbing approximately £150 to £200 a day to feed their addiction. It is a phenomenal problem. Deputy O'Donoghue's Government did <Col N="363" /> absolutely nothing to resolve the scandal of Mountjoy, where clearly many drug addicts end up, which has no methadone maintenance programme.  It is an outrage that the Fianna Fáil Government allowed thousands of heroin addicts who were jailed for horrible crimes out on the streets of Dublin just as addicted as when they went to prison to continue robbing and mugging my constituents and the citizens of Dublin to feed their addiction.  A Government must never be allowed to make that mistake again.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue, who represents Kerry, cannot possibly understand the nature of the drug problem afflicting Dubliners if his reported views on the solution are true.  He told <i>The Irish Times</i> that &ldquo;gardaí should be given the power to arrest drug addicts and detain them in drug treatment centres for up to six months&rdquo;.  Over the years the gardaí have detained and, after due process, have had sent to Mountjoy Prison hundreds of such addicts but Deputy O'Donoghue's party in Government did nothing about their treatment while interned there.</P>
    <P>I invite Deputy O'Donoghue to walk with me through the streets of Dublin South-Central, the south inner city and the public housing and flat complexes to familiarise himself with the problem.  He can get a close-up view of the real issues in those areas and hear from the people who are the victims of the drugs and crime problems.  The people of Dublin want, in addition to punishment appropriate to the crime, treatment programmes that will remove the need for addicts to rob in the first place.  They are not seeking Fianna Fáil's &ldquo;national drug detention unit&rdquo; as proposed by Deputy O'Donoghue.  They want a planned and orderly development of services to educate, treat and reform addicts.</P>
    <P>I wish to ask Fianna Fáil about its new discovery of drugs as an issue. What was Deputy O'Donoghue doing in Government when the national co-ordinating committee on drugs only met twice in 1992, twice in 1993 and not at <Col N="364" /> all in 1994?  Did Deputy O'Donoghue and Fianna Fáil assume that they had solved the drugs problem?</P>

      <P>This week the Law Reform Commission published an examination of the law on bail.  While it was not mandated to make specific recommendations, its findings should give pause to those who see restrictions on bail as the panacea &mdash; as clearly Fianna Fáil do &mdash; for all our social ills.</P>
      <P>This Bill strikes at the heart of the presumption of innocence which is the cornerstone of our legal system.  If the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Donoghue were put to the people in a referendum and passed it would result in the introduction of a preventative detention system.  Deputy O'Donoghue, as is clear from newspaper reports, is intent on the provision of such preventative detention systems throughout the country.  He has also asked that the Garda Síochána be allowed to test suspected drug addicts to ascertain if they are habitual and, if so, intern them for up to three years for treatment.  The least Deputy O'Donoghue should know about addiction is that the best way to solve it is to get the addict to admit to his addiction.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill provides that any person charged with an offence can be remanded in custody if the judge is satisfied &ldquo;that there is a probability that the person will commit a class of criminal offence if admitted to bail&rdquo;.  In times of crisis there is always a temptation to seek quick fix solutions and there is no doubt that we are currently facing a law and order crisis which threatens to undermine civil society. However, the introduction of internment along the lines proposed by Fianna Fáil will not address the root causes of social breakdown.  It will not even satisfactorily address the symptoms.</P>

      <P>I appreciate why Deputy O'Donoghue has introduced this Bill.  His colleague, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, authorised the Attorney General in February 1994 to ask the Law Reform Commission to investigate the issue of bail.  We have only recently received its report and it would be wise to study its conclusions.  It is a comprehensive report which has addressed the bail issue in Ireland and has compared it to the situation that prevails in other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I praise the Minister's work during the short period she has been in office. She has been conscious of abuses of the bail laws and, as can be seen from her recent pronouncements, of the drugs problem.  There is extreme concern in Ireland at present.  There is a feeling that the balance has moved in favour of the criminal rather than of the victim of crime.  I often wonder if the changes that have taken place recently have the interests of the criminal more at heart than the people oppressed by crime.  I am referring to the right to silence, which is a contentious issue.  Any person who is innocent of a crime will not require the right to silence.  I would expect them to be loud and vocal in declaring their innocence.  The right to silence appears to help the hardened <Col N="366" /> criminal and it does not make the work of the gardaí any easier.</P>
    <P>Many people when talking about crime and its solutions suggest that extra garda resources should be put on the streets.  However, that often is not necessarily the best measure to control the situation.  While I admire the gardaí and what they are doing, the ongoing saga between the Garda Representative Association and the Garda Federation has done nothing to present a good image of the Force.  I look forward to the day this matter is resolved.  The most pathetic photograph I have ever seen was of a security force outside the Garda Representative Association conference in Galway to prevent people from entering.  It was laughable.  I make that point not to criticise the gardaí but to indicate that it does not present the right image of the role of the Garda Síochána to members of the community.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission has deliberated about this issue for 18 months.  If its work is to be worthwhile it must be addressed seriously.  There will be implications if any changes are made in the bail laws to make them more stringent.  If a referendum is required to do that, so be it.  We cannot continue to ignore the situation that exists.  A protection mechanism for the ordinary people must be introduced and I would welcome holding a referendum to do this.</P>
    <P>However, if we introduce more stringent bail laws there will be consequent costs to the economy and extra prison places will be required.  In that context, the Government should seriously address the question of providing extra places at Castlerea prison in the near future.  I have no axe to grind on behalf of Castlerea as I live a long distance from Roscommon.  However, I can see the logic of what is happening.  The Law Reform Commission has addressed this problem.  We must change the bail laws and a referendum might be necessary. That implies that we will need extra prison space and more capital expenditure. If that is the case, so be it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> The Criminal Justice Act, 1994, provided a protection mechanism <i>vis-á-vis</i> people who amassed extra finances through committing crimes when out on bail.  The Act provided that the proceeds of such crimes could be confiscated, that is, assuming that the person were caught in such a situation.  On this and the earlier points on the right to silence and the bail laws hopefully, as a result of this, we can do something about crime, which appears to be endemic in Irish society.  We have a big problem in the Limerick area caused by imported crime with criminals, particularly young thugs from the city areas, going to what could be described as soft touch areas of the county and harassing small communities, towns and villages. Shops are robbed and cigarettes and alcohol stolen.  I would hate to see the situation that exists in certain parts of Dublin emerging in rural areas, but if the present activities are allowed to continue rural shops will be almost like fortresses, like those in Dublin city.  People in towns and villages around the country are concerned about this.</P>
    <P>The situation that has prevailed in certain parts of Limerick city has given the wrong image of the entire Limerick community.  The county suffers as a result of the crime problem in the city, because, to a degree, it is the soft touch. I understand it is possibly no different in Dublin and that Meath and Kildare are affected in the same way.  If we are to restore confidence and heed the concerns of the people, it is incumbent on politicians to show leadership on this issue.  If we have to have a referendum on bail in order to make laws more stringent, we should do so.</P>

      <P>I am sure Members know as well as I do that we have debated bail about seven times in the <Col N="368" /> three years I have been a Member of this House.  There have been numerous motions and several Private Members' Bills during the period of office of the past two administrations.</P>
      <P>It is fair to suggest at this stage that there is almost cross-party support for radical action to be taken, including a constitutional referendum, on the matter of bail.  We appear to have a revolving debate and a total paralysis of analysis of this subject.  The long awaited report of the Law Reform Commission is tortuous and comprehensive but after 200 pages, it peters out into inconclusive statements &mdash; weak suggestions of what might be appropriate in certain circumstances. That is not the fault of the commission, because it was not asked for hard recommendations or proposals for reform.  It was asked to study the law and, indeed, it gave us a comprehensive analysis of everything one would want to know about bail here and in other jurisdictions, and the legal, sociological and administrative problems involved in making any change in the bail laws.</P>
      <P>The founding principle of our due process is that one is innocent until proven guilty.  The entire corpus of the criminal law is based on and radiates from that fundamental tenet of the presumption of innocence.  It is a long standing rule of law and is, in fact, copper-fastened in our Constitution by Article 40.4.1º which states:</P>
      <P>No citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That has been construed strictly by the Judiciary over the years, which means that preventive detention has been ruled out definitively by the courts.  That is why we need an amendment to the Constitution to allow some flexibility and discretion and to allow this House to legislate in such a way that would empower a judge to have some discretion as to whether a person should be released on bail if there is a propensity in that person to, or sufficient evidence to suggest he will, re-offend while on bail.  That is the nub of the problem.  If <Col N="369" /> this issue was put to the people, they would give a resounding &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to that question.</P>
    <P>The report is disappointing in that it peters out and offers no conclusions or proposals for reform, but that is an issue for politics, it is an issue for the Minister, the Government of the day and this House to deal with.  Last night, when the Minister addressed the issue, she indicated that she did not see the weak recommendations in the Law Reform Commission report ruling out the possibility of a constitutional referendum on bail.  Soon after the Minister was appointed she announced that there would be such a referendum on bail and it was warmly welcomed by this House, but there was some dissention from the Labour Party making the traditional argument that the presumption of innocence is too fundamental a tenet to tinker with.</P>
    <P>I would be interested to hear if this is still the Labour Party's position, because it is important that when there is almost cross-party consensus on this issue we should know what is stopping the Government bringing forward the constitutional referendum to which the Minister for Justice committed herself when she was appointed.  It was a basic principle of Fine Gael policy while it was in Opposition and is now a principle adopted by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats.  What is the catch? Why the delay by the Cabinet in driving this change and introducing the possibility of a constitutional referendum on this issue?</P>
    <P>The traditional notion of the presumption of innocence until proven guilty must be balanced, in the context of Irish criminality at present, against the fact that most criminals in Ireland today are persistent reoffenders.  We have high rates of recidivism, juvenile delinquency and juvenile offending.  We have extremely high rates of drug addiction related criminality.  Looking at the figures, we are not just talking about sufficient evidence to suggest a likelihood of reoffending.  When one is talking about a drug addict who is 20 years <Col N="370" /> old being released on bail there is a certainty that he will reoffend &mdash; one is not even talking about a mere likelihood. He needs £200 a day to feed his habit and is released on bail with a long delay before his case goes to trial and there are no adequate systems in place, short of robbing, to feed that habit.  The State is remiss in this regard.  Recent figures show there are long waiting lists for people who are trying to get off drugs and who cannot get into clinics, which are full.  We have 7,000 drug addicts in Dublin and a large proportion of them are not receiving any treatment.  It is not a simple matter and there are no quick-fix solutions and in that sense I agree with the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>The depressing fact about the lack of recommendations is that it leaves it up to this House to respond.  We must do the best we can as legislators.  We must put in place a mix of measures which will improve the situation of offending while on bail.  The reform of the bail laws to refuse a person bail, where there is firm evidence of the likelihood of reoffending, is a reasonable amendment to exist in law.  At the moment, bail can only be refused when there is evidence that a person might not turn up for court or might abscond or intimidate witnesses.  It is folly and reckless to release people who are certain to re-offend, given their drug addiction and their need for money to feed this.</P>
    <P>When we look at the figures, it is clear we are presiding over chaos in our prison system.  There are 2,210 prison spaces.  In 1993 10,448 people were committed by the courts to jail, this includes those held on remand and those sentenced. To deal with this number, 3,564 people were given full temporary release, which meant they did not have to return.  People are granted such release with conditions but I wonder what these conditions are and whether adherence to them is monitored.</P>
    <P>I recently asked a parliamentary question about the number of offenders who re-offend while on temporary release.  The Minister said this information would be difficult to compile <Col N="371" /> and would involve staff engaging in a disproportionate amount of work. Nobody knows what people do while on full temporary release.  In 1990 a survey showed there were high rates of juvenile re-offending.  I am sure these rates have increased since then, given the drug addiction problem.  We had the highest rate of juvenile offenders among Council of Europe countries.  The profile of criminal offenders at the moment is that they are young males with no stake in life and no hope of jobs.</P>
    <P>The Lord Mayor's commission was chaired by Judge Michael Moriarty of the Circuit Court.  Its report showed that the average number of convictions per offender was ten.  The number of convictions of individual offenders ranged from 1 to 93.  The most common age at which the first offence was committed was 16.  This is a pathetic profile of our criminal population.</P>
    <P>We have no juvenile justice legislation, which is urgently needed.  On the Order of Business the Taoiseach announced it would not be available until next spring.  Previously we were told it would be introduced during this session.  In 1992 much of the intellectual work on the causes of and remedies for juvenile crime was done by a select committee of this House.  The work done and proposals put forward by that committee are languishing and there is still no sign of a juvenile justice Bill.</P>
    <P>I believe the report is worthy but it does not solve the problem and does not give directions to the Minister, who knows what is required.  It is absolutely essential that we have more prison spaces and I hope the Minister will be in a position shortly to announce that the prison building programme, which was postponed because of cutbacks, will be reinstated because if we do not provide places for offenders we will contribute to the chaos.  The problem is multifaceted; we need spaces and a detoxification and rehabilitation centre for addicted criminals.  If we dealt with this pathetic type of criminal behaviour we would go a long way towards solving <Col N="372" /> the problem in our prison management system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, which is extremely timely.  There is widespread anger among ordinary citizens at the level of crime on the streets of Dublin and throughout the country.  Many corner shops are raided four or five times a year.  Handbag snatches are a common daily occurrence.  The crime wave, which is in the main drug-related, seriously threatens the quality of life we have enjoyed until now.</P>
      <P>The public are furious that this situation is being allowed to continue.  There is a groundswell of public opinion on this issue, which can be described as a community-based political awareness.  I welcome this momentum for action and I call on the Minister to seize the moment.  The public now demand and will accept changes in the law to make life tougher for criminals.  There is now a widespread acceptance that the criminal justice system does more for the rights of criminals than for innocent victims whose plight is often ignored. Times have changed and modern society must cope with many new difficult issues.  Violent crime is now a sad reality of life and, unfortunately, drugs are a part of Irish culture.  As Deputy O'Donoghue and others have said, the balance needs to be readjusted and the civil liberties of the victim should also be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the summer the Garda Síochána called for changes in the law.  This was in the context of the drugs reform package introduced by the Minister. The Garda said it wants action with regard to legislation on the bail laws and the right to silence.  We need to know the Government's policy on bail.  The Minister promised that a referendum would be put to the people, possibly at the same time as the divorce referendum. This now seems to be changed and the publication of the excellent document by the Law Reform Commission seems to have delayed this further.  There appears to be confusion <Col N="373" /> in the Government on the matter.  We need to know the policies of the Labour Party and Democratic Left on bail; we might then have some indication of what the policy of the Government as a whole is in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission's report is being used as an excuse to delay the matter even further by setting up more committees to examine all aspects of the situation.  The report is good but I hope we can quickly reach agreement on what we need to do, particularly with regard to bail.</P>
    <P>The commission's report is extremely helpful.  It points out that a quarter of armed robberies are carried out by people on bail.  According to Garda statistics, in 1993 3,200 indictable crimes were committed by people on bail, although it is speculated that this could be as high as 6,000 or even 9,000.  One in ten crimes is committed by people on bail.  The report of the Lord Mayor's commission shows that the average number of crimes committed by an inmate of Mountjoy is 10.4.  This statistic shows the extent of the problem and the need to deal with it decisively and update the bail laws.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission did not opt for a referendum and it is not in a position to do so but it has come up with many useful suggestions.  The present law is that bail can only be refused if it is feared the accused will not turn up for trial or will intimidate witnesses.  There is no power to refuse bail on the grounds that the accused might commit further offences.  That is, of course, based on the presumption of the right to be considered innocent.  The Law Reform Commission suggests that the length of time people are at liberty before trial should be reduced.  It also highlights the inadequacy of the number of judges available to deal with crime generally as well as the cumbersome aspects of the pre-trial period.  We all agree with those recommendations which can be introduced in parallel with this Referendum Bill.  Deputy O'Donoghue suggests more legislation to deal <Col N="374" /> with the aspects outlined in the Law Reform Commission's report.</P>
    <P>The serious question of drugs-related crime is one of the big bail issues. Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill is reasonable and balanced, and examines all the issues.  It proposes to introduce a third reason for refusing bail, that is the probability that the accused would commit another crime.  That would deal effectively with the situation that now prevails.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day the people will decide and nothing can be fairer than that.  I have no doubt that the people would support this measure as a reasonable one to deal with the new, changed situation of modern Ireland and to restore the balance in favour of victims of crime.</P>
    <P>One important safeguard &mdash; that no individual can be held for longer than 90 days without trial &mdash; should counter the arguments by civil liberties groups that there will be miscarriages of justice. In any case, we are dealing mainly with drugs-related offences where there is a probability that the accused will commit another crime, so the miscarriage of justice situation does not arise.  There is no need for civil liberties groups to be dramatic in highlighting that aspect.</P>
    <P>The key to the whole question is that limited spaces are available in our prisons. We have temporary release and bail to ease the problem but there are not enough prison places to deal with the situation if this referendum is carried. It is estimated that between 400 and 600 extra places would be needed to accommodate a change in the bail law.  A capital cost of £80 million is suggested for building prisons and £20 million for running costs.  These figures raise serious questions.  Are we prepared to prioritise the fight against crime by spending that amount of money?  People would support a measure to change the law on bail as well as to provide the necessary funding.  The decision to postpone or cancel the building of the prison at Castlerea and the women's prison in Dublin was a backward step as far as the bail laws are concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="375" /> Much has been said about the problem of drugs on our streets.  While it sounds like a cliché, it is true to say that drug abuse threatens the very fabric of our society so we have a responsibility to deal with the situation effectively.  I tabled a parliamentary question for the Minister for Health asking him to outline drug treatment facilities in the Eastern Health Board area.  His reply showed that not many beds are available in the EHB area.  The Minister says he is concerned about the numbers on waiting lists for drug treatment. However, he says he is satisfied his officials, in consultation with the EHB, are working to improve the situation. Detoxification facilities are hopelessly inadequate for dealing with the massive escalation in drug addiction.</P>
    <P>We have debated the need to improve the laws in that respect, and this side of the House welcomed proposals by the Minister for Justice when she finally got them through Cabinet.  We also need to look at other areas such as education and health services that must be provided by the State.  We will not solve this problem until we provide adequate detoxification and other drug treatment facilities.  We are only kidding ourselves if we think we will solve the problem by changing the law.</P>
    <P>Detoxification treatment in prisons must be made a priority otherwise there is a strong possibility that convicted people will continue their drug addiction in prisons and, once released, they will continue their criminal activities. These serious issues need to be examined.</P>
    <P>During the debate a legal point arose which warrants further discussion.  It relates to section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 which deals with crime committed while a person is on bail.  The section obliges a court to give the accused a consecutive sentence in such a case.  It was hoped that this section of the Act would cut the number of crimes committed by people while on bail but, unfortunately, the court adopted a new interpretation and did not implement <Col N="376" /> section 11 as it was intended to be implemented.  It introduced the concept of suspended sentences and adopted the totality principle.  I am surprised the court adopted that interpretation because the section would have been helpful in dealing with this problem. Unfortunately, in the last year or two there has been a huge increase in the number of crimes committed by accused people out on bail.</P>
    <P>For the vast majority of people, the criminal justice system is out of touch with the realities of modern life.  The priorities should be to protect the citizen and his or her property.  The public cannot accept that crimes are committed by people out on bail or on temporary release.  They simply cannot understand why that is being allowed to continue and why the Garda are being made to look foolish when &mdash; even if they manage to secure a conviction &mdash; they have to deal again with the convicted person who, within a short time, is out in the community again committing more crimes.  The public wants action and change.  Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill is an attempt to deal with this modern complex problem which will be supported by the people.  I call on the Minister and the Government to introduce their Bill as quickly as possible, if it will not support this one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised this Bill is before the House because I remember speaking on this subject on 4 May 1995. I thought the Opposition would have the decency not to introduce similar legislation months after it was discussed. The Law Reform Commission, which was appointed by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn in the previous Administration, considered the issue of bail and we were waiting for the report to come before the House to discuss it.  It is astounding that we are debating this issue on the day the report is published.  I do not know if Deputy O'Donoghue has seen the report, but we need a reasonable period of time to study its 200 pages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>A Government of Renewal</i> states that <Col N="377" /> an examination of legislation by the Law Reform Commission to allow courts to refuse bail where the court considered it desirable would take place.  It did not speak in terms of a constitutional amendment, but of legislative provision.  The Law Reform Commission reported yesterday that it proposed legislative changes, but it did not propose any change in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The central issue is that changing the law on bail restricts the liberty of the accused before trial, but changing the constitutional entitlement to bail denies liberty before trial.  That is the nub of the matter about which we are concerned. Do we want to change the Constitution so that we will provide imprisonment prior to trial, or do we want to tighten the legislative provisions to ensure that offences are not committed while suspects are on bail?  The latter is preferable in a democratic society because we could restrict liberty on the basis of suspicion and it could also interfere with the presumption of innocence.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court's decision in the O'Callaghan case in 1966 specified that all citizens should be entitled to bail, except where someone might abscond and not stand trial or a suspect might interfere with witnesses.  It stated that the refusal of bail was a form of preventative justice which had no place in our legal system and was alien to the two purposes of bail.  The Supreme Court made it clear that its approach was to strengthen the legislative provisions, rather than providing for constitutional change.  The guiding principle of common law and our Constitution, the presumption of innocence before guilt, protects the rights of the individual. International jurisprudence recognises human and civil rights in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is a low percentage of remand prisoners in this country compared with the rest of Europe and the western world.  As a result, people spend less time in our prisons compared with other countries.  It also means that we need fewer prisons.  There has been a lot of discussion recently about building new <Col N="378" /> prisons.  The Law Reform Commission estimates that we need 600 new prison spaces at a capital cost of £80 million and an annual running cost of £20 million. This is a direct result of a decision to introduce preventative detention.  We must discuss if we want to spend money on prisons or on ensuring early trials. Often a long period of time elapses before a suspect comes before the courts because we do not have enough judges to deal with cases and our procedure is cumbersome.  We should spend money on early trials rather than putting it into a system which needs an overhaul.  I agree with Deputy Haughey who criticised the prison system.  It does not rehabilitate prisoners or produce better people as a result of the time spent there.</P>
    <P>There are serious problems which must be addressed, including the fact that people on bail are committing crime.  There has been an increase in the number of crimes committed by people on bail in recent years, but it has not been as significant as was indicated. Approximately 8,000 offences were committed by people on bail in 1984, the year we introduced the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, which provided for mandatory consecutive sentences.  That number has decreased dramatically over the years and it is now approximately 50 per cent of that number.  The initial decrease was to 2,500 and then it increased to 4,500.  We must address that problem.</P>
    <P>There are two reasons why there has been an increase in the number of offences committed by people on bail. The first was referred to by the Law Reform Commission and relates to the fact that judges tend to be more lenient when dealing with consecutive sentences. Instead of imposing straight consecutive sentences, they often impose a suspended sentence, leaving us back at square one.  This could be remedied very easily by strengthening the consecutive sentence provisions in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission has not adverted to another reason for an <Col N="379" /> increase in the number of offences committed while people are on bail.  It is an issue which is challenging communities on a daily basis and that is drugs.  It is estimated that 75 per cent of criminal offences are drug related.  Every garda in the street will tell one that.  Let us examine the profile of the people committing those offences.  The offences are committed in disadvantaged areas by addicts with no access to regular funds. They commit the offences to get money to feed their addiction.  Irrespective of whether we change the bail laws and regardless of the restrictions we place on them, they will continue, both inside and outside prison, to want to feed that addiction.</P>
    <P>A multifaceted approach is required to deal with the major drug problem.  If we continue to interpret the problem in terms of law enforcement &mdash; I fear that Deputy O'Donoghue puts an undue emphasis on this &mdash; we will fail to address it.  We pretend to the public that we are addressing the problem but that is not good enough.  The introduction of new legislation, which we present as being tough on drug abuse and the drug barons, does not address the problem. We already have legislation to deal with drug barons.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1994 provides for the confiscation of the proceeds of crime.  It should be implemented.  When did we last hear of it being implemented?</P>
    <P>If we want to deal with our criminal justice system, it is crucial that we put in place a broadly based treatment programme. Addicts are very often pushers. They commit crime to get money to feed their addiction but also peddle drugs on a small scale.  The problem of crime and drug pushing is cyclical.  I know many of these people in the inner city.  They would love to escape from this cycle, go to a satellite clinic and join a programme which provides them with a heroin substitute, counselling and therapy.  The facilities are not there.  The only clinic on the northside of Dublin is in Amiens Street.  Other communities are organising against the location of <Col N="380" /> community treatment programmes in their areas.  This is one of the serious problems facing the Eastern Health Board at present.  We must be tough and ensure that people who are abusing drugs are treated in their local communities or we will never solve the problem.</P>
    <P>There is a ludicrous situation in the prison system at present.  While one State agency, the Eastern Health Board, promotes substitute maintenance, counselling and therapy, the prison authorities refuse to implement it.  They will not go along with the Eastern Health Board proposals.  As a result, detoxification in Mountjoy prison lasts five or seven days and it is cold turkey after that.  Naturally that void or vacuum will be filled by illegal drugs.  As I have said on other occasions, Mountjoy is the biggest drug centre in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We must deal with these issues and in doing so we will automatically reduce the number of crimes committed by people on bail.  The figures for 1994 indicate that out of 4,416 offences committed, 1,648 were burglary offences committed by suspects on bail; 2,217 were larceny offences and 547 fell into the category of other crimes.  By and large these are crimes against property and, even though there is no such breakdown in the figures, I believe they are largely drug related.  We must address these matters and we must adopt a multifaceted, multi-agency approach.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission proposes a number of legislative changes which should be examined.  We must review the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 and the court interpretation of consecutive sentences whereby judges suspend such sentences rather than making them truly consecutive.  These provisions must be strengthened.  We must also examine the estreatment of bail as recommended by the Law Reform Commission.  I was surprised to find that this was rarely enforced.  I thought estreatment was a regular occurrence if somebody breached the terms of their bail.  We now find it is not being implemented.  If somebody puts up a considerable sum <Col N="381" /> of money as bail, they should pay the price.  Bail conditions include the good behaviour and non-criminal activity of a suspect.  I cannot understand why the courts are not estreating bail.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1994, which we passed last year after the gardaí requested powers to confiscate the proceeds of crime, does not seem to be implemented.  Why is it not implemented?  Why is there no liaison with the Revenue Commissioners in relation to its implementation?  It is about time that heads were knocked together on this issue because agencies seem to be operating independently of each other with the minimum co-operation. I ask the Minister to address these questions.  There should be a new and specific offence covering breach of bail with which people could be charged and, when convicted, they could be sentenced.</P>
    <P>The most important issue, and one which was also referred to by the Law Reform Commission, is the substantial reduction of the pre-trial period.  We must examine this area.  I am reluctant to see us put large sums of money into a prison system which all of us in this House know is a disaster.  We have never been able to reform it properly. The fallout from that system is that the amount of money which is spent on it is not cost-effective.  No Government has come to terms with it in any substantial fashion.</P>
    <P>If we put a further programme in place costing about £80 million we will be putting 600 people &mdash; that is the immediate estimate &mdash; into prison on preventative detention, costing the State and the taxpayer another £20 million per annum on salaries and operational costs.</P>
    <P>People can be out on bail for months, almost years.  It is common to wait 18 months at present for a trial to take place.  If we put some of that money into enhancing the pre-trial procedures and ensuring that people were not out on bail for any lengthy period of time, that would eliminate the problem in the first instance of a long period between the <Col N="382" /> charge and trial.  If we must inject money, it would be better spent in either the provision of extra judges or dealing with the cumbersome procedure involved in the admissibility of evidence and preparation of books of evidence.  I urge that we look at that.  These, of course, are not my proposals although one or two of them might be.  These are the proposals which are inherent from the Law Reform Commission's report.</P>
    <P>All the proposals must be looked at. It would be rash indeed for us to embark on a constitutional referendum at this time since the Law Reform Commission has spent some 18 months compiling its report.  It has undertaken a lot of research.  It has conducted comparative work in other countries as well as looking at statistics here.  By the way, they discovered rather poor statistics at the Department of Justice in the prison section and, indeed, in the Garda Commissioner's reports.  A lot of new statistical work should be undertaken to ensure that statistics are reliable. Reliable statistics are not coming from either the Garda or the prison section at the Department of Justice.  That is a key area which should be addressed.</P>
    <P>In any case, I regard this proposal for an amendment to the Constitution as premature.  It has not come at the right time.  We have had two debates on it now without having had the benefit of studying the outcome of the deliberations of the Law Reform Commission. I have no doubt Deputy O'Donoghue will have another amendment to this effect a few months down the road, which would be the appropriate time.  I welcomed the first proposal in May as an opportunity to discuss the issues but it is now unnecessary, out of line and comes at the wrong time.  I do not know whether that was deliberate or not.  Certainly, we cannot have any meaningful discussion now.</P>
    <P>The debate in itself is welcome.  We must update our legislation to face new threats to society.  We have seen how the profile of the offender has changed over the years and the type of offence which is taking place now, the drug <Col N="383" /> offence, was virtually unknown in the seventies.  That is the changing criminal profile so we must adjust to it.  In doing so, we cannot discuss a legislative provision in a vacuum, without relating it to the offences for which it is intended.  If we find that 75 per cent of offences are now being committed by people who abuse drugs and if we find that type of offence lends itself to a further offence while a person is awaiting trial, we are clearly right to home in on this point but we must do it in a meaningful fashion, addressing all aspects of the problem.</P>
    <P>It must not be the old story which seems to be inherent in every Opposition. I cannot remember Fianna Fáil coming out strongly on these issues prior to the break-up of the Government last December.  It seems to be inherent in Opposition to seek political mileage by throwing legislation at problems, by shouting from the rooftops that one is going to be tough on crime, by saying that the way one will be tough on crime is by introducing tough legislation and by leaving it at that.</P>

      <P>I agree and disagree with Deputy Costello.  I agree with him in that the Opposition did not bring forward all this legislation when they were in Government. Certainly, the people would not be crying out for this kind of legislation to protect themselves from criminals who are running around the country, and rural Ireland in particular.</P>
      <P>I talked to a Garda sergeant on Monday in my constituency, where there have been a number of serious robberies recently.  Some of the suspects were in custody all day and they spent half the day making statements and then decided not to make a statement.  The Garda need the powers.  The powers are certainly not with the Garda at the moment; they are with the criminals. This House must return powers to the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday, I heard on the news that <Col N="385" /> for the first time in 40 years there was a reduction in crime in England.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, should talk to her counterpart in England to see what they did to achieve this because it is important that people can go to bed at night, feel they are safe in their beds and have a night's sleep in the knowledge that these thugs will not break in, rob them and speed away in high-powered cars.</P>
    <P>The other matter I want to address has nothing to do with the bail laws but I intend to speak on the bail laws next week when I get another opportunity. The Minister has my full support.  As far as I am concerned, she has done a good job since she was made Minister for Justice. It is a difficult job, one which is not easy to do because there will always be crime.  That said, we must give powers back to the Garda.  I ask the Minister, as a political favour and a favour to the people of this country, to put the gardaí back on the beat.  I ask the Minister to reopen the rural Garda stations that were closed by the previous administration. The stations in my own area at Louisburgh, Newport and Mulrany each had a sergeant and five to six gardaí stationed there.  At present there are no sergeants or gardaí in some of these places.  The gardaí must be put back on the beat and their powers restored.  The power cannot be given to the criminals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The points system was devised by the institutions of higher education as the fairest means to allocate places to students.</P>
      <P>The major strength of the points system is that it is objective, efficient and transparent.  It rewards achievement in the leaving certificate without reference to social position, school attended or other extraneous factors.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the points requirement for courses is determined by the demand for particular courses and the number of places available. Some courses will always be demanding points requirements, for example medicine.  I am not aware that anybody has advocated unlimited expansion of places on such courses. Such limits derive from the requirements for qualified personnel in such areas.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I am not disposed at this stage to establish a specific review as suggested by the Deputy.  However, if the Deputy or the institutions of higher education come forward with real alternatives which preserve the strength of the present system than I will listen attentively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>This question was put down in a constructive manner following consideration of the research data compiled by the Education Research Centre, in particular, for the purposes of the NCCA.  It is quite clearly shown, as a result of that research, that over 50 per cent of students either drop out of school or fail to attain an honour in the leaving certificate, 36 per cent fail to attain a single honour at higher level, 53 per cent attain fewer than two honours, 12 per cent do not even achieve a pass&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With respect, Ceann Comhairle, I am asking questions.  In the current year alone, 11 per cent of students are repeating the leaving certificate. Given those statistics, is it not clear to the Minister that a fundamental review of the points system and the examination system is needed and that there is nothing wrong with establishing such a review body?  Why will she not proceed proactively on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am mesmerised that a question put down by the Opposition spokesperson on education about reviewing the points system for universities &mdash; for our high achievers &mdash; results in a lecture about retaining people at school.  I refer the Deputy to the fact that a question has been put down on today's Order Paper about the Department of Education's response to those who leave the school system early, what the Department is doing and what changes have been put in place.  I ask the Deputy to wait for that information.</P>
      <P>It may be useful to share some of the research data available to the Department of Education with the Deputy. This data refers to a project in Dublin City University, from 1980 to 1985, which required students applying for places in the university to take an aptitude test.  The test was based on a scholastic attainment test used in the United States with appropriate modifications for an Irish setting.  The university looked for different information and also used the results of the leaving certificate and first year examinations.  I will make the research data from that project available to the Deputy.  It is interesting to note that the results of the project suggest that the leaving certificate is a good predictor of university performance compared with the alternative aptitude tests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IBEC has called for a review of the situation.  However, I repeat what I said <Col N="388" /> before, not in any facile way, that if the Deputy or institutions such as IBEC want to offer real alternatives to what is clearly seen as a very transparent assessment, I will listen.  I repeat, however, that the points system has been seen to be fair and people gain places without reference to social position, school attended or other extraneous factors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>No one is questioning the fairness or transparency of the points system.  What is being questioned is the degree to which the points system is determining behaviour and methodology in teaching, subject choices and dictating the entire second level curriculum. How does the Minister account for the variation in grades awarded in applied mathematics as opposed to grades awarded in English?  Why is music the least chosen subject on the leaving certificate curriculum?  The answer is that students will not accumulate enough points from music or art.  It is clear that a review of the system is needed.  The Minister is being less than imaginative or innovative on this issue. My party will certainly put forward proposals.</P>
      <P>As already stated, this question was put down in a constructive manner.  The Minister should be more open to my suggestions.  It is clear, from research data, that the points system is dictating what subjects are being taught in schools and the way in which they are taught.  That is a very detrimental influence for 50 per cent of students.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the original question which is quite specific.  The Deputy asked if I would consider the establishment of a special review body to undertake a fundamental and comprehensive analysis of the points system with a view to bringing forward recommendations to improve the system.  Questions which ask for the curriculum to be improved and enlarged, for changes to the curriculum for art and music, what I am doing to retain students&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the next occassion I come to the House to answer Oral Questions it might be helpful if that question were put down.  I will then provide the information available to me. The Deputy has suggested that all the research data shows that the points system dictates the second level curriculum. However, the one piece of research data specific to this question shows that the opposite is the case.  I am interested in sharing research data on recommendations to improve the points system with the Deputy but the other points he made relate to wider educational matters. I will inform the Deputy, through answers to other questions, about changes which are taking place in the education system to ensure that everyone, not just the high achiever, benefits from the State's massive investment in education.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Education &ldquo;Charting our Education Future&rdquo; stated that programmes will be developed relating to tobacco, alcohol, substance abuse and the promotion of healthy lifestyles.  These programmes will support schools in promoting the social, personal and health education of students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Initiatives are being taken in respect of substance abuse prevention.  A major programme of substance abuse education for second level schools has been developed jointly by the Departments of Education and Health in conjunction with the Mater Dei Counselling Centre. I launched this programme in October 1994.  It is being disseminated to second level schools generally with associated <Col N="390" /> in-career development for teachers.  At present the programme has been introduced to about 50 per cent of all second level schools and the dissemination and in-career development will continue during the current school year.</P>
    <P>I hope to give details in the near future of a substance abuse programme for primary schools.  Proposals are also being drawn up for a substance abuse awareness programme in primary schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, launched what she termed her emergency package to deal with the scourge of drugs and substance abuse in our society at a press conference in July of this year.  It was announced at the press conference that a substance abuse programme would be introduced in primary schools this September. However, it is clear from the Minister's response that this statement was premature and such a programme will not be put in place in primary schools this year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference between this September and this year.  The Deputy correctly referred to the initiative announced by the Minister for Justice.  At that stage I availed of the opportunity to disseminate the information on the second level schools programme &ldquo;My Own Two Feet&rdquo; which was launched in October 1994 and to set out our proposals for a primary schools programme.  That programme is being developed and it will be ready for introduction in schools this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>It must be remembered that there are already ongoing programmes in schools and that the success of &ldquo;My Own Two Feet&rdquo; is now being felt in schools.  The NCCA was invited to bring forward a programme on substance abuse along the lines of &ldquo;My Own Two Feet&rdquo;.  The health boards and the Garda Síochána are also <Col N="391" /> involved in the development of the programme. The development of the substance abuse prevention programme in schools cannot be seen as separate from relationships and sexuality education which are part of social, personal and health education in schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to other programmes but will she not agree that this is a priority programme which would be introduced in primary and second level schools?  She also said that information on &ldquo;My Own Two Feet&rdquo; had been disseminated in schools.  A number of the secondary schools I contacted still depend to a large extent on their programme organisers to initiate and put together proper substance abuse programmes.  Does the Minister have any plans to provide in-service courses for parents on the delivery of these programmes?  She has lacked urgency in dealing with this issue and has not given it the priority it deserves given the widespread concern in the community about substance abuse generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">

      <P>This programme is a priority.  The Deputy followed the debate which gave rise to the introduction of social, personal and health education in schools and he must acknowledge that there has been much action in this area.  This action takes on board the primary responsibility of parents to educate their children and their role in the education provided by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>There has been teacher training under the second level programme.  The two year pilot phase was very successful and we are widening the scope of the programme all the time. Sometimes these programmes are more successful when they are kept out of the headlines.  I am always mesmerised by the different views expressed by the schools to which Deputy Martin refers. <Col N="392" /> The Department of Education is very open to discussing with school managers any problems they have in the introduction of new programmes.  Will the Deputy indicate to those schools that the Department is interested in their problems?</P>
      <P>The programme for second level schools was introduced almost one year ago and in-service training, supported by the in-career development unit, was provided.  Of the 26 courses held, nine were in Dublin and three in Cork.  Each course lasts for 50 hours and caters for 15 teachers.  The programme is in operation in 400 second level schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have that information. I asked the Minister why she will not provide in-service training on substance abuse for parents of primary and second level students?  Parents are the key to the success of this programme and it cannot be operated in schools in isolation.</P>

      <P>Parents are consulted on the introduction of these programmes in schools.  The financial assistance made available by the Department of Education to parent associations is seen as giving parents a voice in the education of their children.  The information is disseminated in schools and if the Deputy can give me a reason teachers should be trained in this I will be interested in hearing it &mdash; Deputies on the other side of the House have not put forward many initiatives.  The in-service training has dealt with the teaching profession which, together with the school management, introduce these programmes in partnership with the parents.  During my time in office the Department of Education has not been found wanting in providing support for parent organisations through training and finance.  The in-service training provided by these organisations gives parents a voice in the education of their children.  I always welcome the views of parents on decisions relating to the education of their children.</P>

    <P>In preparing the Education Estimates it is the practice to critically examine enrolment data and estimated financial requirements of all schemes and programmes funded out of the Education Votes.  This is to ensure that their budgetary allocations are such as to enable them to be implemented with <Col N="394" /> maximum efficiency and cost effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The Deputy refers specifically to cutbacks in schemes under the aegis of my Department.  There are no financial cutbacks in 1995 in any of the schemes operated by my Department.  In some cases where VTOS courses relate to the 1995-96 school year, it has been necessary in order to meet the 1996 financial target, to reduce the intake in September of this year to last year's intake which is below the expansion of places which was originally planned.</P>
    <P>I should also remind the House that since I took up office there has been a major expansion in activity in the VTOS programme.  The average number of places taken up in 1992 was less than 2,000.  By 1995 this had more than doubled to 4,300.  The volume of activity in VTOS will not greatly change in 1996.</P>
    <P>To effect savings in 1996 it was proposed also to limit the increase in child care assistants to 70 instead of 100 as originally announced.  However, having reviewed the resourses available to me I have decided to approve the 100 posts as planned.  As the 1996 Education Estimates are at an early stage of negotiation the Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position today to speculate about possible changes in schemes under the aegis of my Department.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her answer, but she has not properly addressed the question.  What are her priorities regarding prospective cutbacks? The criteria appear to be cost effectiveness rather than what is needed in schools.  Would it not be cost effective to have a decent school psychological service, particularly in the light of recent cases of child abuse?  Intervention at an early age would, perhaps, prevent these awful scandals.  Will the Minister make the provision of a psychological service a priority in the context of her budget?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Would the Minister not also agree that it is extremely difficult for schools to plan and for teachers to have some confidence in the programmes upon which they are embarking when the <Col N="395" /> Department keeps stepping in and out? I am glad the Minister allowed the child care assistant posts to remain.</P>

      <P>There are priorities, and a Minister has a certain amount of flexibility in drawing up a budget.  My first priority is to retain total confidence in a system that will be able to educate our young people to perform in a changing society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the psychological services, there have been many changes in the educational system and a network of support is being put in place.  Funding for that has been increased each year. In the last year the psychological service got quite a big increase in funding and 100 extra guidance counsellors were appointed.  There is a particular role for guidance counsellors not just in guiding young people through the points system but in regard to personal guidance; we have set up a guidance institute and are bringing forward recommendations in that area.  The remedial service has been introduced to second level schools. There is now home/school liaison which creates a link between home and school. Sometimes children who need the remedial service also need guidance and psychological services.  A network of <Col N="396" /> support is being put in place.  I can assure the Deputy that any funding or increase in funding that comes to the Department is very much targeted towards those who need it most.  Sometimes it is quite helpful when Deputies criticise decisions that have been taken. None of us would say that the Department of Education wastes money but rather that it never has enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some sympathy with the Minister in that I agree that the Department of Education can never have enough money to spend in some areas.  However, I challenge her budgetary policy in the Department.  We have introduced a free third level education scheme but we still do not have an adequate psychological service and children suffering from behavioural problems may have to wait up to two years to see a doctor.  Such children may present with disorders because of child abuse.  That should focus our minds on what we are doing within our educational service.  The Minister got her priorities wrong this year.  In the upcoming year she should look again at primary level education and particularly at those damaged children.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that we should focus our minds. There is much evidence in the record of the House of the dramatic increases in funds that have been allocated.  We will keep increasing them but we need the support of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is disingenuous of the Deputy to suggest that the free fees initiative took funding from another sector.  Let me remind the Deputy that it was the abolition of the covenent tax relief that funded the introduction of free fees. However, that kind of distraction will not cause me to fall out with the Deputy when she asks me to focus my mind on those in primary school, particularly disadvantaged children.  From my early days here, when Members of the Deputy's party ridiculed me as the Minister for the disadvantaged, that has been my <Col N="397" /> priority and will continue to be as we focus our minds on the budget of 1996.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 7 together.</P>
      <P>Planning for a programme of inservice training in connection with the relationships and sexuality education programme is well advanced.  The programme will be finalised following receipt of the report of the implementation group which is working on the details of implementing the programme and the curricular guidelines being prepared by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  The preparation of an overall training strategy for the implementation of the relationships and sexuality programme has been a central element of the work of the implementation group.</P>
      <P>The circular which I issued to all schools in January proposed that schools would now begin to develop their policies with a view to starting to introduce programmes of relationships and sexuality education into schools in the 1995-96 school year.  This proposal received a very large measure of support from the partners in education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to assist schools in preparing for the introduction of the programme, three groups have been working with my Department for some months.  First, the National Council for Curriculum <Col N="398" /> and Assessment is developing curriculum guidelines, teaching and learning strategies and assessment/evaluation procedures.  Draft guidelines prepared by the council were issued to all schools in June.  Final guidelines will be prepared taking into account comments received on the draft guidelines.</P>
    <P>Second, an implementation group, representative of my Department, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the partners in education, is considering how best to implement the details of the programme. I expect to have a report from this group within a few weeks.</P>
    <P>Third, my Department has been working with the Department of Health on reviewing existing activities and teaching materials which have been developed by the health boards and a range of other organisations.  The proposals from this group are now being examined in both Departments and will be finalised before the end of October.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is the Minister so slow to introduce this programme?  The circular was issued in January and guidelines have been issued.  When I asked a question about this before the summer recess I was accused of wanting to delay the implementation of the programme. The Minister said that we should be careful to avoid giving encouragement to people who want to delay it.  I do not want to delay it, but it is incredible that, although we are well into the new school year, the final guidelines are not yet ready and no inservice training has been given to teachers or parents.  It is clear that the programme will not be ready for introduction until 1996.  It is typical of the Minister's approach that she makes announcements which are greeted with fanfare and establishes committees but nothing happens on the ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is apprehension among the teaching profession about the introduction of this programme. It has received tremendous support from all the partners including <Col N="399" /> owners, managers, parents and teaching bodies, but there is apprehension among teachers who teach the programme about the importance and success of the initiative.  They have strong views about essential training and support for teachers and the school community, the need to take things slowly, the training of teachers to include enabling them acquire the knowledge, understanding and necessary skills to teach the programme and the need to collaborate with parents and others in the area.  If it means that we hasten slowly but gain our objective, I am more than willing to play my part in that.</P>
      <P>I believe it was in May 1993 I indicated that I, as Minister, would set up a process begun by many other Ministers of including a module of sex education in schools.  I underestimated how long it would take to achieve that in partnership.  It is a measure of my <i>modus operandi</i> that if one of the partners believes that it needs more time, investment and consultation to achieve something people expect of the education system, I am prepared to move slowly and indicate, as I did during the Easter conference speeches, that rather than expect this programme to be operating in schools in September we will hasten slowly and look forward to its gradual introduction during this school year.  We should not underestimate the number of schools which operate such programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister announced it would be introduced by September.  I accept that she underestimated the length of time it would take to introduce the programme having regard to consultation with the partners.  However, I put it to her that it would be better, more effective and would avoid the creation of apprehension and confusion if, prior to major public announcements of initiatives such as this, she would enter into detailed consultations to arrive at some measure of agreement with the teachers and parents prior to making <Col N="400" /> politically nice sounding statements prematurely?</P>

I was asked about my responsibility as Minister for Education for the introduction of sex education in our schools.  I gave an undertaking at that stage that I would set about doing that. I have set about something other Ministers have set about, but none has quite succeeded.</P>

      <P>The Deputy asked why such a programme is not in our schools.  If previous Ministers had been successful in introducing such a programme, I would not be saying, &ldquo;let us hasten slowly&rdquo;.  We have not reached the position many previous Ministers sought to reach and we are about to reach it during this school year.  It has taken a little longer because of genuine apprehension among the teaching profession who will be responsible for introducing it in the classroom.  I have reacted positively to calls from the teacher unions which have been supportive of the concept of this programme and hastening slowly to enable their teachers to feel fully empowered before they take on the task of operating the programme.  Many schools are operating such a programme and those which are not are those that consider they have particular problems.  I <Col N="401" /> am concentrating on those schools and it was useful to have had a public discussion on the matter.  People are aware that I have had as much support from church and managerial bodies as I have had from teacher unions.</P>

      <asker>Mr. Martin</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Education</askee>
      <Quest>the reason an exact portion of the new £150 service charge for third level students was not specifically allocated to student services to be distributed in a democratic fashion by the students themselves in the context of their own democratic structures; and the reason the national students union, the USI, was not represented on the subcommittee of the Higher Education Authority that proposed this change.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I must correct the view that this is a new charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I introduced free undergraduate tuition fees the standard practice had been that the universities had included the charge for examinations, registration and student services with their tuition fees as a single payment.  In the Dublin Institute of Technology-RTC sector, tuition fees for ESF funded courses did not include this charge and <Col N="402" /> most Dublin Institute of Technology-RTC students paid the charge directly to the colleges.</P>
    <P>Students eligible for means tested support will have their grant increased by £150 to meet the cost of the charge.</P>
    <P>The working group did not recommend a specific breakdown of the £150 charge but rather that each college should set out publicly for the information of the student body how this amount is allocated as between examinations, registration and capitation for student services.</P>
    <P>In coming to this recommendation the working group had regard to the fact that the arrangements that apply in relation to student services vary from college to college.  In accepting its recommendation I was anxious not to be over-prescriptive but rather to allow flexibility to the colleges and their student bodies to arrive at arrangements most appropriate to their circumstances.</P>
    <P>The working group was established to make recommendations to me on the overall implementation of the free fees initiative.  The issue of the £150 charge was only one element in its deliberations.</P>
    <P>There was consultation with USI prior to the submission of the working group's report.  I personally met the USI in January and March.  After receiving the report I also met them in July.  There was also a meeting involving an official of my Department and a USI representative in April.</P>
    <P>The working group had regard for student concerns in recommending that (a) colleges should not be permitted to demand from students more than the maximum amount of £150; (b) colleges should set out publicly for the student body how the £150 would be allocated and (c) the arrangements to be put in place should not adversely affect the funding of student unions, clubs and societies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's decision not to specifically allocate a portion of the £150 to students directly has resulted in, for example, the students' <Col N="403" /> union in UCG getting £5.80 out of every £150, the one in Carlow regional technical college getting £5 and the union in UCD getting £7.  Does the Minister consider those figures adequate to support student services in those colleges having regard to the amount they received through the system prior to the introduction of free fees?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding those figures, we indicated to students and to the Higher Education Authority which was involved in the working group that we would try not to be too prespective at the outset.  There is a good student administrative committee in UCC where these matters are easily discussed. I thought it would be better if the colleges involved provided details of how the money is being divided and at the end of the year we could consider the success of this initiative.  We, in Marlborough Street, could have adopted a centralised approach to this area, one in which the Department of Education never had a role.  It is new territory.  A working group considered the matter.  We had a good deal of consultation with USI.  The anecdotel evidence of the effect this year will&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's decision and the manner in which this was organised has rolled back the clock ten years in so far as student unions are concerned. I was a member of the students' union in UCC ten years ago which initiated a referendum to bring in the capitation system whereby a certain portion of the fees were allocated to the <Col N="404" /> students to be distributed by them under the aegis of their own democratic structures.  The Minister had that option.  It is not a case of centralising&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am putting it to the Minister that she had the option of giving the students the power to receive a certain portion of funding and to redistribute it.  I put it to her also that some members of the Government were successful administrators of the national students union, including the Ministers of State, Deputies Rabbittee and Gilmore, and others in the Labour Party. Is the Minister now trying to crush the power and influence of students unions? That is what the students believe.  They believe that the authorities are taking over the allocation of funding to student services.  The power and influence of the union is being whittled away because of the decisions taken in relation to the £150 charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of whittling away any power and indeed I have always maintained the position of recognising USI as the group which represents the student body.  When I was involved in student politics all the higher education colleges were members of USI and the smaller colleges were beginning to take their place. This decision was made following consultation and a degree of concern expressed by the student body that the £150 would be buried in the fees initiative and the need to separate the two.  I have made the announcement.  We have capped the £150 and we have asked each college to set out publicly for the information of the student body how this amount is being allocated between examinations, registration and capitation for student services.  I await the effects of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <P>The implementation of the stay safe programme at classroom level in each individual case follows agreement between the board of management, the teacher and the parents involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Minister's reply.  I ask her to reconsider making the stay safe programme mandatory for a number of reasons.  The Minister could allow individual parents to restrict their children participating in the programme.  The main reason she should embark upon this course is because of the awful sexual abuse scandals that have come to light in the past few months and the increasing number of revelations.  We are talking about the most vulnerable people in our society. The scale of recent revelations is horrifying but if we had a system whereby we could be assured that every school operated such a programme, it would at least stem the tide in this area.</P>

      <P>This programme started in the Eastern Health Board area and has been made widely available only in the past number of years.  I am awaiting the evaluation report on the stay safe programme in primary schools from the inspectorate and I will be making that available at the end of September.  I want to encourage schools to adopt the stay safe programme without prescription.  Approximately 80 per cent of schools are operating the programme and that is a satisfactory outcome when one considers that the programme was initially made available only in the Eastern Health Board area. A survey of the stay safe programme has been carried out and I believe the reassurance of parents will encourage the last remaining schools to consider operating the programme.  The vast majority of parents surveyed expressed satisfaction with it.  There was a strong endorsement of the programme from 73 per cent of the chairpersons of boards. A total of 79 per cent of school principals, 88 per cent of teachers and 98 per cent of parents also endorsed the programme. Of the 3,310 primary schools <Col N="407" /> surveyed, 99.7 per cent have now availed of teacher training, 80 per cent have held meetings for parents and just under 60 per cent are already involved in the programme.  Given the support of parents and managers and the continuing support of the teachers unions who have publicly declared their support for this programme, I expect we will move towards full availability of the stay safe programme without resorting to prescription or circulars.</P>

      <P>I am happy to concur with the Minister that where the stay safe programme has operated it has been extremely successful and I am glad to hear the figures she has quoted.  I would say to her, however, that school subjects are mandatory and something as basic as the protection of our children should be mandatory also.  I ask her to seriously consider this.  Schools can be persuaded in this regard but it will take time and we do not have that time when we are talking about vulnerable children.  I urge the Minister to reconsider this matter. School subjects are important but our children are much more important.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the commitment in the White Paper to the development of the health in school programme.  The health in school programme can include programmes which do not come under the specific stay safe programme.  In endorsing the stay safe programme we say to parents that it meets the needs of children. It has grown from a small localised scheme to one which covers the entire educational system.  The training has been completed and there is a network of 40 teachers for the support programmes. Through the development of a health in school programme, students are empowered to take decisions in regard to sex education.  Had a magic wand been waved a couple of years ago we would not have in place the material, the training for teachers and the support of parents.  I am confident we will look back on this time and say that within the <Col N="408" /> health in school programme, for which each school has responsibility, the needs of the children today will be met in a way they were not met for their parents.</P>

      <P>The Higher Education Authority has advised me on the number of places to be provided for Higher Diploma in Education courses in all the colleges which provide these courses.  I have accepted the authority's recommendation, which will afford H. Dip graduates a reasonable prospect of following a career in teaching, while ensuring that there is a sufficient number of qualified teachers to meet the needs of the second level system.</P>
      <P>H. Dip courses train graduates as second-level teachers.  Newly-trained second-level teachers are finding it very difficult to get permanent employment. If I abolished the quota I would be making a difficult situation worse.  I have no plans to rescind the quota fixed by the authority for University College Cork.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that a number of students select their leaving certificate subjects every year and subsequently go on to select their degree subjects with the specific intention of taking teaching as a career?  Those students are actively encouraged by their career guidance teachers.  What right have these students when, having completed their third level education, they cannot take a professional qualification that will enable them to take up employment as teachers?  In respect of Cork specifically, what saving has been made to the Exchequer by putting a quota on the number of entrants to the higher diploma course?  What would be the cost to the Exchequer if that quota was lifted in the morning?</P>

      <P>I cannot give the Deputy the pounds, shillings and pence breakdown.  Many students studying for the leaving certificate, with the active encouragement of their career guidance teachers, who set their sights on a particular career may not reach their goal. The Deputy said they come to the end of their degree course and are not encouraged or are prevented from doing the training to find a job.  I can give the Deputy some interesting statistics which I gave to the House last year. A survey, which was responded to by 585 higher diploma graduates, was conducted on what happens to higher diploma students.  Some 5.1 per cent had got permanent teaching posts in Ireland; 55 per cent had part-time, temporary or substitute teaching posts.  Some 5.1 per cent obtained posts compared with 10.8 per cent in 1983.  If we go back to my time in the teaching profession the employment rate for higher diploma graduates was 57.6 per cent.  Those who are guiding children towards teaching must not use the information of their own time.  I was in the teaching profession at a time when the employment rate for higher diploma graduates was nearly 60 per cent.  The recent survey conducted by the Department shows that employment for higher diploma graduates has fallen to 5.1 per cent. Deputies and people in Cork, in particular, who encourage students towards teaching because it has employment prospects do not recognise the reality of the demographic trend in the school system today.</P>

      <P>It is unsatisfactory that the Minister is unable to tell the House the financial basis on which the quota was imposed and the savings that will be made as a result of this quota.  It has always been the practice to take a broader view of education.  A number of newly qualified teachers have left this country to teach in European and American schools and to do a great deal of work furthering education in the Third World and developing countries. Is the Minister saying we will no longer <Col N="410" /> train and enable teachers to follow in that proud tradition?  Is the Minister saying this country will never again train second level teachers who can fill such posts in European countries from which they may return to education, a few years down the road, bringing the linguistic and other skills they have learned from teaching abroad?  That is a very narrow view.  A time will come when there will be a scarcity of teachers in second level education as there now is in the first level education.</P>

      <P>Yes, I agree.  The Minister said today that when people like us raise issues here they sometimes cause her to re-enter a case and a decision made by a body such as the Higher Education Authority, who may be further away from the realities of the classroom than the Minister or I.  Will the Minister consider it in the broader terms I have put to her?</P>

      <P>That was a wonderful speech by the Deputy which implied we had saints and scholars in Salamanca and wherever.  Even if the Deputy thinks, given the demographic trends and the patterns of fertility in Ireland now, teachers will return to teach at any stage with the language skills and experience gained abroad, as Minister for Education I have to be more realistic in the advice I take and in the encouragement I give to people about teaching.  The schools were bursting at the seams in the 1970s.  Today there is a dramatic drop in the fertility rate which means there will be 600,000 fewer children in the system.  I have no reason to doubt those figures which are the long term forecast for the drop in the school-going population.  I suggest it is not sound advice to send trained teachers abroad without being able to say they will come back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can go back to how this was examined and I can give the statistics.  At one stage there was a recommendation to <Col N="411" /> close some of the Department's higher education courses in the universities. Following a re-examination the Higher Education Authority, whose remit is to advise the Minister, made these recommendations. I say to the Deputy, parents, career guidance counsellors and to children, that the employment rate for graduates in Ireland is satisfactory but the job prospects for graduates with a higher diploma in education who wish to go for teaching is not as rosy.</P>

      <P>Had the Minister received phone calls, as I did, in May, June and July from anguished students &mdash; mature enough to make up their mind without encouragement from me &mdash; who have committed themselves to a career in teaching and have lost out last year and again this year because of the imposition of a quota, would she not give these students a break?  They feel cheated because they were under the impression when they started the BA they could follow through in the traditional way and do the H.Dip.  That expectation has now been dashed by the Minister.  If she had organised it so that all new entrants from next year onwards could not expect to pursue the H.Dip., that would have been just but there is no justice in the way the Minister has dealt with these students.  Many of the 55 per cent engaged in part-time teaching will progress to permanent positions. The Minister will be aware from the early retirement negotiations that teachers now obtain permanent jobs later in their career than ten years ago and many students are prepared to take part-time positions for four or five <Col N="412" /> years.  The Minister should rectify that injustice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only fair to students, particularly students in Cork, that we put the record straight.  We are talking about a cohort of students who entered college in 1992.  In 1991 there were 132 places on the H.Dip. course in Cork but in 1995-96 there are 185 places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the facts. The Deputy said that the students had unfair expectations but they went to college in 1991 when there were only 132 H.Dip. places and now there are 185 places.  The number of students doing the H.Dip declined.  There was a recommendation to reduce the number of education departments from five to two which the Higher Education Authority was asked to examine and it recommended in its report of July 1991 that the five education departments should stay but that a quota system should be introduced.  It recommended a quota of 500 &mdash; I was not in the Department of Education at that time &mdash; and that the intake should be restricted from the beginning of the academic year 1992-93. At that stage I asked it to review its recommendations in the light of the demands and the improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio and we arrived at 800 places which is the number now available.  It must be remembered that there is postgraduate training for national school teachers.</P>
      <P>We are educating young people for the teaching profession, in a system where the numbers are dropping dramatically despite an improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio.  We are saying to students, their parents &mdash; who think of teaching as a very safe profession &mdash; and their guidance teachers that there are many other degree courses which students may take.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have accepted the Higher Education Authority's recommendation which <Col N="413" /> stood at 500 in another Minister's time but now stands at 800.  It is putting a wrong slant on it to say that I have cancelled places.  There are 185 places available to students in Cork who wish to pursue the H.Dip. but the employment prospects are none too bright.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the quota subject specific as a situation could arise quite quickly where there might be a shortage of teachers of science, maths or basic subjects?  My information is that the quota is not subject specific and I would like the Minister to clarify this.  Perhaps she could demonstrate at a later date the savings to the country from the introduction of the quota.  The country has made investment in the young person's education from primary school through to university.  There is only one more year to do in order to obtain a professional qualification and now the person is being denied that.  Since the music hall ditty &ldquo;Don't put your daughter on the stage, Mrs. Worthington&rdquo; I have not heard such a passionate plea for not entering a child for teaching. That is unworthy of a country that has always prided itself in its education system.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Quill for making that very interesting point and for her contributions to the debate in this House.  In asking if the H.Dip. is subject specific, the Deputy has highlighted an area that is causing concern, that is, how to make best use of the 800 places that have been allocated for the H.Dip.  I intend to follow this up.</P>
      <P>I will try to put figures on the savings that will arise from the introduction of a quota.  It will be interesting to try to put figures on the savings that will arise if students find alternative jobs and do not go into teaching.  It would be helpful if the Deputy could be more specific in the information she is looking for.  The information from the Higher Education Authority is that graduates who do not go into teaching have excellent job prospects.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the imposition of a quota normally has the reverse effect in that it stimulates demand and furthermore that in spite of the demographics there are schools in the primary sector that cannot get trained teachers because things do not work out that easily?  By definition, if schools are allowed to choose teachers will we not have to train more than the exact requirement? Would she not agree that when one takes the requirements of all Irish language schools and for different subjects we will find in a large number of cases that we will have sufficient teachers with specific qualifications and that the basic right of someone who did a degree with a view to teaching is being denied when there is a lottery for H.Dip places?  Will the Minister confirm that half the places for the H.Dip are allocated on merit and the other half are allocated by lottery and those who go to university will not have the opportunity to chose teaching even though that is their chosen career.</P>

It recommended that given the demographic trends the quota should be 500. Last year we initiated extra teacher training for primary level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention to secure the integrity of the school year was signalled well in advance.  It was clearly outlined in the Green Paper on Education &mdash; Education for a Changing World &mdash; in June 1992 and in the White Paper on Education &mdash; Charting our Education Future &mdash; in April, 1995, <Col N="416" /> both of which were widely circulated to school authorities and other interested bodies.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the commitment outlined in the White Paper, circulars on Time in School were issued to primary and second-level schools on 11 August 1995.  They confirmed the position which is that schools must be in operation for a minimum of 183 days at primary level and 167 days at second level.</P>
      <P>Following the issue of the circulars I was anxious to facilitate schools requiring further clarification on specific aspects of the circulars.  To this end I arranged for officers of my Department to staff helplines to assist schools in dealing with implementation problems. I believe that the action I have taken will ensure that the integrity of the school year will be safeguarded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that school principals begin to put their timetables in place for the forthcoming year in the spring and that before schools close for the summer holidays the timetables are in place and teacher allocations have been agreed?  Will she also accept that sending a circular on 11 August in respect of the school year that breaches an already established timetable is the work of somebody who has no idea about how schools are run and how school timetables are designed or administered?  It is nothing short of a scandal to treat schools in that manner and to expect them to revisit and revise painstakingly worked out and agreed timetables.  I ask the Minister to accept that it is a scandal.  She must also accept that this has been a feature of recent times in the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was involved in education for over 25 years in one way or another until eight and a half years ago.  There is now a chasm between school principals and the Department of Education that was never there in my time.  This is due to poor communication, badly timed circulars being sent out by the Department and a total lack of proper consultation in advance.  In my day I never saw the <Col N="417" /> Department of Education spend so much money on PR and so little on proper and necessary communication with school principals, teachers and those who deliver education in the classrooms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>We extended nothing in the context of the school circulars. We reaffirmed the current position, the rules as laid down by earlier circulars that there were 183 days at primary level, 167 days at second level, and defined the length of the school day and half-day.  While it has been argued that schools had arranged their timetables, this circular did not require schools to change the timetable once it was in operation for the required number of days per annum and hours per week. Where there was an excessive number of half-days we were seeking a change of timetable.</P>
      <P>The Department in this circular &mdash; which was well signalled in advance &mdash; secured the school day.  I have met principals who have thanked me for the circular because they have not timetabled excessive half-days.  They have timetabled within the prescribed number of days and hours as laid down by the Department of Education.  Schools that have not been involved in raising a storm have abided by the timetable.</P>
      <P>The circular did not extend the school week.  It asked the schools to devise their own timetables according to their own requirements as long as they met the laid down and accepted time of the school day.  It did not seek to pre-empt the outcome of the talks because the subject of the additional six days was excluded from the circular.  Schools that are having no difficulty with the Time in School circular have been timetabling according to the times and days laid down by the Department of Education.</P>

I thought the Minister would easily identify with the fact that most people are on holidays on 11 August; I am sure the Minister was on holidays on that date as I was.

      <P>Some schools had developed the habit of bringing in infants over several weeks.  In this circular I did not add one extra hour to the school day as laid down and required by the Department of Education. However, I am not totally heartless and where schools over-reached themselves in timetabling half-days that were not covered by the Department's regulations and where they had specific problems because the circular was issued in August we set up a helpline and have been involved with principals in the timetabling.  The timing of the circular was a result of the delicate negotiations that were going on earlier. Where there were difficulties they were due to people changing the school day as prescribed by the Department.  We have told schools that if they have difficulty in implementing the circular this year they should contact us.  In the Department we not only have helplines and a freephone line but we have <Col N="419" /> installed a communications centre so that people can communicate with the Department about necessary changes as the system of the Department moves forward.</P>

I put it to the Minister that it is about time she acknowledged those teachers who put in extra hours above and beyond the call of duty, organise concerts, coach various sports teams, etc.  The Minister may well nod, but they are going to start billing her and her Department for the hours put in after school hours and, if we get into a regimented overregulated system like that pertaining across the water, we will diminish and devalue the system that we have at present.  The education system as we know it depends largely on extra commitment, above and beyond the call of duty, from our teaching profession.</P>

      <P>There seems to be some confusion about the title of this Bill, particularly the number of the amendment &mdash; 15 &mdash; because No. 12 seems to have been skipped in the course of constitutional amendments.  It may give rise to difficulties in the future. I understand that No. 12 was skipped because it was defeated.  The normal procedure is to then renumber the amending Acts from the start.  We had before this Nos. 13 and 14 from the last set of amendments but we have no No. 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the foundation of this party in 1985, the Progressive Democrats have been at all times seriously concerned about the difficulties to which the 1937 Constitution gives rise.  We said so at our foundation and about two years <Col N="479" /> later we published a new draft constitution with a full commentary on it.  The new draft constitution was a much shorter and less complex document than the existing Constitution.  It sought also to reflect, give expression to and vindicate matters and rights of fundamental importance and to do so in a manner which would be permanently valid for the future in any pluralist, democratic Republic in part or all of this island.  In particular, we chose to advocate dropping from the Constitution the many specific and detailed provisions which tend to reflect a particular type of social thinking prevalent in Europe in the 1930s and to replace that redundant and superseded approach with a more concise recital of fundamental principles that one could expect to remain universally true and valid.</P>
    <P>Part, at least, of our thinking in this respect was governed by the more than 200 years experience of the Constitution of the United States which, in a most complex society, has stood the test of time notwithstanding the size, diversity and racial and ethnic mix of the United States.  It is interesting to reflect that, currently, one of the most harmful consequences of a provision in the US Constitution arises from something that was seen as relevant in the 18th century but is certainly not so now, namely, the provision guaranteeing the right of individual citizens to bear arms.  Our Constitution is redolent with such specific and dated provisions, but we have not learned any lessons.</P>
    <P>Before the 30th anniversary of our Constitution, the late Seán Lemass saw the need for major amendment of it.  As we approach its 60th anniversary now, it is abundantly clear that the need for major and radical reform is urgent and pressing.  Replacement is the only really feasible option.</P>
    <P>The Government is now proposing in this Bill, with the agreement and support of the Fianna Fáil Party, to add to <Col N="480" /> the detail and complexity and to seek to reflect, to the greatest extent that it can, a particular social view.  The Bill in effect makes legislative rather than constitutional proposals but, because it does so in a constitutional framework, it makes their future amendment extremely difficult, even when it becomes abundantly clear that huge problems will have arisen as a result of their interpretation at some time in the future by the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>In our draft constitution, the Progressive Democrats simply omitted any reference to divorce so that the matter could be dealt with by the Legislature. However, it seems that it may well not now be sufficient, as I had once thought, simply to delete Article 41.3.2º from the Constitution.  Amending the present Constitution in a piecemeal fashion, as it has been over the years, is quite different to and much less satisfactory than adopting a new Constitution which omits the more manifest defects of the 1937 document.  If one is making a single issue amendment, as in this case, one has to read the amendment in the light of the remainder of the Constitution. That requirement has not been taken on board by the draftsmen in this Bill.  If this provision is passed by the Oireachtas and accepted by the people in a referendum, the new Article 41.3.2º will have to be read in conjunction with the remainder of the Constitution and, in particular, with the provisions of Articles 41, 42 and 44.  It will clearly be in conflict with the ethos and premise underlying those Articles.  I am not clear how the Supreme Court will reconcile the obvious conflict.  Neither can the Minister be clear as to how the new provision will be interpreted or how the conflicts will be resolved.</P>
    <P>This problem arose before in the amendments to Article 29.  The treaties listed in the amendments made to that Article were clearly in conflict with numerous other provisions of the Constitution. To overcome the difficulty the <Col N="481" /> amended Article 29.4.3 includes the following:</P>
    <P>No provision of this Constitution invalidates laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the State, necessitated by the obligations of membership of the Communities or prevents laws enacted, acts done or measures adopted by the Communities, or institutions thereof, from having the force of law in the State.</P>
    <P>The same need and the same principles surely must apply here to avoid this conflict and to avoid the possible undermining of the very restrictive form of divorce proposed in this amendment.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, to prevent internal conflicts in the Constitution and to avoid detailed legislative provisions in the Constitution, this amendment should read along the following lines:</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Constitution, a Court designated by law may grant a dissolution of marriage where it is satisfied that all the conditions prescribed by law are complied with.</P>
    <P>If the phrase &ldquo;notwithstanding any other provision of this Constitution&rdquo;, or something like it, is not used, it means the Supreme Court, in interpreting the proposed amendment, will have to read the remainder of the Constitution and, in particular, the remainder of Article 41 in conjunction with it.  This will give rise to a veritable minefield of difficulties. Will the various references in Article 41 to &ldquo;the Family&rdquo; be interpreted as applying to the first family or to the second family?  If there are two families as a result of two marriages, how can the rights of the family be described as &ldquo;inalienable and imprescriptible&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Family&rdquo; is referred to with such awe in Article 41 that it takes on an almost supernatural aura.  Although it is not a proper noun, it is spelt with a capital letter wherever it is used and some extravagantly reverential statements are <Col N="482" /> made about it and philosophical guarantees &ldquo;antecedent and superior to all positive law&rdquo; are given in relation to it. How can detailed provisions for divorce be contained in such an Article?</P>
    <P>The obvious conflict between this amendment, if made, and the remainder of the Article will be litigated at great length and cost and will give rise to huge uncertainty for a long time.  The part of Article 41 where &ldquo;the State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of Marriage ... and to protect it against attack&rdquo; seems to be incompatible with what is now proposed will immediately follow it.</P>
    <P>I make this argument not to oppose the availability of divorce, which I support, but to express my concern that the passage of this amendment, in this form and without the qualifying words I have suggested, may well result in divorce in practice not being available at all.  Even if it is available, the resolution of all the conflicts and incompatibilities will give rise to an endless legal quagmire and will in practice deprive suffering people of what I believe should be their legal right to remarry, if their marriages have irretrievably broken down.</P>
    <P>The whole premise on which Article 41 is based is that in all circumstances there can only be one family.  That seems to be borne out by section 3.3 which would immediately follow the proposed amendment.  If passed in its present form we will have the somewhat ludicrous and totally anomalous situation that the Constitution will recognise divorces obtained in Ireland but will give no recognition to foreign divorces.</P>
    <P>Article 42 recognises the family as the primary and natural educator of the child and guarantees to respect the inalienable right and duty of parents to provide for the education of their children. After a divorce who, for the purposes of Article 42, are the parents?  Are they the original parents or are they one of the natural parents and his or her new spouse?  There is no point in trying <Col N="483" /> to enact law to solve these questions. These are constitutional and not legal provisions.  No law has any effect as against them.  It must surely be starkly clear to anyone who wants to see that laying down what in effect is detailed social legislation in the Constitution is the height of foolishness.</P>
    <P>We already know this with total certainty from the litigation that arose out of the 1983 amendment on abortion. That was a shorter and less complex amendment than now proposed and it was much less in conflict with other provisions in the Constitution than the proposal in this Bill.  Nonetheless look at what happened.  The X case was tortuous. The High and Supreme Courts were convulsed by what they had to decide.  The judgment was unsatisfactory from virtually every point of view and it necessitated no less than three constitutional referenda in its wake, two of which were passed and one of which was rejected.  What we are now doing is even more fraught with difficulty.  Every word of the 14 lines of this amendment will be dissected and fought about in many of the more bitterly contested divorce actions.  The discretion which a court should have to do what seems fair and reasonable in the particular circumstances of a case is taken away from it. It is not just hamstrung by convoluted legislation; it is handcuffed by a convoluted Constitution.  Where is the justice in that?</P>
    <P>A recent statement by lawyers who specialise in family law calculated that the actual waiting period for a divorce in many cases will be eight years.  If a marriage has irretrievably broken down, where is the justice in that, particularly for a woman?</P>
    <P>If we must have detailed provisions in our Constitution about divorce, how can we justify not having one word about nullity?  Nullity is a far more drastic remedy, with much greater consequences for those involved and their <Col N="484" /> children, than is divorce.  Annulment after 20 years of marriage and several children is a mere fiction but somehow, for many people, nullity is respectable and divorce is anathema.  We all know why but why does our approach have to reflect the views of one church only?  It is a requirement of the Catholic Church in many countries that before an application for nullity will be heard, a civil divorce must be obtained.  Will that now become a requirement here?  If the church insists on it in other countries why does it condemn it so unreservedly here?</P>
    <P>It is necessary to remind the House once again that this is a Republic and that we are legislating for all its people. If we fail to do so, should we be surprised by the reaction in the North?  Or is it the truth that, like the Unionists, a majority here is happily partitionist? Above all else a republic cherishes its minorities and values its diversity.  Do we?</P>
    <P>The proper course for the Government now is to withdraw the form of amendment it is proposing and substitute one which allows the terms and conditions for divorce to be spelled out in law.  It is no excuse to say that something is sensitive and therefore its terms must be put in the Constitution so that it cannot easily be changed.  If Mr. Haughey had taken that approach as a cop out, we would now have an Article in our Constitution requiring a healthy 25 year old to obtain a doctor's prescription to enable him to buy a condom.  We might find it difficult to change something even as patently stupid as that.  If the House approves the provisions in this Bill it will pass a vote of no confidence in itself as a Legislature.  It will be a celebration of its own mediocrity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment to the Constitution to allow persons who have been separated for some years, and between whom there is no hope of reconciliation, to divorce and to be allowed to marry again.  I have on the <Col N="485" /> past three evenings had the opportunity of calling on people in their homes in parts of County Dublin and in a rural part of County Westmeath to discuss this issue.  I intend to continue to do so throughout the country.  I hope, in what I say today, to reflect on some of the concerns and views that were raised personally with me.</P>
      <P>Social circumstances have changed dramatically in the past 20 years in Ireland.  The number of persons whose marriages have broken down, without hope of reconciliation, has greatly increased.  Some marriages have broken up fairly amicably because of basic incompatibility and some have had their marriages annulled by their church. Others have had little choice but to end their marriage relationship because of violence, abuse or the effects of chronic substance addiction.</P>
      <P>Some of the people in these tragic situations have remained single but would like to know that they have the opportunity to remarry.  Others have already set up home and have had children with a new partner, but their new relationship does not have any of the legal protections that go with a State-recognised marriage.  Apart from the lack of the formal and social status conferred by marriage, these couples have lesser rights than married couples in aspects of taxation, of succession rights, of rights to guardianship, and of rights to maintenance in the event that the relationship breaks up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me be more specific so that people can see why a right to the option of remarriage is important.  The rights that cohabitees do not have, but that they can gain if they are allowed to remarry, are as follows: (1) Although cohabitants may obtain maintenance for children, they have no claim for maintenance for themselves.  (2) Where parents are unmarried, the right of guardianship automatically vests in the mother only and not in both parents, as it will if they are married.  The father <Col N="486" /> would have to apply to court to obtain rights of guardianship.  This could be contested, and costly in some circumstances. (3) While the courts may make property adjustment orders on granting a decree of judicial separation, there is no similar power to adjust the capital assets of cohabitants no matter how long they may have been cohabiting or how much they may have contributed to one another's assets.  The general law of property applies.  (4) Unlike a spouse, a cohabitant has no rights of succession to the other's estate.  (5) Unlike a married spouse, a cohabitant has no statutory right to occupation or special protection of the home in which he or she resides.</P>
    <P>I hope that those who think we do not need the right to remarriage, because cohabitation is sufficient or that things will arrange themselves, will reflect on these important legal points that I have just listed.</P>
    <P>Marriage breakdown is a tragedy.  It is second only to bereavement in the pain that it causes.  Unfortunately, the pain would not be mitigated by the State forcing couples to stay together after their marriage has actually broken down.  Irish law already recognises this and already makes arrangements for people to separate.  Our law no longer forces people to stay married in other than the most formal sense, but our law does continue to stop them from marrying someone else.  I believe that social stability would be promoted if persons whose marriages had broken down irretrievably after a long period of separation were allowed by the State to remarry.  This could allow them to create the most stable possible environment in which to rear the children they have through remarriage.</P>
    <P>Some have argued that divorce will create additional costs for the State. Marriage breakdown and the splitting of households almost always creates the possibility of additional social welfare costs falling on the State.  The problem arises because of marriage breakdown, <Col N="487" /> not because remarriage may be allowed. Indeed, it could be said that remarriage creates at least the possibility that new and more stable financial circumstances can be created in some cases which might relieve the State of some of the costs it would have to meet in continuing to support lone parents.</P>
    <P>In parallel with the provision of the right to remarry, I undertake that the Government will do everything possible to support families and to help keep marriages working well.  Fiscal, social and educational policies will all be reviewed in order to strengthen the bonds that keep families together.  In the short time since this Government has come to office we have supported the establishment of the first ever all party Dáil Committee on the Family, chaired by Deputy Paul McGrath, and an official Commission on the Family has been announced by the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Proinsias De Rossa.</P>
    <P>These parallel initiatives will allow the first ever review in the history of the State of how Government policy can help couples in the task of making families work.  All persons of good will, whatever their political or social viewpoints, will be invited to be involved in these important initiatives in support of the family.  This review of family support policy is being undertaken simultaneously at both political and official level to maximise its effectiveness.  The Government will also shortly be establishing a Cabinet sub-committee on the rights of children in accordance with the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>We must look objectively and clear-sightedly at all the circumstances that can help to keep families together, and at those that push them apart.  Over the past 30 years the focus of social progress has been concentrated on enhancing the rights and social status of women and men in the workplace.  Over the next 30 years I hope that the focus for social <Col N="488" /> development will be in enhancing the rights and social status of children, women and men within stable and caring families that provide all with the psychological reassurance we need to face the ups and downs of life.</P>
    <P>I would now like to say something about the role that courts can and will play in mitigating the adverse effects on children of marriage breakdown and, indeed, of the divorce that may or may not follow from it.  The courts already play a role in ensuring as far as possible that the psychological as well as the material needs of children are met in separation cases, and they will do so in divorce cases also.  The Guardianship of Infants Act, which will form part of the divorce legislation, provides that:</P>
    <P>in any proceedings before any court, on the custody, guardianship or upbringing of an infant, or on the administration of any property belonging to or held on trust for an infant, or the application of the income thereof, is in question, the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
    <P>This has been interpreted by the courts to include the physical, intellectual, religious, social and moral welfare, as well as the financial welfare, of the child.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that at present the courts have available to them the possibility of suggesting that children be assessed by psychologists or by the probation and welfare services.  This involves the assessment of both the parents and children outside the atmosphere of the courts, and often assists judges in arriving at decisions focused on the paramount welfare of the children.</P>
    <P>Of course, none of this prevents children suffering the consequences of marriage breakdown which the State cannot prevent.  As it is, 4,000 couples a year are involved in legal actions in regard to <Col N="489" /> marriage breakdown.  We can and will seek to mitigate its effects on children as best we can.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will forgive me if I conclude my contribution by putting it in a personal and party context.  On the day I was elected leader of my party in 1990, I said:</P>
    <P>Fine Gael has the political courage to place difficult social decisions before the Irish people.  Fine Gael has the realism and the compassion to raise the issue of divorce.  We believe that our laws should reflect social reality, and that the present situation gives insufficient protection and reassurance to those caught in the reality of broken marriages, particularly to the children.  The interest of children in having a supportive family environment will be of paramount concern in all our work on this subject. Indeed, it is concern for children and their future, for the long term as well as for today and tomorrow, that drives our policy on economic matters as well.</P>
    <P>I believe that this legislation and the accompanying work we are doing to support the family can be seen as fulfilling that commitment I gave on assuming the leadership of the Fine Gael Party almost five years ago.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Before dealing with the detail of the proposed amendment to the Constitution, I must clarify a few basic facts.  I fully respect the right of the people to vote on this issue.  As a result, I have no objection in principle to the proposal to amend Article 41.3.2º being put to the <Col N="490" /> people.  If I was unwilling to do that, I would be denying the people their right to decide.  As someone who values the ultimate sanction of the people in all cases in relation to our Constitution, it is reasonable to respond to a public demand for a vote on the issue. However, I want to clarify that voting for a referendum does not imply support for the proposal.  We will vote on Second Stage on whether this issue should be put to the people.  I will deal with certain details in relation to the proposal on Committee Stage.  Anyone who tries to suggest that those who vote on whether we should have a referendum are supporting the proposal or are hypocritical are being unfair.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that no matter how much consensus exists in this House, there are different views on divorce. Everyone admits that it is too close to call at this stage.  It is important that diversity is recognised and allowed for on such a fundamental issue.  We cannot afford to ignore the strong feelings of so many people.  The effort, therefore, by some parties to ensure that only one view is put across in the House is a disservice to the Dáil as the people's representative body.  I congratulate my party leader for his courage in allowing a diversity of opinion on the matter, but I regret that such diversity has not been allowed in the other parties.</P>
    <P>I protest at any effort by the Government to use State funds to advocate this issue.  A referendum must be decided by the people without public money pushing one side or the other.  It is also important that information given by the Government about this campaign should be accurate and not propagandist. Unfortunately, the information given to date has been both.</P>
    <P>Marriage breakdown is always a tragedy and no legislation can take away the pain and suffering it causes.  It seems, therefore, that we should endeavour to lessen the incidence of <Col N="491" /> marriage breakdown instead of trying to pretend that legal remedies, which tend to increase the incidence of breakdown, are the answer to the problem.  It would be better if we addressed the issues of poverty, bad housing and unemployment which are contributory factors to marriage breakdown, particularly for the less well-off.  It would also be better to direct resources to these areas and to family support services rather than making fat cats out of many legal and other professional people at the expense of the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to the introduction of legislation for the dissolution of marriage, particularly in the form proposed. While I recognise that people are in difficult situations as a result of marriage breakdown, I believe that the problems created by the dissolution of marriage far outweigh the problems it solves. Despite the fact that we have an increasing rate of marriage breakdown, it is low compared with jurisdictions in which divorce is available.  When we talk about separated people, we mean all separated people, but statistics from other jurisdictions only include divorcees.  For example, our marriage breakdown rates, including all separated people, are less than 5 per cent of people ever married.</P>
    <P>There were 165,000 divorces in England and Wales in 1993.  This is equivalent to a divorce rate of 11,500 per annum for a population of our size. Our rate of legal separation is approximately one quarter of that figure.  In other jurisdictions where divorce is freely available, the marriage breakdown rate is as high as four in ten.  It is also a fact that the breakdown rate of second marriages is high.</P>
    <P>Serious consideration has not been given to the effects of a high rate of marriage breakdown on our society in the long term and the effect on children in particular.  Furthermore, there is a need to examine in detail the effect on <Col N="492" /> children not only of marriage breakdown, but also of second marriages.  I propose that urgent consideration should be given to appointing experts to examine this aspect of the problem.</P>
    <P>A lot of argument has centred recently around the debate on whether the availability of divorce causes an increased rate of marriage breakdown. Statistical evidence seems to indicate it does.  It also seems from the statistics produced in the White Paper a number of years ago that the more liberal the regime, the greater the number of divorces sought.  For example, the rate of divorce in Britain more than doubled between 1970 and 1975 following the introduction of a more liberal divorce law in 1969.  Similarly in Italy where the rate of divorce doubled between 1985 and 1989 following liberalisation of the law in 1987.  Yesterday a Minister of State from the Democratic Left Party said we should compare the statistics with Northern Ireland.  In 1979 there were 745 divorces in Northern Ireland. By 1991 the number had grown to 2,310, which was three times the rate in 1979, the year the law was liberalised.  We would need a separation rate of 5,320 to compare with the rate of divorce in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is easy to understand why the rate of marriage breakdown is greater when the divorce law is more liberal.  It seems reasonable that people would consider more seriously the decision and commitment involved when entering into an indissoluble marriage than they would when entering into a marriage which can be dissolved with relative ease.  To argue that the commitment in both cases is the same leads one to the conclusion that the chances of a couple in an indissoluble marriage breaking up is statistically the same as for a couple who are living together without any formal marriage.  However, everyone knows that is not the case.</P>
    <P>There are those who argue that divorce is a civil right.  What they are saying <Col N="493" /> is that there is a right to vary the terms of an agreement freely entered into by two adults, the terms of which were known beforehand.  That in itself is not a civil right.  It might be argued that the right to enter into a dissoluble marriage is a civil right and that the choice provided by the State should not be between living together without marriage and permanent indissoluble marriage. If there is a right to a dissoluble marriage it could be equally argued that people have a right to enter into an indissoluble marriage.  Lest I am confusing the Minister, let me simplify that.  If one wants to be pluralistic the obvious thing to do would be to give people three choices &mdash; the choice of living together, which is perfectly legal, the choice of entering into a dissoluble marriage, and the choice of entering into an indissoluble marriage.  That would be the ultimate pluralist solution.  The Government has never proposed such a solution because it wants to straitjacket everybody into its way of thinking.</P>
    <P>The Government is essentially proposing &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; divorce which, in its details and practical implications, is not very different from the divorce regimes common in other parts of Europe.  That is probably the intention.  The unions have said we should support this for no better reason than that there is divorce in the rest of Europe.  That is a most childish and puerile reason for doing anything.  In most jurisdictions there is a different number of years required when there is consent by both spouses and when one of the spouses is not consenting. When both spouses consent to divorce the time lapse is as low as one year in some jurisdictions.  However, where there is not consent by both, it is more common to have a period of five or six years.  In this regard the Government's proposal of four years would seem to be more conservative than that common in Europe for divorce where both parties consent.</P>
    <P>However, appearances can deceive. <Col N="494" /> On examination of the operation of the Judicial Separation Act it is seen that where there is consent by both parties the only proof of separation required is a statement in court by one party to the effect that they have been separated for the required period.  No further proof is normally required.  It seems that the same formula will apply to divorce proceedings.</P>

      <P>We will debate that again on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>As regards the safeguards to ensure applicants' awareness of alternatives to divorce proceedings, and to assist attempts at reconciliation, the responsibility rests with the solicitor.  What is likely to happen is that solicitors will get applicants for a divorce to sign a document confirming that the conditions of section 5 of the family law (divorce) Act have been complied with, and this will indemnify the solicitor.  Anybody who has gone to a solicitor knows that people are given sheets of paper, a formula is gone through, the people sign and are told that a particular problem has now been disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; aspect of the proposal means that people who have had barring orders against them or who have been convicted in court for acts carried out within the family home against family members will be free to get divorced and, without question, to get married <Col N="495" /> again.  This includes people convicted of violence against family members, incest etc.  Given that 30,000 to 35,000 men are separated at present, the number of such people could be quite significant.  If there are 30,000 separated men it is likely that 20,000 or fewer might consider entering into another marriage. According to the Government information paper on the divorce referendum the present rate of barring orders is 4,400 a year.  It is therefore reasonable to suppose that there are up to 10,000 separated men who have had a barring order against them at some stage.  This could represent a large proportion of the men thinking of remarrying if divorce were available.</P>
    <P>I want to raise the question of the annulling of marriages by the Catholic Church.  Facts which are not accurate are often bandied about regarding this. Despite people's unwillingness to recognise that the Catholic Church might have anything to offer on any subject, it is interesting to examine the procedure involved in granting annulments.  I accept that because of nullity decrees granted by the church, the question of registration of marriage needs to be examined.  One of the problems is that in most cases civil and church marriages are entered into simultaneously. However, the number of nullity decrees granted by the Catholic Church in the whole of Ireland is quite small, about 200 a year for the whole 32 counties. Another interesting concept of church nullity decrees is the vetitum.  In about 75 per cent of cases ending with a nullity decree a prohibition, called a vetitum, against remarriage in the Catholic Church is imposed on one or both parties. This is because the defect which caused the nullity is adjudged to have been so serious as to put at risk the validity of a further marriage.  In other words, decrees of nullity differ in two fundamental aspects from the proposed divorce regime.  One is that they are <Col N="496" /> based on the premise that the marriage never existed due to some defect at the time of marriage.  Furthermore, in most cases one of the partners is prohibited from remarrying in order to protect the genuine interests of any future spouse. Also the number of nullity decrees is small.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that divorce and legal separation are growth industries.  It is evident from the increasing number of family law solicitors and barristers just how lucrative this business is.  What is not normally recognised is that the financial bonanza is affecting accountants, estate agents, engineers etc. as well as solicitors and barristers because of the large amount of property transfers involved in marriage break up.  Mar deir an sean fhocal &ldquo;Is olc an ghaoth nach séideann maith do dhuine éigin&rdquo;.  I call on all Members of the Dáil, in the spirit of the Ethics Act, who stand to gain financially from the introduction of divorce to declare their interest publicly. At present even with legal separation an earning spouse in a one income family has financial responsibility for only one spouse or partner.  However, in a divorce regime where the earning spouse marries again&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That question must be answered between now and 24 November. Will it be found by further reducing the social welfare rates, or by imposing extra taxation, or are we just going to let people sink?</P>
      <P>In summary, I hope there will be a full and open debate on all the consequences of the Government proposal. For my part, because of the damage the introduction of divorce has caused to the fabric of society in other countries, I will vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; on 24 November.</P>

      <P>Those who argue that the introduction of divorce will bring serial marriage Hollywood style to Ireland would do much better to look at the example of Hollywood, County Down rather than any other Hollywood.  Divorce has been available in Northern Ireland for a very long time and nobody, including the Deputy, would suggest Northern Ireland has a divorce culture. Just as in the Republic, people there marry with the intention of remaining married for life.  The majority of married people succeed in that objective and do not seem to consider that their marriages are undermined by the existence of the right to divorce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As in the Republic, a significant minority do not succeed.  Are the opponents of divorce seriously suggesting that there is a greater rush to separation and marriage breakdown in Armagh than there is in Dundalk?  Both towns are in the Armagh Diocese but I have not heard the clergy of that diocese or any other diocese straddling the Border distinguish between the situations on either side of the Border.  In Northern <Col N="499" /> Ireland there are about 2,300 divorces per year and just over 3,000 of what we call judicial separations.  This compares with current figures of 4,400 applications for barring orders and almost 3,000 applications for judicial separation in the South.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Some barring orders only last six months.  That is manipulation of figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1992, there were 9,200 marriages in Northern Ireland, approximately 10 per cent of which involved people who had been previously married. Statistics in the area of marriage breakdown can be very difficult to assess but there is some evidence that a number of people in Northern Ireland whose marriages have broken down do not get divorced.  Each year, about 700 more couples go through the equivalent of a judicial separation process than go through divorce.</P>
      <P>In Northern Ireland in 1993 &mdash; and this is very significant if we want a serious discussion about this important and tragic problem &mdash; about 28 per cent of divorces were granted after five to nine years of marriage; 24 per cent were granted after ten to 14 years of marriage and 27 per cent were granted after 15 to 25 years of marriage.  There is no suggestion from anyone involved in this debate that the current state of marriage in Drogheda is different from that in Newry or that Derry has a significantly greater problem of marriage breakdown than Letterkenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I had the opportunity to meet agencies in Northern Ireland which deal with marriage breakdown counselling and mediation services and with lawyers involved in family law.  In discussions with Relate, the principal marriage advisory and counselling service in Northern Ireland, the people <Col N="500" /> who are dealing with marriage breakdown were very clear that the availability of divorce was not the cause of marriage breakdown; that marriages break down whether or not divorce is available; that regard for the institution of marriage is still very high and that people did not rush easily to the divorce courts as the figures illustrating the length of marriages before divorce is sought will show.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I am grateful for the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the need for a new fire station in Enniscorthy town.  The old fire station occupied 27 years ago on a temporary basis by the fire personnel at that time is lacking in basic facilities.  It is an old shed type building in deplorable condition.  There is only one shower, one toilet, one heater and no eating facilities or diesel fumes extractors. There are 12 firemen working from it.  The yard is in bad condition and is covered with muck and grass in wintertime. The roof leaks and has been patched up on numerous occasions over the years by Wexford County Council.</P>
      <P>The firemen have been fighting for a new facility for the best part of 20 years. Some of them told me recently that despite repeated requests to different Governments they have not been successful. Last year when I was in the Department of the Environment a proposal for a fire station went to tender and we expected work on the new fire station would commence in March or April this year.  Will the Minister explain why there has been such a lack of action since last December?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfair that firemen who have given a tremendous service to the Enniscorthy area are asked to continue to <Col N="501" /> work in such archaic conditions.  It is only right that they should have modern facilities.  They have modern fire tenders but because of lack of space are unable to park them side by side.  If we can provide new fire tenders, we should be in a position to provide a modern fire station.</P>
    <P>A few years ago the urban council secured a site in Enniscorthy.  A new garda station was built which the Minister for Justice opened earlier this year. A new library was also built on the site. The third section of the site has been lying idle for the last few years.  It has become dirty and overgrown.  Will the Minister for Justice, in the absence of the Minister for the Environment, give a commitment that work on this fire station will commence as quickly as possible?  The Enniscorthy area needs it, as do the firemen who have given such loyal service over the years.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware of the need to have this fire station built as quickly as possible.  Will she give a strong commitment that within the next three to four weeks building will commence. I understand, and I am open to correction, that the tenders have been accepted.  It may be that the builder has been appointed and work is due to commence shortly.  I ask, in the interests of the firemen and the people of Enniscorthy, that this work commence as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for raising this issue.  I remember with great pleasure the day I spent in Enniscorthy and how lucky Enniscorthy is to have a new Garda station and library.  I suppose the icing on the cake would be if I were able to give the Deputy the information which he seeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approval in principle to provide a new fire station at Enniscorthy was given to Wexford County Council in January 1993.  Preparatory work, by way of cost plans and drawings, was then <Col N="502" /> undertaken by the council and in June 1994 approval was given to prepare contract documents, specifications and working drawings for a two-bay fire station with drill tower.</P>
    <P>Following the receipt of these completed documents, approval to go to tender was given to the council in November 1994, and the council submitted a recommended tender last March.  The question of approving this tender is now under consideration in the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>The capital sum available for the fire services development programme in 1995 amounts to £4.5 million.  While this is an increase of £0.5 million over the 1994 provision, the carry over of commitments in respect of works in progress, or recently completed, places a heavy demand on the available funds. These up front bills represent a first charge on the finances available in any year.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that the case for a new fire station at Enniscorthy is fully accepted by the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, but he has to deal with the project in the light of the funds available and the competing demands.  I understand he hopes to give a decision on the proposal in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Government values very highly the work of the fire service and is fully aware of its importance for the community. The Government has supported, and will continue to support, the major advances that have been made in the service in recent times.  Since 1981, over £76 million has been invested to provide over 80 new fire stations, to purchase about 300 new appliances and other equipment, and to develop a modern computer-aided mobilisation and call-out system.</P>
    <P>Wexford County Council has shared in those improvements.  For example, a new fire appliance was delivered last year and, since 1985, a total of seven new appliances have been purchased for <Col N="503" /> the county.  New fire stations were constructed at Gorey in 1987, and at New Ross in 1983.  Total grant aid of about £1.5 million has been made available by the Department of the Environment for these improvements.  I look forward to the new fire station at Enniscorthy being added to that list of achievements as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, is not here but I am sure the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, will outline to him what I have to say.</P>
      <P>Local improvement schemes are the method people in rural areas use to get roads to places which are not serviced by existing county council roads.  In a lot of cases in the west of Ireland, these are either roads to houses or to community facilities such as bogs, commonages, strands, etc.  In passing, I might say that the road to my own house was built with the help of an LIS scheme about ten years ago and it is not in the charge of Galway County Council yet.</P>
      <P>Following strong representations which I made to the Minister's predecessors, an increase in funding was given under the local improvement scheme allocation in 1994 and 1995.  However, the funding being provided is still well short of the 1991 figure of £279,000 and the 1990 figure of £326,000, particularly when inflation is taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, there is a five year waiting list for local improvement schemes in County Galway.  I asked, as a member of Galway County Council, that a report be given to the council last year and we received the following information.  At that time we had 45 schemes on hand for 1991, i.e. applications lodged in 1991 <Col N="504" /> on which work had not yet been done. There were 265 people who stood to gain from those schemes.  For 1992, there were 57 on hand.  For 1993, 47; 1994 to this time last year, 32 applications; and there were 15 island schemes on hand.  That gave us a total of 196 schemes on hand on which work had not been carried out going back five years.  The total number of people that stood to benefit from these schemes was 1,235.</P>
    <P>Further information was given by the council officials regarding grant allocations and the number of schemes completed.  Basically, for the five years between 1990 and 1994, we received a total allocation of £1.091 million and 99 schemes were completed.  An analysis of the figures shows that we need an annual allocation of between £500, 000 and £600,000 just to maintain the <i>status quo.</i> in other words, to stop the list getting longer.  In order to cut the waiting time to a reasonable length of between one and two years, a once off payment of £1.5 million is also required.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that there are a number of these schemes each year involving roads leading to dwelling houses.  For example, in 1993, seven of the 13 schemes done had houses along them and a total number of 13 houses were serviced by these schemes.  In 1994, four of the schemes involved roads with houses along them and the number of houses serviced was 15.</P>
    <P>I have a case of an old couple in my own constituency.  The wife had a stroke a number of years ago.  They live half a mile up a bóithrín and it is nearly impossible for a doctor or nurse &mdash; and certainly, an ambulance &mdash; to gain access.  They applied last year for an LIS scheme and must wait four years before that basic service of access to a house will be provided.</P>
    <P>In the name of humanity, it is about time something was done for the endless number of people on the west coast who are waiting for the primary provision of <Col N="505" /> a road to their dwelling house.  I am not talking about people who built houses recently at the back of the mountain.  I am talking about people who have lived in these places for 50, 60 or 100 years, as far back as their families have lived there.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is well aware, there are no public roads on two Aran Islands, Inis Meáin and Inis Oírr, and the local improvement schemes are used by Galway County Council to provide a road infrastructure on the islands.  There is a need, therefore, to provide special extra funding to ensure there is a continuing development of the road infrastructure on these islands.</P>
    <P>As this is a self help scheme, where applicants must pay from between 10-30 per cent of the cost, it is obvious that all the applications submitted to the council are of great importance to the applicants. When you see people forking out £1,000 to get a road and people complaining about water charges in other places, it is obvious how important this is to them.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to provide the necessary money for these schemes to ensure that access to basic services and to houses is provided to all in rural Ireland.  I will be listening in anticipation to the Minister's reply.  Arís, mo bhuíochas don Aire, agus tá súil agam le cúnamh Dé go mbeidh dea scéal aici dhom.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Ó Cuív for his passionate plea for improved funds for the local improvement scheme.  I will pass on to my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, the strength of the Deputy's arguments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the local improvement scheme, county councils have power to construct and improve non-public accommodation roads.  Responsibility for the administration of the scheme is <Col N="506" /> devolved to the councils, subject to general guidelines issued by the Department of the Environment.  These encourage councils, when preparing their annual programme of works, to ensure as far as practicable that priority is given to projects most requiring attention in the country as a whole.  However, the priority assigned to individual projects is a matter entirely for county councils themselves.</P>
    <P>In 1995, the State provision for the LIS is £3 million, as compared with £2.5 million in 1994.  Allocations are made to all county councils and are based on the original Western Package Programme. The allocations reflect that fact in that the western counties continue to receive the greater proportion of available funds.  Regard is also had to general demands known to the Department, based on the actual take-up rate in previous years.  The increase from £2 million in 1993 to £3 million in 1995 is indicative of the Government's commitment to this scheme when there are so many other demands on limited Exchequer resources.</P>
    <P>In the case of Galway County Council, the grant allocation this year under the LIS amounts to £220,000, an increase of £40,000, or 22 per cent, on the 1994 allocation.  Payments to Galway County Council in 1994 actually amounted to £207,000, or £27,000 greater than the original allocation, due to savings arising elsewhere.  In 1994 Galway County Council carried out 13 schemes benefiting 184 people at a total cost of almost £234,000.  The beneficiaries' contribution amounted to £26,500. This year, the council is carrying out 18 schemes at an estimated cost of almost £252,000 which will benefit 153 people. The estimated total amount of local contributions will be almost £32,000 in the current year.</P>
    <P>The local improvement scheme grants have been fully allocated in 1995 and there are no additional funds available now to increase the allocations already notified to county councils.  The record <Col N="507" /> will show that Galway County Council has received a generous share of the total funds available.

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Dublin Drug Dealing.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKenny" hpid="Mr. S. Kenny Mr. S. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Since early summer, community groups in the Kilbarrack area, in co-operation with the local Garda Síochána at Raheny, have been meeting on a regular basis to consider how to address the drugs menace in their area.  Paradoxically, the threat to the community from drug trafficking, dealing and abuse began to escalate and focus on the Kilbarrack area at that time.  People were not prepared to give information to the Garda Síochána due to fear and intimidation.  I am aware of cases where residents requested drug dealers and users to move away from their houses.  In response, their windows were broken, they were physically attacked and their property was daubed with offensive slogans.  I know of some families who sold their homes and moved out of the area as a result.  Tenants of Dublin Corporation in the area have been forced to leave their accommodation due to what can only be described as modern day terrorism.</P>
      <P>There have also been a number of shooting incidents in the area in recent months, directly related to the activities of drug dealers.  Two months ago, a quantity of firearms and ammunition was discovered beside the railway at Kilbarrack near an open space where drug dealing openly occurs.  More recently, shots were fired at the home of a Garda who lives in the area and a rock, with a warning message attached, was hurled through a window.  This action was seen by the community as a warning that no one would be immune from intimidation if they took a stand against drug dealing in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> The Government must wage an all-out fight against the scourge of drugs which threatens urban society.  The community in Kilbarrack, and throughout Dublin, wants effective action to be taken against drug dealing.  They want the hand of law enforcement to be strengthened and increased powers for the Garda Síochána to deal with the drugs menace.  Extra resources must be provided and overall priority given to law enforcement in the fight against drug abuse.  I welcome the new measures announced by the Government in July.  I recognise that a multifaceted approach is required to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>I support the provision of treatment facilities in local communities to enable addicts who have been misusing drugs to come off them.  I welcome the initiative taken this month by the Minister for Health &mdash; through Eastern Health Board Community Care Area 8, which covers the Kilbarrack area &mdash; to provide two additional outreach workers and one additional community addiction counsellor to work with drug misusers in the area.  In addition, the voluntary agency Crosscare will be developing a peer education programme aimed at preventing drug misuse among young people in the Kilbarrack area this autumn.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the drugs problem differs from area to area and that there is a need to provide improved community infrastructure and better education, employment and training facilities in areas of high unemployment which become the focus for exploitation by drug dealers.  In recent months, the Government has introduced a number of community initiatives in the Kilbarrack area.  A community development programme was put in place in August at St. Benedict's Resource centre.  This week the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, provided further resources to enhance the facilities at that resource centre.  I believe that the <Col N="509" /> Kilbarrack area would also benefit from a Department of Justice youth diversion scheme.  There is much more to be done to restore the community's confidence in itself to address these issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kenny for raising this issue which has given rise to a great deal of concern in the Kilbarrack area.  I am a northsider myself and I know how disturbed the people in that area are by the drug situation in Kilbarrack which has given rise to such a community effort to highlight the problem.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are aware of the drugs situation in the Kilbarrack area and are taking all necessary steps to deal with the problem.  During the past 12 months, there have been numerous successes in apprehending suppliers, and searches for drugs take place when information is available.  In enforcing the law, it should be noted that the Garda Síochána have had to contend with a lookout system at a flats complex in the area and, in seeking entry, have encountered steel reinforced doors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding these difficulties, the Garda Síochána are continuing to give the problem all necessary attention.  In addition to all members of the Force having a responsibility for the enforcement of the drug laws, there is a specialist District Drugs Unit based in Raheny, comprising four detective gardaí under the supervision of a detective sergeant. These members are engaged in the surveillance of those suspected of involvement in drug dealing and continually monitor their activities.  Another important function of the unit is the compiling and co-ordination of intelligence on drug related activities in the area.  Following recent meetings between residents and local gardaí, extra uniformed and plain clothes personnel have been deployed to intensively patrol the area.  These additional patrols will include extra road traffic checkpoints which, it is believed, will <Col N="510" /> help deter drug dealing in the area.  I have been informed that the Garda Síochána expect that these measures will result in a reduction in drug dealing in the area.</P>
    <P>There is a perception that the Garda Síochána should be engaged in something more substantial than manning road traffic checkpoints.  However, these checkpoints are a very effective way to deter people from going about the business of drug trafficking.  When Garda checkpoints are placed in an area they divert such activity.</P>
    <P>As regards the wider issue of the drug problem, the Deputy will be aware that I have already dealt with this matter in the House in detail on a number of occasions since becoming Minister for Justice.  The Deputy will know that the whole issue of drugs is a matter of the highest priority for me.</P>
    <P>Last July, I secured the approval of Government for a comprehensive package of measures to deal with the drug problem.  I have made the implementation of these measures a top priority for myself and the Garda Síochána. Urgent discussions are already taking place between all the relevant agencies and Government Departments to put in place the necessary framework for closer working arrangements between the Garda Síochána, the Customs and Excise Service and the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Garda Commissioner recently appointed a Deputy Commissioner to take overall responsibility for all Garda operational matters in the fight against drugs.  This is as a direct result of a Government decision giving the highest priority to the fight against drugs by recommending that a Deputy Commissioner take overall responsibility, the first time such an action has ever been taken.</P>
    <P>Another of the measures contained in the package is the creation of a new National Garda Drugs Unit.  The <Col N="511" /> Government has approved the appointment of a Chief Superintendent to head up the unit on a day-to-day basis and he will be answerable to the Deputy Commissioner. The other measures, which involve, among other things, increased powers for the Garda Síochána and other law enforcement officers, will be implemented as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I take Deputy Kenny's point that the issue is not simply related to the area of justice.  It involves a co-ordinated <Col N="512" /> approach by the health services, education services, the corporation and local authorities &mdash; which are responsible for housing policy, etc., in the areas involved &mdash; and community groups who have information on, and knowledge of, what is happening.  I will investigate the Deputy's point in relation to a youth diversion scheme.  Perhaps he will discuss the matter with me on another occasion.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.10 p.m. until 12 noon on Tuesday, 3 October 1995.</P>

      <P>The educational needs of primary school pupils suffering from specific reading disability (dyslexia) are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the assistance, where appropriate, of a remedial teacher.  I understand that the child in question has the benefit of a remedial teacher service in the school which she is currently attending.  In addition, this school has a range of special education services and there is considerable expertise among the staff in dealing with children with special needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also point out that fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties. In addition, the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific reading disability. I can also advise the Deputy that a total of 132 primary schools in County Galway currently have access to a remedial <Col N="421" /> teaching service.  These schools account for approximately 71 per cent of the children attending primary schools in the county.</P>

      <P>The Youthreach programme is a primary means of identifying early leavers from the school system. The programme is delivered jointly by my Department and the Department of Enterprise and Employment, through a network of training centres under the vocational education committees and community training workshops funded by FÁS.  It provides two years integrated education, training and work experience for young people in the 15-18 year age group who are at least six months in the labour market and who have left school early without any qualifications or vocational training.  Co-ordination at local level between the vocational education committees and FÁS is handled by the chief executive officers of the vocational education committees and the regional directors of FÁS.  In February and October of each year, schools make returns to their local FÁS office giving details of those who have left school early.  This information is used for compilation of a social guarantee register from which trainees are recruited on to Youthreach.  Young people are also referred on to the programme as a result of contact with welfare, probation, Garda, youth and community agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For young people who have already left the school system early without any qualifications or vocational training, <Col N="422" /> Youthreach provides an integrated programme of education, vocational training and work experience in an out-of-school setting.  At present approximately 3,000 first year places are provided on the programme, of which 2,000 are in the vocational education committee sector.  I will be allocating a further 450 places on the programme to vocational education committees shortly.  Measures have also been put in place which are designed to ensure the retention of young people in the school system.  These include: the junior cycle schools programme, which is designed to meet the needs of a small proportion of pupils in the junior classes of second level schools who do not benefit from the junior certificate programme.  This programme is being developed at pilot level for introduction, on an expanded basis, from September 1996; the leaving certificate applied programme, which I introduced from September 1995, will prove an attractive option for those who find the existing senior cycle curriculum unsuitable, as well as those who would normally have left school with poor results at junior certificate level.  It is my policy to increase the rate of retention of young people to completion of senior cycle education to 90 per cent by the year 2000.  This objective will be achieved through providing an effective foundation of general education and a strengthened and expanded vocational orientation in a restructured senior cycle.</P>

Candidates will be prevented from doing an exam by the superintendent only if their conduct is such as to upset other candidates. The person referred to by the Deputy sat his maths paper 1 examination on 8 June 1995, after originally being refused admission to his school by the acting school principal because he was not wearing the school uniform.  As the candidate's family will be aware, all of the circumstances in which he sat his maths examination have been fully taken into consideration in the marking of his maths papers.</P>

The total annual amount paid in respect of salaries and allowances of teachers in fee-charging schools is approximately £28 million.  Of this, approximately £10.5 million is accounted for by the salaries of teachers in Protestant schools.  The total teacher pay bill at second level is of the order of £584 million.  Applications for capital grants by fee-paying schools are infrequent and do not give rise to a significant charge on capital resources.</P>

Officers of my Department have had discussions with the authorities in Foyle View School in relation to this matter.  While the school in question does, on occasion, enrol individual children from the Inishowen area, the school authorities have indicated that they do not at present have the necessary accommodation and facilities to cater for all of the children from the Inishowen area who now require such a service.

      <P>The letter sent to vocational educational committees on a confidential basis was of a preliminary nature inviting them to contact the Department to discuss the position in their particular circumstances.  It was considered best to clarify the position in this way so as to avoid unnecessary concerns among those involved.  The vocational education committees have been given an indication of what their allocations are likely to be for 1996. Contacts between my Department and vocational education committees are continuing.  As soon as the position is finally clarified, my Department will formally confirm to the vocational education committees the number of places that will likely be available to them.</P>

      <P>I regret that it is not possible to extend the service as requested.  The school transport scheme is intended to provide a basic level of service for pupils who would otherwise experience difficulty in attending school regularly.  Pupils living off the main route of service, as is the case with the five pupils in question, are generally required to make their own way to a convenient pick-up point.  The pupils in this case live between 0.2 and 2.7 miles from the present pick up point.  If the service were extended to Toombola Crossroads the additional annual cost in this case would be almost £3,000.  The cost of providing a service at this level on a countrywide basis would be prohibitive. I understand that the extension requested would also disimprove the timetable of the existing service, both morning and evening, for other pupils on this route.  The service being provided to the pupils in question is regarded as adequate and is the best that can be offered in this instance.</P>

      <P>In his reply to Deputy O'Donnell on 24 May, 1995 the Minister for Finance confirmed that he participated in the process of consideration by the Government of the White Paper and that this process included consideration of the cost implications of the White Paper.  As Deputies will be aware, costing exercises are contingent on a variety of variable factors.  Such factors include, the timescale within which proposals are implemented, the outcome of discussions/negotiations with concerned interests and expert advice on the detailed implementation strategies. Also, as the Minister for Finance pointed out, the cost of education measures are determined to a large extent by pay costs, which in turn reflect numbers employed in the sector and pay rates at any given time.  In this context he indicated that it would not be useful nor appropriate to comment on what the cost elements might be into the future and I agree.</P>
      <P>For these reasons I do not intend to publish a cost framework or series of cost projections for the White Paper. These exercises would not be very meaningful.  They would not contribute to the implementation of the White Paper.  The final Government decision on the funding of initiatives in the White Paper is as set out in my foreword to the White Paper.  I have reiterated this position to the House in my Statement of 4 May 1995.</P>
      <P>Also, very importantly, many key changes in the White Paper will not involve additional resources.  Rather, they involve the establishment of rights, responsibilities, roles and functions to create a modern framework for the management of the education system.  In this regard, I am giving priority attention to the tabling and enactment of legislation.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware from my recent letter that it did not prove possible to include the schools in question in the recent expansion of the early start pre-school programme and the recent pilot initiative under which I deployed a number of teacher counsellors to schools in disadvantaged areas.  However, I can assure the Deputy that I am conscious of the problems faced by the Cowper Street schools in dealing with disruptive pupils.  The needs of these schools will be taken fully into account in the context of any further expansion of the programmes.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, I would point out that my Department is currently engaged in discussions with both schools with a view to their amalgamation.  Significant progress has already been made in this regard.  I would see such a development as offering a particular opportunity for addressing the problems to which the Deputy refers.  An amalgamation would enable the schools to combine their available resources and direct particular attention to the problems to which the Deputy refers.  These resources include the full-time services of remedial teachers for both schools and ex-quota teaching posts in each school, by virtue of their inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>

      <P>I would be extremely anxious to ensure that all children with a remedial need should have access to a remedial teaching service.  Significant progress has already been made in this regard and I intend to maintain this momentum, as available resources permit. The number of remedial teachers in place in the primary sector has increased from 947 in 1992 to 1,188 in the current school year.  This includes 55 remedial teacher posts which have been allocated to primary schools with effect from September, 1995.  As a result of this latest allocation, 71 per cent of primary schools in the country now have access to a remedial teaching service.  Of the total of 3,203 primary schools in the country, 918 do not currently have a remedial teaching service.  A list of the schools in south Tipperary which do not currently have a remedial service is being compiled at present and will be forwarded to the Deputy early next week.</P>

      <P>The improvement of the teaching and learning of continental languages in our second-level schools has been one of my policy priorities since I became Minister.  In the ongoing reform of the senior cycle programmes, continental languages are being included in phase one.  New syllabuses were issued to schools last spring.  At present, the in-career development unit of my Department is conducting a countrywide inser-vice programme to assist modern language teachers in implementing the new syllabuses.  Practical <i>Guidelines for Teachers</i> have also been prepared by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, a programme of in-career development is being implemented at <Col N="435" /> school level in French and German.  A corps of expert classroom teachers has been selected and they have been given special training to enable them to assist in the reforms.  During the present school year, they will be visiting all second-level schools to advise their colleagues on the implementation of the new syllabuses.</P>
    <P>One of the main features of this reform is the increased emphasis on oral language.  The percentage of marks allocated to oral and listening skills is being increased from 30 per cent to 45 per cent in the leaving certificate, for both higher and ordinary levels, beginning in 1997.</P>
    <P>At primary level the White Paper on Education states that pupils will be introduced to a European awareness programme.  This will include an introduction to European languages, life and culture at an informal level.</P>

      <P>I announced last week the establishment of TEASTAS &mdash; the Irish national certification authority. The authority will operate on a nonstatutory basis for an interim period, pending the enactment of the necessary legislation.  The remit of the interim authority will be to advise the Minister on the actions to be undertaken, and to undertake any such actions which it considers necessary, to put in place a single, nationally and internationally recognised certification structure covering all extra-university third-level and all further and continuing education and training programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A key feature of the national qualifications framework which TEASTAS will now develop will be structured progression pathways for students and <Col N="436" /> trainees, including PLC students, though the education and training sytem in order to maximise the opportunities and options open to students and to meet the continually changing requirements of the economy for skilled personnel. Such progression structures will include systematic arrangements for progression to third-level programmes.</P>
    <P>My objective is to recognise and underpin the importance of post-leaving certificate programmes, in meeting the diverse needs of students and the economy. It is not the intention to assimilate the sector into the third-level sector but rather to provide clear avenues for progression, within the context of a nationally and internationally recognised certification and qualifications framework.  This is the policy direction set out in the White Paper on Education, <i>Charting our Education Future.</i> The establishment of TEASTAS is a major and concrete manifestation of my commitment to the implementation of this policy.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that, as a first step towards establishing ladders of progression to higher levels of training, I have approved a pilot initiative by the council of directors of regional technical colleges, in conjunction with the National Council for Vocational Awards, whereby places on selected courses in the regional technical college-DIT sector were allocated in 1995 on the basis of attainment achieved in the NCVA Level 2 Awards by candidates on PLC courses.</P>

      <P>An extension of a school transport service to enable a child to be picked up and set down at home may only be considered where the child is severely medically handicapped and the condition is such as to prevent the child from making his or her own way to the pick-up point.  The same conditions apply to payment of medical grants towards the cost of private transport arrangements from a child's home to the pick-up point or to the school.  On the basis of medical evidence submitted, my Department's, medical adviser has determined that these conditions do not apply to the child to whom the Deputy refers.  As this child is already availing of a reasonable level of service in the context of the general operation of the scheme and as the medical adviser has confirmed that the relevant conditions do not apply, it would not be open to my Department either to extend the service, or to pay a medical grant towards the cost of private transport arrangements.</P>

      <P>I recently announced the setting up of a review committee on school transport.  The first meeting of the Committee will take place during October.  A date has not as yet been set for the completion of the report of the school transport review committee.  The review committee will include representatives from my Department, Bus Éireann and the transport liaison officers.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy, however, that all interested parties, including the Federation of Transport Operators, will be given the opportunity as part of the consultative process to put forward their views and will be invited to make a formal submission to the review committee. My Department will give public notice in due course setting out the terms of reference of the review committee and inviting submissions from all interested parties, as part of the review process.</P>

      <P>A new community college to cater for 750 pupils is being planned for the Glanmire-Riverstown area of Cork. Architectural planning is proceeding and the project is currently at the developed sketch scheme stage.  Funds are being made available this year in respect of design fees.  However, the question of providing capital funds for building will not arise until the planning process has been fully completed.  At this early stage, it is not possible to say when construction work will commence. However, I assure Deputies that every effort will be made to have the planning of the college completed as quickly as possible.</P>

This figure is based on an estimated total of 5,000 traveller children of primary school age, of which 4,200 are attending primary schools.  A total of 1,800 of these children are attending primary schools on a fully integrated basis.  A further 2,160 children are enrolled in the 217 special classes for traveller children attached to ordinary primary schools.

      <P>Section 3 of the Child Care Act, 1991 requires health boards, in the discharge of their functions under the Act, to have regard to the principle that it is generally in the best interests of a child to be brought up in his or her own family.  Thus, the emphasis is on providing support and <Col N="445" /> assistance to vulnerable families so that children can remain at home and only in exceptional cases are children to be taken into care.  I believe this to be the correct approach and that it has the support of the vast majority of those professionally involved with children.</P>
      <P>I am aware that certain difficulties exist in relation to the provision of appropriate placements for certain children who need to be taken into care, particularly those whose behaviour is such that they cannot be cared for within the existing range of child care services.  I want to assure the House that action is being taken to address this problem.  The 1995 Child Care Action Plan which I launched last July includes a range of initiatives to increase the availability of care placements.  Among the developments which I have approved are the following.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has been given approval to develop new residential facilities and to expand its foster care services through the recruitment of an additional 80 foster parents. Approval has also been given to additional family placements for children with special needs.  Resources are also being provided for the development of special care facilities at Killinarden House and Trudder House to cater for ten to 12 out-of-control youngsters.</P>
      <P>The Mid-Western Health Board has been given resources for the recruitment of 15 special placement foster families, the provision of special arrangements for out of control children and the development of after care services for children leaving care.</P>
      <P>Approval has been given to the North-Eastern and Midland Health Boards to enhance and improve residential services for children and to the North Western Health Board to develop services for difficult adolescents. This includes the appointment of two community based child care workers to assist these children and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The South Eastern Health Board have been given resources for the <Col N="446" /> further development of its foster care services.  The additional provisions will enable the board to continue its policy of placing children with challenging behaviour in special fostering arrangements in the first instance, as an alternative to residential care.</P>
    <P>Approval has been given to the Southern Health Board for the development of special care arrangements in order to cater for the needs of out of control children.  The board is also proceeding with the development of a new assessment service for children to ensure that the individual needs of children are clearly identified and appropriately addressed.  New residential facilities in Tralee and Killarney, and a unit to cater for eight girls in Cork, have also been approved.</P>
    <P>The Western Health Board has been given resources to enhance its residential care services for adolescents, including the provision of a purpose-built residential unit in Salthill, and the development of after care support services for children leaving care.</P>

    <P>The number of social worker posts that are currently unfilled must be viewed in the light of the fact that approval of the creation of 70 social work posts was given to the health boards in the Child Care Action Plan which was launched as recently as 10 July.  Health boards are involved in an ongoing recruitment campaign which has the objective of having all posts filled as quickly as possible.  While some difficulties with recruitment have been experienced, every effort is being made by the health boards to fill posts without delay.  Apart from the current intensive recruitment campaign, a number of other steps have been taken to address the increasing demand for social workers.  These include the establishment earlier this year of the National Validation Body for Social Work Training and Education and the approval by the Higher Education Authority of 20 additional university places in Social Science from October 1995.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie) Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 47 and 48 together. At the outset, I want to reiterate that the Government is firmly committed to the full implementation of the Child Care Act at the earliest possible date and it is my top priority in the Department of Health to ensure that this is achieved.  Earlier today the Minister for <Col N="449" /> Health, Deputy Noonan <i>(Limerick East)</i> and I met the Chairmen and Chief Executive Officers of the eight health boards.  They have assured us of their full support and co-operation for our efforts in this regard.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, 17 of the 79 sections of the Act are currently in force.  It is my intention to make the necessary order within the next few days to bring a further 44 sections into operation. These include key sections dealing with the protection of children in emergencies, care proceedings and the powers and duties of health boards in relation to children in their care.  These provisions will greatly strengthen the powers of the courts, the health boards and the Garda to intervene to protect children from abuse and neglect.</P>
      <P>I am also about to make new regulations in relation to the placement of children in foster care and residential care and the placement of children with relatives.  The three sets of regulations will provide the health boards with a range of options in looking after children in their care.  They will also require the boards to visit, supervise and review children in their care on a more systematic basis than before.</P>
      <P>The decision to proceed with the implementation of these provisions at this time must be viewed against the background of the sustained programme of investment in child care services that has taken place over the last three years.  Since 1993, additional funding of the order of £30 million on an annualised basis has been provided to develop child care and family support services and to strengthen the capacity of the health boards to meet the demands of the new legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Child Care Action Plan, 1995 which I launched last July provided for a wide range of service developments including the creation of some 342 additional posts for the child care services; the expansion of assessment and therapeutic services for the victims of child abuse; the provision of additional accommodation and supports for homeless youngsters; the establishment of <Col N="450" /> new special care units catering for children who are out of control; the development of locally based helping services to assist families in difficulty and increased financial support for voluntary groups providing services for victims of family violence.</P>
    <P>The 342 extra posts that have been approved bring to over 850 the total number of new posts created in the child care services since 1993.  The scale of this approval at a time when there are restrictions on public sector recruitment generally demonstrates the commitment of the Government to child welfare, and our determination to ensure that child protection services are equipped to respond to the needs of vulnerable children.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the massive increase in staff and resources that have been provided for child care over the last three years, I believe that health boards are in a position to adequately discharge their responsibilities both under current legislation and under the new provisions mentioned by the Deputy.  That is not to say that I am entirely happy with all aspects of our current services; there is still much room for improvement and, with the support of the Minister for Health, I will be seeking additional resources for child care in the Estimates for 1996.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of training, this is, of course, primarily a matter for the health boards and I am aware that various initiatives have been taken by the boards to prepare staff for the new legislation.  In order to ensure that health board staff are fully <i>au fait</i> with the new regulations that are about to be made, I intend that the regulations which I will be signing on 1 October will take effect on 31 October.  This will provide additional time for staff in health boards together with the Garda and the courts to familiarise themselves with the new provisions and to make any necessary changes in their practices and procedures. The Department of Health will also be circulating explanatory guides to health boards and has made arrangements with the Department of Justice <Col N="451" /> for the provision of briefing material for the Garda Authorities and relevant court staff.</P>
    <P>Finally, I want to say that I am conscious of the fact that much work remains to be done to attain the standard and quality of child care services that we all desire.  I believe that the developments over the last three years have provided us with a good base from which to develop and meet the challenges that lie ahead in this vitally important area.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Any arrangement to join a private health insurance scheme is a matter solely for the individual and the health insurer.  As Minister for Health I have no function in making such arrangements.  The issue of a medical card to any individual is a matter for the Chief Executive Officer of the relevant health board.</P>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Midland Health Board in this case.  I understand that, following the normal review procedures, this person's medical card was withdrawn in August as the board did not receive a reply to requests, issued earlier in the year, to submit a renewal application form.  Another application form has been issued to the family and they have undertaken to submit same to the Midland Health Board as soon as possible.  I have asked that the board would, on receipt of the new application, have this case dealt with as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>The 1995 provision of £3 million for this scheme represents an increase of £500,000 or 20 per cent on total 1994 payments.  The administration of the scheme is devolved to county councils and details of waiting lists in individual counties are not available in my Department.  The extent of such lists can be influenced by the different practices adopted in different areas and is not necessarily an objective measure of relative need.  There is no additional funds available to me to increase the allocations already notified to county councils for 1995.</P>

The software package to which the Deputy refers was not chosen as tests carried out in my Department showed it to be unable to meet the specified technical requirements.

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 77 and 78 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper on Education, <i>Charting our Education Future,</i> outlines <Col N="467" /> the proposed future strategy for providing suitable education for pupils with a disability in either special educational facilities or in an integrated environment.</P>
    <P>The fundamental objective of the commitment in the White Paper is to ensure, to the maximum possible extent, that all children with disabilities will have access to suitably resourced education services in their own area and within the ordinary school system. However, the extent to which integration can be achieved will depend on the specific and evolving capacities of the individual children involved.</P>
    <P>The details of each student with a special disability will be entered in a national data base.  Each education board will have a responsibility for all students in its region who have been entered on the national data base and will co-ordinate education provision, including support services, for these students.</P>
    <P>A number of ordinary primary schools will be designated by the education boards as centres where children with particular disabilities may be educated. Existing special schools with fulfil an expanded role as schools dealing with a variety of disabilities and as regional resource centres.  Each student with a disability will be assigned to the nearest appropriate special school in the region.  Even if it is decided that the student should attend an ordinary school, he/she will still have access to the support services provided in the special school.</P>
    <P>The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment will advise on the setting up of curriculum development projects for students with speciaistl education needs.  To accommodate eductional provisions for children with disabilities in mainstream schools, the development of the curriculum will allow for flexibility, addition and adaptation. The curricular needs of all students in special classes, units and schools will be reviewed continually, <Col N="468" /> based on age, ability, needs and aspirations.</P>
    <P>An action plan for implementation of the White Paper proposals is currently being pursued by my Department.  It is intended that the proposals will be implemented as speedily as possible, having regard to the necessary legislative measures which will underpin the proposals and overall resource availability.</P>

      <P>The abscondings referred to by the Deputy relate to two incidents at Oberstown Boys' Centre on Saturday, 9 September 1995 and one incident on Sunday, 10 September 1995.</P>
      <P>The first abscond incident occurred at about 4.30 p.m. on Saturday, 9 September when two boys managed to break out through a roof light in their house unit and absconded from the centre. The two boys involved returned to the centre the following day, one voluntarily and the other having been apprehended by staff.</P>
      <P>The second incident on the Saturday occurred at approximately 9 p.m. when two boys were returning to their house unit from the gymnasium in the grounds of the centre.  One boy ran away from staff but the other boy was returned to the unit immediately by staff.  The boy who had absconded was returned to the centre on September 17 by the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Sunday, 10 September 1995, four boys were returning to their house unit with staff following a football match in the grounds.  The four boys ran away in <Col N="469" /> different directions and absconded from the centre.  All four boys were returned to the centre at 2.30 a.m. the following morning by Garda.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of each of these absconds, the local community and Garda were alerted immediately and staff of the centre gave chase and sought to return the boys involved.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that I view these developments with the utmost seriousness.  Members of the local community have every right to expect to be protected from incidents of this nature and it is my intention to ensure that every possible step is taken to avoid a repetition of such incidents.</P>
    <P>Arising from the events in question, a group comprising management and staff at the centre has undertaken a comprehensive review of current control procedures to identify deficiencies and consider what further steps need to be taken to address the problem of absconds.</P>
    <P>Officials from my Department will be meeting with the management of the centre in the coming days to consider the group's findings and arrange for the implementation of improved control procedures.</P>

      <P>I should add that my Department is currently considering appeals for increased teacher allocations from individual school authorities.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>EU competition law is enforced primarily by the European Commission and the European Courts.  EU competition rules are also <Col N="473" /> directly applicable in this country and actions in respect of alleged breaches of those rules may be taken in the Irish Courts by affected parties.</P>
      <P>In its 1990 report of its study into restrictive practices in the legal profession, the Fair Trade Commission made wide ranging recommendations for reform, some of which have been taken on board in the Solicitors (Amendment) Act, 1994 and in the proposed legislation for reform of the Courts and judicial system, announced recently by the Minister for Justice. Other recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission were adopted by the profession on a voluntary basis.</P>
      <P>The outstanding Fair Trade Commission recommendations relate mainly to the barristers' side of the profession, the matter of joint legal education and training and greater mobility between the two branches of the profession.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment has consistently supported the case for reform and will continue to press for the outstanding recommendations of the Fair Trade Commission to be dealt with.</P>
      <P>I also draw the Deputy's attention to national competition law.  The Competition Act, 1991 prohibits, by analogy with EU competition rules, anti-competitive practices and the abuse of a dominant position.  At present the Act is enforced primarily by way of private civil actions in the Courts between disputing parties.  While the Act illustrates examples of what may be prohibited, it is ultimately for the Courts to decide what constitutes a breach of the law in any case brought before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Competition (Amendment) Bill, 1994 contains provisions enabling the Competition Authority to investigate anti-competitive activity, either on its own initiative or as a result of third party complaints, and to take court actions where necessary.  In line with the Policy Agreement for Government I am committed to strengthening the enforcement of competition by giving the Competition Authority powers of enforcement and by enabling the courts to <Col N="474" /> impose stiff fines on those found to be engaging in unfair competition.  I intend to seek to have the Bill enacted as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The appointment of the consultants, to assist the task force which I established to review certain procedures in the commercial state companies operating under the aegis of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, was made following a competitive tendering process in accordance with the Government procedures.  The <Col N="475" /> fee quoted by the successful consultant was £126,000 excluding VAT.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>BGE has a statutory obligation to develop and maintain a system for the supply of natural gas on a commercial basis and any proposals for an extension of the gas grid are assessed by the board in the light of that obligation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="476" /> Only projects which meet the board's economic criteria are undertaken.  In that context, I am anxious that the network should be extended to other areas of the country where that would be commercially viable.</P>
    <P>I have received repeated representations seeking extensions of the BGE gas grid to Shannon, County Clare.  I have asked the board to investigate the economics of extensions to Shannon, Ennis, Tralee, Galway and other towns and this investigation is ongoing.</P>

      <P>The PESCA programme is a European Union-funded Initiative being implemented by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) on behalf of the Department of the Marine.  The programme is part of the European Union's response to structural changes in the fishing industry, and provides aid for a range of measures intended to assist diversification within the industry or into other activities.  PESCA covers all coastal counties and will run until 1999.  The number of projects assisted in any particular county will of course depend on the number and the suitability of the applications received from promoters in that county.</P>
      <P>A proposal by the Belderrig Development Association in Foxford, County Mayo, was among the twenty-two projects which have so far been approved for funding under the PESCA Initiative. This project aims to carry out a feasibility study on the development of Belderrig Harbour for marine tourism. It will cost over £18,000 of which almost £10,000 will be contributed by the Exchequer and the European Union.</P>
