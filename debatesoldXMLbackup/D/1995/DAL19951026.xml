    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1 and 2.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the proceedings on No. 1, if not previously concluded shall be brought to a conclusion at 1 p.m.  The following arrangements shall apply: (1) the speech of each Member shall not exceed 20 minutes; (2) Members may share time and (3) a Minister of State shall be called to make a speech in reply not later than 12.50 p.m.  The Dáil on its rising today shall adjourn until Tuesday, 7 November 1995.</P>

      <P>Are the proposals for dealing with No. 1 satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Is the proposal that the Dáil on rising today will adjourn until Tuesday, 7 November 1995 satisfactory and agreed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>While not formally opposing the Government's proposal, may I use the occasion to ask the Taoiseach yet again if he will give us details of the legislative programme arranged for the following week?  A cursory look at the Order Paper will show that Private Members' Business far out-weighs any firm programme of Government legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be more than happy to arrange a discussion on the likely timing of legislation with the principal Opposition party through that party's Whip if that would be helpful.  I have given indications in the House over recent weeks of legislation that is at a very advanced stage of preparation and which will be available to be taken either when the Dáil resumes or soon thereafter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Taoiseach that Fianna Fáil is the largest Opposition party as opposed to the principal Opposition party.  Will the Taoiseach state if the Government is proposing that we also adjourn during the week of the divorce referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more than happy to be corrected by Deputy Harney as to the proper description of Fianna Fáil; I think &ldquo;principled&rdquo; might be a better word.  The matter of an adjournment for the week of the divorce referendum has not yet been considered.  I would be happy to get views from the Opposition parties and others as to whether that would be helpful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>A Whips' meeting was postponed yesterday until next Wednesday.  Will the Taoiseach, through his Whip, indicate this week what legislation it is proposed to take when we come back?  We on this side of the House would like some time to prepare rather than be told next Wednesday what legislation is coming up the following Tuesday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Minister of State and Government Whip, Deputy Jim Higgins, that there will be a meeting of the Whips next Wednesday at which he will be able to give the Deputy very full information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy has problems about the timing of meetings, perhaps the easiest thing to do is have a <Col N="1543" /> discussion through the normal channels with the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with meeting on Wednesday and have already agreed to that.  However, I asked the Taoiseach if he could indicate exactly what legislation will be taken the following week so we know this week before going home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be back here next week even though the Dáil is not sitting.  I gather he has indicated he will be attending a meeting on Wednesday.  Obviously the Government will make this information available to the Opposition parties as soon as possible, either at the Whips' meeting or independently of the Whips' meeting if that is possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather than taking up time in the House on a matter that can best be dealt with through the normal channels of communication which exist in this and every other Parliament, I suggest that Deputy Ahern discuss the matter with Deputy Jim Higgins.  I have no doubt he will be facilitated in every way possible by the Minister of State.</P>

      <P>Having regard to events in late 1994 and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs then expressed wish that the Attorney General would come before the House to explain some of his actions, does the Taoiseach contemplate the introduction of legislation which would allow the Attorney General to come before the House to explain his intervention with the national broadcasting authority regarding a child sex abuse programme?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Work is proceeding on the provision of representation in the Seanad for emigrants.  This will require a constitutional amendment which, in turn, will require a referendum.  Work is being done by the Minister for the Environment on the many technical aspects of this matter.  It is likely the question of a referendum and a date for it will determine retroactively the date for the introduction of the legislation on representation for emigrants.  It is not possible, therefore, for the Government to answer Deputy Kitt's question as to the date for the introduction of the legislation.  Although no decision has been taken I expect that the referendum might be one of a number to be taken on the same day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to answer as accurately and fully as possible the Deputy's legitimate question. Obviously one of the factors which will determine the introduction of the legislation is the determination of other questions to be taken on the same day. I assure the Deputy that this issue is being worked upon intensively by the Minister for the Environment and it is high on his agenda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That, pursuant to section 1 (2) <i>(b)</i> of the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995 (No. 22 of 1995), it be hereby declared that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Part II of that Act in so far as it relates to&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  Dáil Éireann and its members,</P>
      <P>(ii)  the Clerk of Dáil Éireann,</P>
      <P>(iii)  committees of Dáil Éireann and their members and clerks,</P>
      <P>(iv)  joint committees of Dáil and Seanad Éireann and their members and clerks,</P>
      <P>(b)  Part III of that Act in so far as it relates to the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of Dáil Éireann, and</P>
      <P>(c)  Parts V and VI of that Act in so far as they relate to members of Dáil Éireann,</P>
      <P>shall come into operation on the 1st day of January, 1996.</P>
      <P>Last week I heard a radio show on which a well known singer was asked who he would least like to share a taxi with and his answer was &ldquo;any politician&rdquo;. There is cynicism about people in public life and a belief that we in this House are only out for what we can get out of politics.  People in politics, never mind the long hours worked and the strong commitment to public service on all sides of the House, are all tarred with the same brush &mdash; that we belong to a discredited profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the reason the Ethics in Public Office Act is important to us as Deputies and in strengthening trust in our democracy.  It is also important for confidence in the public service and the wider public sector.  It sets out to put the facts, not the myths, on the record.  It establishes the principle of openness in <Col N="1551" /> addressing any potential conflicts of interest.  It sets out a framework where the conduct of public business and the private interests of people in public positions are seen to be kept separate.</P>
    <P>Ministers and Deputies, civil servants and people running State companies are in positions of public trust.  The Act provides a framework for identifying and dealing with potential conflicts of interest in these roles.  It enables people in public life to demonstrate that the values of public service come first and people in positions of public influence to show that they keep their public duties and their private interests separate. Its mechanisms are a safeguard to show that those who work in the public's name are working on behalf of the public interest.</P>
    <P>These rules on disclosure of interests echo those in other parliaments among our European neighbours and in the European Parliament itself.  They are a basic feature of democracies in the modern world.</P>
    <P>The Act provides for the annual registration of interests by people in key public positions &mdash; Oireachtas Members and Ministers, the Attorney General, senior civil and public servants, board members and senior executives of State companies and Ministers' special advisers.  It sets out procedures for handling conflicts of interest which arise on the job and new rules in relation to the acceptance of gifts by office holders. It introduces greater openness and accountability into personal appointments by office holders and provides for an independent commission to oversee key provisions of the Act and investigate complaints.</P>
    <P>The Act has been debated at length both in the House and in committee &mdash; few Acts have received a more thorough going over &mdash; with spirited contributions from all sides, including Deputy Connolly and Deputy McCreevy of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Michael McDowell of the Progressive Democrats, the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, who fronted for Fine Gael, the Minister of State, Deputy <Col N="1552" /> Rabbitte, of Democratic Left and Deputy Willie Penrose of my own party who made a robust contribution.</P>
    <P>Our purpose today is not to revisit those debates.  The Act is now law and today we are making arrangements to commence those sections which apply to Members of this House.  This is in line with the constitutional principle that each House regulates its own affairs.</P>
    <P>The Government has already made the commencement order to bring the other sections of the Act, other than the provisions for Deputies and Senators, into operation from 1 November.  The Minister for Finance, the designated Minister under the Act, is proceeding with the necessary orders to apply the Act in respect of the public service.</P>
    <P>As the Act is a technical one, I will set out in simple terms the provisions that we are making for the commencement order today.  I have already circulated during the summer an informal guide to the Act's requirements for Deputies and Ministers which covers these issues in somewhat more detail.</P>
    <P>A select committee of this House chaired by the Ceann Comhairle must be set up under the Act with the statutory task to prepare guidelines on compliance with the Act for Deputies and to offer advice on individual queries from Members.  A similar select committee of the Seanad will have the same functions for that House.  This follows the constitutional provision, Article 15.10, that each House regulates its own affairs.</P>
    <P>The guidelines will be drawn up following consultation with the independent commission which oversees the Act for Ministers and senior public servants and with the Seanad select committee to ensure maximum consistency. It will be an important protection under the Act for Deputies to show that they were acting on the advice or following the guidelines laid down by the committee if a complaint was made.  A further role for the committee is to investigate complaints and report to the House. The committee will have comprehensive powers to summon witnesses.</P>
    <P>Preparatory work on setting up the <Col N="1553" /> committee and preparing the guidelines can begin when today's order has been made to ensure that all the necessary elements are in place for the commencement of these sections on 1 January. The House may also consider any amendments required to the Standing Orders of this House.</P>
    <P>The Act requires two types of disclosure of Deputies, as it does of all groups which come within its remit: an annual statement of interest and <i>ad hoc</i> declarations of interest where a conflict of interest may directly arise, that is, in speaking or voting on a specific issue.</P>
    <P>Oireachtas Members, including Ministers, must set out annual statements of their interests in a public register.  The first register covers interests arising from the time the Act was passed to the first registration date, that is, from 22 July to the end of January next.  The interests to be declared in the register are outside income; shares and directorships; land, but not the family home; gifts, other than personal gifts; public contracts and work as a paid lobbyist. These points are covered in more detail in the informal guide which I have already circulated to Deputies.</P>
    <P>These interests are similar to those listed in other parliaments.  Interests below a threshold value do not have to be disclosed, that is, assets or shares worth £10,000 or less, income of £2,000 or less, or gifts worth £500 or less.  These amounts will be index linked.  In no case is disclosure of the amount of income or the value of the interest required.</P>
    <P>In addition, when speaking or voting in the Houses of the Oireachtas, Members will be required to make a formal declaration if the issue involves a potential conflict of interest for either themselves or a connected person, that is, a close relative or business partner. A simple statement that the Member has an interest is sufficient.</P>
    <P>As people holding executive positions, Ministers and other office holders are required to make a more comprehensive declaration of interests than ordinary Members.  In addition to the annual declaration of their personal <Col N="1554" /> interests, which as in the case of other Members forms part of the public register, Ministers are required to make an additional private declaration of those interests of their spouses and children known to them which could have a bearing on their public duties.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the independent commission have to be informed where a Minister proposes to exercise a function of his or her office which could potentially benefit themselves, their immediate family or business associates, or another Minister.  The Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle are office holders under the Act.  In line with the developing role of Oireachtas committees, it will be open to the House to designate the Chairs of particular committees as office holders under the Act.  An Attorney General who is a Member will also come under the provisions for office holders.  An Attorney General who is not a Member is treated in the same way as other senior public servants.</P>
    <P>The order before the House provides for a commencement day of 1 January next for the sections of the Act dealing with Members.  The first registration date for registration of Members' interests is 31 January next.  Members have 30 days from the registration date in which to register their interests.  The register is laid before the Houses following a further 30 days.  In other words, Members will make their first declarations by the beginning of March and these will be published in the beginning of April.</P>
    <P>The Act deals not only with politicians. It sets out rules for the disclosure of potential conflicts of interest for senior civil servants and those running State bodies.</P>
    <P>Senior public servants, senior executives and members of State bodies are required to make annual declarations which are private in respect of their own interests and of those interests known to them of their spouse and children which could have a bearing on their public duties.  They are also required to make once off declarations where a potential <Col N="1555" /> conflict of interest, involving themselves or close connections, could arise in the performance of official duties.  Further, they are generally forbidden, as a term of their conditions of appointment, from performing a function where there is a conflict of interest unless there are compelling reasons for so doing.  In such cases these reasons must be given in writing to the relevant authority and made available to the independent commission. These rules are based on the existing guidelines which operate for senior executives and board members of State companies.  They provide an important safeguard.</P>
    <P>The Act is careful to strike a balance between serving the public interest through disclosure and respecting the legitimate right to personal privacy. Those in public life declare their own interests on a public register.  Declarations by public servants and State board members will be confidential to the relevant authority.  Declarations in relation to family interests, which are required only from people in executive positions, from Ministers but not from ordinary TDs, will likewise be confidential to the commission.  Any unauthorised disclosure of such information will constitute a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>Apart from addressing the separation of public and private interests, the Act also deals with gifts to office holders, and with the appointment of personal advisers and assistants by Ministers.  The Act provides that any gift worth over £500 given to a Minister, their spouse or child by virtue of that ministerial office becomes the property of the State.</P>
    <P>As regards personal appointments by office holders, e.g. personal assistants and special advisers, the Act provides that these will be temporary and will cease when the office holder leaves office.  The Government will be precluded from appointing such persons to permanent positions in the Civil Service. This gives legal effect to what is already <Col N="1556" /> established practice.  The Act also provides for publication of details of all such personal appointments.</P>
    <P>An independent commission will oversee key provisions of the Act in respect of office holders, special advisers, public servants, including civil servants, and senior executives of State boards, mirroring the role of the select committee in relation to overseeing the Act in this House.  The commission will undertake the investigation of complaints of possible contraventions in respect of these groups.  The commission will comprise the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Ombudsman, the Ceann Comhairle and the Clerks of Dáil and Seanad Éireann.  A Cheann Comhairle, you will have onerous roles as both Chairman of the select committee and Member of the commission, which, I am sure, you will discharge with distinction.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the motion before us today is to bring those provisions of the Act as apply to the Dáil into operation from 1 January next.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>My party was in Government when the origins of this Act were being discussed.  It was published during the term of office of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Coalition.</P>
      <P>The purpose of today's motion is, as the Minister said, to bring the regulations of the Act into effect from 1 January next.  It is a little unusual that regulations under an Act are discussed in the House.  It does not happen often.  It can be done on any occasion if they are challenged and sometimes Government Ministers decide to bring the regulations before the House.  On this occasion, I suggest the reason the regulations under the Ethics in Public Office Act are being brought before the House is that the Government has run out of business and it fills a few hours of Dáil time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Act has been fully debated in select committee and in greater depth than most other Bills, including Finance Bills and other possibly more important Bills for the following reasons: (a) there <Col N="1557" /> was considerable interest among Members on all sides of the House; and, (b) there is exceptional interest in the media with regard to anything which affects politicians.</P>
    <P>I have no problem with the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995, because I readily recognise we must proceed in this fashion.  The vast majority of Members have nothing to fear from the publication of any documents or register which will be formed.</P>
    <P>The Minister made the point that the Act will restore public confidence in the tarnished image of politicians.  I do not think it will even though I welcome the Act.  This must be the only profession in Ireland &mdash; perhaps politicians all over the world suffer in the same way &mdash; but we are acutely aware of it in the Irish context, whose individual members go out of their way to debase it.  I am a chartered accountant and Deputy Michael McDowell is an eminent practising barrister.  In both professions, members compete against one another for business, even though barristers do not admit it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>They do not engage in price competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Except in the upward spiral of price competition because there is such a limited number of them.</P>
      <P>In any event, if one member of the club were attacked, both Deputy McDowell and I would go out of our way in our respective professions to, at least, defend the club atmosphere.  In Dáil Éireann and Irish politics, particularly over the past 15 years or so, we have gone out of our way to do the opposite.  Whatever we could say about one another that would bring disgrace on that person, and eventually upon all politicians, we have said.  It is amazing then that politicians get up and ask why people are so cynical about politicians. I suggest it has been politicians themselves who have brought this about over the past 15 years with the help of an ever compliant media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not blame the persons in the <Col N="1558" /> media for reporting or investigating as it is believed that this sells newspapers. One could predict every few months that a certain newpaper will run an article on TD's long holidays.  It is something which will fill the pages.  There will always be a TD or someone from the other House there who will not give the full picture.  When we have been attacked in the public press for excessive salaries, travel, etc., we have always had TDs who go along with it because they believe if they play to the media, they will get favourable publicity.  Is it any wonder we bred the cynicism which the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald rightly points out is there?</P>
    <P>I do not believe this Act will do much to restore public confidence in politicians. I have been on record a long time as having said one of the main reasons people lost confidence in politicians is not that we keep denigrating ourselves, even though that is an important factor, but that over a long period of years successive Governments, which were composed of all the parties now in this House, have gone out of their way to run the country in a totally irresponsible fashion and have pandered to the public will.</P>
    <P>We will shortly get to the stage where, like the United States of America, we will be governed by opinion poll.  Politicians and political parties who go down that road for short-term political gain debase the currency of politics in the long-term.</P>
    <P>This aspect of politics has been advanced in the past number of years by a number of parties in this House. Whether in Government or in Opposition, Fianna Fáil has been on the other end of it.  We have been attacked consistently. I am not saying other politicians and parties have not suffered over the years but, in general, Fianna Fáil is perceived as the receptacle for bad things in political life and politics. Notwithstanding my friendship with the Minister of State, which goes back to our time in University College, Dublin, I think Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald honestly believes that.  I do not think it is <Col N="1559" /> out of base motives.  Since before she came into this House and shortly after coming into the House, I have heard her make many statements.  I do not necessarily blame her but this is a common perception among a certain class, in which the Minister of State moves, perhaps more frequently than I do.  It is not only her.  Many people of her generation and background believe that about my political party.</P>
    <P>This generation of Fianna Fáil and Front Bench will fight back when accused.  In the past, and I have been a Member of this House since 1977, Fianna Fáil preferred to get on with the business and, whether under former Deputy Haughey or Deputy Reynolds, more or less said there was no point trying to defend ourselves against a lot of it.  No one would believe us, there was an ever compliant media and they were well able to listen to all these bad things.</P>
    <P>The reconstituted Fianna Fáil parliamentary party and Members of the Front Bench have had enough and will fight back.  An article in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 25 October 1995 carried the heading: &ldquo;Ignoring the kudos to be gained from backing high political standards&rdquo;. The political correspondent made great play about the Electoral Bill and implied that Fianna Fáil's position on it was what one would expect from that party.  The same political correspondent, and others, have long argued that Fianna Fáil will do anything to get votes and that it has nothing to do with standards, ideas or policies.  That is what emanates from the media, particularly <i>The Irish Times</i> and I have had enough of it.  They state that this is what one can expect from Fianna Fáil; everything is done to get votes, nothing is too low for us to stoop to and we are not to be accepted in any form.</P>
    <P>The thrust of the article is that there are political kudos and votes to be gained from going down the road advocated by the political correspondent.  He and others have argued that this party will do anything to get votes yet in the article he states that Fianna Fáil cannot <Col N="1560" /> bring themselves to face up to the Act even though there may be votes in it. As far as this party is concerned, turning logic on its head is nothing new for the media or for that newspaper but this defies belief.  The article mentioned Deputy Dempsey and I am sure he will be well able to defend himself.</P>
    <P>If we think the Ethics in Public Office Act will change public attitude towards politicians while one of the major organs of the State continues to campaign vigorously against my party &mdash; as they are entitled to do &mdash; we need to think again.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State's statement that guidelines will be published. As I said on Committee Stage, I hope a booklet will be published so that every Member will know how to comply with the provisions of the Act.  My colleagues, Deputy Connolly, put forward various proposals to guard against the making of vexatious claims in the run up to an election but these were not accepted.</P>
    <P>The Act is a good one and I welcome it.  Most Members who are more worried about their liabilities than their assets have nothing to fear.  There is belief, fostered more by the party of which the Minister of State is a member than any other, that every Member is up to his ears in scandal, money dealing, asset management and has all kinds of income.  The majority of Members find it hard to live on the salaries generously given to them by the taxpayer.  The Devlin Commission used to assess the salaries of politicians, the Judiciary and higher public servants.  This was replaced by what was known as the Gleeson recommendations.  Successive Governments had great problems in implementing them.</P>
    <P>I was proud to be a member of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government that decided in the summer of 1994 to implement the recommendations. However, I was disappointed when the new Government used the same old cop out and deducted the increase in salaries recommended for members of the incoming Government.  The media <Col N="1561" /> pressure was too much for them.  My advice to all Members is that the people do not respect any profession that debases itself.  I do not know any medical doctor who gets more business because his fees are the cheapest, nor do I know of any chartered accountant who gets more business for a similar reason and I certainly do not know of any barrister who gets the best business because his fees are the cheapest.  The opposite is the case.  We make the same mistake by responding to people who write about us.  The people are not really concerned about the salary a poliitican receives.  However, if they are asked in an opinion poll they will say we are paid too much but we are less respected for postponing increases than if we accepted the increases recommended by an independent commission. I was very disappointed when colleagues with whom I served in the previous Government postponed them. Does anybody remember that now? When it is decided to grant the increases the same journalists will write the same old rubbish about us and the debate will continue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Act.  I would like to think that it will increase public confidence in Oireachtas representatives, as stated by the Minister of State.  I hope it will but I will not hold my breath.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>My position has been consistent in that I have always favoured the establishment of a register of interests in the House.  The Act has that effect and in so far as it achieves that it is an unduly cumbersome method of doing what virtually every Legislature does by Standing Orders. However, it seeks to extend its remit to people who hold public office in various guises and in that respect its effects could not be achieved by a change in Standing Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My interest was drawn to the opening remarks of the Minister of State when she quoted a singer on a radio show saying the last person the singer would like to share a taxi with was a politician. There is a fair number of singers with <Col N="1562" /> whom I would not care to share a taxi either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy McDowell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not the slightest bit worried about that kind of remark.  In any democracy I do not think politicans ever will be the flavour of the month.  Certainly barristers realise they never will be the heroes of any democratic society, but there are circumstances in which the members of any profession should stop digging holes and denigrating their profession and instead begin to defend it if and when publicly criticised.</P>
      <P>I also agree with Deputy McCreevy that, if there were a full statement, as opposed to a statement of registerable interests, of the financial affairs of Members, if the full unvarnished truth were required to be published in general terms, the only surprise would be at the relative poverty of the Members of this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Or minus net worth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Nobody I know of has enriched themselves to any significant extent by participation in the political process.  Personally, I have found that the only financial effect of participation in politics has been disastrous. I am not pleading for sympathy, but merely making the point that, were I not a Member of this House, my net worth would be substantially more than it is now.  That does not apply just to me but to many others who, had they applied their talents and energies to selfish pursuit of wealth in their various professions, trades or callings, would be far better off for never having darkened the door of Leinster House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, the corollary of that point is that many people now believe, and say it to Members, including myself, that we must be mad to be in politics since it is thankless and pointless and is a demeaning profession of which to be a member.  That public incredulity that <Col N="1563" /> anybody who has anything to offer would bother to make a contribution to the political system is a serious problem which this Bill does not address.  There will be no register of what people could have earned had they remained outside this House, no register of the long hours they put in here.  Deputies who lose their seats and livelihoods will not be registered.  There will be no newspaper articles written about those ruined by politics nor about those whose health has quietly collapsed owing to their political commitment.  There will never be any public interest in the down side of political involvement but there is a huge appetite for suspicion that there is some secret up side to being in politics that motivates people corruptly and secretly to participate in a profession which otherwise appears to be unrewarding.</P>
    <P>I have no reason to believe that any legislation ever can seriously improve the general ethical complexion of our political system.  If one can influence decisions by brown paper bags, be they in the planning, political, legal process or anywhere else &mdash; and suspicions that these things happen are greatly exaggerated &mdash; this Bill will never stop that. This Bill will not root out or expose corruption.  Anybody who wants to behave corruptly will not find that this Bill offers them a moment's worry or in any sense amounts to an obstacle to their corrupt path in politics.  If one wanted to make corrupt decisions one could drive a coach and horses through this Bill if its provisions ever were invoked.</P>
    <P>This Bill will not clean up politics.  It whitewashes some aspects of politics perhaps, but will never clean up politics in the sense that it cannot offer the electorate any guarantees that henceforth their politicians will be more upright and less corrupt because this Bill is in operation.</P>
    <P>If one wanted to make money out of peddling political influence one would be far better off not being a Member of this House but a public relations consultant who can and will charge clients <Col N="1564" /> hefty fees for influencing others.  Certainly within my time in this House I have never witnessed any opportunity for a Member to make the kind of substantial sums some people in the private sector appear to make out of lobbying us.  If there were to be protections of the public interest in that regard, then concentrating on politicians probably is the last exercise in which one should engage.  If and when influence is peddled by a professional group of consultants and lobbyists, public attention should focus on them rather than on those whom they seek to influence.</P>
    <P>One shortcoming of this Bill which persists is its failure to address the relationship between the public service and the private sector in one very serious and material respect.  Where is it provided in this Bill that senior members of public bodies and senior civil servants may not take up directorships in companies with which they had dealt previously as public servants? I think that is provided for, to some limited extent, across the water in Britain.</P>
    <P>There should be a code of practice in this country that prevents senior office-holders in the public service and in public bodies from retiring from one job and thereafter joining a group with which they had dealt previously on behalf of the public sector, at least for a period of time, in order to demonstrate that their subsequent appointment cannot be related to anything they did while in public office.  It is not good enough that large firms can have a relationship which people making decisions about their fate which enables those firms to recruit those same people after they resign from positions in which they have substantially influenced the commercial success or failure of those companies.  That is an area with which the Bill does not deal.  I wonder whether it is necessary that it should deal with it. Perhaps it would be better were there to be a convention to the effect that, say, a Secretary or Assistant Secretary of a Department could not resign and join a company with which his Department had had close dealings over a period of <Col N="1565" /> one or two years.  That would remove the suspicion that people holding high office in certain Departments of State expect to be invited to join the boards of companies with which they had dealings while exercising public authority.  The Minister of State might apply her mind to this issue.  I cannot imagine how to draft a section of a Bill which will achieve that end, but we need to put in place a convention along those lines.  I do not criticise the public service when I say this, but it is undesirable, as undesirable as it would be for a High Court judge to resign and become a director of an insurance company whose cases he had decided until the time of his resignation of retirement.</P>
    <P>One of the things which disappointed me was that the promise to consider this Bill in tandem with the Electoral Bill was not kept.  The Second Stage of the Electoral Bill is now before the House, but the Ethics in Public Office Bill will come into operation before it is dealt with.  I am deeply suspicious of the moral stance of those who say politics will be cleaned up if contributions to political parties are transparent and parties &mdash; if not wholly placed on the public payroll &mdash; are provided with a basic income from public funds.  I do not believe that will have the intended effect.  Politicians require public help much more in the area of assistance to carry out their duties rather than direct funding for their re-election campaigns. An analogy of sorts exists between the argument that it is wrong to use tax-payers' money to fund one side in a referendum and the argument that it is wrong to use taxpayers' money to pay political parties' expenses between elections, on the basis of the outcome of the most recent election.  Using taxpayers' money in this way effectively makes the result of the next election more likely to correspond with the result of the last one.</P>
    <P>On the subject of using public moneys in the political domain, I listened to Deputy Shatter deal very ably with Mr. Binchy on the radio this morning.  He said public funding was necessary to <Col N="1566" /> counteract propaganda from the anti-divorce group during the referendum campaign.  It seems that the use of public funds to affect the outcome of elections or referenda is deeply suspect.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to think in terms of a complex issue such as Maastricht or the Single European Act and state that these were circumstances where public funding could be so used.  However, is it correct to use public funding in relation to a social issue such as divorce?  Is it correct to use public funds in a campaign to eliminate proportional representation and return to the straight vote system, to curtail the independence of the Judiciary or to deprive some religious minority of their rights or citizenship under the Constitution?  Would public funding be made available to finance such projects because a majority of the Dáil felt use could be made of the Exchequer's resources to promote its view of society?  I doubt it.</P>
    <P>This legislation and the Electoral Bill, which were supposed to be considered in tandem, are examples of using statutes to attempt to persuade the public that all is well.  They also represent an attempt to create the illusion that it is possible to legislate for honesty in politics by use of statutory provisions.  The only guarantee of honesty in politics is the standards of the people who vote in elections.  They know the people with whom they are dealing and can judge them reasonably.  If they do not know, or are not prepared to make assumptions about the calibre of the people with whom they are dealing, they have no business voting for them.  The best judgment of the honesty or integrity of a politician must be that, if his or her political standards fall below those required or desired by the public, he or she can be removed from office at the next election.  The electorate cannot cast responsibility for its faulty judgments on to the Legislature.</P>
    <P>It is not our duty or function to put laws in place to attempt to assure the electorate that we are honest, upright people.  It is the function and responsibility of the electorate to ensure that <Col N="1567" /> their politicians are what they require. This legislation is more of an aspiration than a guarantee.  It will not guarantee anyone that politics following its enactment will be different to politics prior to its enactment.  It may have a symbolic effect in that some elementary safeguards will be in place.  However, those safeguards are unnecessary or redundant, in large measure.  As Deputy McCreevy stated, Members would be better to spend time assuring the public that politics is not a way to become wealthy, is not corrupt and does not need more legislation to prevent it being corrupt.  The reverse is the case.  Any shortcomings which the Irish political system may have are largely shortcomings inherent in our society and due to the choices voters make on election day.</P>
    <P>It has most emphatically not been the case, from my experience, that Members of this House are brokers in influence for personal gain.  There are many faults in our political culture including patronage and favouritism, which probably exist in every political culture.  Personal corruption, however, is not a vice which I have ever encountered in this House.  In so far as the Irish political system wishes to vindicate itself &mdash; I echo Deputy McCreevy's statement in this regard &mdash; I wish to place on record my feeling that the largest sacrifices in favour of democracy are made by those who engage in the political process. They make the big sacrifices and in large measure they are the losers personally, economically and in their family lives.  We should never cease to point out to the electorate that going into politics is not a sign of madness &mdash; as they will say over a pint in a pub &mdash; or a thing a cute person would not do but is a matter of public service.  We should not pander to those who believe that the dominant motive of those who engage in political life at a representative level is self-interest.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill but have certain reservations about it.  I agree with Deputies Michael McDowell and McCreevy because as an auctioneer serving on the urban council and the county council I am debarred from council work and as a Member I am debarred from every doing Government work of any sort.  Some people view political life as a blood sport and great fun but they do not see the commitments that public representatives make to democracy and the work they put into trying to be honest and decent in public life.  All that is reflected in the media is smart remarks about politicians.</P>
      <P>Recently I read in a newspaper what property a Minister in the Government owned.  I met a constituent who said he had thought that man had more property and was wealthier than that.  If people like me or other Deputies stayed in business we would make a great deal more money.  People ask why we get involved in politics.  One gets involved in politics because one believes one can do some good for the country, for the community and the county.  That is why I got involved in politics.  I try to do the best job I can on behalf of the people who elected me.</P>
      <P>There are cynical people who will say what they like about you.  At times you would feel like suing them but that is only a waste of time.  What is said is hurtful to public representatives and their families.  Public officials implementing Government policy on halting sites in my county are the subject of vicious talk.  It is wrong that people say nasty things about public officials and public representatives. People should think before they talk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill but I have a problem with the fact that politicians can no longer come into this House and look for better pay and facilities for TDs because straight away the media will report that we are at it again.  I have a small auctioneering firm in the west and before I was elected I had a fax <Col N="1569" /> machine, yet in 1995 there is no fax machine in my office in the Dáil.  The general community expects a good and reliable service but simple facilities, the provision of which would not place a great burden on the taxpayer, are not in place in this House.</P>

      <P>Our secretaries are overworked.  I would love to have more time to research the issue on which I speak but I have no researchers available and my secretary is already overworked.  It is wrong that we do not have research staff.  People say TDs are paid a massive salary but say nothing of the tax we pay. When I go home to the west tonight I will attend three public meetings, tomorrow morning I will be at my clinics and we do not know what funerals I will have to attend and who will be calling to the house.  Saturdays, Sundays and bank holidays do not matter in politics. People will come to your house and you have to bring them in and deal with them.  That is the way it has to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no difficulty with Members' interests and assets being public but I do not think it should be on the front page of <i>The Star, The Irish Times</i> or the <i>Irish Independent.</i> I find it difficult enough to live and I do not know too many millionaires in the Dáil.  It would be grand if we knew when elected to the Dáil that we would be here for the rest of our lives or if we lost our seat there would be provision for us.  This is where the media do not give us credit.  I have been in the Dáil for 15 months and am an auctioneer with three young children. The seats in the constituency have been reduced from six to five, by decision of a committee set up by the Dáil, and there is no guarantee that the present Members will be elected at the next election.  One could be left trying to get one's business up and running again. <Col N="1570" /> Nobody has any sympathy if the business is gone.  It is difficult to do two jobs but one has to keep an eye on one's business because of the uncertainty of losing one's seat.  If you have been a Member of this House for ten or 15 years things are fine because you have a pension but someone who loses his seat after one term has nothing and his business may be gone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have absolutely no difficulty with this Bill.  Once and for all the myth of the gravy train in Leinster House should be blown out of the water.  In the eight years I have been in this House I have not seen hidden wealth or opportunities for making money.  I know only what it has cost me. If Members have wealth they were successful in their private life but they have to make a sacrifice to come in here.  We need to attract successful people who can generate ideas that are for the benefit of all.  The business they left will not be as successful as if they had remained. I have absolutely no doubt that they had to make a sacrifice to enter politics.  I could name numerous Members who, had they remained in the business in which they were involved, would have been extremely wealthy, but they had a flair for public life and felt they had a contribution to make.  The general public perceive that once you get into Leinster House you are on a gravy train. That is nonsense.  I believe the media have a role.  It is time that people are shown for what they are and that the Members come in here to do a job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am slightly confused about the declaration of interests.  I am a farmer and I am fairly interested in agriculture and have a good knowledge of it.  In my parliamentary party there would be solicitors, doctors and so on and when we all come together we can have a viewpoint on policy.  The same applies to all the other parties.  If there is a debate on agriculture, must I declare that I have no personal interest?  Of course it would benefit my farm in Cavan if we got better export refunds.  However, I am not taking part in the debate from personal <Col N="1571" /> interest but because I know it will benefit agriculture here.  Likewise, if we are debating the legal system, does Deputy McDowell have to declare that he would not benefit from changes?  Of course his practice may benefit.  He is a man with a high reputation, and it is good that such people give of their time in this House when they would be extremely successful outside the House.</P>
    <P>If the sacrifice aspect of being in public like is mentioned, people ask us why we went into politics.  I do not like that attitude.  A sacrifice is made by elected representatives whether at urban, town commissioner, county council or Oireachtas level.  Once one becomes a public representative one's life becomes public.  Constituents with problems go to their public representatives and have no regard for the fact that he or she may also have problems.  The public representative must be available at any time of the day or night on any day of the week, Sundays and bank holidays not excepted.  Constituents want their problems addressed immediately. People entering public life accept that, but the public must realise that there is sacrifice involved and that the family life of the public representative can be disrupted.</P>
    <P>People may ask why I entered public life but I am not complaining.  The same question could be asked of doctors and solicitors.  A doctor who is called out late at night might complain that the patient could have called him earlier, but the patient would probably go to another doctor.  He cannot complain, he must be available.  That must be accepted.  The public must understand that a sacrifice has to be made and the media must play a role in making the public aware of that.  The other side of the coin is the satisfaction I get from being in public life is being able to do something for people.</P>
    <P>As my party is in Government people expect I can do something for them with the result that my workload has trebled.  It is not that they are expecting something to which they are <Col N="1572" /> not entitled.  Their view is that I have closer contact with a Government Minister, and that is understandable.  They come to me expecting to get results. However, people can change their loyalties. If they are dissatisfied with a doctor they will go to another.</P>
    <P>If I can be of help to a constituent it may be said that I can pull strings.  That is nonsense.  If a person has a problem it is understandable that he would write to his public representative.  What would be the point of being in public life if one could not go to the top and get the best people to sort out a problem?  It is a serious problem for the person and if a public representative can get results, that person is grateful.  On the question of backhanders etc., in my 21 years in public life, the offers I got of the £5 note would not make anyone rich.  If somebody asks me to have a drink or gives me a bottle of whiskey at Christmas, I accept and appreciate that gesture. However, the idea that public representatives get backhanders is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>The general perception seems to be that favours can be bought and that deals are done behind closed doors.  I reject that.  Let us be open with the public and they will respond.  If there are to be deals they should be negotiated openly.  Let us be more honest with the people and not create the idea that we can pull strings.  Generally people will get nothing more than their rights, and if they get that they will be happy.</P>
    <P>It is time we decided on a fixed-term Dáil.  The change of Government recently without a general election has been marvellous for the country.</P>

      <P>There has been an increase in economic activity with fresh thinking etc. and we did not have an election or end up with a rag-bag of politicians as a result of disillusioned people voting for Jack, Tom or Harry rather than the political party that can do something.  We should have fixed-term Dála and be able to form a new <Col N="1573" /> Government within that term if a Government cannot follow through on its policies.  This would help political parties and Deputies because election campaigns are a costly exercise.</P>
      <P>There is more I would like to say but I am sure Deputy Nealon has a very enlightening contribution to make and I will yield to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a well intentioned Bill but its influence on the conduct of affairs will be minimal.  If people want to beat the system this Bill will not stop them.  It will be just another obstacle, a minor irritant to be circumvented. Nevertheless, the intention is good and in that respect I wish the Bill well.</P>
      <P>For the vast majority of Dáil Deputies it will have no relevance.  We will have nothing to declare, and the longer we are in this House the less we will have to declare.  Deputies are impoverished rather than enriched by the rewards of working here &mdash; I am talking about financial and monetary rewards, of course. We have only ourselves to blame for this.  When it comes to rewarding ourselves properly or giving ourselves the services to which we are entitled as public representatives in order to do the job for which we were elected, we are cowards. We are always looking over our shoulders and worrying about what the electorate will say.  If we were more courageous in this respect and gave ourselves the services and the monetary rewards to which we are entitled, the reaction from the public would be positive rather than negative.  In that respect I was greatly disappointed that the difficulties that arise from Deputies regarding the work they put in and the expenses they incur which are not reasonable were not taken on board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Deputy McDowell is a better authority on this Bill than I but I believe it could be challenged in the courts by any Deputy or Senator.  We, particularly in the Dáil, were elected by the public under certain conditions &mdash; it is not like being appointed to a job.  Now a new set of conditions are being imposed which impinge not just on the <Col N="1574" /> Deputy but on his family to a certain extent.  If it were challenged in the courts it could possibly be overturned for the duration of this Dáil.  It may be different when we face the electorate the next time knowing of the changed conditions.</P>
    <P>Something on which I am sure Deputy Connolly will have some strident and important comments to make is the fear that this legislation could be used to damage the reputation of a Deputy.  A person can bring an unfounded accusation to the attention of a committee or commission which, inevitably, will get into the public domain and if that happens it does not matter whether it is true of false.  Three or four months later the public will merely recall the allegation, they will not remember the outcome or whether &mdash; if it was false &mdash; the person who made it was fined.  Such accusations can be deliberately timed to damage a person's reputation at election time and politicians are in a rough game in so far as getting elected is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister endeavoured to stop such practice by increasing the fine for frivolous or unfounded allegations, but the increase is not enough.  It should be £10,000 or, as Deputy Connolly called for, £20,000.  What is £20,000 compared to the irreparable damage that may be done to the reputation of an election candidate?  The provisions of the Act enable the fine to be increased.  Despite that, however, the Electoral Bill and this Act are worthwhile, but we will not address the real issues unless we provide the services we require.  Members should have a secretary in Leinster House as well as in their constituencies, they should also have the necessary technology to operate efficiently.  That is the least we deserve.  They should also be properly paid.  The public has a cynical attitude about us, much of which may be our own fault.  We do a difficult job that is badly rewarded.  It is time we addressed these matters and the sooner the better.</P>

      <P>This legislation has been debated for more than two years and today we are dealing with the motion and regulations.  When I was elected to the Dáil four decades ago a Deputy's salary was £1,500 per annum and one secretaty worked for ten Deputies.  I recall an incident in which we did not know whether a key on an Underwood typewriter was the letter I or T, a brush had to be used to discover which letter it was.</P>

      <P>Those who have been Members of the House for as long as I have, perform their duties in a highly commendable manner with great dedication and devotion to their constituents.  They have also devoted a great deal of their time to the passage of legislation.  Some of my colleagues, from all parties, who were not re-elected left this House penniless. Many of them had young families and had left remunerative employment to serve in this House in the national interest.  However, because of the whim of the electorate they failed to be re-elected.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ring referred to constituency changes which at one time affected mainly the Dublin area, but they are now affecting Mayo where, if the six candidates go for re-election, one will not be re-elected.  That is unfortunate but the reality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been changed because of the <i>status quo</i> of the population there, we are fortunate in that regard.  I sympathise with Members who, because of boundary changes, had to move from areas they represented for <Col N="1576" /> years and relaunch themselves elsewhere where, in some cases, they faced great opposition from their party colleagues.</P>
      <P>All Members need transport, especially if they live in a rural area. Most rural Members clock up car mileage of approximately 65,000 in a two year period and perhaps more if they live in Cork, Kerry, Mayo or Donegal. When they are trading in their cars they need a minimum of £10,000 to buy another.  Because of high mileage, garage owners will not place a high value on their cars.  Many Members have to take out a mortgage to buy a new car.  I am fortunate that I own my house.  Most Members pay approximately £400 per month in mortgage repayments and £200 on car loans.  They must also pay their taxes, living costs and other expenses incurred in representing their constituents.  Many organisations approach them for funding and the new trend is to include a Member in a draw and inform the person later that he or she owes, say, £100 for the ticket.  Those selling the tickets justify their actions by saying they thought the person would wish to be included.</P>
      <P>I have been a Member of this House for a long time and I sometimes wonder whether I am in the right place or whether I am tuned in correctly to what happens here.  Some people say Deputies receive brown envelopes every week but I never saw one of them and I doubt if other Members did.  I resent the implication that politicians are corrupt.  There have been very honourable people here from across the political divide.  As other speakers said, if a Member does not behave properly his fate will be decided by the electorate at the next election.  That is the way democracy operates.</P>
      <P>I have not ever been personal in debate; I deal with the issues as I see them.  The Act provides that where an allegation of improper behaviour is made against a Member, the Clerk of the Dáil investigates the matter, but such an investigation may take months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1577" /> If a general election is held in the meantime that allegation hangs over the candidate who could be from any party.  As a woman said to me many years ago: &ldquo;There is seldom smoke without a fire&rdquo;. It is very difficult for a person to exonerate himself in those circumstances. Under the Act a fine of £1,500 may be imposed on anyone who makes a false allegation against a Member, but a number of people could form a cartel to collect that relatively small sum.  I proposed that the figure be increased to prevent frivolous, damaging allegations being made against a Member.  If a candidate against whom an allegation has been made is defeated at an election, the allegation falls.  That person may have acted properly but people will simply say that he had hard luck and it was a pity the allegation was made at that time.  I feel very strongly about that issue because unfounded allegations can be extremely damaging to Members.  I hope that no colleague across the political divide finds himself or herself in that position, but in the event of it happening I will watch with great interest to see how it is dealt with.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the spouses of members of Government declaring their interests but I have reservations in regard to the children of those members declaring their interests.  A person's son or daughter may become involved in a business transaction relating to land rezoning or land designation, a transaction which the Deputy may favour or of which he may not be aware and it may be alleged afterwards that the member concerned was aware of the transaction.</P>
    <P>In future, candidates of good calibre will consider the position fully before standing for election.  People who are faring well in business should think long and hard before coming in here.  On leaving office in 1992 I learned that returning to business was not easy and being a Member of the House is a disadvantage to my business.  I would be better off if I was not a Member.  Some people are reluctant to deal with me in view of the carry on in this House down <Col N="1578" /> the years.  Lest anyone thinks that we are well off financially, that is not true in my case nor is it true in the case of many Members.</P>
    <P>People may ask why we stand for election.  We do so for the common good.  I have a deep interest in the welfare of my country and wish to see it make good progress.  I believe I have much to offer and the people I represent obviously hold that view also.  I would not like people to think that we are here on the make.  In my years here I have never known that to be the case.  I regret to say that many people would have been better off if they had not come in here.  Certainly their work in the business arena would be much more rewarding financially.  I do not have a problem with the regulations in the Bill, but if somebody wants to upend the system the provisions in it will not guard against that.</P>
    <P>There is a perception that we are about to do a big clean up but that is not true.  The salaries that apply to Members would not attract new people into politics.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with the manner in which the Gleeson report treated Members of the House.  Deputies work seven days a week, including bank holidays, and are always on call.  In what other employment is such a commitment required?</P>

    <P>I hope when the Bill is enacted in the New Year its provisions will not pose difficulties for any Members.  Difficulties would not be caused by the Member <Col N="1579" /> concerned but by others.  As a long serving Member, I have given my views on the Bill without rancour or reference to personalities.

      <P>I listened carefully to what Deputy Connolly said.  He is a forthright and robust presenter of his case.  He participated in the debates on amendments to the Ethics in Public Office Bill on earlier stages.  However, I disagree with his approach.  The principle of accountability and transparency is one on which neither of us disagrees. Deputy Connolly missed an important point in deploring the fact that Deputies work all hours, are poorly remunerated, have an onerous job and very few have made money out of politics.  I put forward a different view.  We who are elected to the House as national politicians are privileged to serve.  We are privileged to be in a position of power and influence.  There is a heavy responsibility on us to ensure the public has confidence in us and we must put in place a statutory system covering a register of interests and donations which is transparent to guard against a conflict of interest.  We owe that to the public. We need to be paid more and we could do with a trade union to protect our interests.  However, the key issue is that we are public servants.  Like those who hold key positions on public boards and public offices in other areas, we are in the public arena and must be seen to be accountable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not very long ago since Deputy Connolly's colleague, Deputy Cowen, then a Minister, was the subject of what I would regard as a somewhat scurrilous campaign because he held 1,000 shares in a company which were worth a small <Col N="1580" /> amount of money.  If this legislation had been in place at that time, his interest in that company would have been declared and there would have been no question of anybody trying to gain political advantage or otherwise over the then Minister as he would have been protected. That example illustrates how this legislation would have benefited the Deputy's constituency colleague, and I am sure there are other examples.</P>
    <P>There is a perception among the public that politicians are not entirely honest or the type of people others look up to as role models.  I decry that view and it is unfortunate that it exists.  We get a very bad press, but there is a cynicism abroad that politicians are on the make and they will avail of any opportunity to improve their financial or other positions. That is not true, but how do we prove that to the public?  We do not do it by complaining that we get bad press, that there are scurrilous journalists and we need to put a press council in place. We can do all of that from time to time, but we must be seen to be transparent and accountable.  There is no other effective way of achieving that other than on a statutory basis.  Other parliaments have put similar legislation in place long before now and the political world has not collapsed around them. We have nothing to fear.  The fears enunciated by Deputy Connolly are unfounded.  In our work today and that carried out over many months, in the specific commitment in the last programme for Government and in this one, we are ensuring that politicians are not only answerable to the public but that our status in the public eye will be protected, defended and asserted.  That is important.</P>

      <P>In the document signed by Fianna Fáil and Labour, the Fianna Fáil and Labour Programme for a Partnership Government 1993-1997, probably no other issue was spelt out more <Col N="1581" /> clearly in terms of broadening our democracy than ethics in Government. It is interesting to note that the matter was covered in that document and enunciated by the present Administration in <i>A Government of Renewal.</i> It undertook to urgently implement what was decided in the previous manifesto.  That document outlines in great detail the provisions for the enactment of an ethics in Government Bill.  It states that in line with our commitment to open Government and transparency in all Government transactions we will undertake the following measures: enact an ethics in Government Bill; a register of Members' interests will be introduced; a similar registration of interests will be introduced for senior civil servents; the Government procedure instructions as they relate to the registration of gifts to office holders will be incorporated into the legislation.  The second part of that set of provisions states that we will introduce State funding for political parties in line with European models; we will introduce a system of registration of substantial donations and subscriptions to political parties and candidates and limits will also be imposed on expenditure for each election for each candidate and for political parties.  We have a twin track approach: first, politicians will be protected, their interests will be declared and any conflict of interest will be enunciated.  Second, we will deal with the funding of political parties and spending by candidates at election time. These are two essential elements.  Both are exceedingly positive because they will ensure that nobody can level a claim that individual politicians are making money out of politics and that in carrying out their campaigns political parties and candidates are being bank rolled by non-political interests, big business and so on.  These will enhance the profession of politicians and I fully support both.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on her timely work in bringing forward these Bills.  They fill a vacuum that would have had to be filled at some future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1582" /> While we are enhancing our democracy in terms of the role of politicians I am concerned about another item.  I listened yesterday to the debate on the Harbours Bill, much of which had to do with whether politicians should be allowed serve on harbour boards.  This question has arisen in recent years in relation to education boards, the Dublin Institute of Technology, the regional technical college board or whatever new boards were established.  Every Bill for the semi-State sector has only one prohibition. It bans national politicians, not local politicians but members of the Dáil and Seanad and MEPs as well as debtors and criminals from sitting on such boards.  That prohibition is somewhat at variance with what we are doing to enhance the role of the politician in this legislation and in the Electoral Bill. I would much prefer that we did not include in all our new legislation this prohibition on elected members of the national parliament from sitting on national State boards.  It is unnecessary. By and large politicians would not serve on them, but certainly in some cases they would serve and they would have a tremendous expertise to offer.  By having a specific prohibition we are, by innuendo, suggesting that somehow national politicians cannot be trusted or that there would be a conflict of interest not covered in this legislation.  We should look again at this prohibition in our own interests to ensure we do not undermine our position as elected politicians.</P>
    <P>We are providing a statutory system whereby key public servants and public representatives declare their interests to show transparency and to assure the public it is being served.  This will strengthen our democracy.  It will ensure that allegations levelled at us in the past cannot easily be levelled at us in the future.  I will be happier to be a Member of the House when this legislation becomes operable on 1 January 1996.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate my colleague the Minister of State on her enormous efforts and work in bringing <Col N="1583" /> this very complex legislation through the Dáil and the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs and on bringing the regulations into force.  The Minister deserves the commendation of everyone in the House and, indeed, the public, on her achievement.  I congratulate also all Deputies who contributed to the debate, none more so than Deputy Ger Connolly who made a tremendous contribution particularly on Committee Stage.  Deputy Connolly maintained a watching brief for all of us on all the complex matters particularly the roles of our families and friends.  He has made a fair case for the difficult life of a TD and the enormous pressures on backbenchers.</P>
      <P>As a student I remember reading Basil Chubb's famous book on the Irish Constitution in which he referred to the life of TDs.  He quoted a long extract from a former distinguished Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, who told him of the type of things that happened to him 40 years ago.  One incident was on the golf course, perhaps St. Anne's when constituents seeking favours more or less followed Mr. Haughey from tee to tee putting their cases and making suggestions. Mr. Haughey found it difficult to concentrate on his game.  Times have not changed that much, that happens to us every Saturday and Sunday.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not generally on the golf course, but it is a very difficult life. A corollary of the Bill could be that at long last Deputies and particularly backbenchers will receive proper remuneration.  My constituency colleague, Deputy Liam Fitzgerald, remarked during the first few days I was in this House that Deputies should be paid at least as well as a principal officer in the Civil Service.  We seem to be paid well in terms of salary and backup facilities but we are still the &ldquo;Cinderellas&rdquo; of the political system.  Yet we will be subjected to this fairly transparent and <Col N="1584" /> open regime, of which I totally approve. Perhaps the Minister would look again at remuneration and support for backbenchers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;up to one-third or 40 per cent of our salary can be spent on supporting these activities.  The partnership Government was right, as Deputy Costello said, to bring the Ethics in Public Office Act into force. Deputy Connolly who is a philosopher will remember <i>The Republic</i> by Plato, one of the first great political books in the history of mankind.  Plato found the problem of how to guard the guardians as the most difficult.  His solution was that they were not to get married and they were not to have any property.  As a result of this philosophy we have what are called platonic friendships today. Plato's solution was overstrict.  Our solution, the Ethics in Public Office Act and possibly the Electoral Bill which will complement it, is more civilised and humane and that is the reason I commend it.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons for the low esteem of politicians in the eyes of the public is that there are one or two politicians who were extremely wealthy, even though the source of their wealth was not their public life.  However, there was a remarkable coincidence between the enormous prosperity of one or two politicians and their rise to political prominence. That gave reason for concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great concern was expressed also, particularly in the County Dublin area, about the development of our city and the dramatic way in which Dublin has expanded.  There are problems in relation to people owning property on the outskirts of the city and in trying to put in place a taxation regime to address that.  Many vile rumours and innuendoes have been circulating over the past <Col N="1585" /> six months.  A prominent firm of solicitors in Newry has alleged that complaints have been made to it about the rezoning of land in the Dublin area.  We must examine that area.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, said, a taxation system is one way to deal with this problem but under the Ethics in Public Office legislation we will clearly know in what areas people have particular interests.</P>
    <P>As one of my colleagues mentioned to me this morning, declaring one's interests has been a regular practice in local government for a number of years. When certain discussions arise in our City Council chamber people declare their interests in or connection with the topic being discussed.  To that extent, there has been a degree of openness at local government level.</P>

      <P>There was always an opportunity for staff in our development and planning departments to sign the register of interests and to clarify those interests if the matter came up in subsequent debate.</P>
      <P>I welcome this motion.  I am sure everybody in this House will be happy to sign the register of interests and to indicate areas in which they may have a material interest of say whether they are connected to persons in such a way that it would be important to declare that information to the House.  I welcome also the <i>ad hoc</i> declarations system similar to the system in local government. That will give people an opportunity to outline any interests they may have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The buzz words of the 27th Dáil have been &ldquo;openness&rdquo; and &ldquo;transparency&rdquo;. We now have an opportunity to implement this legislation and I welcome what the Minister has done in that regard.  The people most affected are Ministers and top public servants.  I welcome this legislation which will clarify what most politicians have always accepted, that public life should not <Col N="1586" /> only be totally above board but should be seen to be so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I came into the Chamber to speak on the Refugee Bill but my interest in this matter has been aroused by the contributions of the last three speakers and the Minister of State.  The aims of the Bill, as set out by the Minister of State on numerous occasions, are highly commendable but, like Deputy Callely, I believe it may not achieve its better aims.  Undoubtedly there is a suspicion that there are negative aims in the legislation in that there are obviously people in political as well as public life who are suspicious of their fellow politicians.  Part of the reason for this legislation is that people feel they need to keep an eye on some of their colleagues.  That is unfortunate.</P>
      <P>One of the effects of this legislation is that the interest of the media and others &mdash; which we like to complain about in this House &mdash; will be justified by the actions and suspicions of Members and their party supporters outside this House.  That is unfortunate, I also share the concerns of some speakers that this legislation will not convince the public that the political process is beyond reproach.  In the context in which people wilfully make allegations on foot of information which they know to be at best suspect and perhaps entirely incorrect this legislation will not achieve the aim of bringing the political process into the open and making it more respectable. I doubt if anything could do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation will put additional pressure on a number of politicians who have the best interests of their constituents at heart.  I ask the Minister of State not to make public the register of interests, which would be compiled following the enactment of this legislation, unless it is relevant to some matter of public interest, legislation going through the House or some other development. It is possible that the register might become of prurient interest to some people and may be reproduced.  That would not matter in my case because I have nothing of interest to declare but <Col N="1587" /> some of my colleagues on all sides of the House may be more concerned about their poor as opposed to their advantageous financial status and the kind of comparisons which might be made following the implementation of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations about the timescale.  It will be difficult for a committee of the House, which has not yet been set up to consider the matter, to prepare the type of guidelines required under the legislation by 1 January.  I suspect many of my colleagues would have liked to express reservations about this matter but one runs the risk of being targeted if one comes into the House to express reservations about an Act such as this.  A Member may be suspected of having something to hide, which is manifestly not the case where most of us are concerned.</P>
    <P>I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Connolly, for having debated the Bill in such detail.  I had the advantage of having discussed this matter with him on a number of occasions.  While I share some of his concerns, I commend the basic aims of the legislation in terms of raising public awareness of the work of politicians and reducing the level of suspicion that appears to exist.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Members of the House for what has been a reflective debate.  Following the long teasing out process this legislation has gone through, today marks the end of one era and the beginning of another.  I have learned much from the process involved in preparing and steering legislation through this House.  It has certainly been a hugely educational experience for me</P>
      <P>I thank the Members who helped me on that journey, particularly Deputy Connolly who has probably given an unprecedented amount of time to this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy made the important point that no political party, <Col N="1588" /> particularly a party which commands the allegiance of over 40 per cent of the electorate, should be automatically deemed corrupt.  There is a knee-jerk reaction in that regard.  We were caught up in it to some extent during the last Government.  It was a period which I enjoyed and during which we did much good work.  However, we were guilty by association, anybody associated with Fianna Fáil was also enmeshed in a sea of corruption and sucked down to lower than acceptable standards.  It is unacceptable to make such a broad statement about any political party or group of TDs and the Deputy made a fair point.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy asked if I could issue another guide to the intricacies of the Act.  Today we are handing over the process to the House.  Under the Act, the committee of the House issues the guidelines.  I have staff who could write PhDs on the Act and my office will be available to offer help and assistance. Under the Constitution the House makes its own rules and regulates its own affairs.  It is now the business of the House under the Act, to interpret and issue guidelines for Members.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell raised an important point about conflicts of interest where people are working with and supervising a company one day and taking a job with them the following day.  He was referring to senior civil servants who move on to such positions. We looked at this point and it was raised during the discussion on the Bill. There are constitutional impediments to stopping anybody earning a living.  If Deputy Connolly was to lose his seat&mdash; I hope that day is long postponed&mdash;he would be entitled to go out and earn a living in whatever way he could.  There are constitutional difficulties in this area.</P>
    <P>However, the Department of Finance which regulates standards in the public service is looking at rules and guidelines which would deal with that issue as part of people's terms of appointment.  It would not be possible to introduce legislation in this regard because we must <Col N="1589" /> respect people's right to earn a living. The Deputy made a fair point.  The issue can be dealt with by drawing up guidelines for people about taking subsequent positions if there is a conflict of interest.</P>

      <P>I was slightly amused by Deputy McDowell.  His love for market economics is part of his political make-up and he protested about the money people are paid.  It is a job for which there has been no shortage of demand.  However, I accept the points made on all sides of the House, particularly about the conditions for backbenchers. As a Dublin TD I find the pressures hard enough but at least I sleep in my own bed and see my family every evening, if they are awake.  I appreciate the pressures on rural TDs and those with geographically dispersed constituencies. Those pressures may not be as widely recognised as they should be.  It is easy to make cheap shots about long holidays.  People in our business work very hard and long hours with little time off.  In the new year I will introduce legislation to place a ceiling on working hours for ordinary workers.  The maximum will be 48 hours a week.  Most of us would love a maximum 48 hour week.</P>

      <P>I do not think we will.  Deputy McDowell also mentioned the Electoral Bill which, as Deputy Broughan said, is part of the overall package.  A number of Deputies mentioned the need for more back-up for TDs in the area of research.  I raised that point with Deputy Howlin who is now steering the Electoral Bill through the House.  A percentage of public funding should be invested in research and it is important to accept the rationale for <Col N="1590" /> public funding.  It is preferable that there is no suspicion that any of us would be influenced by disproportionate funding from business, trade union or other interests.  That is why State funding for political parties is important.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ring made a thoughtful contribution and described life as it often is for people.  Deputy Boylan asked if, as a farmer, he has to declare his interest each time the House debates headage and so on.  The Act states clearly that where people are dealing with an issue in which they have a general interest which is shared by a wide number of the general public, it is not declarable.  Each time we debate children's allowances I do not have to declare that I have one child to whom it still applies.  The purpose of the select committee is to offer guidance to any Member with a worry or doubt in this regard.  The Act covers specific interests, such as where the value of a Deputy's shares might increase following a specific action relating to a specific company.</P>
      <P>Deputy Nealon asked whether the Act is constitutional because it involves a change in our conditions of service.  It is a change which we have enacted for ourselves in conformity with Article 15.10 of the Constitution.  This House regulates its own affairs.  It enacted the legislation and is today giving effect to those provisions.  Deputy Connolly has consistently raised the problem of false or malicious allegations during elections. It is a fair point with which I have much sympathy.  We had a good and lengthy discussion of the issue on Committee Stage.  I was sympathetic to increasing the figure but the advice of the Attorney General's Office was that the maximum possible was £1,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Killeen asked whether the register should be published.  The Act provides for a public register.  It is important to distinguish myth from reality.  The public can see that most Members operate on overdrafts and do not own property.  It is important that people see that we are dealing with the <Col N="1591" /> public's business and do not have anything to hide.  Deputy Killeen also mentioned the timescale in the Act.  When all the provisions of the Act are implemented procedures follow as night follows day.  The committee will be established and draw up the guidelines. There is no reason preparatory work cannot be done in the House in advance of 1 January and I again offer assistance from my office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broughan raised an interesting, platonic point.  I hope that, at a time when priestly celibacy is being widely debated, there are no proposals to introduce political celibacy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill recognises that refugees are particularly vulnerable and like the 1994 Bill it proposes in the interests of justice to set out their rights in statute.  I welcome many of the provisions which represent an improvement on the position under the 1994 Bill, for <Col N="1592" /> example, the entitlement of an applicant to have his case heard, the clear commitment to the provision of an interpreter and the widening of the definition to include persecution because of gender, sexual orientation or membership of a trade union.  These provisions strengthen the Bill and give recognition to the fact that refugees sometimes suffer persecution to the extent that they need to leave a country. I compliment the parliamentary draftsman and the Office of the Attorney General for incorporating in the Bill many of the points made by us during the debate on the 1994 Bill.</P>
      <P>Last week I referred to the situation as it affects people from Cuba.  All Governments should be more forthcoming in seeking to have the US blockade on that country lifted.  Many Cuban people and people who have an interest in that country have told me that the US blockade which is now more than 30 years old and which contributes to the economic difficulties of Cuba is not justified on any political grounds.  The Bill gives the impression that economic refugees will not be entitled to have their case heard.  If this is the case it will be a very great mistake.  While we tend to view most of the refugees from Cuba as economic refugees it has been represented to me by some of them that there are other reasons people wish to leave that country.  I would not like to see a situation develop whereby such people would be automatically debarred from making a case for refugee status.</P>
      <P>It is extremely important to ensure that the people dealing with refugees have proper training.  When refugees arrive on our shores they are frightened and disorientated and they require much help.  They tend to be suspicious of officialdom and are afraid for their safety and that they might be returned to the jurisdictions from which they have come.  It is important, therefore, to provide proper training for people who deal with refugees and for those whose jobs will be substantially changed under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1593" /> Reference has been made to forged documents.  In some cases forged documentation is a prerequisite if a person is to have any chance of escaping from a country.  The possession of false documents should not be sufficient reason to prevent people from making an application for refugee status in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The position of people living in Ireland is different from that of people who arrive at ports or airports in that they are required to make their application directly to the Minister for Justice. This is a sensible provision and presumably all the provisions of the Bill will apply to them.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the position of applicants while they are awaiting the determination of their applications.  It states that they have the right to remain here during the processing of their application and that statutory bodies will provide for them during that period. I wish to pay tribute to health board and social welfare officials and others who have been extremely helpful to refugees and looked after their needs in a commendable manner.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and am glad that the Government has seen fit to introduce it at this stage.  I will deal on Committee Stage with some of the minor concerns.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been talking about the need for a refugee Bill for a long time.  Many people who are genuinely concerned about the welfare of others have made regular representations to us on the importance of the introduction of such a Bill in conformity with the Geneva Convention and Protocol.  I had <Col N="1594" /> informed them that a Bill was in the course of preparation and would be brought before the Dáil.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing it before us at this stage and compliment the former Minister who initially began work on it. The Minister said the Bill is a combination of ideas and amendments.  It is important for a Minister to consider proposed amendments and to take on board any criticisms or ideas.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International is happy with the Bill and welcomes the extension of the definition of a refugee but it also has some worries.  While I share some of these, they are minor when compared with the previous position.  During the debate on the 1994 Bill reference was made to people who are put into prison. The Minister of State, Deputy Carey, was very involved in a case involving a refugee who arrived at Shannon and was imprisoned.  It is outrageous that refugees should be put into prison given the generosity extended by other countries such as the United States, Australia and England to our emigrants. Many people had to emigrate from Ireland on economic grounds and we do not have any basis for refusing refugee status to people who leave their countries for similar reasons.  I would not like the Minister or the commissioner to be too harsh on those people who had to leave their own country because of unfair treatment and who wish to live here.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section which deals with the provision of an interpreter, where possible.  This matter was the subject of a long discussion during the course of the debate on the Refugee Bill, 1994.  It must be both frustrating and frightening to find oneself in a strange land unable to speak the language of the persons asking the questions. At least those who arrived at Ellis Island in the United States from Ireland, albeit in a poor state of health, had the advantage of being in an English-speaking country.  Many died shortly thereafter.  Therefore an interpreter should be provided, where possible &mdash; a person may speak a rare <Col N="1595" /> dialect &mdash; before a decision is made on an application.  Concern has been expressed about refugees who arrive with forged documentation.  It is more than likely that refugees fleeing their country of origin because of financial and other problems will need forged documentation to cross frontiers.  This issue has been highlighted by Amnesty International and others.  I ask the Minister to consider whether section 8 needs to be amended.</P>
    <P>I am delighted a commissioner is to be appointed to decide on applications. He will be independent in carrying out this function and report to the House on the activities of his office.  This should instil confidence in the process.  I understand that Refugee Trust has raised questions, but I am satisfied that the person appointed will be an expert in this area.  Those who are genuinely concerned about the plight of refugees can be assured that they will receive fair treatment.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill contains provisions under which a person may be granted refugee status on humanitarian grounds having been refused by the commissioner in the first instance.  There will always be cases in which the issues involved are not black and white where one is justified in bending the rules.  Circumstances can vary and there is a need to avoid injustice.  I also welcome the provision under which a person granted refugee status may be reunited with their family.  While there is a need to impose a limit, immediate family members should be welcomed.  There is a need for confidentiality in dealing with applications as life can be made difficult for the relatives left behind in the country of origin when it is discovered that the person concerned has disappeared. I am concerned about the section which deals with attempts to mislead the commissioner. It should be acknowledged that there is a temptation for refugees in seeking to gain entry to this country to over-state their case.  They will do everything they can to ensure they find a welcome here, including telling a <Col N="1596" /> white lie to justify their application. There is, therefore, a need for leniency, unless it is established that a refugee is trying to conceal a criminal background.</P>
    <P>I am glad that refugees will be able to avail of legal aid in making an application as they could not be expected to defend themselves in court, particularly if they do not speak English.  It is important that they are represented by a solicitor and the costs are borne by the State.  We are dealing with people with little or no financial resources, not millionaires.  This Bill replaces the Refugee Bill, 1994.  It is no reflection on the proposers of that Bill that many suggestions were made when it was introduced.  It is a bit like writing a speech, the first draft is always the toughest.  Having received the recommendations of Members of the Dáil and other interested parties it was easier for the Minister to bring in this Bill and have the difficulties ironed out.  There are, however, concerns, some of which I have outlined.  I am sure the Minister will do her best to resolve them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil welcomes the general thrust of the Refugee Bill, 1995.  It sets out in statutory form the status and rights of persons recognised in the State as refugees and the procedures to be followed in determining whether a person should be afforded recognition as a refugee.  As a modern 20th century nation, geared up for the next millennium, we must channel our resources and energies towards aiding persecuted people who wish to legitimately seek refuge in our country.</P>
      <P>This Bill was built upon the Refugee Bill, 1994, and the substantial work of my colleague, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn. It represents a major step in our State's provision for the protection of refugees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has been a party to the 1951 UN Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees since 1956 and the 1967 Protocol relating to the status of refugees since 1968.  However, only now, almost 40 years since we became a party to the Geneva Convention, are we <Col N="1597" /> making provision to provide a statutory basis for the implementation of Ireland's obligations under the 1951 convention and the 1967 Protocol as well as providing a statutory framework for the procedure to be followed in the determination of refugee status.  The decades have rolled on but at last the Refugee Bill, 1995, will place our undoubted obligations on a statutory footing.</P>
    <P>The Refugee Bill, 1995, will have a major bearing on the manner in which we, as a nation, deal with refugees in future.  Fianna Fáil broadly welcomes the thrust of the Bill but we will be proposing a number of amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The status of refugees is a crucial issue.  This country has a clear empathy with the plight of refugees.  Our nation's history is dotted with litanies of persecution, people living in fear and being driven from their own land.  It is now time that Ireland, bearing in mind our history at the hands of others, sets about formally recognising the status and rights of refugees.  While Ireland is a party to the convention and has allowed people to enter and reside in Ireland, we have done this without providing any legal basis for our actions.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that the whole world did not stop while we waited for this legislation.  It is important to recognise that we have welcomed many refugees to our shores over the years on a non-statutory basis and have worked in close co-operation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  I know from my time as Minister for Justice that on a regular basis, a number of times a week and sometimes daily, requests were dealt with through the UNHCR so what is being done in this Bill is giving effect to what has been happening in practice. The message should not go out that somehow or other the doors are now to be opened.  The welcome mat has been there for legitimate refugees and they have been dealt with, in a non-statutory manner admittedly, but in a compassionate manner as well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1598" /> Earlier this month, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs heard at first hand of the tragic experience of some of those at the coalface of the refugee issue.  Presentations were made by Rescue Trust, by a Vietnamese programme refugee who arrived in Ireland as a boat person in 1979 and by a prominent doctor who arrived in Ireland a number of years ago seeking asylum from the oppressive regime which existed then and, unfortunately, still exists in Iraq.</P>
    <P>Indeed, recently the evil Saddam Hussein showed his true face to the world by holding this so-called referendum <i>vis-à-vis</i> his presidency.  Of course, the international community was not surprised to learn he garnered almost 100 per cent of the vote in a clear demonstration of the continued existence of the oppressive Iraqi regime.</P>
    <P>As we were made so tragically aware of such appalling regimes throughout the world, together with those countries ravaged by war and other man made oppression, it is incumbent on Ireland to place the status and rights of refugees on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>Graphically outlined at the October joint committee meeting was the fact that, while debating status and rights, we must not ignore the extremely important issue of the provision of health care and rehabilitation facilities which must be made available to severely traumatised refugees.  Of course, the issue of the provision of legal aid to refugees must also not be ignored.</P>
    <P>Throughout the world and, regrettably, probably until the end of time we will have tyrants, oppressive and selfish rulers.  As a modern nation gearing up for the 21st century, Ireland must channel its resources and energies towards aiding and abetting those persecuted people who wish legitimately to seek refuge in our country.  Our ports, doors and hearts must be receptive.  We should not and must not betray our history by ignoring legitimate refuge to those who knock on our door.  Ireland must stand tall and must display a humane and fair nature.  Once and for <Col N="1599" /> all, it must bury its poor history of accommodating refugees.</P>
    <P>Ireland must move urgently on the refugee issue.  I therefore welcome, subject to some amendments, the passage of this extremely important Bill through the House.  Indeed, the Refugee Bill, 1995, may prove a lifesaver to many persecuted people and it is not often we can say that about a Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill as many Members of both Houses are interested in it.  Deputy Burke, as vice-chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, is well aware of the extent of interest in the subject among Members there.  Such interest is not confined to Members of that committee.  The Bill is the fruit of expressions of interest by many Deputies, particularly since the 1994 Bill was published.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which has been put forward as a replacement for the Refugee Bill, 1994.  I compliment the previous Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, and the previous Government for living up to their commitment to bring this Bill forward.  I also compliment the last Minister and Minister of State for listening closely to the views expressed by Members here.  It is an example of how legislation should be treated in these Houses in that where genuine concerns are put forward and genuine amendments are suggested, they are listened to by the Minister and Government.  This proves we have a better Bill as a result of all that effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Government gave priority to this Bill by giving special responsibility to the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Burton, for this issue.  Many Deputies will share my concern at the apparent, if not real, slowness of the Department of Justice in many areas.  The appointment of a Minister of State with specific responsibility for this issue has helped to have the amendments and points in relation to the 1994 Bill addressed <Col N="1600" /> quickly in the Department and to have the Refugee Bill, 1995, brought before the House that we might work on it without undue delay.  I compliment the Minister of State for her work in recent months in this area.</P>
    <P>I wish to address two main areas: first, the improvements which have been made in the 1995 Bill compared with the 1994 Bill; and, second, some of the criticisms and concerns which have been raised inside and outside this House in relation to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The aim of all concerned with the welfare of refugees is to ensure that our procedures for dealing with refugees are placed on a statutory footing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Burke referred to the practice that built up administratively over the years which was compassionate in many respects but defective in others.  It is necessary to remove any doubt that may exist and to assure refugees that the law affords them as much protection as possible.  We should aim to meet the highest international standards of fairness and justice when dealing with refugees and I am satisfied that the general thrust of the Bill will ensure that is so.</P>
    <P>Our record in this area has not been the best.  Other countries were more lenient with and tolerant of refugees but when the Bill is passed we will be on a par with the best practice in those countries.</P>
    <P>In many European countries there is an increasingly hostile attitude towards refugees, particularly economic migrants, since the fall of the Berlin Wall and the ending of the Cold War. Many countries have tightened up procedures where heretofore they had a more liberal refugee policy.  In Germany, France, Sweden and other countries there is increasing intolerance towards refugees.  I hope that will not happen here.  This Bill will ensure that the interests of Irish citizens, refugees and asylum seekers are well balanced and dealt with properly.</P>
    <P>The two aspects of the Bill I most welcome are that there will be an independent procedure for determining refugee applications and there will be an <Col N="1601" /> independent appeals system.  We must ensure they remain independent.  I do not doubt that the Department and the Minister will do their duty in that regard.  When the Bill is enacted I hope we will not forget about the issue but will avail of the opportunities afforded us to discuss, for example, the annual report of the refugee commissioner.</P>
    <P>I welcome clarification of the definition of &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; and compliment the Minister on extending it to include those who fear persecution for trade union membership or on grounds of gender or sexual orientation and for including the fear of sexual assault as a threat to freedom. Members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs heard testimony from refugees, some of which was horrific particularly as regards physical assault and sexual assault.  In Bosnia many women were the victims of rape or were threatened with sexual assault. It is important to recognise that the threat of sexual assault is a threat to freedom which may force someone to flee their country and become a refugee.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill provides that refugees automatically will have the legal rights that apply to all persons in this jurisdiction.  These are to be extended to family members who are allowed to join their refugee relation in Ireland.  Provision is made to allow a dependent relative &mdash; not just a spouse, parent or child &mdash; admission to the State.  This will help in the reunification of families.</P>
    <P>The Minister extended the provisions of the Bill beyond the exact requirements of the Geneva Convention and that is welcome.  Section 5 gives effect to Article 33 of the convention which states that a State such as ours shall not expel or return a refugee to the frontiers of territories where his or her life or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.  Section 5 goes beyond that provision and extends the protection to people other than refugees. Any person who falls into the category which is defined will not be returned to their own countries.  That <Col N="1602" /> allows us to treat in a humanitarian way those who arrive at a port or airport and may not have come within the definition of &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; but who are threatened or terrorised in their own country.  I am glad that the section of Article 33 which prohibits certain people from availing of the Geneva Convention protection is not being applied.</P>
    <P>The Bill continues in statutory form the existing provision for the Minister to allow a person who may not technically qualify as a refugee to remain here on humanitarian grounds.  Many people have been afforded protection under that provision and it is right that it should be put on a statutory basis. While we wish to be as open as possible to refugees we have a duty to ensure that our procedures are not abused or taken advantage of.  In this era of international terrorism, drug trafficking, genocide, money laundering and serious crime the Government must ensure powers exist to weed out and deal with bogus applicants who take advantage of the provisions for genuine refugees.  The powers set out in the Bill are necessary, fair and balanced and do not pose a threat to bona fide applicants.</P>
    <P>As regards the procedures for making, accepting and determining applications for refugee status I welcome the establishment of the commissioner who will be independent.  We know the important and impartial role played by the Ombudsman in vindicating the rights of citizens.  The refugee commissioner will have no less an important or independent role.  I trust succeeding Governments will ensure the necessary resources are provided through the commissioner and his or her office and avoid the unhappy experience we had a number of years ago with the Ombudsman's office.  It is up to us to oversee the Estimates and counter any Government proposal that does not make the necessary resources available to the commissioner.</P>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the refugee appeals board.  Those of us who deal with constituents' queries on social welfare, health, etc. appreciate the need <Col N="1603" /> for such a procedure.  I regret that aspersions have been cast on the independence of the board which will be established by law, act in accordance with the principles of natural justice and be chaired by an experienced lawyer. The board will strengthen significantly the rights of refugee applicants where the commissioner refuses an application.</P>
    <P>The right to appeal and to an oral hearing is guaranteed.  That is an improvement on the 1994 Bill.  The procedures for receiving and dealing with applications are comprehensive, generous and fair to the applicant.</P>
    <P>The role of the immigration officer has been changed under the Bill in that, henceforth, he will be obliged to inquire of a person he believes may be a refugee whether he or she wishes to apply for refugee status.  The immigration officer must inform that person not only of his or her right to apply for refugee status but also to consult a solicitor and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.  In effect the role of the immigration officer will be to inform any person of those rights and refer the application to the Refugee Applications Commissioner.</P>
    <P>Critics who say there is confusion over the interpretation of the term &ldquo;authorised officer&rdquo;, who fear that the &ldquo;immigration officer&rdquo; may end up being an &ldquo;authorised officer&rdquo; should read the definitions section when they will be reassured that an &ldquo;authorised officer&rdquo; will be a member of staff designated by the Refugee Applications Commissioner and that his role will be separate and distinct from that of the immigration officer.</P>
    <P>The Bill affords an applicant the automatic right to an interview with an officer of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, the right to present his or her case, which is a considerable improvement on the 1994 proposals.</P>
    <P>One matter of concern to many people has been the right of an applicant to the services of an interpreter, <Col N="1604" /> considerably strengthened in the provisions of this Bill, and goes as far as is humanly possible.  Not every point of entry to the State can guarantee that an interpreter will be available, at short notice, to assist a refugee applicant in dealing with an immigration officer. However, the Bill goes further than its 1994 predecessor in ensuring that, where humanly possible, intepretation is provided.  What greater provision can be made in practice than to vest in the authorities the highest possible obligation to provide an interpreter and allow for rare or exceptional cases, for example, when an applicant might refuse to co-operate with our authorities? That high standard of obligation to provide an interpreter applies also where an applicant is interviewed at a later stage in the procedure by an officer of the Refugee Applications Commissioner or at a hearing of the Refugee Appeal Board.  I am very happy that the right to an oral hearing and to interpretation, as far as possible, is being provided.</P>
    <P>The detention of refugee applicants has been a matter of concern over many years.  I am satisfied that the Bill will eliminate the disgraceful instances we witnessed in the past, of persons being put in jail while applications wended their way through the cavernous channels of the Department of Justice.  There is need for some provisions to detain people who may be under definite suspicion, for example, of being a drug trafficker or, as we witnessed recently, one of the bombers in Paris.  The provisions of this Bill still provide that such a detainee should be brought before a court as soon as possible and, in the case of his or her detention being confirmed by the court, must be brought back to have that decision reviewed every ten days.  Another necessary, humane provision is that a person under 17 years of age may not be detained.</P>
    <P>The provision of legal aid for refugees has also given rise to anxiety.  I note the Government has agreed that legal aid should be provided administratively and <Col N="1605" /> I understand that discussions are continuing with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and others on how this provision might be operated. The Minister of State said that she will announce its details during the passage of this Bill, which I hope she will do quite soon.</P>
    <P>It is also satisfying to note that programme refugees coming here, such as the Vietnamese, Bosnians and the additional 250 who will soon arrive from the former Yugoslavia, will have their rights protected and enhanced under this Bill.  While they may not come within the normal, international definition of &ldquo;refugee&rdquo;, they will be afforded the same protections.</P>
    <P>Another anxiety of those interested in this matter is in relation to the provision for fast-tracking manifestly unfounded applications.  A number of the provisions of this Bill should allay such concerns in that they endeavour to safeguard the rights of asylum seekers and ensure they are dealt with in accordance with the highest standards.  Of course, we also need to protect Irish citizens and their rights.  While we need a fast-track procedure to deal with obvious suspects, such as perpetrators of international crime&mdash;and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees agrees that this procedure should form part of our practice&mdash;the Bill provides that a person whose application has been found by the UNHCR to be manifestly unfounded must be given reasons therefor, afforded an opportunity to advance a case in their defence, and continue to have the opportunity to appeal to the Refugee Appeal Board, another wise safeguard.</P>
    <P>Another concern relates to the Dublin Convention which I understand was drawn up to deal with the position whereby many refugees who were what could be termed &ldquo;refugees in orbit&rdquo; were shunted from one European country to another.  It is my understanding that the convention aims to guarantee an asylum seeker that his application will be dealt with in one of the member <Col N="1606" /> states of the European Union in accordance with the United Nations Convention. That convention does not change the law on asylum but simply sets out the rules for determining which state should deal with an application.  While we accept responsibility for an application sent to us from another member state, if it is in accordance with the Dublin Convention, we are not obliged to transfer it.  The Bill provides that a person will not be transferred to another state under the terms of the convention unless that state has given a clear commitment to deal with such application in accordance with proper procedures.</P>
    <P>The right to work is the final concern I want to address.  Under the provisions of this Bill, an applicant for refugee status will not have the right to work but, of course, will be entitled to be maintained under our social welfare code and other provisions.  Some people have suggested that we should give asylum seekers a right to work while their applications are being processed.  It goes without saying that, when their application has been dealt with and approved, they will have the right to work.</P>
    <P>I am aware, from the Minister's opening remarks, that her Department is concerned about giving that right to work prior to an application being determined because it could be abused and it is easy to foresee how that might happen.  For example, a person who should normally apply for a visa or work permit might be encouraged to pretend he or she is a refugee to obtain the right to work here sooner.  It appears to be reasonable to provide that the State will maintain such an asylum seeker during his or her period of application and be allowed to work here when their application has been granted.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, the overall manner in which the Department of Justice deals with migrants, other than refugees, is in need of overhaul.  Any Member who has had dealings with that Department, for example, through the Aliens Office on behalf of people endeavouring to gain entry to this State to study or work, or <Col N="1607" /> even those endeavouring to take out Irish citizenship will know its antiquated, convoluted and secretive system for dealing with such applications; even the term &ldquo;aliens&rdquo; is offensive, sounding like something from the movie &ldquo;ET&rdquo; or &ldquo;Star Trek&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Now that the Bill has been introduced, I ask the Minister to apply herself and her Department to a total overhaul of the so-called aliens legislation and procedures.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a model of the type of legislation that should also cater for other classes of migrants to this country. Now that the Minister of State has been successful with this one, perhaps she can persuade her Department to examine that other category as a matter of priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I whole-heartedly welcome the provisions of this Bill which will give effect to the legislative measures we have been seeking for refugees for many years &mdash; and represent a good attempt to deal with the worldwide problem of refugees today.</P>
      <P>Living as I do in Limerick city, close to Shannon Airport, I have had much experience of refugees seeking asylum here, stretching back to the 1950s, when I was a young boy, when Hungarian refugees came here, having fled their country.  They were settled in an Army camp at Knocklisheen, near Limerick city, organised by our military forces. Indeed one could write a book about them, some were very resourceful, even to the extent that, after the heating had been turned off at midnight, they made their own form of poteen.  Those refugees did not arrive carrying prayer books or rosary beads.  Many of them were resourceful.  After a time many left Ireland but some married local people in County Limerick and went into business. One or two even played soccer for the local senior team.  It was a long chapter and a book could be written about our experiences in dealing with the Hungarians who were the first refugees to come to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1608" /> In later years Ireland accepted refugees from Chile following the overthrow of President Allende's democratic government.  I met them when they arrived at Shannon where they settled since the Shannon Development Company was good enough to provide housing for them.  I still meet some of these refugees today and help with their problems. This is also a long saga because, contrary to what Members might think, despite their being upholders of democracy, these refugees were not united when they came to Ireland.  They were divided into factions but, perhaps, were not as bad as is the Fianna Fáil Party at times.  They were not one large happy family.  They all had different opinions about Chilean politics and their country's future and I often experienced problems trying to reconcile those differences. That I do not speak Spanish proved a handicap in dealing with them. I helped with their problems in relation to medical cards, employment with Shannon Development regarding housing. Some of them found employment, learned to speak English and went on to live good lives in the midwestern region and have contributed to the life and economy of that part of the country.</P>
    <P>Ireland has accepted in the region of 600 refugees from Bosnia and other places.  I am often unhappy with the way these people are treated, but by and large, they are well housed and receive an allowance from the Government through the Midwestern Health Board. However, the majority are not provided with any formal education.  I would like to see legal refugees, who have been cleared to enter the country, being more fully integrated into the community. They should be able to attend courses in English and FÁS courses.  There are times when they can be seen aimlessly walking the streets in County Clare and I do not like that.  It is not good enough to simply have them live in Ireland as refugees.  We must endeavour to integrate them into society so that they can lead useful lives.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps a cliché to say so, but when in Rome do as the Romans do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1609" /> We should not place refugees in a ghetto, lock them away in their houses, give them a weekly allowance and say everything is rosy in the garden.  It is not.  That is not an adequate way in which to deal with refugees.  They must be treated as human beings and involved in society.  I would like the Bill to be strengthened to integrate refugees into our society.  They can learn the language and engage in educational and occupational courses.  There is scope for that to be included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>During my time dealing with refugees I discovered that they fall into two categories political refugees and financial refugees fleeing from their debts.  Not everyone who seeks asylum in Ireland is fleeing a tyrannical, authoritarian regime.  Some people run away from debts and others from their wives or from unhappy marriages.  People have been known to flee their country for many reasons.  It is not always the people who are downcast, depressed or persecuted who are at the forefront of those who flee.  People who are sharp-witted often see an opportunity to run away from their duties and responsibilities, be they familial or financial.</P>
    <P>We have a rather sentimental attitude to refugees because many people had to leave this country, at various times in the past, for largely financial &mdash; though sometimes political &mdash; reasons.  We have a soft spot for anyone who uses the word refugee but it covers a wide multitude of people.  Certain criteria needs to be laid down in the legislation to deal with grey areas.  I was strenuously lobbied by Amnesty International in recent months before the introduction of this Bill.  I informed them of our good intentions to introduce the best, fairest, most humanitarian and just legislation possible. At the same time we should not leave ourselves open to abuse and exploitation by some people.  Amnesty International has been happy with our approach but that organisation is still unhappy with three or four areas where it believes the Minister has not taken its representations fully into account.</P>
    <P>I am happy that this is a good, honest and intelligent attempt to deal with the problem of refugees.  It also brings <Col N="1610" /> Ireland into line with other humane countries that were perhaps, ahead of us in this area.  The 1951 Geneva Convention and the 1967 Protocol to that convention are fully covered by this legislation. The Bill contains a definition to the word &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; and lays down parameters on humanitarian grounds.  Not much more can be done because, regardless of what Bill is enacted by this House, unforeseen problems will always arise.  We can consider such areas as they arise.  This is a good, honest attempt to deal with a problem which plays on everyone's conscience.</P>
    <P>The Scandinavian countries have given a very good example in this area. Sweden has been very humane in dealing with refugees.  We could learn from that country's ability to contain such a mixture of people and maintain its economy and the cohesiveness of its society.</P>
    <P>We have difficulties in so far as we have high unemployment &mdash; I am pleased to note the figure for this is decreasing &mdash; and problems dealing with the travelling community.  Indeed, we might ask how relevant is the travelling community to the question of refugees? It has been difficult to integrate the travelling community into our society and to ensure that a dichotomy does not exist between the travelling and settled communities.  Other countries have more easily been able to deal with the influx of refugees than Ireland. Perhaps we can learn from their example.  The fact that there is such high unemployment in Ireland militates against giving employment to refugees. Perhaps we can tackle this problem through a process of greater integration, more vocational courses involving FÁS, etc., refugees should not be placed in ghettos.</P>

      <P>I wholeheartedly welcome the Bill.  I assure Amnesty International that we intend to do our utmost to bring Irish legislation into line with <Col N="1611" /> the very best international legislation in this regard.  I expect the Minister will deal compassionately on Committee and Report Stages with any areas which have not been fully covered.  Amnesty International might not be entirely satisfied since we cannot permit anyone to dictate to us what we should do.  I have given some examples of the areas highlighted by Amnesty International but I did not want to be too graphic or hurtful to any race.  We have an obligation to be fair to everyone.  Irish people in general will be satisfied that this is a good, civilised Bill which will stand comparison with any similar legislation in Europe or the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanBree" hpid="Mr. Bree Mr. Bree">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bree</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation.  It is significant that this debate coincides with the 50th anniversary of the United Nations which has worked well on behalf of refugees.  It is very important critical legislation.  As legislators, we must ensure that it is correct.  We must ensure that those who seek asylum in Ireland are treated in a scrupulously fair and impartial manner.  Many Deputies believe that the Bill introduced last year did not deal adequately with the interests of asylum applicants and I firmly believe the Government took the right decision when it went back to the drawing board rather than proceed with rushed and ill-conceived legislation.</P>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out, the purpose of the Bill is to give statutory effect to our obligations under the 1951 UN convention on the status of refugees. Whereas Ireland has been party to the UN convention since 1956 we have only implemented it on an administrative basis.  We have been criticised for the way in which we deal with asylum seekers and while this may not be the place to discuss the veracity of these claims, I hope this Bill will alleviate the problems that exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be noted that Ireland has never shied away from its international <Col N="1612" /> obligations to refugees and asylum seekers, which can be borne out by the figures furnished by the Minister on overseas assistance for refugees, the provision for programme refugees and for those seeking asylum.  It is worth nothing that the Government contributes substantially to the welfare of refugees overseas in the context of our overseas development aid programme.  This year the Government allocated £5 million for emergency humanitarian assistance and a further £3.5 million for rehabilitation programmes.  In addition, there is a grant this year of £1 million to the general budget of the UN High Commission for Refugees and a further £350,000 to the UN relief and works agency to support Palestinian refugees.</P>
    <P>Members may be aware that 1,000 programme refugees&mdash;550 Vietnamese and 450 Bosnians from the former Yugoslavia&mdash;have been admitted to Ireland under the terms of specific Government decisions and on 29 August the Government agreed to admit another 250 people from the former Yugoslavia together with their close relatives.  By the end of 1996 there will be approximately 1,200 programme refugees in Ireland.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a replacement for the 1994 Bill which had similar objectives but incorporates the significant number of amendments tabled to the 1994 Bill. This is a reflection of the Government's commitment to ensuring the success of such an important Bill.  Its main objective is to significantly strengthen the applicant's right to fair procedures in the determination process.  The Bill strengthens the safeguards and procedures and clarifies the entitlements of asylum seekers and refugees.  The Bill provides that all applications will now be examined by an independent refugee applications commissioner with a right of appeal to a five person appeal board. These provisions obviously represent an advance on the 1994 Bill which provided for a three person refugee applications board and a one member appeals tribunal. It also contains significant new safeguards in that an applicant will have <Col N="1613" /> a right to be interviewed with authorised officer of the commission and, in the case of an appeal, a right to an oral hearing before the refugee appeal board.</P>
    <P>The Bill extends the provisions for family reunification so that as well as those family members, other family members may be admitted to reside in this State where a dependency relationship exists between the refugee and the family.  Another provision that is imperative for a fair and open hearing of each case is the obligation to provide interpretation for refugee applicants. This obligation has been increased to such an extent that interpretation must be provided in all but the most exceptional circumstances.  The detention provisions provide for safeguards which permit detention of asylum seekers in exceptional cases.  In addition, a person under 17 years may not now be detained and the intervals at which continued detention must be reviewed by a court have been reduced from the 21 days permitted under the 1994 Bill to ten days in this Bill, a most welcome provision.</P>
    <P>The provisions relating to deportation have also been revised to ensure the highest standards of natural justice and, in addition, the Bill also includes consideration of compelling humanitarian cases which would otherwise fall outside the definition of a refugee.  The emphasis on natural justice and humanitarianism is very important and I am particularly pleased that this is included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The extension of the definition of refugee is welcome and under this Bill a refugee will be taken to include persons persecuted because of their gender, sexual orientation or membership of a trade union.  All Members can be proud of this Bill as I believe it is one of the best planned and most extensive Bills to come before the House for a long time.</P>
    <P>It is significant that this debate coincides with the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the United Nations. More significant, however, is the fact <Col N="1614" /> that it coincides with the 150th anniversary of the Great Famine which sparked off the Irish diaspora.  This has remained a perpetual characteristic of our history for the past 150 years and, therefore, we, more than most other countries, have an obligation to support refugees and asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>I am sure this Bill will meet the international obligations and will serve as an example to many more countries throughout the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill in principle.  This issue has given rise to a great deal of controversy in recent years, and many Members have highlighted what was seen to be the unfair treatment of people who arrived in Ireland, having been forced to leave their country.  They were unable to avail of a system that would lead to recognition of their refugee status.  Most of those individuals were unfairly locked up in our prisons, and it is wrong that prison places should be used for such a purpose when there are other more pressing demands on them.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that after such a long time &mdash; this relates to a convention signed by Ireland in 1951 &mdash; we are putting provisions for refugees on a statutory footing.  The disturbances in Yugoslavia and other places have seen huge numbers of people having to flee from country to country.  Not long ago I tabled a number of questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and was quite surprised to hear that such large numbers of people who are discommoded in this way become refugees and how little power there is within the EU system to address the problems of refugees in a crisis.</P>
      <P>People who are displaced from their country of origin are in a traumatic situation. It is only fair then that a country such as Ireland, which signed the 1951 convention, should introduce a Bill to give refugees statutory footing and ensure the highest standards of fairness in dealing with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was particularly perturbed when I first heard of the aliens department in <Col N="1615" /> the Department of Justice.  Although I appreciate that it is a pragmatic way of describing the department and the people it deals with, it is most insensitive to the people who have to deal with such a department through no fault or desire of their own.  I would like to pay tribute to my party colleague, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, who gave a firm commitment shortly after her appointment as Minister for Justice to give the aliens department a more appropriate title and make it more user friendly.</P>
    <P>I have had occasion in the past to communicate with the UN regarding people who needed the assistance of a public representative.  Dealing with the Department of Justice at that time I was distraught and dismayed by the lack of services for the refugees in question.  A near neighbour of mine who was involved in the Irish Refugee Council forcefully brought to my attention the inadequacy of the facilities available in Ireland to address the needs of refugees. Since I have gained a little interest in this area, I have seen firsthand as a member of the Eastern Health Board the board's involvement with a number of other relevant departments, in helping quite a number of refugees over the last two or three years.  Facilities and services were put in place to ensure that these traumatised people were integrated into society in the most appropriate fashion.  I congratulate those involved in the projects under the umbrella of the Eastern Health Board. I was very impressed by the relatively short period involved in ensuring full integration of the refugees into Irish society.  I would have expected, because of language barriers etc. that support services would have been required over a prolonged period of time &mdash; months or years.  It was quite the opposite.  With the necessary supports and services in place these people were fully integrated into society and quite enjoying Irish life in a very short time.  I congratulate all involved.  Their work shows that when we undertake a project like this, identify <Col N="1616" /> the costs and put in place all the necessary supports, the integration of refugees can be very successful.</P>
    <P>Most aspects of the Bill have been covered by various speakers.  Perhaps the Minister could, in the House or by way of letter to me, clarify what structures it will be necessary to put in place when this Bill is passed, the timescale relating to the necessary new structures, the costings that have been calculated for the provision of them and the allocations that have been earmarked to ensure that the structures can be put in place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. D. McDowell Mr. D. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute on this Bill.  I congratulate the Minister and her predecessor on the considerable amount of work that has been done in preparing this legislation over several years.  The Private Members' debate on the Refugee Bill introduced by Deputy Alan Shatter was one of the first debates in which I spoke when I was elected to this House in 1992.  I was pleased at that stage to be able to welcome the principle of Deputy Shatter's Bill.  I am glad that after three years of gestation we finally have a Government Bill before this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with my constituency colleague regarding immigration.  It is rarely that we get the opportunity to speak consecutively in this House and to be in agreement.  Many Members of this House have had experiences similar to his in dealing with the aliens office at the Department of Justice.  The manner in which that office deals with certain issues, including the secrecy in which it operates what is, effectively, British immigration law is a cause of concern. It is an accident of history that we have a free travel zone with the United Kingdom.  However, as a result we enforce UK immigration regulations that are not appropriate for a sovereign State such as this.  I was recently contacted by a Jordanian, a skilled employee in the Dublin branch of an American multi-national company, who told me his mother, who is in her <Col N="1617" /> seventies, was refused a visitors visa and was not given a reason.  That caused considerable distress to her and her family.  Her son has been working legally here in a very skilled job for some years.  Also, many medical students have been refused, on tenuous grounds, an extension on their stay here.  It is unacceptable that the criteria used for such refusals are not made known.  We should subscribe to the Schengen Convention to which the majority of EU members have subscribed.  While I understand the difficulty in respect of the common travel zone between here and the United Kingdom, the current position is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as it will improve matters for refugees.  I congratulate the Minister on her announcement to provide free legal aid for refugees, and I hope that is not seen as a vested interest in the matter.  It could be provided through private practitioners or the legal aid system &mdash; the most sensible way of providing it &mdash; or by commissioning a council or agency to do so. Most refugees cannot afford legal aid. Also, as many of them come from Cuba or Eastern Europe they do not speak English.  Therefore, I welcome the provision that places a greater onus on the State to provide interpreting facilities.  I accept that may be impossible in all cases and there will also be those who refuse to co-operate with the State.</P>
    <P>The practice of detaining willy-nilly refugees in Mountjoy or elsewhere is disturbing.  Therefore, I welcome the provision that delimits the circumstances in which people can be detained in custody while their applications are being considered.  This emphasises the importance of avoiding delay in dealing with applications.  The majority of refugees who come here are in poor circumstances, mentally and otherwise.  Therefore, it is important that delay in dealing with applications is of a minimum.</P>
    <P>The Bill will give statutory effect to current administrative procedures.  One of the main reasons for its introduction is to close the gap that exists between practice and theory in regard to this <Col N="1618" /> matter.  While the theory set down by the Department is acceptable, there is a great deal of anecdotal evidence to show that in many cases it is not put into practice.  Even with statutory provisions in place, we must examine the way State agencies and the general public deal with asylum applicants.  The Department of Social Welfare, in particular, is not consistent in the way it deals with such people.  Most applicants rely on supplementary welfare and while the provisions that apply to citizens in respect of such benefit are not clear cut, they are much less clear cut in respect of asylum applicants.  Their entitlement to local authority housing must also be examined.  Many of the refugees who arrive at Shannon are housed in bed and breakfast accommodation in County Clare and others are housed in a home operated by the Red Cross in Dublin. Additional facilities are required to cater for the number of applicants for refugee status, which has increased significantly in recent years.  In particular, when dealing with programme refugees it is necessary to provide enhanced back-up services.  We can scarcely call ourselves a multilingual society, and to enable refugees cope with living here, the State should teach them basic English.</P>
    <P>Our attitude to refugees differs somewhat from the rest of Western Europe in that most people here welcome refugees. However, it is regrettable that is not true in all cases.  Many refugees, even when they have acquired refugee status, report difficulties in securing housing and this can only be deemed as an undercurrent of racism.  Therefore, as soon as possible the State should subscribe to the United Nations Convention on Racial Discrimination.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision that will permit the Minister, in compelling humanitarian circumstances, to allow a person who does not fall within the Bill's definition of a refugee to remain here.  I also welcome the extension of the definition of &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; to include those persecuted on grounds of gender, sexual orientation or trade union activity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1619" /> Amnesty International expressed concern at the fact that the Minister will be allowed implement, by regulation, the Dublin Convention.  While we must be sensitive in this regard, it is part of our obligation as EU members.  The Bill will allow the Minister not to apply the convention in circumstances in which the transfer to another country of an asylum seeker would not be in the interest of the individual concerned.  I hope that measure is used in a sensible fashion.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and commend the Minister, and her predecessor, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, on their work in this regard.  I hope it ensures that our treatment of refugees will be of the highest international standards.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to be assured that the Government has finally approved the arts plan.  Will the Minister agree that the arts plan has been underfunded to the tune of £3 million in the first year of the plan?  It was promised that £19.6 million would be paid to the Arts Council to implement the plan, but to date only £16.5 million has been paid out.  Does the Government propose to compensate for that shortfall in its funding in 1996?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>When I assumed responsibility for the Arts Council its funding was £10.25 million.  As the Deputy stated, its funding was £16.25 <Col N="1624" /> million last year.  That increase was well deserved and is short of the figure I envisaged for the Arts Council, one component of the plan.  The Deputy is correct that the figures envisaged for the first year of the three year plan included a figure of £19.5 million.  It is a matter for discussion between the Minister for Finance and me as to how the plan can be delivered.  I welcome the support for the plan from all sides of the House, but Deputy Quill will appreciate that I must reconcile my personal wishes for the most speedy implementation of the plan with an economic logic that would be driven even harder by her party.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that the timescale for the implementation of this plan is of the essence and if it is not financed as promised its provisions will not be put in place?  If the gap between moneys promised and moneys granted widens in the second and third year compared to what happened in the first year, then assuredly the arts plan will fail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I like to give the House the maximum information.  I still hope that I will be able to stay within the time period of the plan.  It is stated that a figure of £26 million funding will be reached at the end of the period of the plan.  Having regard to that, we must decide how to structure the plan in terms of time.  The happy consequence of a Government decision taken this week is that it is approved as the framework for arts development for the next period.  We need to consider the specification of the timeframe for the plan which is structured around seven modules. The Deputy is correct in saying that if the plan could not be funded at the level originally envisaged in the three year period an extension of the timeframe for the implementation of those seven modules would be required. However, I am having meetings with my colleague the Minister for Finance, one of which I will be attending when I finish Question Time, and I am sure I bring <Col N="1625" /> the good wishes of many Members of the House with me.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht</askee>
      <Quest>the conservation status of the Broadmeadow Estuary between Swords and Malahide, County Dublin, in both Irish and European law; if any further designation is pending subject to transpositions of Council Directives; and the protection, if any, which is or will thereby be afforded to this high amenity area.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15757/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In March 1994 regulations entitled, European Communities (Conservation of Wild Birds) (Amendment) Regulations, 1994 &mdash; S. I. No. 59 of 1994, were made designating the Broadmeadow Estuary and other areas as special protection areas under Article 4 of Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds, popularly known as the Birds Directive.  The Birds Directive was transposed into national law through regulations, made under the 1972 European Communities Act, which were entitled, European Communities (Conservation of Wild Birds) Regulations, 1985 &mdash; S. I. No. 291 of 1985.  In accordance with this Directive, member states are obliged to protect all wild birds and their habitats.  Under Article 4 member states are bound to take measures to conserve the habitat of two categories of wild birds i.e. certain listed <Col N="1629" /> rare or vulnerable species and regularly occurring migratory species.  Particular attention must be paid to the protection of wetlands and particularly to wetlands of international importance.</P>
      <P>This country must therefore undertake appropriate steps to avoid pollution or deterioration of habitats or excessive disturbance affecting wild birds, in so far as these are significant. This implies that any new projects or activities situated in or likely to affect special protection areas should not be undertaken without prior consultation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service in order to ensure that no significant damage to the conservation value of such sites takes place.  Broadmeadow Estuary has also been proposed for designation as a natural heritage area.  The proposed natural heritage areas have no statutory basis as yet and designation will not occur until after the Wildlife Act, 1976, has been amended.  I expect to bring amending legislation before the Oireachtas next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A regulation is being prepared which will transpose into national law Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, known as the Habitats Directive and I expect to sign it in the near future.  Apart from giving effect to the Habitats Directive, the proposed regulation will strengthen the protection for all existing and future special protection areas.  Under the Habitats Directive this country must submit to the European Commission a list of candidate sites meriting designation as special areas of conservation.  All proposed natural heritage areas are being examined to determine whether or not they warrant inclusion on this list.  Before submission of the list to the Commission I will undertake public consultation by arranging to have the list published and inviting the public to submit their comments on the proposals.  As a result of this consultation process, sites may be added to or removed from the list which is eventually submitted to the Commission. The final decision as to <Col N="1630" /> whether the Broadmeadow Estuary should be designated a special area of conservation will depend on the outcome of the overall process I have described.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  Will the Minister consider if the future plans may require that either himself or a representative of his Department make a verbal statement at the public inquiry on the Broadmeadow Estuary which is in progress at the prospect of building a 50 ft. wide bridge and a 30 ft. high embankment across part of this ecologically sensitive area?  Is the Minister aware that Fingal County Council has shamefully deleted a recommendation by an independent engineer and wildlife consultant that the bridge ought not to be built at the proposed location?</P>

      <P>Officers of the National Parks and Wildlife Service have been in touch with Fingal County Council on all of the issues.  The Deputy will know from my reply that I am committed to a process of consultation.  I was anxious to ensure consultation because people have views to submit.  I certainly will facilitate that process.  I will examine the suggestion he also made to see whether it is useful. We will continue our contacts and take such action as is appropriate and supportive of the consultation process I have described.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that three arms of the State are involved: Fingal County Council, the National Roads, Authority &mdash; who have decided one course of action &mdash; and the National Parks and Wildlife Service who are trying to get them to change their mind or contradict their intent? This is a bureaucratic muddle, as outlined by Deputy Sargent.  The public hearing on the intention to construct a a national primary road network or bridging through the area has caused a great deal of confusion.  This matter should have been clarified so that the public débâcle involving Fingal County Council, the funding agency of the National Roads Authority and the National Parks and Wildlife Service could have been avoided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Lawlor for enabling me to clarify matters.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service is now directly responsible to me.  We have certain obligations which are outlined in my substantive reply.  I have listed the directive, the European requirements, the regulation and the other measures I intend to take to meet my public responsibilities as Minister.  I also intend to review the legislative base in regard to the national heritage areas when I amend the Wildlife Act, 1976, early in 1996.  To answer Deputy Lawlor's question directly, it is always best to have co-operation, prior consultation and agreement, but as the Minister with responsibility for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, I have clear responsibilities which I will exercise.  I welcome co-operation from those planning developments such as the local authority and the National Roads Authority.  As to whether it is desirable to avoid a public hearing, that is a matter for the citizens but we will be reasonable and available for consultation. We will take whatever action is in the public interest.  That is the instruction I have given to the National Parks and Wildlife Service.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Minister is amenable to consultation and I look forward to having further discussions on this matter at the public inquiry.  Will the Minister state if amenity value is an aspect that will come under the protection of the habitats directive and, if not, will he comment on whether this proposal might be in breach of that directive? Is it the Minister's intention to sign it into Irish law in time to avoid a project going ahead that might, in retrospect, be in breach of the directive we are anticipating?</P>

I am not disposed to anticipate the setting of legal tensions, for example, on the legislative base of a directive and any action which might contradict it.  Until we reach that point it is best to continue the current process and try to reach a proper resolution. I will keep this matter under review and there will be no loss, in a public sense, because of any culpable delay.</P>

In view of the great success of this project, on which I congratulate the Minister, does he not think this is a retrograde step which will row back all the progress made as a result of his enlightened decision to make a grant to Tory Island, Sligo, Clare and other areas?  Is there not a danger that this project will disappear because of a short-sighted measure in trying to save £100,000?</P>

      <P>I appreciate that you are being liberal, a Cheann Comhairle, in allowing this supplementary but I am anxious to answer the Deputy's question. I assure Deputy Nealon that my Department assisted the corncrake project in three locations.  The project, which was evaluated, is a good one.  The issue then arose as to whether we could have a more elaborate scheme within the REPS which would be more generally available to agricultural practice.  I have not ended the scheme, nor have I withdrawn funding from it.  I have publicly stated that in the interim between the end of this scheme and it being dealt with within the REPS I will keep the issue of funding under review.  I appreciate the wide public support for the conservation of the corncrake.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>While the prospect of the corncrake riding on the backs of the swans in the broad meadow is interesting, I want to return to the question I asked on the habitats directive. Did the Minister not promise that this directive would be transposed into Irish law as far back as last spring &mdash; other dates were mentioned subsequently?  In not yet transposing it, will the Minister agree we are putting back the date for amending the Wildlife Act which I understood was to take place after transposition of the habitats directive? Is it not time to treat this matter with a certain degree of urgency so that the projects to which I refer in the question do not slip through by default?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of projects slipping through by default. <Col N="1634" /> I will be direct in saying I experienced some difficulties of a technical kind in relation to the preparation of the Wildlife Act.  The Wildlife Act, 1976, is in urgent need of amendment and work on it is well advanced.  There was a period in which certain policy advice was available to my Department but I was not in full control of the Executive execution of some detail required for the legislation. That case no longer arises.  I am responsible and the Act will be amended in 1996.  There will be no untoward delay because it is important Legislation.  The Deputy should seriously reflect on the complicated legal situation that arises.  I am anxious to have the Bill amended in 1996 to have the best statutory basis for the different orders and directions that will be made.  They will gain from that but I have not stopped the preparatory work until the Act is in place because it was not necessary to do so.  When we have good law and good directives we have the best protection.</P>

I gcás Thurasóireacht Chonamara agus Árann, cé go n-aithním go mbíonn seirbhís thábhachtach á cur ar fáil ag an eagraíocht ar mhaithe lena ceantar feidhme, ní bhíonn a cuid gníomhaíochtaí dírithe ar fhorbairt phobail ar bhonn leathan agus sna cúinsí ní thig liom <Col N="1636" /> deontas reachtála a cheadú sa chás faoi Scéim na gComarchumann.</P>
    <P>Is ar fhorbairt thionscal na turasóireachta in a cheantar feidhme a bhíonn Turasóireacht Chonamara agus Árann ag díriú agus is é Údarás na Gaeltachta, seachas mo Roinnse, a bhíonn ag cuidiú ar scála teoranta le cur chun cinn an tionscail sin sa Gaeltacht.  Tá mo Roinnse i mbun comhráite leis an Údarás maidir le ról na heagraíochta sin i dtaca le cúrsaí turasóireachta sa Ghaeltacht a chinntiú agus cuirfear cás na n-eagras turasóireachta Gaeltachta agus cúnamh dóibh san áireamh sna comhráite sin.</P>

      <P>The Heritage Council, which I appointed on 10 July 1995 under the Heritage Act, 1995, is an autonomous body whose general functions are to propose policies and priorities for the identification, protection, preservation and enhancement of the <Col N="1641" /> physical heritage.  The council has powers to provide assistance, including financial assistance, and advice to persons and bodies in matters relating to its functions.  The council is funded by way of a grant-in-aid from my Department's Vote.  This grant-in-aid is funded from national lottery moneys.  In the current year the grant-in-aid to the council is £1,550,000.  This includes £500,000 for the discovery programme, which is an archaeological research programme.  A detailed list of any grants made by the statutory Heritage Council in 1995 will be published in its annual report for that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The predecessor of the Heritage <Col N="1642" /> Council was the non-statutory National Heritage Council.  Details of projects which benefited from national lottery funding from the National Heritage Council in the years 1993-94 are contained in the Appropriation Accounts for those years.  Prior to 1993 moneys for projects in the heritage area were disbursed through the Vote of the Department of the Taoiseach.  Details of heritage projects for which national lottery funding was sanctioned and-or paid by the National Heritage Council in the period 1 January 1995 to 9 July 1995, following approval by me, are listed in the following table.</P>

      <Quest>the implications, if any, for landowners and persons living in the 600 square miles of County Kerry designated as national heritage areas in so far as grant aid, planning permissions for various developments, agricultural subsidies and other related matters are concerned.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15612/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No natural heritage areas, NHAs, have been designated to date.  Designation will not occur until amending legislation to the Wildlife Act, 1976, has been enacted.  I expect to introduce such legislation to the House in 1996.</P>
      <P>The areas likely to receive NHA designation have been advertised as proposals and interested parties are made aware of the land in question and may, if they so wish, informally object through the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, either to have land included or excluded from a proposed NHA.</P>
      <P>Applications for grant aid in a proposed NHA are normally referred to the NPWS to check whether the proposals are likely to damage the conservation interest of that area.  If the proposal is likely to cause damage, then the NPWS will so advise the grant-aiding authority.  If that authority agrees grant aid will be refused.  If the proposal is not likely to cause significant damage, then the NPWS will make no objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Deputy that it is a standard condition of grant aid that the project being assisted will not damage the environment and this condition applies in all areas of the State not just <Col N="1645" /> areas which are proposed for designation as NHAS.</P>
    <P>In relation to planning applications, the position is similar.  Planning authorities are asked to notify the NPWS of applications likely to have an effect on NHAs.  The NPWS will offer its views and if it feels the proposals will damage the environment it will object formally. The decision in all cases remains with the planning authority and An Bord Pleanála.  Proposed NHA designation has no effect on agricultural subsidies other than in the case of the rural environment protection scheme where farmers will receive a higher rate of grant in proposed NHAs.  This scheme is voluntary and involves farmers agreeing to farm in an environmentally friendly manner.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that the present boundaries are proposals and are open to review on scientific grounds.  I urge landowners who have concerns to contact their local NPWS officials.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the chaos in County Kerry where one third of the land mass will be theoretically affected by this designation?  Kerry Council Council, which has statutory responsibility for this matter, should have adopted the county development plan in 1994.  However, due to the current ambiguity it has had to seek an extension until the middle of 1996.  The general consensus among officials of the council is that the development plan will have to be adopted in spite of the vagueness of the general advertisement in the newspapers and their inability to explain the implications of the Minister's intentions.  The signposting, so to speak, of the Minister's intentions is having a negative effect on the ability of this statutory local authority to proceed with its business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither I nor my Department wish to delay Kerry County Council in carrying out its statutory functions.  While I accept that there has been some confusion the issue is straightforward in one respect.  One <Col N="1646" /> could have gone ahead with a series of designations which may have raised questions about their statutory base. That is why there must be an amendment to the Wildlife Bill, 1976.  In the meantime I have put in place a consultation process.  Ultimately it is for the people of Kerry and their representatives to decide on what is a good plan. It is also equally important to them to take into account the expertise available by way of opinion through the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  This important service should be open to listening to those who are worried about inclusion or exclusion.  The timescale we have set is the best way of proceeding; it is the clearest legal basis for ensuring a designation process which has adequate public consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>The staff of the planning authority must advise concerned interests who are supposed to carry out a quasi-judicial function and make written submissions.  People do not understand how proposed legislation can override a statutory function.  The Minister should attempt to resolve this difficulty by informing the planning authority concerned which is trying to fulfil its statutory function &mdash; not all planning authorities are caught in this dilemma &mdash; what it is intended to do.  Currently, staff within the planning department are not in the position to answer queries from concerned land owners and others within the county who wish to make submissions and suggestions and lodge objections as they are not aware of the contents of the Bill and its implications for the county development plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill, which will be presented to the Oireachtas in 1996, will provide the legislative base.  If it were decided not to await the presentation of that Bill we would find ourselves in a position where advertisements would be placed without sufficient consultation and appeals would be lodged.  There could be a collision between the NPWS in seeking to <Col N="1647" /> meet its responsibilities in one direction and individuals proceeding by way of the planning process with the local authorities. It would be more logical to clearly lay down the statutory basis for the process.  Admittedly, this means we will have to wait until 1996.  In the meantime the suggested NHAs have been put forward as a basis for discussion. The NPWS is available for consultation. On judgment, it would be much more fragile to proceed without first enacting the Bill.  That is how I came to my decision.</P>

      <P>There is considerable concern within the county about this proposal.  Will the Minister give an assurance that the tracts of land designated will not be turned into playgrounds? There is considerable concern that this proposal is a Germanic solution to an environmental problem which does not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing will be done in this area by way of ministerial diktat. A set of proposals has been put forward and the officials of my Department remain open to hear views on them. Equally, my Department has no intention of interfering in any way with the statutory obligations of the local authority. I intend, however, to monitor the process.  It should be as inclusive as possible and take into account the opinion the Deputy has just expressed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that it is most unsatisfactory that another Government Department is using the proposed designations of NHAs as a pretext in order to extract undertakings from farmers that they will not lodge an appeal for five years not-withstanding the fact that the necessary legislation has not been introduced? This is extraordinary.  Will he take the matter up with the appropriate Minister and ask him to desist?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the first instance, it is a matter for the elected heads and <Col N="1648" /> those in managerial positions within the local authorities to whom I presume the Deputy is referring&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is seeking written guarantees from farmers under the REPS that they will not lodge an appeal against the designation of their land as a national heritage area for a period of five years in order to secure the maximum grant payable not-withstanding the fact that the necessary legislation has not been introduced. Does the Minister agree that this is absurd?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that we could proceed with the process of designation without the ultimate protection of a change in the law.  This will happen in 1996.  I take the Deputy's point, but I wish to finish mine as it is of interest.  The two Departments from which I usually receive communications are the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Environment. In the case of the Department of the Environment, any potential environmental damage must be taken into account in making decisions, not just planning decisions.  The NHA scheme should be used as a policy guide, no more and no less.  On the question of how people might use it as an administrative instrument &mdash; this is a matter of concern to the other Minister mentioned &mdash; I will convey the views expressed by the Deputy to my colleague.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>In an age in which Government is reliant on PR, a poor job is being done on the matter of NHAs. Listening to this debate, it appears that they are being perceived as a threat.  If the purpose and meaning were properly conveyed, they ought not to be seen in <Col N="1649" /> that way.  In the light of what has been said, does the Minister have any proposals to open up better lines of communication with the bodies whose concerns have been conveyed to him across the floor?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the spirit in which the Deputy made her observations, communication could have been better in the past.  I have been trying to put a clear consultation process and firm legislation in place.  I agree that there should be better communication.  The Deputy will be delighted to learn that I do not have any public relations consultant working for me.  There is an oifig eolas in the Department.  We should make the case of NHAs.  They will work if we can secure consensus on their acceptability.  We should use the intervening period to achieve this objective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>Before he departed for his constituency last evening Deputy O'Leary spoke to me about this matter, as did Deputy O'Donoghue.  The position is that a blanket advertisement will be placed in the newspapers seeking submissions, representations and views on the proposed designation of national heritage areas.  Will the Minister ensure that a formal submission is made to Kerry County Council which is seeking to adopt a countrywide plan?  There are 600 square miles affected without a statutory or legal basis known for what that third of the land mass of the county will be as they embark on adopting a statutory five year plan in advance of the implications of the Minister's legislation. A formal comprehensive submission should now go to Kerry County Council outlining the intent so that it could be embodied in the written statement so that the residents of the county and the planning officials know their exact responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the Wildlife Act, 1976, which will be amended by the Wildlife Bill, 1996, deals with a whole wide range of matters.  The question of <Col N="1650" /> giving legal support for European Directives and national regulation is one part of it so as one prepares for bringing regulation and, through regulations, directives into effect, that work can be ongoing.  I have no difficulty in asking the officials of the National Parks and Wildlife Service to have discussions with officials from Kerry County Council to deal with particular issues which have arisen there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be most helpful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind Members opposite that when these regulations were introduced some years ago the only grounds for objection which a landowner could make to the placing of an NHA on lands on which he might have an ownership interest was on the basis of scientific grounds.  Obviously, there are major areas of economic concern in this case.  Will the Minister clarify whether entering objections on the basis of economic grounds would be entertained rather than on purely scientific grounds?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason we are having a period of time which some people might say is confusing is that at least we are having discussion and consultation. Frankly, I was unhappy with the previous arrangements which were by way of advertisement.  I had many complaints about the inadequacy of consultation in the past.  We have this time now and we should use it as practically as we can.</P>
      <P>I agree a number of things will have to be borne in mind, not simply scientific matters but it would not be appropriate, at this stage, for me to start indicating the criteria.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree we are in an extraordinary situation? On the policy guide, he has published maps and indicated the designation of areas.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is looking for guarantees that people will not <Col N="1651" /> appeal against policy guides in specific areas.  Will the Minister agree that the whole situation is a mess?  None of us in this House knows what an NHA is because there is no law which defines an NHA.  In fact, what is happening in this whole area has no legal basis.  What the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is doing, in looking for guarantees under the REPS scheme against appealing against the policy guide, is null and void.  It is nonsense, like the whole scheme at the moment because it is not on a statutory basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The confusion which might be there now comes out of a deep well.  Those who were given responsibility in the past for all of this area should, perhaps, have brought it out a little better.  All I am trying to do, now that I am responsible not just for policy but also for its execution in this area, is to put open procedures in place.  I think any Government will welcome that.</P>

I take the Deputy's point that it would be wrong if, at the end of this discussion, there was any conflict between local authorities and the NPWS or, indeed, the public.  I agree that in the end what emerges must be something which is more clear than it is now but it must enjoy public support and acceptability and I will facilitate such discussions as might help.</P>

Déantar socruithe ar leith i gcás Chontae na Mí agus Contae Phort Láirge &mdash; contaetha ina bhfuil ceantair bheaga Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Is ar bhóithre áise go príomha a chaitear soláthar mo Roinne le haghaidh bóithre.  Chun a bheith cáilithe le haghaidh cúnaimh, ní mór do bhóthar áise a bheith ag freastal de ghnáth ar dhá theach cónaithe ar a laghad nó ar dheich líon tí i gcás bóthair phortaigh nó i gcás bóthair chuig gabháltas talún. Bíonn ar iarratasóirí foirm iarratais a chomhlánú agus scrúdaíonn foireann áitiúil mo Roinne na hiarratais féachaint an bhfuil siad cáilithe le haghaidh cúnaimh.  Os rud é gur suim theoranta airgid a bhíonn ar fáil in aghaidh na bliana le caitheamh ar bhóithre, ní féidir cúnamh a cheadú i leith gach bóthair cháilithe.  Bíonn roghanna le déanamh mar sin idir iarratais cháilithe.</P>
    <P>Seo a leanas na critéir a thógtar san áireamh agus bóithre cáilithe á roghnú: tábhacht an bhóthair don cheantar; staid na Gaeilge; riachtanas na hoibre; agus costas na hoibre.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry the basis on which a financial settlement appears to have been arrived at in respect of farmers in the Askeaton area of County Limerick; the reason a settlement was considered by Government in advance of the publication of the report of the Environmental Protection Agency and if the Minister will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take both questions together and am delighted to have this opportunity to <Col N="1656" /> correct what I consider to be a most outrageous, unfair and erroneous report in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> today.  It is a total misrepresentation of the good work I, my Department and the Government have been doing in trying to resolve a very difficult problem.</P>
      <P>The background is that the Environmental Protection Agency was asked to carry out a detailed study of the animal health and other related problems in the Askeaton area of County Limerick.  It published an information booklet in June 1995 in which it states specifically that my Department is committed to undertaking a comprehensive animal health study on two farms in the Askeaton area.  Negotiations to settle the terms to secure the participation of the two farmers involved were protracted but have now been completed.  One of the farms is being leased while the other is being purchased directly by my Department with a view to relocating the family farm.</P>
      <P>These were the only arrangements that would ensure the animal health study could proceed.  Without that study the integrity and effectiveness of the overall investigation would be seriously undermined.  The intention is that these farms will be used for the conduct of an animal health study as part of the comprehensive investigations into animal deaths and illness being co-ordinated by the Environmental Protection Agency. Contrary to some recent reports the arrangements which enabled the studies to proceed on these two farms were indispensable.</P>
      <P>There is an amount of expert opinion from toxicologists and others which states that if we did not involve the farms in the study it would be virtually worthless because it would not deal with the greatest focus of criticism.  For the study to be effective the two farms must be included in it.  All those professionally involved in the investigation and, I understand, local farming and other interests are agreed on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met the Askeaton animal health group which represents a large number of local farmers and they, the media and <Col N="1657" /> others in the area were under pressure to get me to pressurise everyone to become involved in the study.  I am delighted to say that after eight months of working on this I have brought the matter to a satisfactory conclusion.  The financial amounts involved are being expended for the sole purpose of facilitating the most effective possible study.</P>
    <P>Apart from the financial terms agreed for the lease and purchase, no payments are being made to other farmers in the area.  No compensation is payable.  What is involved is access to the land and stock.  The idea is to have a scientific study where some animals will be left in situ, others will be removed and put into laboratory conditions and clean animals from an outside area will be put side by side with animals already there.  The most exhaustive study will be carried out.</P>
    <P>The report of the Environmental Protection Agency to which Deputies referred is an interim one.  The report which is due in a few weeks will not shed any light on the comprehensive veterinary study which is getting under way now and which would not have done so but for my action.  The interim report will cover the investigations to date by the Environmental Protection Agency and others, particularly Teagasc and the Department's veterinary laboratory.</P>
    <P>The work of these agencies is ongoing and will probably not be finalised before 1997.  The overall investigation cannot be finalised unless the onfarm animal health study can be undertaken.  The work on the two farms referred to is essential.</P>
    <P>My action and that of the Government contrasts starkly with the inaction of my predecessors.  This problem has been known to exist since 1989.  It was left to fester and get worse.  Any allegation that I have been involved in a cover-up when I have held several press conferences and public interviews trying to urge the farmers to co-operate is outrageous. I have acted in a totally transparent fashion in trying to include these <Col N="1658" /> two farms.  We secured the farmers' agreement to participate in the study. Let the scientists take over from here.  I do not know the cause of the problem or the extent of it.  It is in the interests of local employment, agriculture and the community that the truth comes out. That is all I am interested in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reminded of the saying &ldquo;the lady doth protest too much&rdquo;.  After his initial remarks, the Minister's response indicated he is worried or excited about something.  Perhaps the Minister will point out where in my or Deputy Quill's question there is mention of a cover-up.  I did not make any allegations against the Minister. The least he should do is withdraw the insinuation that I might be accusing him of a cover-up.  On what legal basis are these payments being made?  What Act allows the Minister to make these payments?  Would the Minister also confirm that the amounts being paid are in the region of £1 million as indicated in the <i>The Cork Examiner</i> today?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I can allay Deputy Dempsey's fears.  I was referring to quotes in this morning's edition of <i>The Cork Examiner</i> in which Deputy Joe Walsh was reported as accusing me of &ldquo;playing with dynamite&rdquo;, Deputy Ned O'Keeffe as having &ldquo;expressed grave concern at the Government action&rdquo; and the leading article suggested that the Government is engaged in &ldquo;some kind of cover up&rdquo;.  It was not the questions that caused me difficulty, rather the presentation of the case.</P>
      <P>Some of the firms referred to, including a food processing firm, are absolutely in support of what I have done and were exerting maximum pressure to get this study under way so that the information to establish what is causing the problem there could be ascertained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey asked the legal basis on which these payments were being made.  This matter has been under scrutiny by my Department, but the Department of the Environment has <Col N="1659" /> ultimate responsibility for the Environmental Protection Agency study if and when follow-up action is required.  This has nothing whatever to do with my Department.  My sole role is to secure the veterinary aspects of the study.</P>
    <P>I had detailed discussions on all aspects with the Department of Finance. The Government approved all of the discussions I took in relation to the two farms in question.</P>
    <P>In the case of the farm being acquired, its acquisition cost is based on market values.  When the studies are completed, it is the intention to re-sell the farm, thus causing no great loss to the taxpayer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that any misrepresentations of the Government proposals could be ascribed directly to his failure to communicate fully and at all times the welcome steps he has outlined this afternoon? My understanding is that there are two key farms at issue here, that one of the two farmers has co-operated with the Minister in the manner he has outlined but the other has not, and that there are a number of other farmers in the area who, at this point, are not prepared to co-operate in any way.  How does the Minister propose to proceed in the case of the second key farmer who, if my information is correct, wants to keep all his options open until the report of the Environmental Protection Agency is made available?  How does he propose to deal with the other farmers who are not prepared to be publicly associated in any way with his proposals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the other farmers, the advice on which I have acted at all times was that of toxicologists and best experts who said that a study of the effects of air emissions on human health and all other aspects, would not be credible unless these two farms were involved.  Both farms have received extensive publicity dating back to 1989 in regard to losses and illnesses <Col N="1660" /> of livestock and so on.  It was never pointed out to me that other farms were vital to the credibility of the study.  It is not anticipated that we will deal with other farms.  I want to make it quite clear that, in relation to carrying out herbiage studies on grass land, post mortems on animals or other veterinary studies, all the analytical services of my Department, including those of Teagasc and others, will be made available to all farmers in the Askeaton area but the direct &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; role of gaining entry to farms will apply to these two only.</P>

      <P>Is it not the case that a scientific study is taking place and that it will be a matter of weeks before we know its outcome?  Would it not be prudent to await the outcome of that study, with the involvement of Teagasc and the Environmental Protection Agency, so that the Minister's decision could be based on scientific evidence?</P>
      <P>The Minister said that he was endeavouring to purchase Mr. Justin Ryan's farm and lease the other one.  Has it been purchased and, if so, how much was paid for it?</P>

What will be published by the Environmental Protection Agency will be an interim study which will not include the Ryan or <Col N="1661" /> Somers farms, but that will be possible in the final study because of the steps I have taken.</P>

      <P>Deputy Joe Walsh's second question, which Deputy Quill also raised, was the position about the Ryan farm.  The precise position is that verbal agreement has been reached in principle.  Nothing has been signed and I understand a meeting between legal people and officials of my Department has been convened for tomorrow to endeavour to bring that matter to finality.  I do not want to pre-empt its outcome.  The matter is still under negotiation. Nonetheless, bearing in mind the position in which I found myself three months ago, when requests were being made for a price, I stated publicly that the price being sought was totally unsustainable by the taxpayer.  I am satisfied the final price will represent a fair market value for the land and stock involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told us the Government has taken a decision to lease these lands and I remain unsure about the legal basis on which it decided that could be done.  For example, would it not have been possible, under compulsory purchase powers to have purchased the land in question since public health and safety are involved?  It is also my understanding that such legislative <Col N="1662" /> measures could have been invoked in this case in the event of the relevant farmers proving obstinate about selling their land.  Would the Minister comment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I can comment fully on that because at one stage I actually contemplated that option.  I sought the advice of the Attorney General and was advised there was no legal basis on which such a compulsory purchase order could be implemented, that it would entail enormous practical problems, involving the Garda and scientists. Realising that no study would be complete without the involvement of the two farmers in question, my only option was to negotiate a satisfactory outcome. I am satisfied that we will attain a solution reasonable to the taxpayer.  It should be remembered that, within the context of what is at stake in the area &mdash; such as the threat to employment, food safety factors and the like &mdash; many people were caught in a very difficult position.  If the Deputy cares to inquire into it, he will fully realise that it is very difficult for everybody involved.  I did not want anything to get out of hand which would lead to circumstances in which allegations could be made which would be damaging to our food industry &mdash; there are many celebrated cases &mdash; and for which there would be no justifiable basis.</P>
      <P>The best option to pursue is an independent, impartial study.  My mind is completely open as to what the findings of that study will be and as to what is the cause of this problem.  Let us get to the truth in a scientific manner. However, it would not be possible to do so without the co-operation of the two farmers.   We have reached the point &mdash; between a carrot and stick approach &mdash; where the most exhaustive animal health study ever attempted in Ireland will be carried out on these two farms. This will ultimately lead to an Environmental Protection Agency report which will hopefully resolve the problem.</P>

      <P>I believe I understand <Col N="1663" /> what the Minister is doing and what he has achieved to date.  He has clearly been successful in respect of one of the key farms.  However, I am informed that, in respect of the second farm, the owner of it is not prepared to co-operate. In reply to Deputy Dempsey the Minister stated that it is not open to him to apply a compulsory purchase order. In the event of the Minister hitting a stone wall in respect of the second farm &mdash; which is essential to enable the completion of the study &mdash; what options are open to him?  Will the Minister say how he proposes to proceed in the event of that emerging in relation to the Ryan's farm?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I can clarify that we have already reached a full agreement with the Summers and the tests are under way.  In relation to the Ryan farm the situation is that I met both families some months ago.  I explained the importance of securing their co-operation. Since then my officials have been involved in moving towards a market price.  I am advised by my officials, who are directly involved in these negotiations, that a verbal agreement has been reached with Mr. Ryan.  This will obviously be subject to legal ratification. However, there is no basis for me to suppose that any stone wall exists.  I would rather work on the assumption that my officials' assessment of the situation is correct and that we can proceed. In fairness to all concerned, there was a time when there was a complete stand-off.  However, good sense has prevailed. The farmers in the area realise that they have most to gain by a comprehensive study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As in previous cases regarding other pharmaceutical companies, the State is paying for the entire study.  When I became Minister there was a great problem in that no one was prepared to take responsibility for the study, because of the interdepartmental aspects, or for the cost of it.  Following criticism that this was damaging the food industry and employment, the Government decided, <Col N="1664" /> in the overall interests of employment and agricultural and community health, to deal with this issue.  That is why we took the exceptional step to have a public inquiry of this kind.  I imagine that all the figures of what is paid to an individual farmer will be made available in the future.  I will have no difficulty making such information known to the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there an admission of culpability by the State or the Department in proceeding as they have without waiting for the full scientific evidence? Is the Minister informing the House that there is no legislation which would have permitted him conduct the survey and inquiry he is now embarking upon without expending such a huge sum of money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever is the cause of the problem, be it air emissions, management practices or deficiencies in the soil, there is no way that the State is to blame and no one has alleged that the State is culpable.  There is no question of a precedent, culpability or compensation in anything we have done.  The State's role is purely to carry out the study.  If the study provides <i>prima facie</i> evidence of any source of the cause, it is open to anyone to take civil action. However, there is no question that the taxpayer caused the problem.  The taxpayer and the State are completely innocent in every respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to legislation, I am advised that potential constitutional problems exist with regard to the right to private property.  The Deputy will appreciate that I did not wish to create, in what was a micro problem, a macro one where the rights of landowners would be called into question because from time to time &mdash; Members will be aware of the celebrated case in County Tipperary &mdash; different actions have been taken.  There would be substantial resistance from farmers because it might be alleged that the study was a whitewash.  They would be very reluctant and might carry out their own study which could be used as legal evidence in any case they might <Col N="1665" /> take to court.  There are many factors to be considered in legislation.  On balance, the best and neatest option was to secure the agreement of the farmers at a minimum cost, let the study take its course and allow the public and the scientists judge what needs to be done to ensure there are no further animal health problems in the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned minimum costs in regard to the survey. What efforts did he make to ensure that the survey might be carried out while leaving the farmers in situ?  What arrangements might have been made to pay adequate compensation to those involved while the survey was being carried out rather than seeking to buy them out in the first place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>One farmer stated a preference to remain in the area and to have the problem resolved.  That is why, for the two year period of the study, we bought the stock and agreed to replace it in due course.  The second farmer was adamant that he was so distressed by the extent of the losses, and other factors involved, that he wanted to move his family out of the area.  He did not want to enter into negotiations with regard to a temporary arrangement.</P>
      <P>The farm which my Department purchased is adjacent to an industrial park where other State agencies are involved in industrial promotion.  As we intend to resell the land, and resolve the problems that occurred there, we are confident that the money we paid for it can be recovered.  The intention is that this will not result in a net loss to the Exchequer.</P>

I brought this to the Government's attention by <i>aide memoire</i> and the Attorney General's advice was that he was not aware of any such powers.  To my knowledge, the answer is no.

    <Title>Refugee Bill, 1995: Second Stage (Resumed)</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State listened carefully to the deliberations of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security and was able to dramatically improve the 1994 Refugee Bill.  We now have a comprehensive, balanced and fair Bill which will go some way to creating an independent procedure to deal with the problem of refugees on a statutory basis.</P>
      <P>Our contribution to UN ODA programmes is remarkable for a country our size.  We have also made a major contribution to the resolution of international problems, particularly in relation to Vietnam and the former Yugoslavia by accepting 1,200 programme refugees.  A significant number of both groups of refugees have settled in my constituency and I am aware of their ongoing problems, but on balance they have settled in remarkably well. Many of the Vietnamese refugees are self-employed and this is a fine achievement for someone settling in a new country.  The Trócaire report on refugees highlights the issues with which we will have to deal following the enactment of this Bill, for example access to welfare and in particular, supplementary welfare.  Deputies already have to deal with the problems their non-refugee constitutents experience with supplementary welfare and it is even more difficult for refugees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps we could have put a great deal more effort into familiarisation programmes for Bosnians from the former Yugoslavia which would have assisted them in coping with the different aspects of Irish culture though I <Col N="1711" /> have examples of families who have coped remarkably well and are now contributing to Irish society.  Accommodation has also been a source of concern for refugees.</P>
    <P>The Minister strengthened the provisions of the 1994 Bill, particularly by extending the historic Geneva Convention definition of refugees to include those who have had to flee because of gender, persecution, and trade union membership.  Section 24 gives programme refugees a status.  Refugees who have been here two to two and a half years are concerned about their rights in Irish society but under the provisions of this Bill those who have been granted refugee status will now have precisely the same rights as Irish citizens. It is appropriate that this Bill is being debated during the 150th anniversary of the Famine.  There has been a consistent stream of refugees from our shores from the days of the great John Mitchell and other political refugees and it is appropriate that as an independent State we are dealing with it.  This is a true memorial to the one million victims of the Famine.</P>
    <P>A refugees application commissioner and an appeals commissioner are being established on a statutory basis.  In the past when people seeking refugee status arrived they were sometimes bundled on to the next plane and sent on their way or jailed.  Now the rule of law will obtain and immigration officers will have no discretion, as the Minister rightly indicated in his speech, about informing these people of their rights: the process under which they can obtain the services of a solicitor through legal aid, and how to make contact with the UN High Commissioner.  If they can make a well founded application under the definition of the Bill they can remain as refugees.  As my colleagues Deputies McDowell and Callely indicated this morning we had an <i>ad hoc</i><Col N="1712" /> secretive system of dealing with refugees seeking asylum in this country which sometimes brought shame on us. The Minister of State in pioneering this Bill has done great things for our international status and I congratulate her on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This long overdue Bill is a very significant improvement on the Bill brought before us by the previous Government in 1994.  It bears saying that the last Bill proved unsatisfactory. My colleague Deputy Shatter, in particular, set out the ways in which the Bill was inadequate and with party colleagues he put down a series of amendments. I am glad they met with a relatively open attitude from the then Government parties and a fair measure of agreement had been reached on the improvements needed.</P>
      <P>I am delighted the Government has taken the sensible view and, instead of proceeding with an inadequate Bill which was in the process of being amended, decided it was better to sit down and start from scratch and produce a much more comprehensive and satisfactory Bill to deal with a series of very important issues raised during the debate on the 1994 Bill.  I was glad the former Government took an open attitude to the amendments but this Bill represents the first real breakthrough in the way we think about our obligations to refugees and approach the definition of their status, the conclusion of their cases and the entitlements that we should grant to people who come here as refugees.  It was clearly unsatisfactory, as Deputy Broughan said, that our arrangements for dealing with refugees were on an administrative basis from the day we acceded to the 1951 UN Convention, back in November 1956. That begs a great many questions and one could ask why we took that particular route at the time.  It is worth dwelling on that for a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1956 a refugee problem without <Col N="1713" /> parallel from the end of the Second World War arose in Europe with the uprising in Hungary of that year and its repression by the Soviet regime.  It would be too painful to go into some aspects of that, but the countries of the western world, including ourselves, distinguished themselves by their inactivity and moral cowardice in the face of that repression.  I was old enough then to remember clearly the emotions felt by a great many people in our country.  It was perhaps the first time in my life that I came to understand in full the utter futility of the high moral tone of the so-called principle that lay behind the doctrine of neutrality.  I will not go into that; Members of the House know my views very well on that issue.  In the last few weeks I have heard colleagues looking back to that time and criticising the policy adopted by the Government of the day and inveighing against the fact that all it did was to look for surplus Army huts in which to house refugees.  Numbers of refugees at that time were housed in locations around Shannon in Nissan huts.  However, I would not like it to be left unchallenged on the record as if that were a dishonourable thing to have done at the time.  In 1956 Ireland was still in the middle of a depression, and there was no way in which any substantial number of adequate housing units could have been built in the kind of time that was available then to meet the crisis.  On that occasion, at least in so far as the treatment of refugees was concerned, this country reacted rather well.  Even if we had reacted badly in common with all the other nations of the then West, apart from praying at Mass for the conversion of Russia, we had reacted very badly to what happened in the streets of Budapest at that time.</P>
    <P>I have heard colleagues criticising what was done in 1956.  Those same colleagues did not have a lot to say in 1969, nor have they said anything since about <Col N="1714" /> the business of providing tents at Gormanston and field hospitals along the Border to deal with people who felt themselves to be refugees from Northern Ireland at the time.  We should look back on these things with a little more deliberation than is sometimes the case.</P>
    <P>That is all divergence from what I set out to say.  It was unsatisfactory that for so long, almost 40 years, our policy in relation to refugees remained purely on an administrative basis.  I know that the administrative policy we adopted was declared by our courts properly to be a binding policy but it is, of course, far better to have these things set down in law, properly codified, so that the people who have to come to us looking for a welcome, looking for a home in our country, know their rights and entitlements and so that the people here who are charged with receiving those people and adjudicating on their cases can have both the benefit and the discipline of a clear set of statutory principles, a clear set of provisions in law for dealing with the applications made.</P>
    <P>Now we will have a clear basis of law when this Bill is enacted.  It sets out the rights of applicants, the protections that are to be granted to them and the assistance that is to be afforded to them when they look for that protection.  I am particularly pleased that this Bill includes a provision for a refugee appeals board so that we can be sure, as far as that is ever possible in life, that justice will have been done in specific cases.  That will be a very important provision in the future because there is no area of the law, as far as I know, where we can always be sure that things will be properly done the first time round. Even if we can be 99 per cent certain that justice will be done if we apply the provisions of our law, it is very wise and necessary, to provide for an appeals procedure.</P>
    <P>I note that in this Bill there is a section 12 to deal with manifestly unfounded appeals, and these come up <Col N="1715" /> from time to time.  I remember one particular case about which there was not a great deal of talk at the time.  It was the case of a young gentleman from a country to the west of us, which I will not name for diplomatic reasons, who was returning home from a country to the east of us, which I will not name either &mdash;it has disappeared since.  He applied to be taken in here as a refugee.  On examination of his case we found that the reason he wanted to be taken in here as a refugee was that in the country where he had been and training as a mechanic in a tractor factory, what I suppose one would call a certain kind of rudimentary night life was available, and he did not look forward to the prospect of going back to his own factory where, as he said, there was no Coca-Cola, hamburgers or night life.  He was quite rightly put on a plane again at Shannon and continued on his merry way.  I do not know what happened to him after he got to that country.  There are colleagues here who seem to be very friendly with the regime in that country, but I do not think any of them ever followed up that particular case.  I have not heard that he was subjected to any great discrimination after he went back home.</P>
    <P>I am very glad also that in this Bill a provision is made to extend the family reunification provisions that have been in our practices up to now.  I can imagine, having spoken to a number of people, both refugees and people who have been dealing with them, that the question of family reunification can often be one of very great concern for people who, after all, are forced to flee their native countries.  Of course, things do not always happen neatly, and one can never be sure that all of the members of a family will find themselves able to move out of the country that they are forced to leave at the same time or all together.  Given the strength <Col N="1716" /> of family ties, it is a cause of great distress to a great many people if they cannot be sure at least that they know where the other members of their family are and then if they cannot bring about a situation where those members of the family who want to be reunited can be brought back together again.  I am glad that provisions to deal with that problem are included in this Bill.  It is a very important advance in the provisions we will have in force.</P>
    <P>It is one of our common habits to pat ourselves on the back and remind ourselves from time to time what a great little country we are.  We are not that great when it comes to dealing with refugees.  We behaved very honourably in 1956.  We behaved with some honour and credit in relation to refugees from Vietnam and in individual cases elsewhere, but we have not really done an awful lot.  I am not criticising any particular Government when I say this.  We do not know the real extent of refugee problems.  There are other countries which we are inclined to look down on from our superior moral position of neutrality that have done much more than we have to help refugees who have been forced to leave their native countries for one reason or another, particularly in recent years.  For example, the reunfied Federal Republic of Germany has done more than any other European state for refugees.  I am not sure that a great many people in this country realise just what an enormous contribution Germany has made to dealing with the refugee problem, one that was very present, very close to its own borders even before the new opening up in Central and Eastern Europe and one that is still there given its proximity to the former Yugoslavia.  Sweden, which has a different type of neurtrality, and even France have done much more for refugees and have been much more liberal in admitting them than we have. Proportionately, our ancient enemy across the water has also done a great <Col N="1717" /> deal more for them.  I am not criticising any Government in this regard.  It is not in our national psyche to understand the full extent of the refugee problem.</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for an extension of certain rights to refugees.  This does not simply put in statutory form a practice that already exists, rather it reinforces and extends the rights of refugees.  If I understand it correctly, the purpose of section 3 is to grant refugees the rights enjoyed by Irish citizens in respect of employment, the exercise of a profession and access to social welfare benefits as defined in the social welfare and health Acts.  I welcome that provision and hope it will assist those refugees who are here and others who may come in future.</P>
    <P>There have been complaints about the non-availability of some necessary services for refugees, such as trauma counselling, when they arrive on our shores.  Many Members heard the eloquent presentation in that regard to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and at other venues.  The circumstances in which many refugees are forced to leave their homes give an inkling of the strong case to be made for such counselling.  A meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs recently heard details of a particular case.</P>
    <P>In 1956 many Hungarians had to leave their homes.  Members of their families had disappeared, were killed or imprisoned.  In recent times those forced to leave the former Yugoslavia because of their religious beliefs must be deeply traumatised.  Others survived ethnic cleansing and saw family members being killed, tortured or put into camps. Many of them may never know what happened to close relatives.  Such cases should move us to compassion and we can understand the distress of those affected.  In areas of conflict families are scattered to different countries and many have to stand by and watch years of work literally go up in smoke.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill refugees will be <Col N="1718" /> granted the same entitlements as Irish citizens to health and social welfare services and we must ensure resources are distributed fairly.  While I accept it is outside the remit of the Bill, we should endeavour to obviate the need for people to become refugees in the first place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss this important issue.  Despite the fact that we have had strong growth in employment in recent times, the long-term unemployed are being alienated and ostracised by the Government.  Radical, innovative and targeted policies are required.  The Government should treat this crisis as a national emergency.</P>
      <P>Half those on the live register are long-term unemployed.  In Dublin, 51 per cent of the unemployed have been out of work for more than 12 months and 26 per cent have been out of work for more than three years.  I was pleased the Government appeared to be at last giving this problem the attention it deserves, but I can only describe the ministerial smoked salmon lunch summit on unemployment today as a cosmetic exercise.</P>
      <P>Since this Government came to office there has been total confusion about who is responsible for employment policies. As spokesman for labour affairs I have had difficulty identifying whether it was Minister Bruton, Minister of State Rabbitte or Minister of State Fitzgerald who has responsibility for it.  The Minister, Deputy De Rossa, entered the scene today and made new announcements. Has he taken over responsibility for unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has failed miserably in not delivering on its promise to set up <Col N="1719" /> a local employment service to co-ordinate a range of counselling, training, work experience and job placement services for the long-term unemployed. Last March £6 million was allocated to set up this valuable service which would ensure the long-term unemployed would be made aware of jobs available locally and which would provide quality training.  It is a national scandal that, having announced the scheme earlier this year, the Government has not yet set up this service.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment must cut through the red tape and ensure the employment service is put in place speedily.</P>
    <P>The CSO labour force survey gives grounds for optimism on the jobs front and vindicates the economic policies pursued by the last Fianna Fáil Government. Between April 1994 and April 1995 the number of people employed increased by 49,000.  I am heartened to note that the much maligned private sector has proved it can deliver on jobs if given the opportunity.  The non-agricultural private sector is clearly the engine for growth in the economy, providing 37,000 jobs in the 12 month period April 1994 to April 1995.  That sector must be encouraged to continue to expand.  I urge the Minister for Finance to cut employment taxes in the forthcoming budget and to continue to restrain growth in public expenditure. They are the policies that must be pursued.</P>
    <P>Clear targeting must take place in regard to the long-term unemployed. The mixture of ideological positions in this Government has become very apparent, with the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, entering the fray today.  Lack of cohesion and urgency is evident at Government level. I call on the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to ensure that those unemployed for 12 months and longer will <Col N="1720" /> not be ignored and excluded in terms of employment policies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Deputy is trivialising this debate by cheap political rhetoric. Everybody knows that when Fianna Fáil was in government the number of long-term unemployed increased by 25 per cent, a startling increase, and to suggest, as the Deputy did, that this crisis has suddenly occurred is untrue.  Before indicting people for not holding special meetings relating to the long-term unemployed, the Deputy should look to his own benches.</P>
      <P>The figures published this week are very encouraging.  They disprove the long-standing critique of Irish economic performance by showing we are capable of turning good growth performance into real employment.  We have enjoyed unprecedented growth this year, with an increase of 4 per cent, or 49,000, in the number of people at work.  There has been a net increase in employment of almost 130,000 in the last five years.  The labour force survey, the internationally recognised way of measuring unemployment, shows a decline in unemployment of 26,000 in the 12 months to April 1995. It is desirable that we would have more regularly and timely labour force statistics. We cannot rely on measures of unemployment that are purely eligibility related, which unfortunately is the position with the live register.  The labour force survey gives a much truer picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While this year's reduction of 26,000 in the number unemployed is very encouraging, the unemployment issue remains a very serious one.  As the Deputy pointed out, 48 per cent of registered unemployed are long-term unemployed.  Not only is the size of this group alarming but the disadvantage faced by them is great.  Figures indicate that almost half of them have no formal <Col N="1721" /> educational qualifications.  The prospects of people on long-term unemployment finding work are extremely low &mdash; 25 per cent or probably fewer find employment within a year.  That is a permanent feature of the system.  We must address ways to improve opportunities for the long-term unemployed, for whom present opportunities are very bleak.</P>
    <P>The Government is tackling long-term unemployment through a range of targeted measures including the large scale community employment programme, the back to work allowance scheme and various training programmes. These are supplemented with the progressive introduction of a more intensive local employment service with particular focus on guidance and counselling. I make no apologies to the Deputy for the approach taken in carefully putting this service in place so that it genuinely provides opportunities for the long-term unemployed.  Nobody would thank us for putting in place on a rushed basis what would be seen as a local bureaucracy that is not capable of delivering, not properly locally based and not capable of adding real value. We might be able to say we have spent £X million, but nobody would be happy and in the longer term we would not get value from it.</P>
    <P>Recent budgetary initiatives have been aimed at reducing the cost of employing workers.  These measures have increased the incentive to work by improving the take home pay of the lowest paid workers.  Schemes such as the family income supplement and the reduction in social security taxes for the low paid have been part of the strategy to improve incentives for the unemployed. These measures represent a concerted effort to improve the possibilities of the long-term unemployed re-entering the labour market.  The Government is very conscious that while a wide range of measures have <Col N="1722" /> been implemented, long-term unemployment remains persistently high.  We are committed to intensifying our efforts to assist this group, which is one of the most disadvantaged in the labour market.</P>
    <P>Further reductions in unemployment will be achieved through a redoubling of our job creation efforts.  It is critically important that we adopt the measures necessary to sustain the economic success of our economy and a key way to address that issue is to concentrate on competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The Government at a special meeting today considered the unacceptably high level of long-term unemployment.  The longer people are unemployed the more difficult it is for them to find work.  The Government renewed its commitment to ensure that economic and employment growth benefit the long-term unemployed, including those living in unemployment blackspots.  It also considered ways to support the recruitment of the long-term unemployed.  The meeting provided a context within which the Government will consider specific proposals in the coming months to put in place further measures to stimulate employment growth and tackle long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>Specifically the Government decided to draw up and implement a comprehensive strategy embracing all policy areas with clearly defined objectives to deal with all aspects of the unemployment problem, particularly long-term unemployment. We must strive in particular to improve access to new job opportunities for the long-term unemployed. We must find better ways of removing potential impediments which severely limit access by the long-term unemployed to the labour market.  This may require a range of strategies including, for example, better targeting of existing schemes, better means of progression into labour market programmes and consideration of the special problems of young people, the tax on social welfare <Col N="1723" /> and the delivery mechanisms we have adopted.  The Government has instructed the Department of the Taoiseach, the Office of the Tánaiste and the Department of Enterprise and Employment to oversee the preparation and implementation of this strategy and to prepare regular progress reports for Government on the actions taken to implement it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  Section 31 of the Finance Act, 1995, contains a very welcome provision.  The purpose of that section was to extend to the self-employed the direct debit or instalment method of making their preliminary tax payment.  In recent years considerable progress has been made by the Revenue Commissioners and by compliant taxpayers in developing a well structured system for the payment of PAYE and value added tax.  As is evident from reports of the Revenue Commissioners, considerable progress has been made in the collection of all taxes.</P>
      <P>For a number of years it was possible to pay one's VAT or PAYE by way of an instalment arrangement.  The logical extension of that for income tax was provided in section 31 of the Finance Act, 1995.  The purpose of that section was to allow people to make instalment payments of their preliminary taxes by direct debit.  Unfortunately, it will not be possible to avail of that facility in the tax year 1995-96.  Preliminary tax payments should be made on 1 November and I understand that the Revenue Commissioners were not in a position to issue mandate forms and the Collector General's office is not allowing people to avail of that concession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that a mistake was made in the drafting of section 31 of the Finance Act.  The Act should have provided that <Col N="1724" /> that concession would commence in the tax year 1996-97.  I am aware that the group which meets with the Revenue Commissioners has agreed that the facility will commence on 1 January 1996 and will relate to preliminary tax payments for the year 1996-97 which will be due on 1 November 1996.</P>
    <P>A strict reading of the Act is that the facility should have been available for this tax year and people whose preliminary tax payments are due on 1 November should have been allowed to use it given that the provisions of section 31 are specific.  It should not be necessary for me to read the provisions of the Act, but the Minister can be assured that a layman's interpretation is that the concessions should have applied to the tax year 1995-96.  As it would be legally possible for taxpayers to avail of the direct debit method under section 31 until 31 December, I ask the Minister to indicate to the Revenue Commissioners that they should facilitate any taxpayer who wishes to use that concession.  I understand the Collector General's office indicated that it does not intend to allow that concession, but if a taxpayer is refused that concession he or she could take a legal action.  My reading of section 31 is that the concession was intended and an error was made.  I suggest that section should have been framed to provide for the commencement of that concession in that tax year 1996-97.  The reason I raise this matter is that the section specifically provides for the commencement of the concession in the 1995-96 tax year and a taxpayer should be allowed to avail of it if he or she so desires.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to convey the apologies of the Minister for Finance to the House as he is unable to be present, but I am delighted to have an opportunity to reply to the matter Deputy McCreevy raised.  I have listened carefully to what he said which is <Col N="1725" /> broadly correct in so far as enabling legislation to provide for the introduction of the direct debit option for payment of preliminary income tax was introduced in the Finance Act, 1995. That facility was part of a package of measures which emerged from a review of self-assessment carried out by the Revenue Commissioners and representatives of tax practitioners through the Tax Administration Liaison Committee, of which I am sure the Deputy is aware. I found that committee very useful when I was in Opposition as members of it helped me draft amendments to Finance Bills.  As the Deputy is aware, the package put forward by TALC was accepted and given legislative effect in this year's Finance Act, specifically in section 31.  That section also provides for a fixed date for the payment of the balance of tax over and above the amount of preliminary tax and the closing of a loophole whereby spouses jointly assessed could hitherto avoid the payment of preliminary tax by alternating as assessable persons.</P>
      <P>While the enabling legislation was enacted this year, I am advised it was never intended that the instalment system would be implemented before next year.  This was clearly understood by all concerned with the new package of measures.  A lead-in time was necessary to allow the Revenue Commissioners to make the necessary practical arrangements, including the putting in place of new computer systems to support the instalment arrangements.  The implementation of the legislation is placed under the care and management of the Revenue Commissioners in the normal way.</P>
      <P>Apart from the practical arrangements to be made, the legislation on the direct debit option requires arrangements to be agreed between taxpayers and the Collector General's office and is subject to such conditions as the Collector General may reasonably impose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The direct debit scheme is clearly <Col N="1726" /> intended to spread the burden of preliminary tax over 12 months.  On this basis the earliest the scheme can come into operation is January next for the payment of preliminary tax for 1996-97 which would otherwise be due on or before 1 November 1996.  The desirability of a calendar year based scheme was accepted by all participants, that is Revenue officials and tax practitioners in TALC.</P>
    <P>The systems to support the payment of preliminary tax by direct debit are currently being put in place and will be operative prior to January next to enable taxpayers to pay their preliminary tax for next year over the full calendar year 1996 in monthly instalments on the ninth day of each month.  The mandate forms and suitable publicity to promote the scheme will be available before then.</P>
    <P>While the enabling legislation does not rule out direct debit arrangements which are for shorter durations than the 12 month calendar year outlined, this is of course subject to arrangements being agreed with the Collector General as I already mentioned.  The possibility of a shorter duration was intended to cater for exceptional circumstances.  It was felt that it would be unwise to preclude the possibility of payment arrangements involving direct debiting arrangements for certain cases over a shorter period than a calendar year if these had the agreement of the Collector General.  Of particular concern in this regard were relatively new or small businesses which might not be in a position to sign up for the direct debit scheme at the beginning of the year.  However, even in these cases, the spread of payments would normally involve a period of at least six months.</P>
    <P>Those opting to avail of direct debit to pay their preliminary tax will have the option of basing their preliminary tax liability on 105 per cent of the preceding year's tax.  Thus, taxpayers exercising this option in 1996-97 can <Col N="1727" /> base their preliminary tax on 105 per cent of their liability for 1994-95 as against 90 per cent of their final liability for 1996-97 or 100 per cent of liability for 1995-96 if they wish to ensure against the possibility of interest charges.  The 105 per cent option is only available to taxpayers opting for direct debit.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is satisfied that Revenue is pressing ahead with the necessary arrangements and that, as from next year the direct debit facility will provide a useful payment option for taxpayers.  This and other amendments have arisen out of a process of consultation with the tax profession highlighting the benefit of such consultations which the Minister for Finance will be seeking to develop in the future.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also requested that people should be allowed the instalment payment option this year.  I will convey that request to the Minister and ask him to consider it favourably.</P>

      <P>I do not know why I codded myself into believing the Minister for Education would reply to this matter.  As she does not reply to matters raised by other Deputies on the Adjournment I was foolish to think she might have replied to this one.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to raise this important matter this evening and to support the application made by Saint Declan's College, Kilmacthomas for additional classrooms.  There is a critical need for <Col N="1728" /> more space at that college and solutions are required in the short-term.</P>
      <P>Kilmacthomas is located in mid-Waterford and this is the only second level college in that electoral area. There are 14 local primary schools mainly in rural areas and others in the towns of Portlaw and Kilmacthomas which feed into that college.  This school has enjoyed a tremendous reputation over the years and as a result the clamour for places has become increasingly acute.</P>
      <P>Parliamentary questions were tabled on this matter during the year, and, as usual, did not elicit much information. I hope that by raising this matter this evening a full report will be furnished as to what is happening and when the school authorities can expect to see some action.</P>
      <P>Following the visit of an inspector the need for extra space in that school was confirmed by departmental officials. Arising from that, a design team was nominated by County Waterford vocational education committee, but members of that team have not been accepted by the Department.</P>
      <P>As far as I am aware, the vocational education committee is still awaiting instructions to commence the architectural planning of the proposed extension.</P>
      <P>To cater for the 542 students, the vice-principal's office and a converted bicycle shed are utilised for classroom purposes, which is ludicrous.  The school cannot cope with the present enrolment and is hopelessly inadequate when one projects into the future.</P>
      <P>As a result of this dire overcrowding the college authorities are afraid that the Department may decide to supply four prefabricated buildings.  This would mean they could be waiting for a considerable period before any building work is undertaken.  The principal and staff would be prepared to put up with the hardship if they knew they would get a new building eventually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1729" /> The present building was constructed in 1969 to cater for 90 pupils.  An extension was provided in 1983 which now seeks to hold 542 pupils.  I referred earlier to the feeder national schools in the area.  Student numbers from these schools over the next four years will be as follows: 1996&mdash;200; 1997&mdash;163; 1998 &mdash;169; 1999&mdash;187.  The school intake is based on a conservative 66 per cent from these national schools.  The expected enrolment for the next school year 1996-97 is 670.  Part of this increase is explained by the conversion to a six year cycle.</P>
    <P>Based on the numbers available it is predicted that enrolment in St. Declan's Community College will level off in the year 2000 at the figure of about 680-720. In round figures, it can be reasonably expected that the requirement from the year 2000 onwards will be a school to accommodate 700 students.</P>
    <P>The plans envisage an additional extension of 1,570 square metres, thus ensuring that essential facilities for students such as toilets, canteen and cloakrooms will be adequate for the projected numbers.  Even at present these facilities are wholly inadequate.</P>
    <P>The parents' council say that progress regarding new accommodation has been slow and does not reflect the urgency of the accommodation problems at the school.  Parents, pupils, teachers, school management and all associated with this mid-Waterford school are waiting patiently for an immediate response to a deserving educational cause.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, regrets she cannot be here this evening.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to reply.  As the Deputy referred to my affinity with Waterford, last Friday night I spent a considerable number of hours with the Waterford Chamber of Commerce and listened to their problems in regard to the second crossing of the bridge and the need for a university <Col N="1730" /> for Waterford.  Certainly I will do all I can to assist them, even though it does not come within the remit of my Department.</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for giving the Minister for Education this opportunity to clarify the position concerning the provision of additional accommodation at St. Declan's Community College, Kilmacthomas, County Waterford.</P>
      <P>This school was built in 1970 and an extension of 1,277 square metres was deemed necessary in 1982.  An application for prefab accommodation, four classrooms, was approved in 1992 to accommodate the short-term increased enrolment at the school.</P>
      <P>In 1994, County Waterford vocational education committee applied for an extension to accommodate the school's ever increasing enrolments and brought to the attention of the Department the serious lack of suitable accommodation at this school.  The enrolment for 1994-95 consisted of 277 boys and 234 girls. The planning section of the Department of Education projects a long-term enrolment of 600 pupil places and additional permanent accommodation will be provided on that basis.</P>
      <P>In July this year a schedule of residual accommodation and of suggested future use of existing accommodation was agreed by the vocational education committee.  The extension will be 1,570 square metres and is estimated to cost in excess of IR£1 million.</P>
      <P>The vocational education committee has nominated their design team which is currently being examined by the Department's post primary building unit's professional staff.  It is hoped to begin the architectural planning of this extension early next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the Minister for Education is fully aware of the urgent need for this extension at St. Declan's Community College and she will ensure that every effort is made to commence the architectural planning of this extension so that the new building <Col N="1731" /> may proceed at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to raise this important issue on the Adjournment and the Minister for coming in to reply.  I ask the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to ensure the retention of Beleek Wood, Ballina, as a public amenity.  In particular, I wish to refer to the proposed sale by public auction of an area of three acres, known locally as the wooded area at the black gates on the Killala Road, Ballina.</P>
      <P>Belleek Wood is one of the finest scenic amenity areas in the west.  It comprises a wooded area of over 100 acres, a small lake pound, a fine castle hotel, nature walks, ancient monuments, flora and fauna indigenous to the area and the River Moy famous here and internationally as a salmon river, which runs beside and along the wooded area.  The wood is a major tourist attraction and environmentally it is the jewel in the crown of Ballina.  Ballina hosts part of the Department of the Environment which is within a stone's throw of the wood.</P>
      <P>The local Community of the Killala Road have spent up to £50,000 in improving the area with flowers, shrubs, plants, footpaths and lighting.  A local man has developed a caravan and camping site nearby which is up to international standards.  There is also good housing in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the above reasons the local community do not want this property, which is owned by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, sold to accommodate a halting site as the area is totally inappropriate for such a purpose. Negotiations on a sale for the purpose of a halting site have taken place. We have now learned that this proposal <Col N="1732" /> has been stopped and that the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry say that the only fair way to dispose of the property is to put it up for public auction.</P>
    <P>Why should the local community or the people of Ballina have to buy back their own wood?  They are taxpayers and entitled to every consideration in regard to its disposal.  Public auction may result in the property falling into the wrong hands and destroying the total potential of this area.  Both I and the people of Ballina want this property transferred to the local community to help Ballina attain its full tourist potential. There is a precedent in other parts of the country for such an arrangement. In view of what I have said I hope the Minister will desist from the route he is taking in regard to public auction of this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to deal with this issue on the Adjournment.  My colleague, Deputy Ring, and my ministerial colleagues, Deputies Higgins and Kenny, have been in touch with me about this issue.  In fact, Deputy Moffatt gave a handwritten letter on this topic.</P>
      <P>It is true that my Department was proposing, through the forestry service, to sell by private treaty this parcel of land to Mayo County Council.  I was asked by Deputy Moffatt and others to allow open competition so that other parties would have an opportunity to bid.  I discussed the matter with my officials and said, as a principle, it should be sold by open competition and that is what has been decided.  The fairest and the best way to allow the local community to know what is happening is by means of public auction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a bit much to blame the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry for the decision in regard to a halting site.  It is a matter for the county manager, the housing staff and the members <Col N="1733" /> of Mayo County Council, not the forestry service.  We have no function in relation to the provision of halting sites and it is wrong to try in any way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with that. The site in question is approximately 5.5 acres or 2.3 hectares of woodland one mile north of Ballina on the Killala road.  It is zoned agricultural in the 1992 Ballina UDC development plan.  This site is one of a large number being disposed of by the Department over time. Most forestry properties were transferred to Coillte Teoranta in 1989.  Only those without any operational forestry value or perceived developmental potential were retained in State ownership. The intention at all times is that they should be disposed of because they are of no economic worth to my Department. Our primary business is to develop a forestry service.  The Department is now embarked on a programme to sell all of these sites.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no role in relation to amenity or recreation.  As was stated in reply to Deputy Ring last Tuesday, this site is to be sold by public auction.  My Department has an obligation to maintain the maximum price and it would be wrong of me to impose conditions that would affect the sale price.  If there is a need to delay the auction to allow people do <Col N="1734" /> whatever is necessary it will not be rushed by me or by the forestry service. However, I cannot depart from the normal procedures.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the controversy which has centred on the site in recent weeks. I do not wish to appear to be insensitive to any of the views expressed by a variety of people at local level but it is most important that Deputies, the general public and people in Ballina clearly understand my role and functions in the matter as Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    <P>There is no longer any rationale for such sites remaining in the ownership of the Department or the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  I expect the necessary arrangements for the public auction to be made in the near future.  This approach is consistent with my desire to ensure the best obtainable price is secured in any public disposal of State assets.</P>
    <P>The Deputy suggested the retention of the property as a public amenity solely for tourism and recreational purposes but I am sure he will accept that as Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry I do not have a function in such matters.  I would be most reluctant to impose any conditions on the sale of property which might adversely affect the prospects of the sale or the proceeds, nor can I predict the outcome of the public auction in terms of the identity or intentions of any party which might purchase the property.  Suffice to say there have been expressions of interest on behalf of a number of parties, including Ballina Urban District Council, in recent years.  The property was offered for sale by public tender in 1991 but the outcome of that process was not regarded as satisfactory.  It is clear, therefore, that for some time we had indicated that we intended to sell the property.  With regard to prospective purchasers, circumstances and the market may have changed over the intervening period and it is not <Col N="1735" /> unreasonable to offer the property again for sale.</P>
    <P>In the event of the site being purchased by the local authority or any other party, it will be a matter for that party, not for me as Minister, to determine the use to which it is put having regard to the proper planning and other requirements.  At the risk of stating the obvious, it is entirely a matter for Ballina Urban District Council or any other party to determine whether to make a bid for the property at the auction.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that my approach to this matter is simple and above board.  As and when arrangements can be made I am disposing of all forestry properties retained in State ownership on the establishment of Coillte Teoranta, including all the residual land.  In this instance, as in others, I have adopted the approach of offering the property for sale by public auction, that <Col N="1736" /> being a manifestly transparent means of disposal.  My actions are governed by a desire to secure the best obtainable price for the property and in this context, as in others, I would be most reluctant to contemplate attaching any conditions of sale which might adversely affect either the prospects or proceeds of the sale.</P>
    <P>I do not have a function in relation to the management of the site as a tourist or recreational amenity, nor can I predict the identity or intentions of any party which might buy it at public auction. It would be a matter for the purchaser to determine, in accordance with proper planning and other requirements, the use to which the site is put and I am sure that would apply in the case of Ballina Urban District Council as in the case of any other prospective purchaser.</P>

      <P>I am aware <Col N="1667" /> that there were complaints about the dashing being applied to the north facing walls of the castle.  Because of the ongoing deterioration in the condition of the walls, treatment of them was essential.</P>
      <P>The National Monuments and Historic Properties Service researched the matter and fully considered the options. There was evidence that the walls had been dashed, and the surviving fragments were analysed.  Having regard to that analysis and to the decayed and cavernous nature of the walls, it was decided that the optimum solution was to reapply dash rendering.  This traditional form of external rendering is commonly found on contemporary buildings.</P>
      <P>When a number of complaints were made, the work was halted in order to permit reassessment of the matter.  This reassessment confirmed that the course being followed was the correct one and the work was resumed.  I am advised that the damp surrounding environment will soon weather the protective coating.</P>
      <P>Some structural support and reconstruction work was carried out to the Manorhouse over the last few years, and further conservation work will be carried out as necessary.  There are no proposals at present to reroof the Manorhouse. Apart from economic considerations, there is concern about the effect the reroofing would have on the structural stability of the remaining walls of the manor.  The castle will be open to the public at the beginning of the 1996 tourist season.</P>

      <P>Tuigim go maith go mbíonn coimhlint idir chaomhnú na hoidreachta agus an brú a thagann ón turasóireacht, go háirithe in áit cosúil le hInis Mór, atá ina oileán agus a bhfuil stór oidhreachta chomh luachmhar sin i dtaisce ann.  Aontaím nach miste bheith san airdeall i gcónaí d'fhonn a chinntiú, a mhéad is féidir, go mbaintear na buntáistí eacnamaíochta agus tráchtála is mó as tionscal na turasóireachta gan, ag an am céanna, damáiste as cuimse a dhéanamh don oidhreacht chultúrtha, agus an oidhreacht teanga ach go háirithe.</P>
      <P>Aithníonn Údarás na Gaeltachta an fhadhb maidir le sluathurasóireacht ar an oileán agus, sa mhéid is go mbíonn baint acu le tionscal na turasóireachta ann, seachnaíonn siad cúnamh a thabhairt do thionscnaimh a mheasfaí a chuirfeadh leis an bhfadhb.  Tá an tÚdarás i gcomhar le pobal an oileáin agus le Fáilte an Iarthair páirteach in Ionad Árann &mdash; ionad oidhreachta a bhunaíodh ansin cúpla bliain ó shin chun suim san oidhreacht a spreagadh agus mar thacaíocht do thurasóireacht chultúrtha.</P>
      <P>Leanfaidh mo Roinnse féin feadh a cumais tríd na scéimeanna Gaeltachta a bhíonn á reachtáil aici agus tríd an bhfoireann atá aici ar an bhfód, ag saothrú i bpáirt le muintir an oileáin, ar mhaithe le húsáid na Gaeilge ar an oileán a bhuanú agus a leathadh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is eol don Teachta, ar ndóigh, go mbíonn spéis ar leith ag líon mór de na cuairteoirí go hInis Mór i nDún Aonghasa. Tá an líon sin méadaithe le blianta beaga anuas go leibhéal thart ar 100,000 duine in aghaidh na bliana.  Ag féachaint don bhrú méadaithe ar an láthair tábhachtach seo, tá socruithe idir lámha chun gníomhaíochtaí na gcuairteoirí a mheas agus a choimeád faoi smacht.  Tá cosán sonrach leagtha síos anois ó bhun an chnoic go dtí béal an séadchomhartha.  Chomh maith leis sin, <Col N="1669" /> tá obair dheartha idir lámha d'fhoirgneamh beag thart ar 140 méadar cearnach a thógáil a bheadh mar áis do chuairteoirí agus foireann araon.  Táim dóchasach go mbeidh laghdú suntasach ar an mbagairt ar Dhún Aonghasa ón turasóireacht de bharr na gcéimeanna sin atá curtha chun cinn agam.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish practitioners have benefited considerably from the EU MEDIA Programme but, as payments are made directly to Irish practitioners by the 19 MEDIA projects which are located throughout the member states, I am not in a position to indicate what the total drawndown has been.</P>
      <P>Irish producers enjoy strong contacts with their European counterparts by virtue of Ireland's participation in the EU MEDIA Programme since 1991 and in EURIMAGES since 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU MEDIA Programme has had an overall budget of 200 million ecus for the five year period 1991-95.  The programme has 19 separate projects designed to assist European film practitioners and to promote networking of practitioners across the member states. These projects include support for script-writing and screen-writing; for <Col N="1671" /> animation and the documentary genre; for film, television and video distribution; for training of practitioners, including producers and directors; for presence at international festivals; for exhibition of European works in cinemas; and for dubbing and sub-titling of works.</P>
    <P>EURIMAGES, the Council of Europe's support fund for the co-production and distribution of creative cinematographic and audiovisual works requires that at least three European co-producers are involved in the making of a film.  Direct assistance from the fund, up to a maximum of 20 per cent of a film's budget is available for eligible projects.  In the three years since Ireland joined EURIMAGES, a total of ten feature films and one creative documentary involving Irish and other European co-producers have been assisted by the fund.</P>
    <P>Looking to the future, I believe that Ireland's producers are now better placed, given the range of national incentives I have put in place, to negotiate deals with their European counterparts more easily.  Moreover, I and my Department have played an important role in the elaboration of proposals for a Media II Programme with a budget of 310 million ecus to cover the five year period 1996-2000.  It will be concentrated on three main areas of activity &mdash; training, development and distribution &mdash; reflecting the need to focus supports over the next five years.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have secured that the final text of the Media II decision <i>inter alia</i> places an emphasis on support for countries with a low level of audiovisual production capacity and with less widely spoken languages; on small and medium sized companies; on continuous as well as initial training of practitioners; and on decentralisation of Media II from Brussels by the continued activity of media desks and media antennae in member states.</P>
    <P>I am currently considering a proposal <Col N="1672" /> to accede to the Council of Europe Convention on Cinematographic Co-Production and, in the light of this consideration, I will decide whether there would be additional merit in pursuing separate, bilateral, agreements with individual European countries.  I should say, however, that my strong interest in developing strategic alliances for Irish film producers is not confined to Europe.  I hope to be in a position to enter into co-production agreements with Australia and Israel before very long.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, on 10 February last An Bord Pleanála rejected the planning application for a visitor centre at Luggala and the Government, on 28 March last, decided to defer a decision on the location of a visitor centre for the Wicklow Mountains National Park until a management plan for the park had been completed.  Arising from this decision a steering committee was established by me to oversee the preparation of the plan.  Consultants have now been commissioned to prepare the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The brief for the consultants envisages preparation of an appropriate plan for the national park in the context of a nature conservation strategy for the Wicklow Mountains as a whole while taking account also of visitor management and of the social and economic needs of communities in the area.  The consultants have been given a set time-table to prepare a draft management plan.  As part of the initial phase of the consultancy project advertisements have been placed inviting the public to forward their views to the consultants <Col N="1673" /> regarding the Wicklow Mountains area and the Wicklow Mountains National Park.</P>
    <P>When the draft plan has been completed, a process which is expected to take some five months, a period of time will be allowed for the public and interested parties to comment on the contents of the draft and the consultants will, in turn, be given an opportunity to respond.  At the end of the process which I have outlined above I will consider all of the issues involved and, if necessary, I will submit proposals to Government regarding visitor facilities for the Wicklow Mountains National Park.</P>
    <P>With regard to the site at Luggala which was being developed as the site for the Wicklow National Park visitor centre, arrangements are being made to seek the necessary approvals to have certain safety works carried out on the site pending a final decision on its future, a decision which must await the completion of the management plan.</P>

      <P>Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh.  20 agus 36 le chéile.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to provide the Deputies with details of the progress which has taken place in relation to the Burren National Park since the Government decided to withdraw the planning application in relation to the proposed development at Mullaghmore.  As I pointed out to Dáil Éireann previously the planning application which had been submitted to Clare County Council was withdrawn in accordance with the Government decision.  The two other elements of the Government decision i.e., site safety works and the commissioning of a management plan for the Burren National Park have been addressed also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the site works, the <Col N="1675" /> Office of Public Works, having examined the matter in detail, prepared a schedule of the work that needed to be done.  Court approval was then sought for the work and subsequently, the High Court, on 17 July last ordered that the fencing on the site at Mullaghmore should be repaired and that other measures be taken to ensure that the site was made safe and secure including: (i) the dismantling of steel cages; (ii) the bending over of steel bars but no more; and (iii) the removal of builders huts upon the completion of the immediate minor works.  The court ordered that these works be completed by 15 September and that deadline was met.</P>
    <P>The present position in relation to the management plan for the Burren National Park is that a firm of consultants, Brady Shipman Martin, have been appointed to draft a plan in the context of a nature conservation strategy for the north Clare area, and to carry out the consultations which are an integral part of the process established by me.  The work of the consultants is being overseen by a steering committee.  The consultants have been given five months to prepare a draft plan and a further three months will then be allocated to the consultation process.  I would expect that the consultants will have completed the draft by January next.</P>
    <P>The study being carried out by the consultants consists of three elements: the preparation of a strategy for the overall development of the north Clare area which will take account of the requirements of nature conservation as well as of the social and economic needs of the community of the area; the drafting of a management plan for the Burren National Park; and the drafting of a nature conservation strategy for the proposed natural heritage areas in the study area.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Deputies will agree that it is essential that any plans or proposals in relation to the Burren National Park must be formulated in the context of what is best for the north Clare area and that a wide range of factors must be <Col N="1676" /> taken into account in this process.  The consultants have a daunting task ahead of them and I wish them well in their efforts.</P>

      <P>As the Deputies will be aware, last February, pursuant to commitments in the policy agreement for Government entitled &ldquo;A Government of Renewal&rdquo;, I and my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Brendan Howlin, established an inter-departmental working group made up of officials of my Department, the Department of the Environment and the Office of Public Works to examine and report back with recommendatons on improving the protection for listed buildings, including placing the system of listed buildings on a statutory basis, introducing incentives for the proper upkeep and maintenance of such buildings and undertaking a full national architectural audit.  Traditional thatched houses which are part of the vernacular architectural heritage come within the terms of reference of the working group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To date, the working group has met on eight occasions.  It is engaging in broad consultations with local authorities and with other interested bodies and persons in relation to the issues raised by its terms of reference.  Last August representatives of the working group visited Scotland to familiarise themselves with the Scottish listed buildings system and the incentives for the upkeep and maintenance of such <Col N="1678" /> buildings.  I am informed that the working group is making good progress and expects to be able to submit its report by early next year.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputies that, in consultation with the Minister for the Environment, I will give careful consideration to that report and to the introduction of any necessary new policy initiatives in this area.</P>

In the past year the Government has decided that all functions and responsibilities in relation to wildlife as well as other heritage services should be transferred to my Department.</P>
      <P>One of the most important functions of the National Parks and Wildlife Service is the conservation of certain protected species of wildlife and its habitat. This whole area of work is being extended by different directives emanating from the European Union.  Statutory protection is being given to a number of representative ecosystems which include national parks, nature reserves, refuges for fauna and wildfowl sancturies. Special protection areas for wild birds and important wetland areas are also being designated.  A programme of land acquisition has been drawn up targeted at acquiring additional wildlife habitat.  Apart from a number of wildlife and habitat research surveys, a major research survey has been undertaken which will identify important habitats for wild animals and plants in an effort to ascertain whether they should be designated as natural heritage areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also preparing legislation to implement Council Directive 92/43/EEC <Col N="1686" /> on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, known as the &ldquo;Habitats Directive&rdquo; and also to substantially amend the Wildlife Act, 1976.  In particular, I will be seeking to give statutory recognition to natural heritage areas.  I will also be preparing a biodiversity action plan which will set the future direction for conservation in this country.  These measures will extend the work of the National Parks and Wildlife Service.</P>
    <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service, through the Civil Service Commission, are currently recruiting three ecologists, a marine scientist and a data entry technician to assist in this workload. I will be seeking to allocate further staff to this important area in the future as resources permit.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 56 together.</P>
      <P>Deputies may wish to refer to a reply given by the Tánaiste to a similar question on 18 October 1995.</P>
      <P>RTE estimate that, at present, less than one third of the population of Northern Ireland is able to receive RTE television if they are prepared to invest in the necessary equipment.  The quality of reception varies considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1687" /> In 1993, the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference established a bilateral group of officials to examine the issues involved in improving the reception of RTE television in Northern Ireland.  The Irish side comprised officials of my Department, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, the Department of Foreign Affairs and RTE.  The group reported to the Conference that the removal of the current power restrictions towards Northern Ireland of the RTE transmitter at Clermont Carn, County Louth offers the best prospect of an improvement in the short-term. However, the UK side had concerns that reception of Northern Ireland television services in the North would be adversely affected if the power northwards from the Clermont Carn transmitter was increased.  It was agreed that further technical examination was necessary and RTE undertook to carry out the bulk of this work.</P>
    <P>In September 1995 an Irish position paper, based on a report prepared by RTE, was forwarded by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications to the Radiocommunications Agency which is responsible for broadcast frequency management in the UK. This paper identified technical solutions that would minimise and possibly eliminate the problems foreseen by the UK side.  It is expected that technical experts from both sides will meet shortly to consider this paper with a view to reaching an agreed engineering position on the matter.  At this stage, there is no reason to believe that there is a political barrier to extending and improving RTE reception in Northern Ireland.  In this context, the British Ambassador has recently stated that &ldquo;The British Government fully supports RTE's desire to enhance its service to the Northern Ireland audience.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 58 together.  As the Deputy may be aware I recently launched the Code of Practice for Nursing Homes.  The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly recommended that the Department in consultation with the health boards and representatives of nursing home proprietors, should draw up a code or practice for nursing homes. Work on the code took place in parallel with the preparation of the regulations to implement the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.  The code was prepared by a working party set up for the purpose.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the code is to assist nursing home proprietors and staff, officers of the health boards and the general public to a better understanding of what is involved in providing high quality care to residents of nursing homes.  The code attempts to define what is currently considered to be good quality nursing home care.  It builds on the best practice in nursing homes at present.</P>
      <P>With regard to complaints about a particular nursing home in Galway, the Western Health Board inform me that they received some complaints about this nursing home earlier this year. These complaints were investigated by a health board inspection team and the problem has now been resolved.  The board continue to monitor patient care and compliance with the Nursing Homes (Care and Welfare) Regulations, 1993, in this nursing home.</P>

      <P>The Broadmeadow Estuary was designated in 1994 as a Special Protection Area under Article 4 of Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds, known as &ldquo;the Birds Directive&rdquo;. The enabling regulations were the &ldquo;European Communities (Conservation of Wild Birds) (Amendment) Regulations, 1994 (S.I. No. 59 of 1994)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Accordingly this country must take appropriate steps with regards to Special Protection Areas to avoid pollution or deterioration of habitats or excessive disturbance affecting the wild birds where these are significant.</P>
      <P>Traditional hunting is not affected by designation as a Special Protection Area so long as the conservation status of the species hunted is not affected.  The Broadmeadow Estuary is an area traditionally popular with wildfowl.  Hunting on the foreshore is regulated under section 30 of the Wildlife Act, 1976, and hunters must be in possession of a section 30 permit to hunt on the foreshore.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the above the discharge of firearms near occupied buildings and roads etc. are restricted under separate legislation administered by the Department of Justice.</P>

Under that programme, I have allocated £57.85 million (which is the total amount available to me) for expenditure on projects relating to the physical heritage in State ownership which have a tourism benefit. The expenditure is broken down by category as follows: National Monuments and Historic Properties, £28.55 million; National Parks and Nature Reserves, £6.65 million; Inland Waterways, £22.65 million.</P>

      <P>The National Gallery of Ireland receives an annual grant-in-aid from Vote 43 for, among other things, the purchase and repair of pictures, funded from the national lottery.  In 1993 the gallery received the sum of £100,000 for this purpose; in 1994 the sum of £150,000; and in 1995 the sum of £200,000.  The other fund available to the gallery specifically for the purchase of pictures is the lane fund.  The total value of the lane fund including a retained capital sum of £34,000 in 1993 was £97,300; in 1994: £102,330; in 1995: £127,610.  The <Col N="1697" /> Shaw fund is available for such purposes as the gallery board considers appropriate to advance the gallery's interest and could be used for acquisitions but has not been used for this purpose in recent years.</P>

A total of £3.81 million from the national lottery has been allocated to Subhead C1 of my Department's Vote for 1995 in respect of grant-in-aid for the following cultural institutions: the National Concert Hall, the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the National Museum, the National Library, the National Archives, the National Archives Advisory Council and the Chester Beatty Library.</P>
      <P>The total amount of national lottery funding available to An Comhairle Ealaíon through Vote 44 for promoting and financing the arts in 1995 is £3.707 million.  These moneys form part of the total allocation of £16.25 million to An Chomhairle Ealaíon for 1995.  An Chomhairle Ealaíon does not distinguish between national lottery and Exchequer funds when it is awarding grants allocation.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, she has to prepare legislation to criminalise the sale of magazines portraying child pornography and beastiality; and if she accepts that this type of publication, which is not banned under the 1964 Censorship of Publications Act, is frequently to be found in cases of child sex abuse.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, there is a mechanism in place, under the Censorship of Publications legislation, through which obscene publications can be banned. Once a publication is banned, it is then a criminal offence to sell, or expose, offer, advertise or keep for sale, or distribute, or offer or keep for distribution, any such publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would strongly urge persons who may be aware of the sale, at any place, of books or magazines of this kind to employ the provisions outlined in sections 6 and 9 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1946 (as amended).  In particular, section 9 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1946 makes provision for the Censorship of Publications Board, on receipt of a complaint from any person, to prohibit the sale of a magazine which they consider to be indecent or obscene.  Complaints should <Col N="1706" /> be made to the Censorship of Publications Board.  A complaint must be accompanied by a copy of the book in question or, in the case of a magazine, by three recent issues of the magazine.</P>
    <P>It is of course the case that the Garda also have certain powers in situations where magazines of the kind described are offered for sale.  While I do not want to comment on the details of any particular situation &mdash; in case it would prejudice Garda operations in this regard &mdash; I can say that in one particular case an intensive Garda investigation is already in place.</P>
    <P>If, at any stage, it were to become evident that the existing censorship legislation as amended is inadequate to prevent the sale of such magazines.  I will not hesitate to propose amending legislation.  I believe we all have a duty to ensure that children are protected from abuse of this kind.</P>

I am also anxious that any change in the future to the EU dairy regime, either to the quota system or to the market support mechanisms, should be to the longer-term benefit of the Irish dairy sector.  A study is currently being completed on the best policy options for the Irish sector in this context.</P>
      <P>The levels of production in third world countries as well as the degree of internal support provided in the Union will also be relevant issues.</P>
      <P>I should add that a major element in the present situation is that EU production is still well in excess of real demand in the Union.  About 20 per cent of production is marketed with the benefit of export refunds or internal subsidies.</P>
