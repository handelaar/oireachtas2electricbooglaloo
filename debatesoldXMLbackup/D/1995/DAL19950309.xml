      <P>I wish to seek leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to discuss an issue of urgent importance, that is the proposed closure of the knitwear division of Sunbeam Industries Limited in Cork and the need for immediate Government intervention and investigation.</P>

      <P>The Ceann Comhairle facilitated the Cork Deputies on the Sunbeam issue and I thank him for that, but let me make a strong plea to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  Tomorrow 110 jobs will be lost in the Sunbeam factory, the company will go into liquidation and the silence from the Government benches is deafening.  We lost Ford, Dunlops and so on during the term of the last Coalition Government.  Will the Minister for Enterprise and Employment make a statement on the loss of these jobs?  This may not be a national issue but it is of great concern locally.  Will the Minister tell us what he proposes to do about this imminent closure?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Taoiseach wants to be helpful, but we are trying to find out the Government's priority for legislation.  Will the Taoiseach list the legislation in order of priority?  To date, the only new Bills this Government has brought to the House are the Bill before us and the Bill to appoint two junior Ministers.  In the context of promised legislation, when will the Bill on domestic violence, extending barring orders to include not only family situations, be before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to publish in any more detail than has already been made available to the Opposition parties a list of all legislation promised by this Government.  Questions on what stage a Bill is at are being answered fully to the best of my knowledge. I can go no further than that and I do not propose to publish the order of <Col N="771" /> priority of legislation as I believe that is not helpful.  The legislation on domestic violence is at an advanced stage and will be available within the next two months for the Government to approve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <P>On the question of promised legislation on the transfer of prisoners from Britain, does the Taoiseach envisage that this legislation will enable the transfer to this jurisdiction of prisoners serving long sentences in Britain for murder, carnage and destruction in British cities?  If such prisoners are transferred, will they be eligible for consideration for early release under the programme for the release of so-called political prisoners?</P>

    <Title>Regulation of Information (Services Outside State for Termination of Pregnancies) Bill, 1995: Committee Stage.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="793" /> Section 1 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash; Nothing in this Act shall render unlawful any words spoken or acts done in relation to the provision of Act information to any woman where the termination of her pregnancy would be lawful within the State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Those members of the Progressive Democrats who supported the Bill last night did so with a view to being afforded an opportunity today to substantially amend it.  The amendment to section 2 challenges the Minister and every Deputy to relate the implications of the Bill and the application of the information sections to the X case.  The Minister did not refer to this on Second Stage but it would be disingenuous, dishonest and constitutionally perilous if the House did not address the X case.</P>
      <P>At the time of the X case there was much breast-beating by Deputies who said they had not foreseen that the insertion of Article 40.3.3º in the Constitution would lead to the turmoil and controversy surrounding that case.  The time since the decision in the X case has facilitated people to forget the hard facts and trauma of that case.  It has allowed all the old absolutes to return and gain credence.  For that reason we must recall the X case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The X case was a hard one but it was by no means unique.  It dealt with a child pregnancy and the attempts by the Supreme Court, High Court and the population to harmonise and balance the rights of the pregnant mother and the unborn child.  When the Supreme Court judgment was issued there was a <Col N="794" /> collective sigh of relief across the country. It was the right decision given the facts.</P>
    <P>The issue of child pregnancy is only beginning to be addressed in this State. Given the high incidence of child abuse and indirectly flowing from that the possibility of child pregnancy, as we saw in a case which was reported recently, the issue of child pregnancy must be dealt with by the Constitution, this House and the people.  There may be need for a specific provision in the Constitution to balance the rights of unborn children with the constitutional rights of born children as these are not adverted to anywhere in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The facts of the X case were a 14 year old rape victim, suicidal as a result, was ordered, by State injunction, not to travel to Britain to terminate her pregnancy. The court subsequently held that the injunction should be lifted to allow the child have a termination.  Our State was turned into an internment camp for pregnant children.  The amendment seeks to directly address the implications of the Bill, as they relate to abortion information, to circumstances where terminating a pregnancy is legal in this State.</P>
    <P>By framing this amendment I am challenging the Minister to address the issue.  It is a realistic amendment.  We are involved in a constructive process of law making and in no sense should the House be used as a destructive process for scoring cheap political points.  Last week, I asked the Minister if he had consulted with medical practitioners or other agencies on the implications of the X case.  He gave me a detailed reply and concluded:</P>
    <P>I have already stated publicly that I do not believe it would be productive to attempt to bring forward any legislation on the substantive issue in advance of the constitutional review which is due to begin shortly.  This review will cover all aspects of the Constitution other than Articles 2, 3 and 41 which are the subject of separate consultations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="795" /> The Minister is probably right in saying that.  It would be very difficult, given the trouble we have had debating and putting forward legislation dealing with information.  Imagine the controversy, hatred and vitriol that would flow if we tried to legislate for the substantive issue.  However, we will have to do so in due course.</P>
    <P>The Irish bishops on the substantive issue said:</P>
    <P>No motive or compassion for the mother, no reluctance or regret, however genuine, can justify or excuse participation in the destruction of a human life... There are no circumstances in which the life of an innocent human being may be intentionally destroyed.  That principle remains true whatever the law of the State or international law may say.</P>
    <P>The bishops have made their case plainly and unambiguously.  They would deny the compassionate decision of the Supreme Court in the X case.  They would say Miss X had no right to a termination, no matter that she was suicidal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>

      <P>It is the full statement and it was issued yesterday.  It is important that the view of the Catholic Church be read into the record because it is basically a snub to this House, the decision of the Supreme Court and all compassionate Irish people whether they are practising Catholics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment goes to the heart of the constitutional qualms we have about the Bill.  If, in a particular case, doctors are permitted under the Constitution to perform an abortion in this jurisdiction without any restrictions on what they can or cannot do or say, the same exemption from liability should apply <Col N="796" /> when the same operation is to be performed abroad.  Doctors must be given protection if the weight of the criminal law is not to be brought down on them.</P>
    <P>As legislators we have a solemn duty to act in accordance with the Constitution which we are bound to uphold.  I strongly urge that Deputies address the X case.  We cannot get away from the effects of that case.  There are many similar type cases and not only in terms of child pregnancies.  There are medical circumstances where, if women proceed with a pregnancy, their lives are in danger.  In such a case the Supreme Court has held that termination is permissible in this State.  It must follow that information, counselling and advice relating to the termination will be available. In cases where a woman requires an abortion to save her life, her medical advisers will be bound by the terms of this legislation.</P>
    <P>They will not be able to recommend that a seriously ill woman, with a risk to her life, should have a lifesaving operation as that would be advocating abortion and fall foul of section 5 of this Bill. Doctors would not be able to make any appointment or arrangement for her with a doctor abroad even though she might be too ill to do so herself.  They will not be permitted to transmit the woman's medical notes to the doctor in England; this would fall foul of section 8.  The doctor in question would be committing a criminal offence in attempting to save the life of a patient, an Irish woman.  This is clearly absurd, it offends justice, women's rights, and constitutional rights.  If, under the Constitution, a woman is entitled to have an abortion to save her life, she must surely enjoy a correlative right to be told that she requires the abortion.</P>
    <P>I will not labour the point further because we have much work to conduct today but I have raised a valid point which will form the basis of a constitutional challenge to this Bill.  I look forward to the response not only of the Minister but of all Members who care about women's rights in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): Deputy O'Donnell raised the X case which, when first raised in the courts, was a cause of great emotion.  We know what happened at that time, the circumstances of the case.  We found out even more about those circumstances when a criminal case was taken against the person who had impregnated the young girl.</P>
      <P>The House will recall that an application of the Attorney General was taken to the High Court to prevent the girl's parents from taking her outside the State to terminate the pregnancy. Mr. Justice Costello in the High Court granted the injunction which was appealed to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court judgment on the X case is very significant in adjudicating on how the conflicting rights of an unborn child and mother could be balanced in accordance with Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt of the seriousness of the X case.  Those who proposed the 1983 amendment thought they were putting the issue of the right to life of the unborn child beyond doubt as a constitutional right.  They did not envisage the Supreme Court subsequently interpreting that amendment as giving the <Col N="798" /> right to have abortions in this country in certain circumstances.  Those who advocate easy solutions to complex problems, who stray outside their area of professional expertise, and hand down legal opinion like snuff at a wake, should be very careful, especially when they have no legal expertise because the people who advocated the amendment in 1983 did not expect the Supreme Court to use the vehicle of the amendment to adjudicate that, in certain circumstances, abortion would be permissible in this State.  It certainly was not the intention and they were amazed at the result.</P>
    <P>I stood here in a different capacity as Minister for Justice, when that amendment was being proposed.  For purposes of historical accuracy.  Members might look at my Second Stage contribution when I pointed out, on the legal advice then available to me, that this could very well be the result, that it could be the door through which legalised abortion would come into the country. However, I was laughed to scorn by certain people on that occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That is right.  Deputy Dermot Ahern was not here at the time.  What happened was that a majority in the House was hijacked by forces outside the House and the proposals I put forward were beaten because people crossed the House.  That is a matter of historic record, it was not my fault.  I did my best.  I am not point scoring on it, everybody was doing their best.  The heat it generated was colossal, people just could not compose themselves, unlike on this occasion when people did act in a composed manner.  It is fraught with emotion, it is a very difficult case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where does it leave us now?  It leaves us in a position in which, according to the Supreme Court, there is a constitutional right to terminations of pregnancies in this country in certain circumstances. It also leaves the Oireachtas in <Col N="799" /> a position where at some stage, it will have to enact legislation to provide the statutory framework for that constitutional right or, alternatively, to decide on another constitutional amendment to take away that right.  The options are not great, it is extraordinarily complex, but it is very difficult to accept an amendment which, in four lines, can deal with a portion of that complexity. However, I will revert to that in a moment.</P>
    <P>The amendment tabled by the Progressive Democrats &mdash; and I welcome the opportunity to discuss this because it is a complex and serious matter&mdash; reads:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Act shall render unlawful any words spoken or acts done in relation to the provision of Act information to any woman where the termination of her pregnancy would be lawful within the State.</P>
    <P>Quite frankly, I do not know the circumstances arising out of the X case where the termination of a pregnancy is lawful within the State.  There are a number of issues involved.  I do not know whether they would have to be replicated exactly before the right arises, or whether conditions analogous to those of Miss X would be sufficient to confer that right.  For example, Miss X was under age, she was 14.  Is the right confined only to women under 16 years of age?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Perhaps, we can talk about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, if the right is a more general one than that, does it apply only in circumstances in which pregnancy occured as a result of a rape because, again, the exact circumstances of Miss X <Col N="800" /> were that it was statutory rape?  The key point of the judgment suggests that that right would be available in this State only if, in the opinion of those best able to give an opinion, her life was at risk as a result of the pregnancy.  Therefore, are we saying that that right is confined to girls who have been the victims of statutory rape, who are suicidal and have been adjudicated to be suicidal, or is the right more general?  Deputy O'Donnell suggested &ldquo;no&rdquo;, that I am wrong in what I am saying.  I am merely laying out the possibilities: perhaps Deputy O'Donnell is right; perhaps it applies to all women regardless of age, regardless of how the pregnancy occurred.  Perhaps that right is there if there is a risk to the life of the mother on psychological but not pathological grounds, perhaps that is the position. However, to attempt to enshrine that right in a Bill in terms which say the termination of her pregnancy would be lawful within the State is extremely dangerous: I simply do not know what I would be agreeing to if I agreed to that.</P>
    <P>I said, and Deputy O'Donnell repeated, that there are three commitments in regard to this issue in paragraph 29 of the Programme for Government. I would like to expand on them.  It is known that I was involved to a limited extent in the negotiation of the programme for the new Government and I was asked to deal with certain elements of the health aspect of that programme, including this Bill.  The text of the three commitments included in the Programme for Government is exactly the same as was agreed by the Progressive Democrats in its negotiations with Labour and it was a good one in my view.</P>
    <P>The first commitment was to introduce an information Bill as soon as possible and that is what we are doing. The second commitment was to provide research, counselling and education facilities and we are in the process of doing that.  On Second Stage I outlined the way I will be approaching that.  The third commitment was to continue an examination of the complex difficulties arising from the X case.  It would be fair <Col N="801" /> of any commoner to say that that commitment will kick the ball deep into touch and that will continue to be done for some time.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw Members' attention to another commitment in the Programme for Government which was that a group of experts will examine the Constitution. We would be interested in a review of the Constitution.  Many Deputies on several occasions pointed out what they consider to be defects in our Constitution governing a modern State.  A review of the Constitution will be carried out in the first instance by a group of experts.  One may ask, who is an expert as we are all citizens? The word &ldquo;expert&rdquo; is used in the context of those who would have a particular prominence in constitutional law, legal expertise and so on that may be valuable.</P>
    <P>The group of experts would lay out the ball park and examine the parts of the Constitution which might need, to use a non-constitutional expression, &ldquo;to be refurbished&rdquo;.  They would present a report by way of a White Paper or a document of less status which would be passed to an all-party committee of the House.  That commitment in the Programme for Government has not received much attention.  It states that a group of experts will review the Constitution in the course of 1995 and that their report will be passed to an all-party committee in 1996 which will examine the Constitution to decide what amendments, if necessary, should be brought forward.  The only exclusions being considered by the Government are Articles 2 and 3 as they are being dealt with in the context of the Framework Document and negotiations with those with an interest in them, and the provision on divorce which will be dealt with separately in a constitutional referendum.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the Constitution, including the personal rights Articles, comes within the terms of reference of <Col N="802" /> the proposed constitutional expert committee and the proposed all-party committee. I hope that in addition to producing recommendations on various issues, it will suggest changes in the personal rights provisions of the Constitution, including the implications of the X case.  I have followed the X case as close as any Deputy and anything I have heard in the Department of Health of the work carried out on it only confirms my view that it is not possible to legislate in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court in that case in a manner which confines the availability of the termination of pregnancy in this jurisdiction to the narrow scope which arises from the Supreme Court decision.</P>
    <P>If one must have regard to a statutory provision which allows the termination of pregnancy on suicidal or psychological grounds, who is to adjudicate on that?  In other jurisdictions a tribunal of experts, including a gynaecologist, a psychologist and a general practitioner, can be established.  However, if a woman appears before such a tribunal and expresses suicidal tendencies, backed up by medical evidence, what members of a tribunal will say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to her request for the termination of a pregnancy?  The difficulty is how can statute law confined to the exact scope of the judgment in the X case be introduced? Regardless of arguments we may have as to the exact scope of that judgment we all agree it is narrow.  I am not in a position to bring forward legislation arising out of the decision in the X case and I have no intention of doing so, but it will receive consideration by way of the process I described.  The issue of Article 40.3.3º will be considered by way of that process also.  I hope all Deputies on this side of the House in the course of 1996, through representation on an all-party committee, will give their views on this issue.  In those circumstances I cannot accept this amendment today because, in simple terms, I do not know what I am buying into.</P>
    <P>The amendment states, &ldquo;... where the termination of her pregnancy would <Col N="803" /> be lawful within the State.&rdquo;.  If the amendment were accepted nothing in this Bill would render unlawful any words spoken by say a practitioner or acts done in regard to the provision of &ldquo;Act information.&rdquo;  The term, &ldquo;any act done by a doctor would not in any circumstances be contrary to the law&rdquo;, is such an imprecise formulation that I would not know what I am buying into.</P>
    <P>On considering the Bill as a whole, I do not believe the amendment is necessary. The Bill provides that if a pregnant woman visits her family doctor and indicates she is pregnant her doctor will give her advice.  If the doctor does not feel in conscience that he or she can give her &ldquo;Act information&rdquo; in accordance with this Bill when enacted, he or she need not do so and can counsel her on other options.  If the doctor gives the patient &ldquo;Act information&rdquo;, the process culminates when he or she gives her names, addresses and telephone numbers of abortion services abroad and that process will be non-directive.  A pregnant woman who is suffering from cancer may be advised by her oncologist that if she were to carry her baby to full term, necessary treatment, such as chemotherapy, would have to be deferred to a point where she could die.  The oncologist may outline the patient's medical condition, the extent of her cancer, give an expert view on how it will progress and advise the patient that if she does not have treatment for her cancer she may die.  Would that advice advocate or promote abortion or is it not simply a statement of the facts in a non-directive way?  When that oncologist describes the nature of his or her patient's malady are the options not clear?  Is the oncologist not totally within his or her rights to describe the nature of the patient's malady?  To say that an oncologist giving medical advice to a woman with cancer about her condition is caught by the provisions of this Act and that advice would be deemed to be promoting or advocating a termination of pregnancy simply does not stand up.</P>
    <P>I am glad the issue has been raised <Col N="804" /> because we have been fearful of talking about issues which must be in the minds of many women.  A total of 4,200 women from this jurisdiction and 1,700 or 1,800 women from Northern Ireland sought a termination of pregnancy last year and those are only the women who gave Irish addresses.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenneally said on Second Stage that those figures were not correct, but they are the official figures of the United Kingdom's Central Statistics Office.  Deputy Kenneally had a theory that many English women having abortions in England gave fictitious Irish addresses to disguise the fact that they were seeking a termination of pregnancy. That is fantasy.  There is a very simple reason why English women would not give Irish addresses.  If they did, they would have to pay for the termination whereas the vast bulk of them would qualify for a free termination under the NHS in the United Kingdom if they gave an English address.  Is it reasonable to think English women would give Irish addresses for some fantasy reason and have to pay for the termination of pregnancy when if they give the English address it is done under the national health service?  That is by way of an aside.</P>
    <P>In the context of so many Irish women going abroad for the termination of pregnancies, and in the context of the good, valid and compassionate arguments put forward here in terms of family planning services, counselling and advocacy of intervention to reduce this volume, we should talk about the X case.  However, I do not have a solution and I cannot commit myself to bringing in a Bill based on the X case.  However, we will not leave the thing just sitting there and pretend we are doing something.</P>
    <P>We are putting it to the expert group, and all Deputies through an all-party committee will have their say in due course on the X case.  It is so complex and difficult &mdash; and the previous administration had the same difficulty &mdash; there just was not a way of dealing with it.  I am not blaming it in any way, as it is extraordinarily difficult.</P>
    <P>Last night I said Supreme Court <Col N="805" /> judgments do not easily come out in the form of heads of a Bill.  It would be lovely if we thought the Supreme Court in its judgments would give the heads of a Bill but that is not the way it works.</P>
    <P>I understand and share the concerns of Deputy O'Donnell.  She is addressing a difficulty that is not in the Bill and putting forward a solution which has the profoundest of implications and which would drive a coach-and-four through the terms of this Bill, in effect, leaving it up to any doctor to do anything at all if he were to claim that a pregnant woman was in the same circumstances as Miss X or in analogous circumstances.</P>
    <P>The only test then would be if someone prosecuted him and it would run the whole way up to the Supreme Court again.  I want to protect the position of advisers and doctors.  I do not want them to be open to litigation.  I want them to have certainty in the law so that they know what they can and cannot legally do and that they are not being set up by <i>agents provocateurs</i> coming into their clinics.  I appreciate the difficulty in the general area of the X case but the flaw being pointed out is not in the Bill and the solution proposed is so wide that I simply do not know what the circumstances would be if I included it in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I am alarmed and very distressed to hear the Minister's approach to this.  It seems to be based on a number of fundamental legal errors and a failure to understand the import of his own legislation.  This Bill makes it an offence for any doctor in Ireland to make an arrangement in England for any Irish woman to have an abortion whom he has advised on her pregnancy. A person to whom section 5 applies is prohibited by this Bill under sanction of criminal law from making an arrangement with an English abortion clinic to carry out an abortion in respect of an Irish woman who is his patient.  That is what the Bill states.  Does the Minister dispute that?</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that an Irish doctor is not permitted to make an arrangement with an English abortion clinic for the termination of the pregnancy of his Irish patient? If he does not accept that proposition he does not seem to understand his legislation and I will pass on from it, because obviously he will not agree with me on that subject.</P>
      <P>Let us go on from there.  The Minister seems to think he can compartmentalise the X case and say it is for a committee of experts to advise the State about, but it is not.  Article 40.3.3º was interpreted by the Supreme Court to mean that a mother in Ireland is entitled to have an abortion if there is a real and substantial risk to her life by the continuation of the pregnancy.  Furthermore, the Supreme Court said that did not mean there had to be an immediate and inevitable threat of death &mdash; that was too high an onus of proof to cast on a woman.  If there is a real and substantial risk, as a matter of probability, to her life she is entitled under Irish law to an abortion here or in England.  Now if the Minister does not understand that he should not present this Bill.  He says he has difficulty understanding the X case.  If he read the head notes of the report which are simple&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I know, but the head notes of the report read as follows: &ldquo;The true interpretation of Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution required that termination of pregnancy was permissible only where it was established as a matter of probability that there was a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother if such termination was not effected.  To prevent termination, except in circumstances where there was a risk of an immediate or an inevitable death of the mother did not sufficiently vindicate the right to life of the mother&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That is the decision of the Supreme Court.  That is the report it has approved.  That is what that court says it meant and that is what the Constitution means.  I did not like certain aspects of the X case decision but I am bound by it and so is the Minister.  What follows from that is that one cannot say Article 40.3.3º means something else or criminalise doctors who do certain things because one cannot understand the judgement.  Pleading one's ignorance, with the greatest of respect to the Minister, is no excuse.  The Minister is here to enact a law consistent with the Constitution as interpreted by the Supreme Court.  If the Minister tells an Irish doctor he may not make an arrangement under pain of criminal sanction for the termination of a pregnancy in an English abortion clinic in circumstances where the woman as a matter of Irish law is entitled to have that abortion in Ireland or in England, he is prohibiting an act which is lawful.  That is logic, it is plain, simple and straight.</P>
      <P>I do not believe for one minute the Minister can avoid the issue by saying some group of experts may on foot of the X case propose in the House to amend the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds said he would certainly legislate to give effect to the X case decision if the substantive amendment was defeated.

I would not really worry about it so much if this was just an academic dispute or exercise but we are asking this House to create a new criminal offence; that is that an Irish doctor may not make an arrangement for an abortion in England on behalf of a patient of his.  An Irish patient is entitled to have the assistance of her doctor in making such an arrangement in the circumstances set out in the X case, as follows: &ldquo;that there is as a matter of probability a real and substantial risk to her life&rdquo;.  That is not confined to cases where there is an immediate or inevitable threat of death.  That is the law and the Minister is bound by it as much as I.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> How can a doctor establish that there is a real and substantial risk?  Who adjudicates on that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a point on which the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Justice, has been greatly misled.  She announced on radio the other day that if any woman wanted to have an abortion within the rubric of <Col N="809" /> the X case she would have to go to court to establish that situation.  That is rubbish. A woman is entitled under the X decision to have an abortion, as contemplated by that decision, without any access to the courts, without going before any wigged gentlemen; without having anybody take any injunctions one way or the other.  It is her right under the Constitution and the right of her medical practitioner, if those circumstances exist, to assist her.  That is the law.</P>
      <P>This Bill may well be referred to the Supreme Court next week under Article 26.  The Minister is proposing in this Bill that even though he knows &mdash; if he reads the X case decision &mdash; a woman is entitled to have an abortion either inside or outside the State in certain circumstances, nobody can tell her that she should do so if they are a person to whom section 5 applies and that if her doctor comes on the scene and proposes, in those circumstances, to make the arrangements for her he commits a criminal offence.  His excuse for introducing this crazy law which flies in the face of the decision of the Supreme Court is to say he has difficulty in working out what the X case decision means.</P>
      <P>I accept that in any particular case the X case would or would not avail any particular woman but the Supreme Court decides what the Constitution means and it says that an Irish woman is entitled to an abortion if, as a matter of probability, there is a real and substantial risk to her life if the pregnancy is not terminated.  That is not confined to immediate or inevitable death risks. If that is the case, the Minister has to face up to the proposition of whether the Bill is constitutional.  If he is wrong on this it will be entirely his personal responsibility, bearing in mind the response he has given to the House today, because the Supreme Court will not want to hear about an expert group revising the Constitution.  It will want to know whether this Bill is consistent with the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a matter of simple logic, is it not the case that the Bill criminalises a <Col N="810" /> doctor who makes such an arrangement on behalf of a woman in Ireland?  Is it not obvious from the X case in the Supreme Court that there are cases, as a matter of law, where a woman is entitled to have such an abortion and is entitled to have her doctor take every reasonable step to assist her in that course if her doctor is so willing on a conscientious basis, including making arrangements and, if necessary, going to England with her to assist in the operation, including discussing all the details of her case directly and making direct contact with the English specialist who might have to carry out the operation on her with a view to determining how best her health might be saved in those circumstances?</P>
    <P>Let us take the example cited by the Minister of the oncologist and the woman who is facing death if she does not have radiotherapy or chemotherapy. I know a particular woman who, happily, is alive and well and living in my constituency, who faced that difficulty. At the time of the 1992 election she came to me in tears because my party would not take a decisive stance against what was planned in the three referenda. I had known her for many years socially prior to that.  She told me of her experience.  She had to make a decision, based on her own health, whether to proceed with a pregnancy.  It was one of the most terrifying decisions she ever had to make.  Needless to say she finds remarks about murder and holocausts extremely unhelpful &mdash; that is probably a great understatement.</P>
    <P>There is no point in trying to avoid this issue.  An oncologist is entitled to give her advice saying: &ldquo;I suggest you have an abortion&rdquo;.  He or she is entitled to telephone whatever clinic it is in London and say: &ldquo;I have a woman who is very ill and needs chemotherapy.  She already has this complication and I want to be involved in any procedures in respect of this woman.  I want to be consulted at every stage.  I want to make available to you, her entire medical history and to give you advice in relation to carrying out this procedure&rdquo;.  All those <Col N="811" /> issues are that woman's constitutional right now.</P>
    <P>The Minister is avoiding the X case completely.  He said he had difficulty in understanding it and that it is difficult to apply to individuals in certain circumstances. It is as clear as crystal what it means.  It means that a woman, in those circumstances, is entitled to an abortion inside or outside Ireland.  If the Minister introduces a Bill and says it is above his head, is too complicated, is too airy fairy or whatever, he is saying to the Supreme Court he does not care about a woman's right to abortion.  We are dealing with a proposition, effectively, that no woman has a right to an abortion in Ireland under any circumstances.  That is not our law.</P>
    <P>As I said last night, the Minister's failure to deal with this proposition stems from the fact that originally when the heads of this Bill were drafted, people had in mind two Bills: one of which would deal with the substantive issue and the other with information issues. The draftsman sat down and worked along a single track.  He did not look right or left and never looked to see where he was going.  Whatever the draftsman did or why is slightly irrelevant. I am not exaggerating the law when I tell the Minister that the Supreme Court's decision is relatively straightforward as a principle; that woman, in certain circumstances, as a matter of Irish law, are entitled to an abortion.  It follows from that that they cannot be prohibited or inhibited in exercising that right by legal criminal sanctions on those who seek to assist them, if they do so in good conscience and properly in conformity with the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The Minister is leaving no &ldquo;out&rdquo; in this Bill.  He says Deputy O'Donnell's amendment would allow someone to drive a coach and four through it, but that is not the case.  What Deputy O'Donnell is seeking is the absolute minimum to preserve the established rights of women under the X case, to coexist with the general provisions of this <Col N="812" /> Bill.  It seems to me, as a matter of logic, that if the Minister reflects on it he will have to come to the conclusion, sooner or later &mdash; he has a day or two in which to do so &mdash; that if one is entitled to an abortion in Ireland, under certain circumstances, one is certainly entitled to have that abortion carried out in England.  That is axiomatic.</P>
    <P>If you are entitled to have a doctor carry out an abortion in Ireland for you, it is clear that you are equally entitled to have an Irish doctor assist you in making the arrangements for such an abortion if it takes place in England.  If you are entitled, as a matter of right, to have an abortion in Ireland, under the X case, you are entitled to be told that that is the case.  Your medical adviser is just as entitled to urge you to have that procedure done as he or she is entitled to urge you to have any other health procedure carried out.</P>
    <P>The Minister has come into the House today &mdash; I was about to use a phrase used by Deputy Ahern &mdash; and waffled on this subject.  He said that the X case is very difficult, that it is emotional, that it raises all sorts of profound issues that, as a Legislature and a country, we may have to revisit at some stage, kick to touch and get on with this Bill.  The Minister is bound to uphold the Constitution.  This Bill is bound to uphold the Constitution.  The Constitution says that women have rights to abortions in and outside Ireland in certain circumstances.  The Minister and we, as a Legislature, have no right to enact a Bill which inhibits or prevents the exercise of that right by criminal sanctions.  That is crystal clear.  That is why I said in an article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>, which the Minister may not have found too flattering&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister's performance to date on the issue shows that he does not appreciate his function in the Bill, to uphold women's rights as they are now established.  I would be interested in hearing if the Government backbenchers agree with me or whether they think the Minister's position is sustainable. I do not think his position is sustainable and I am very surprised that the Attorney General's advice has not been sought on the implications of the X case for this Bill.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the arguments about the substantial issues raised under it, I have come to the conclusion that we should simplify the Bill to minimise potential legal challenges. Consideration must also be given to whether the Bill will get over the constitutional hurdle.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he does not think this will be a problem and I would like him to respond to this point in more detail.  The decision in the X case and the constitutional rights conferred under it are substantial.  I do not have enough technical skills to know if the amendments proposed by Deputies of the Progressive Democrats are the best way of dealing with this issue and I would like to know what advice the Minister received which says that the obligations under the Bill may be inappropriate in other cases.  Even though they have not been heard in court, other cases have arisen since the X case.  Yesterday there was a reference to an 11 year old girl who is pregnant.  It is important to refer to individual cases involving real women and children. Unless they are lucky enough to have a caring parent or guardian, young girls should be able to make their own arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already referred to the 11 and 14 year old girls who became pregnant after being raped.  Consideration must also be given to the enormous stresses on young pregnant students whose whole lives may be changed by pregnancy, potentially suicidal people and women in their 40s who may be pregnant for the fifth or sixth time.  Pregnancy can give rise to problems for women who have partners, a substantial <Col N="816" /> income and child care facilities and one can only imagine the problems it can pose for single or deserted women who have little financial resources.  The X case was not an exceptional case, there are a number of such cases every year.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to pregnant women who require treatment for cancer. During the debate in 1982-83 a prominent obstetrician from Galway told a medical meeting that he had consulted legal and other advisers about whether he was entitled to treat a pregnant woman for cancer.  The problem was resolved when the woman had an abortion in England.  However, this intrusive medical operation put her at an increased risk of the cancer spreading.</P>
    <P>We must be sure that the X case scenario is covered under the Bill and that we do not implement provisions which can be successfully challenged.  We are not all graced with Deputy McDowell's certainties about this issue.  I come from a different environment and I do not have absolute certainties about all aspects of life.</P>

We are endeavouring to steer a difficult course in this Bill.  Having regard to the information the Government gave to the public in the context of the 1992 referendum, the Minister chose the correct balance in regard to referral, but it will be challenged immediately and constantly.  I would like him to be more specific on the Bill's constitutionality.  We do not want a repeat of the Matrimonial Home Bill which was found to be unconstitutional. Because of the difficulty of legislating in this area, it would be unfortunate if the Bill was found to be unconstitutional.  Many of its sections will improve the position in regard to abortion and make this a better society and it would be unfortunate if we had to risk those sections because of the unconstitutionality of others.  I would like the Minister to refer in particular to the sections which may prove to be unconstitutional.</P>

      <P>I share the Minister's concerns in trying to legislate on the substantive issue.  He is correct in saying this is an extremely complex and difficult area and that extreme caution must be exercised.  Like other Deputies, I am impressed by the expertise, the flood of certainty and tremendous, overwhelming inspiration Deputy McDowell brings to bear in his contributions.  He used one phrase or assertion 25 or 30 times to improve his argument.  I am sure it would be very impressive in a court of law, but it did not impress me. He appeared to be convinced that he had an unequivocal and crystal clear interpretation of a document he had before him which gave him the wisdom to lecture the Minister.  I have no difficulty with him lecturing the Minister on what he should or should not have done <Col N="818" /> in this Bill, but I do not want him to lecture me.  Despite my lack of legal expertise or knowledge of the Constitution, I do not share the certainty Deputy McDowell articulated so forcefully.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the Minister's reference to the establishment of a committee, he should be cautious in regard to its composition.  If he selects five constitutional experts, he will get five different versions of recommendations.  Given the wide-ranging interpretation of our constitutional rights, a multidisciplinary team should be selected by the Minister to form the committee.  The subsequent proposals of such a team would reflect the expertise of various disciplines.</P>

I ask the Deputy to allow us the right to say what we want and not to make any reference to the male or female contributions from this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike previous speakers, I will try to be succinct.  With respect, this is Committee Stage, not Second Stage.  It is unacceptable that the Minister and Deputy McDowell should speak for approximately 25 minutes.  We should <Col N="819" /> be teasing out this amendment and there are many more to be dealt with today on which Members from this side want to contribute.</P>
    <P>This amendment goes to the heart of the abortion issue.  When the Bill was suddenly thrown at us by the Government, which says it wants political consensus, I made the point that it was putting the cart before the horse.  It has been introduced at a stage when we, as a nation, have not yet made a decision on the X case.  While some people do not want the position changed, the majority want the matter addressed. The fact that Deputies O'Donnell and McDowell tabled this amendment indicates the lack of wisdom in bringing forward the Bill at this stage.  As can be seen from the Supreme Court decision, there are circumstances in which abortions are allowed in this State.  I do not support that.  I support what the Minister, Deputy Noonan, said in his Second Stage speech on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982.  He stated:</P>
    <P>...but the basic issue, to those who believe that pre-natal life is human life, is not complex.  It is starkly simple and reduces itself to whether we as a society are willing to accept the introduction of the practice of induced abortion into our legal system. At the end of the day, there are only two possible answers to that basic question.  One is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  The other is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I submit to the House that the answer ought to be &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I agree wholeheartedly with that view. The majority of our people do not want abortion legalised here and, while some Members would not agree, the provisions of our Constitution do not come to an end at Dún Laoghaire Harbour. Some Members have accused us on this side of being hypocrites.  Is it not hypocritical to formalise the right to an abortion abroad while not allowing it in this State?  This amendment indicates the state of flux that exists.  I agree with the Minister that it should not be dealt <Col N="820" /> with in an amendment like this.  The issues are far too complex.  Neither the Minister nor the courts have all the wisdom. Even Deputy McDowell would accept that the legal issues in the X case were not fully teased out.  Unfortunately, what is needed on that type of issue is a full blown case to find out what exactly our Constitution states.</P>

While I agree to a certain extent with the Minister's attitude, I resent some of the points he made in concluding Second Stage last night.  This is an issue that the Minister agreed was extremely difficult.  Yet all he did was make political points.  If that is how the Minister deals with an issue like this.

      <P>Let me analyse that contribution and deal directly with Deputy McDowell's amendment.  Deputy Ahern tells us he is against abortion.  That was a good line in 1983.  Everybody is against abortion, except it is women who happen to have them.  Some women become pregnant, and sadly, find their lives at risk.  Is Deputy Ahern telling us that a woman whose life is at risk should remain at risk and never terminate her pregnancy?</P>

      <P>Deputy Ahern gave us a clear statement that he disagrees with the judgment in the X case and is against abortion and that we should turn the clock back.  No doubt that will go down well with the few members of Family Solidarity in his constituency who have been telephoning him in recent days and, perhaps, with a few members of Fianna Fáil who also happen to be jointly members of Family Solidarity and the Deputy's own local cumann.</P>

      <P>Let us deal with the issues.  Deputy Ahern says that what we are trying to do is, in some way, formalise abortions abroad.  I do not know where Deputy Ahern is coming from, but as of now there is a minimum of 4,500 Irish women having abortions abroad.  Did Deputy McCreevy not say that yesterday?  In 1983 we were told that the 1983 amendment would put a stop to that &mdash; there were only 3,000 women then having abortions abroad. In what way are we formalising it?  Is it the Deputy's suggestion, first, that women whose lives are at risk should die and, second, that we would have a police force sitting at our airports to stop pregnant women leaving this country?</P>

      <P>I am sorry if this upsets Deputy Ahern yet again because it is not directed at him.  The problem in this debate is that it is far too easy for the male Members of this House to stand in this Chamber and dissect women's bodies in the interests of making party political points on this Bill.  I am fed up seeing the male Members of this House and men outside doing this on this issue. It is easy for men to procrastinate about the circumstances in which a woman should be allowed to terminate a pregnancy, about when a woman's health is at risk as opposed to her life, about when she should be given information. When a doctor is consulted by a patient who appears to be seriously unwell, is he to say that she is not yet sick enough that her life is at risk and that he cannot advise a termination, but that she will certainly deteriorate and that, perhaps, in six weeks' time he can tell her that her life will be at risk if this condition persists?  It is very comfortable for men to debate this issue.  We do not have to worry about it.  It will not affect any of us in our individual lives.  It might affect our wives, mothers, relations or, indeed, some friends of ours, but it does not affect us personally.  It is just so easy to debate it, sitting on a high cloud of moralistic fervour.  It is so easy for the godfathers of this debate in the extreme organisations to bring into press conferences young, naive, newly-qualified, good-looking female doctors to present a user-friendly message about a subject which they do not yet have the experience in their practices to understand the implications of.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the amendment before the House, Deputy McDowell has raised a number of issues which are of importance.  I think he is wrong in some respects because this Bill is carefully phrased.  However, the Bill is difficult and I agree with Deputy McDowell that it is open, in some aspects, to a number of different interpretations and will give rise to continuing litigation.  No matter from what perspective one approaches the Bill, people on different sides of the discussion &mdash; I would rather call it a discussion than a debate &mdash; will inevitably bring a constitutional challenge to it.  That is why I said last night that I believe the President should refer the Bill to the Supreme Court under Article 26.  That would allow us to have a clear view about some of these issues and bring to a conclusion the never-ending litigation, at least on this aspect of the problem.</P>
      <P>I am sorry if I am to be accused of having certainties, but I have no doubt that one effect of the X case, which is simple and straightforward, is that where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother she is entitled to terminate her pregnancy.  People may want to walk on the head of a pin to work out at what stage an illness poses that level of risk, but I have no doubt that that is the position.  What Deputy Ahern and others are forgetting is that the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, and his ministerial colleagues tried to row back on the X case judgment.  The third referendum in 1992, which nobody is speaking about, was to delimit the impact of that constitutional decision, to create a situation where if a young girl who was pregnant or suicidal wished to terminate her pregnancy she could not.  That was rejected by the people.  We have already had the referendum to row back on the impact of the X case, and it failed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legal position is, therefore, that if a mother's life is at real and substantial risk, she is entitled to terminate her pregnancy.  That means she is entitled to information about termination and that if she is consulting with a member of the <Col N="824" /> medical profession who, to use the words of section 1 of the Bill, engages in or holds himself or herself out as engaging in the activity of giving information, advice or counselling in relation to pregnancy, is entitled to advise her of the need for termination and, in my view, make whatever arrangements are required.</P>
    <P>She may consult a member of the medical profession who does not hold himself or herself out in that capacity, the kind of doctor to whom the Minister referred.  In those circumstances full advice can be given but in this regard there is a problem with the Bill.  We may not be able to deal with it fully in this House and a constitutional reference may be required.</P>
    <P>Let us take as an example someone who has cervical cancer and is pregnant &mdash; I am sorry if I am getting into the dissecting business but, as my colleague, Deputy Flaherty said, we should talk about real problems and issues which affect women, not men &mdash; who is advised by her gynaecologist, the person she is likely to consult initially, that she should undergo certain medical treatment which would involve the termination of the pregnancy.  She may be advised to terminate in advance of the treatment because of the effects the treatment would ultimately have and the added complexity if she should continue further into the term of pregnancy.</P>
    <P>If the life of that woman is at risk she is entitled to receive information from the gynaecologist who should be able to make whatever arrangements are necessary, and in this country she is entitled to a termination.  Members of Fianna Fáil may be uncomfortable with this notion but that is the result of the X case which was the consequence of the 1983 amendment which members of Fianna Fáil advocated.</P>
    <P>Let us assume that a woman has cancer in another part of her body and is advised by a doctor, who does not profess, to be engaged in providing pregnancy advice, that if she maintains the pregnancy she may die or may be so ill <Col N="825" /> at the time she gives birth that she will not survive or that there is some possibility of her surviving and that she should terminate the pregnancy.  Under great stress she may decide to consult a pregnancy counsellor.  When made aware of the fact that the woman's life is at risk the pregnancy counsellor is entitled constitutionally not just to start explaining that she has various options &mdash; that she could have the child and have it adopted or keep it herself &mdash; but to say that as her life is at risk, she ought to terminate the pregnancy to save her life and ensure she will be available to care for her other children as they grow up.  I am concerned that this Bill will criminalise the giving of such advice by a pregnancy counsellor.</P>
    <P>I am sorry if I have been hard on Fianna Fáil as I know some of its members, including its health spokesperson, have genuine concerns in these areas.  I am sad that they have been unable to articulate them fully and bring their party along with them in addressing those concerns.  It is time to bring to an end the fantasy land debates which have taken place in this House on this issue since 1983 in which people have read from prepared scripts provided by SPUC, PLAC and others.</P>
    <P>In this amendment Deputy McDowell is raising a number of the issues&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two names attached to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg the Deputy's pardon. Both Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy McDowell are entitled to raise these issues which are worthy of discussion. I do not think that in some of these areas we can be absolutist in the sense that I cannot put my hand on my heart and say with certainty that if the Supreme Court is asked to make a decision on the constitutionality of this measure it will hold it to be constitutional or unconstitutional.  There are valid and serious constitutional issues which deserve to be addressed and resolved but outside the esoteric world of the legal system and jurisprudential <Col N="826" /> issues there are real issues which affect women and they should not be treated tritely or lightly.  Because of the different approaches that can be adopted and the different perspectives that can be taken to the Bill my ultimate concern is that all members of the medical profession may be confused if it becomes law and is not dealt with on a constitutional basis.</P>
      <P>The Minister is trying to play a particular role which is to ensure that the fog of propaganda surrounding the debate is cleared.  If this Bill becomes law the medical profession and those engaged in counselling should have a clear view as to where they stand and what they can do.  A woman whose life is at risk cannot wait while her doctor sees his solicitor and consults senior counsel to find out what medical advice he can give her.  That cannot and will not work.</P>
      <P>The amendment reads:</P>
      <P>Nothing in this Act shall render unlawful any words spoken or acts done in relation to the provision of Act information to any woman where the termination of her pregnancy would be lawful within the State.</P>
      <P>What Deputy McDowell and Deputy O'Donnell are talking about is a pregnancy which poses a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother.  The aspect of the Bill which will give rise to a multiplicity of litigation, which will not work, is that in a free society one cannot curtail speech and we should not try to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one aspect which is worth referring to at this stage and to which I will return when I deal with the Fianna Fáil amendments which fail to take into account the impact they may have.  If this Bill becomes law, even if we accept this amendment, certain words will be unlawful.  If an 11, 12 or 13 year old girl is the victim of statutory rape and is pregnant &mdash; I emphasise this may be the case as I do not want to prejudice what may occur in a criminal trial in relation to the young girl whose tragic situation <Col N="827" /> has been detailed in the newspapers in the past 24 hours &mdash; the sad reality, and I make no excuse for saying this, is that she may be compelled to bring the pregnancy to full term or leave the country to terminate it, unless she is suicidal.</P>
    <P>If a young girl of that age is the victim of incest or statutory rape and pregnant the issue should not be whether we should work out if she is suicidal; any young girl in that situation should be entitled to a termination, to say otherwise would amount to extraordinary cruelty.  By forcing her to leave the country to obtain a termination we are simply turning our heads away and, what Deputy Ahern criticised us for doing, formalising the sending of our citizens abroad to effect terminations.</P>
    <P>If Deputy Ahern had a 12 or 13 year old daughter who was pregnant as a result of statutory rape would he be of the view that she should maintain that pregnancy or terminate it?  Would he be of the view that she should not be allowed to terminate it in Ireland and would he stop her terminating it outside Ireland?  We should talk about real people and tragedies; we should not talk in esoteric terms about theoretical law and forget that it affects real people.  If the parents of this tragic girl decide that they want a termination would Deputy Ahern like to see this girl and her family brought before the courts and the current Attorney General do what his predecessor did, create another X case?  I imagine that he would not.  When we talk in general terms we should think of the specific application of the general approach we are adopting.</P>
    <P>Apparently, it may also be unlawful to give information to someone who has discovered that the child they are carrying is anercephalic.  This is another problem we do not address.  That is why I said yesterday that it is sad that the effects of the 1983 amendment have inhibited us in dealing with the issues and social problems that affect so many women.  In dealing with this amendment and in the further amendments, let us talk about people and the impact of <Col N="828" /> what we are doing on the lives of women.  We should try to tease out the Bill and the desirability of the amendments proposed from that perspective.</P>

I ask Deputies to address the amendment.</P>

      <P>During the course of the lobbying campaign on this Bill I was struck by how little those who lobbied me spoke about individual cases or showed much regard for the individual circumstances of women who go abroad for abortions or who might find themselves in medical crisis where there is conflict between their health and welfare and the pregnancy.  As Deputy Shatter said, it is important for us to bring this debate to an individual level.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister again consider my concern about the interaction between this information Bill and the judgment in the Supreme Court?  Is it possible to go ahead with this Bill without taking further into account the judgment in the Supreme Court case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us consider, for example, the case of a pregnant woman who has cancer and needs chemotherapy treatment because her life is at risk.  If a discussion arose as to whether to proceed in terms of an abortion, or in the other direction in terms of continuing the pregnancy, in what position would her doctor be?  I heard about a case recently from a medical practitioner where a question arose about induced labour.  I understand there was disagreement between the doctors and nurses and certain individuals seemed to take the pro-life stance that the procedure could not be done because it was wrong and unlawful. The medical practitioner, on the other hand, was of the view that in <Col N="829" /> terms of the woman's health, such treatment was necessary.  That situation can arise quite often.  How will a doctor, who comes across a case such as this, be affected by the sections which seek to limit the information aspect?</P>
    <P>It is good that we are discussing this amendment and the consequences of the X case.  What has been most striking since that judgment is the lack of discussion about its implications.  There has been a sort of deathly silence in this regard.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing in this Bill because we are having a debate on the reality for individual women who find themselves in difficult circumstances.  Yesterday we heard about the case of an 11 year old girl who is pregnant which highlights many of these issues.  The question of the legalities in this area must be addressed.  I assume the Attorney General, contrary to what Deputy McDowell says, has already given advice on this and said we can proceed with the Bill.  What will be the implications for doctors in circumstances I have described where they have questions about the legality of contact with other medical consultants and passing on medical information in such circumstances?</P>
    <P>My main concern is about the interaction between this Bill and the consequences of the Supreme Court case which is what the amendment is trying to address.  I would be surprised, however, if an amendment such as this was sufficient to address the complexities of that but I understand what the Deputy is trying to do in the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seeks to capitalise on the confusion that arose from the X case.  A comment was made about people straying into other fields. I am neither a medical nor a legal person but I am struck by the advice given to us by the legal profession that we should all keep to our area of expertise. They are quite happy, however, to stray into other people's areas of expertise. Doctors may disagree from time to time but medical decisions generally have a time limit on them and are eventually made.  For legal people, the debate is endless and there seems to be no deadline. I accept that members of different professions become confused from time to time but the legal profession does not seem to have that problem and I envy them.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's comments that the amendments seek to drive a coach and four through the Bill.  While I do not support the Bill, that is all that should happen at this stage.  This issue has been kicked to touch and that works for a while but, sooner or later, another X case will arise.  Many people were disappointed by the Supreme Court decision in that case &mdash; I realise we should not be critical of the Supreme Court &mdash; and the Supreme Court cracked under the pressure mounted at the time and joined in the national hysteria that overcame us all.  Many people believe the Supreme Court decision is written in stone and that we must accept all its conclusions.  It is reasonable to argue that one could go beyond that because the basis of that decision was the 1983 referendum.  The court interpreted what the people decided at that time and if it has worked out in a way which the people did not intend, they should have another opportunity to decide on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that this issue should be dealt with by an all-party committee of the House.  I do not know whether that should be set up before or after the Minister's group of <Col N="831" /> experts examine the issue but it cannot be kicked to touch forever because when the next controversial case arises, there will be much hysteria which might result in legislation being rushed through this House.  That is not the way to conduct our business.  I hope the Minister has not been too upset by the events of the past week or two and that he will tackle the substantive issue because it will not go away.</P>
    <P>I am a little concerned about what Deputy McDowell said.  If the position following the X case is as clear as he says, anyone can have a legal abortion in the country and the case does not have to go to court.</P>

      <P>We all interpret the findings of the X case in different ways, but I wonder if the position is as clear as Deputy McDowell believes and if we will find out next year or the year after that abortions are being carried out here.  On Deputy Fitzgerald's remarks that we should talk about individual women and about what we would do in certain circumstances, I cannot say that if somebody close to me was pregnant I would not be the first on the plane, but that should not deprive me of the right to speak.  Legislation is about setting down standards, but we must distinguish between setting down a law and living by it; there is a difference.  By talking about reasonable standards and what the law should state, you are not saying you swear to stand by it.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for starting this debate on a calm note this morning and I hope that will continue.  He has answered the amendment well.  I hope he does not allow the matter to be kicked to touch for too long and that we will be back here no later than next year trying to tease out the problem.  It will not go away, even people on the opposite end of the spectrum recognise that.</P>

      <P>For those of us who are not lawyers or blessed with intellect in that field, discussion on this amendment is very interesting.  To say that it makes the whole issue even more complex is an understatement.  Many comments have been made about men speaking on what is primarily a woman's issue, but I speak as a woman for whom it is possible to have an unwanted pregnancy. If I understand Deputy McDowell correctly, the conflict arises in that the Constitution guarantees the right to life of the mother where there is a substantial risk to her health as a result of pregnancy while the Bill disallows a doctor to make a referral.</P>
      <P>There is a difference between a service and treatment.  If I am diagnosed as having cancer when I am pregnant I would expect to be treated for cancer by the doctor.  If a girl with an unwanted pregnancy goes to a doctor for information, the doctor will provide her with a service.  The service provided for under this Bill is information and counselling, but the Bill draws a line in that the doctor cannot make a referral.  Will the Minister say whether the lack of clarity as between treatment and service gives rise to the conflict that exists?</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that on Committee Stage issues are debated in great detail. Many of my colleagues have remarked on the certainty with which Deputy McDowell proposed this amendment, which is also in the name of Deputy O'Donnell.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Lest anybody has doubts, and I do not think they have at this stage, I have no legal qualifications, and as Minister, I do not act as my own legal adviser.  I rely on the advice available to me from the legal advisers to the Government.  It is axiomatic that no Minister brings a Bill before the Dáil without having it constitutionally cleared by the legal officers of the State, particularly the Attorney General who confirms it is constitutional. It would be extraordinary for a Minister to bring in a Bill that the Attorney General had not said was constitutional. This Bill is put before the House on the basis that it is in accordance with the Constitution.</P>
      <P>I have no problem teasing out particular sections of the Bill on Committee Stage &mdash; that is the purpose of Committee Stage &mdash; and I have no problem in asking the Attorney General for further advice on legal points raised.  Some interesting legal points were raised this morning by Deputies on particular issues, such as whether they are consistent with the provisions of the X case or whether an amendment is necessary.  I do not believe an amendment is necessary, but if I am advised it is, the one tabled here would certainly not be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> I bring my own expertise to these matters, as do other Deputies.  I do not have legal expertise but I have a reasonable layman's knowledge of the judgment in the X case.  In layman's terms that judgment stated that if there are real and substantial risks to the life of the mother termination should be provided in this jurisdiction.  That is the net point, but the difficulty all of us face is: who decides what is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother? This is where the supposed certainty which Deputy McDowell brings to the debate evaporates.</P>
    <P>While we can be certain about the Supreme Court decision, we cannot be certain about what it means in an individual case.  This amendment states: &ldquo;Nothing in this Act shall render unlawful any words spoken or acts done in relation to the provision of `Act information' to any woman where the termination of her pregnancy would be lawful within the State&rdquo;, which means where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother.  It is then totally subjective to decide where is the real and substantial risk.</P>
    <P>If we have identified a problem this morning, and I respect the legal opinions of Deputies McDowell and Shatter, both of whom bring a great deal of expertise to the area, this amendment does not solve it and if it is pressed I will oppose it.  However, I will ask the Attorney General to consider the matter to see if there is any problem with the Bill arising from these arguments.  If there is, I will report back on Report Stage.</P>
    <P>A number of issues have been raised. This is where people of different professions, the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker, the lawyer give very emphatic assurances of what people in other professions do.  I do not think those in the medical profession who are involved in counselling a patient would behave as Deputies outlined this morning. If a woman's life is at risk as a result of a pregnancy, I do not believe a doctor would say, &ldquo;This is it, you will die if you go to term and I would advise you very <Col N="835" /> strongly to go and have a termination.&rdquo; I do not think that is the way it works. We must remember that we may not be talking about unwanted pregnancies.  A woman whose life is at risk from a pregnancy is caught in a horrific dilemma.  It may be a much wanted pregnancy but the physical risk to her life forces her to contemplate all options.  In those circumstances it is a matter for the woman and her partner to decide and not for a medical practitioner, no matter how qualified, to force the decision on her by the strength of his advice.  In my view all the medical profession can do is inform her of the options and the consequences, including, in the hypothetical case put forward, all the physical consequences of continuing with the pregnancy. The final decision must be made by the woman.  For the medical profession to advise and push an option in the way a number of Deputies suggest is not what woman need or want from counselling.  I believe counselling in that manner is fundamentally unsound.  If the woman is pushed into a decision the consequences are immense.  It may happen that the woman will decide to go ahead with the pregnancy in spite of her physical health.  We all know of circumstances where women continued with a pregnancy in spite of the effect on their physical health because they wanted a baby.  At the bottom line, it is the woman's decision but it has to be based on sound information.  There is nothing in a Bill that prevents anyone from giving her sound information.  Having made her choice, the medical profession must support her needs.</P>
    <P>It is outrageous to suggest the role of the doctor is to tell the woman what she should do in those circumstances.  His role is to give her the necessary information, down to telling her that if she continues with the pregnancy it is his expert opinion that she will probably die.  It is still her choice.  It must remain so.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the amendment but I appreciate that it has been put forward <Col N="836" /> in good faith and that the legal argument it makes is being supported by different Deputies.  I will have the legal point re-examined to see that it does not give rise to constitutional difficulties.  I want a Bill as good as possible within the terms of the policy we outlined and the principle we agreed last night.  I will consult the Attorney General on it but I will not ask him to accept this amendment because it is unacceptable.  I would like the House to allow us accept that position and move forward.</P>

Deputy Michael McDowell is to be complimented for tabling this amendment.  It should not go unsaid that Deputy Shatter's comments on what I had said earlier are the sort of remarks that have brought the debate to where it is.  I find this area particularly difficult as a parent of adopted children.  I can fully appreciate the difficulties that pregnant women have and the difficulties they have with abortions but the way in which Deputy Shatter intervened saying that females can only speak on this issue and then literally walked out is not helpful.  It was reprehensible of Deputy Shatter to ask what I would do in the case of a 12 year old pregnant girl.  I do not know as I do not have the wisdom but whatever is done in circumstances of hard cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I never said to criminalise anybody, but at the end of the day it is up to the persons involved, with the advice of their doctor, to look at all the options.  We should not necessarily be homing in on one aspect and deciding it <Col N="837" /> is <i>a fait accompli.</i> My problem with this Bill is that it accepts that many leave our shores to have an abortion but I think we should be trying to intercept those people and offering them help and assistance.  Rather than tying ourselves up in legal complexities, as we have tended to do on this issue, we should be trying to help these people and advising them of all the options.  The way in which previous issues on this topic have been addressed has to a certain extent perpetuated a culture that is against the unborn.  I say that with all due respect and as someone who has adopted children. There are hundreds and thousands of people who would dearly love to get children and yet they see this happening and the State doing nothing to prevent it.</P>
      <P>My definition of information is different from that of a great many in this House.  The giving of information as envisaged by some Members and as in this Bill in my opinion is not reducing the numbers of those who may seek an abortion or in any way assisting them in deciding on the options.  I accept the Minister has responded in good faith and I think Deputy McDowell has put forward this amendment in good faith.  I think it addresses the issue of the X case as regards this Bill.  The flaw in this Bill is that we should be addressing the substantive issue rather than tinkering at the edges.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge the sincerity of the Minister in bringing the Bill before the House.  I accept his good faith and that his views may be no different from my own.  We are speaking about the interpretation of the word &ldquo;information&rdquo; but may now be going into the broader area of interpreting Article 40.3.3º.  The Minister said it would be foolish to bring forward those parts of the Bill without seeking the advice of the Attorney General.  He sought his advice even though there is a court case pending.  I assume the Attorney General is influencing any decision of the court which is wrong.</P>

Who decides that there is a danger to the mother?  The Minister stated that it does not appear to him that doctors will make that decision.  We are not speaking about abortion in any shape or form under Article 40.3.3º but about the right to life of the unborn and the equal right to life of the mother.  That is now being diluted against the wishes of the majority of the people who voted for that.</P>

We all remember the Bill dealing with matriomonial property which the Minister was assured was sound.  It barely saw the light of day when it was promptly found unconstitutional.  Clearly it is not a foolproof system and a second look at the issues raised would be welcome.</P>
      <P>The amendment raises the substantive issue.  There are other issues in it which try to respond to the substantive issue which probably are an appropriate way to do so.  The substantive issue must be dealt with.  The advice of a single doctor was taken in the X case.  That area and the time at which to intervene to terminate the pregnancy are perhaps the only areas that require legislation. When people are ready for the substantive issue it will be legislated for, not without great turmoil, as a consequence of decisions taken twice by the people in the 1992 referendum where they decided that the right to life of the mother was to be protected to the extent that it had been interpreted in the courts.</P>
      <P>There is no case for saying that the Bill is rushed.  Day after day we were asked when the Bill would be before us. There cannot be much that the Opposition is happy about in having given up Government but perhaps this legislation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I thank Members who contributed on both sides of the argument, those who did or did not support our amendment, at least in principle, even if they cannot find their way to voting for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been very disappointed and mourn for the dearth of liberal voices on this issue today.  As an Opposition Member, it is very strange to propose such an amendment without having the support of the main Opposition party, quite an unusual circumstance.  Indeed, those from whom traditionally I would have expected to find support for this amendment, the Labour and Democratic Left Deputies, have not lived up to the expectations.  I am very saddened that at least some of them could not have voiced some liberal commitment <Col N="841" /> to and aspiration on women's rights on this amendment.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is to be constitutionally sound, its provisions must integrate, be aligned with and complement existing law, as declared by the Supreme Court in the X case.  It fails to do so. This Bill should not remove or diminish those rights, as declared by the Supreme Court.  They cannot be postponed or transferred to a committee of this House; they are self-enacting and obtain since the decision in the X case.</P>
    <P>What the Bill anticipates is that henceforth doctors can be expected to counsel a woman, in circumstances which pertained in the X case, or in any other life-threatening pregnancies, sit behind his or her desk but use objective language only and at no stage use subjective language in the most intimate of conversations.  That is an unattainable direction to give any doctor, and it renders it a criminal act for any doctor to give advice that would in any way promote the termination of a pregnancy even if it meant that that termination would save the woman's life.  All that it is anticipated a doctor can give such a patient under the Bill is a plethora of leaflets or a telephone card, even to a child who is pregnant.  I consider that to be unsustainable, unjust, and we cannot endorse it.</P>
    <P>The complexity of the issue is no excuse for running away from it.  The <i>raison d'être</i> of the Legislature is to deal with such complex issues.  The Attorney General must re-examine this section. The rights, as determined by the Supreme Court, are not postponable, they obtain, and this Bill will diminish those rights to any counselling a doctor may give a pregnant woman or any arrangements he may make on her behalf.</P>
    <P>I call on Members to support this amendment.  I had hoped to receive more support.  It cannot be contended that an eventuality, such as I outlined, was not foreseeable.  Indeed, this Bill is really like a leaking boat, has holes <Col N="842" /> which will contribute to it sinking constitutionally. Along with Deputy Michael McDowell I have done my best to bring this matter to the attention of the House and the Minister.  I look forward to there being a possible review of the advice of the Attorney General and the Government on this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 2, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2.&mdash;Nothing in this Act shall render unlawful any counselling or advice tendered by a medical practitioner to any person where the medical practitioner in question believes in good faith that the giving of such advice is necessary in the best interests of his/her patient.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment seeks to deal with the special position of doctors.  One of the most disturbing aspects of this Bill, in terms of beliefs from both sides of the spectrum, conservative and liberal, is the expressed concern at the insertion of criminality into the conversations, advices, meetings between a doctor and his or her patient, is the State seeking to interpose itself in the doctor-patient relationship.  The doctor-patient relationship always has been one based on trust and confidence, a very intimate one, particularly within the context of a pregnancy, when it is of crucial importance that a patient should be able to <Col N="843" /> speak freely to their doctor, secure in the knowledge that any information they impart would remain confidential. Doctors also should be able to advise their patients, in a manner they consider to be in the best interest of their patients.</P>
    <P>For the first time in the history of the State this Bill seeks to introduce criminality into that most confidential or intimate relationship.  The Government wants to instal the State into the doctor's surgery, to listen in on private conversations, to police and punish any advice or counselling given by a doctor in good faith that does not measure up to the required standard of &ldquo;truth and objectivity&rdquo; demanded in this Bill.  For many years we have endeavoured to take the State out of our bedrooms but here the Minister proposes that the State should be installed in a doctor's surgery.  What kind of a standard of truth and objectivity is that since, under the provisions of this Bill, doctors will be deemed to be criminals, liable to be struck off the medical register, if they fail to give the woman advice that is &ldquo;truthful and objective&rdquo; or in any way advocate or promote abortion?</P>
    <P>If people could agree on what is &ldquo;truth&rdquo; about abortion, we would not be having this debate, it would no longer be controversial.  &ldquo;Truthful and objective&rdquo; are words which defy interpretation. The Government has given doctors no guidance as to what kind of statements will convert them from being healers into criminals under the Bill.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I said my party was supporting this Bill, allowing us the freedom to table amendments.  This and the first amendment, now lost, are crucial. We would like the Minister to give the integrity and inviolability of the doctor-patient relationship due consideration. We have a very good medical profession in this State, doctors and nurses of whom we are very proud and who have served us so very well over such a long period.  However, it is unprecedented that the State should try to police words used between a doctor and <Col N="844" /> his or her patient.  The provisions actually state that the words used must be &ldquo;truthful and objective&rdquo;; it is a policing of words, of baffling proportions.  In making this case for doctors I would have to say that it has been interesting that both liberal and conservative doctors have been singularly absent from this debate; bishops have had more to say in this debate than doctors.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill are absolutely crucial to the manner in which a doctor can counsel or deal with a pregnant woman, it is of enormous importance to their profession.  I call on doctors to state their case and give some impression of what is going on in their minds.  Quite apart from doctors, we are talking about womens' rights to the confidential relationship they enjoy with their doctors, that very intimate relationship which could not be more intimate when one is talking about a pregnancy, say, a conversation with a general practitioner or obstetrician.</P>
    <P>I do not see how any Member can oppose this amendment, it is a minimalist measure simply seeking to ensure that words spoken &mdash; not even acts &mdash; between a doctor and patient are not rendered unlawful.  This amendment is confined to discussions, advice, it does not say anything about picking up the telephone.  The amendment does not deal with referral, it refers to conversations and seeks to ensure that words spoken by medical practitioners to their patients will not form the subject of criminal prosecution.  The objective in the amendment is achievable.  The amendment should be considered by all Deputies, particularly the Minister, and I remind him that it does not encroach into the area of referral.  It merely seeks to remove criminality from discussions and advice given by a doctor to his or her patient.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some difficulty in supporting this amendment.  I was rather surprised at Deputy O'Donnell chiding the main Opposition party for not supporting the previous amendment. We are not in the business of <Col N="845" /> opposing amendments for the sake of opposing them because we are on this side of the House.  We will support amendments if we believe in the logic of the thinking behind them and the case made for them.  We did not see the logic in the previous amendment and I hope we do not support this amendment.  I point out to Deputy O'Donnell that charity begins at home and in this case support for amendments should begin at home.  If she cannot carry her party with her, she is badly placed to berate the Opposition on what it is doing.  I agree with Deputy O'Donnell when she said that she could have expected support for the amendment from the Labour and Democratic Left benches when they were in Opposition and she would have got that support on the previous amendment in the past, but the position has changed as those parties are in Government and different considerations apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell said that there was an insertion of criminality into the Bill by the Minister.  A sanction has been included in the Bill.  The Bill provides that information about services legally available abroad shall now be available in this country in certain circumstances and certain conditions have to be fulfilled. If we want to ensure that those conditions are implemented and people obey the law, some sanctions must apply.  I apologise if I am ministerpreting the objective of her amendment. Section 5 imposes certain obligations on doctors when counselling.  They can give advice on the option of availing of services legally available abroad provided it is accompanied by advice on other options and they do not advocate that a patient should avail of services abroad in preference to other options.  If Deputy O'Donnell's amendment is accepted, it would appear that doctors could say they did not obey the conditions in the Bill, deliberately advocated a particular service and did not counsel on other options because they believed in good faith and subjectively that that option was in the patient's best interest.  There may be a certain logic in that, but I believe the conditions in the <Col N="846" /> Bill regulating how information is given will vanish and there will be no possibility of any sanction being imposed if this amendment is accepted.  All the safeguards in the Bill, with which I agree, will collapse like a house of cards. The effect of the amendment will be to drive a coach and four through the safeguards in the Bill and I would not agree with that.  Regarding the insertion of criminality into the Bill, if conditions are included which state that people must do certain things, a sanction must apply if they do not comply with those conditions.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In effect the amendment states that in a doctor-patient counselling relationship the doctor, if acting in good faith, may give any advice he or she believes is in the best interests of his or her patient. That goes way beyond what is allowed by the code of medical ethics and what we are required to do.  It runs counter to the obligations imposed on us by the 1992 amendment in Article 40.3.3º.  The information amendment in Article 40.3.3º provides that we shall not limit the freedom to obtain or make available in this State, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law, information relating to services lawfully available in another state.  The amendment suggests that we are not going to lay down the conditions by law, but apply the ancient Irish theory of doctors looking into their own heart and deciding what is good for the patient.  That is what an eminent legal expert calls the &ldquo;cardiovascular vision&rdquo; which people with great insight have when they know what is good for other people.  Effectively, the requirement written into the text of the constitutional amendment is that we lay down the conditions in law.  The effect of this amendment means that there would no <Col N="847" /> be conditions in law and the general practitioner could decide what is in the best interest of the patient.</P>
      <P>There is a constitutional requirement that any legislation enacted on foot of the constitutional amendment would regulate the provision of information. The proposed amendment would have the opposite effect in so far as it would grant to each individual doctor the right to interpret the Constitution as he or she saw fit.  That would go far beyond the code of medical ethics and would result in as many laws as there are doctors.  Civil law cannot operate on that basis.</P>
      <P>The same principle underlying the proposed amendment, if applied to other areas of medical practice, would mean, for example, that individual doctors would have the full protection of the law if they felt that, say euthanasia, was in the best interests of the patient.  I am not trying to raise the temperature or suggest that anybody is advocating euthanasia or anything like that.  If a law allowed doctors to decide when counselling patients to advise what they thought was in the patient's best interests, a doctor treating an elderly patient with a terminal illness suffering pain could advise that it was in his or her best interest to end his or her life by taking a bottle of tablets.  That cannot be allowed.  The patient-doctor relationship is not sacrosanct or ring fenced from law.  It is not the case that we are trying to intrude criminal sanctions into the patient-doctor relationship. Doctors, like everybody else, must live by the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will put another analogy to Deputies.  Take the case of a woman with a broken arm and a black eye who tells her doctor that she is having difficulty with her husband, that he beat her again last night and she would like to be counselled on what she should do, whether she should stay with him for the sake of the children, leave home or consider another option.  Her doctor, who is concerned about her position, looks into his heart and decides because <Col N="848" /> her husband has beaten her so often that the only valid advice he can give her is to get rid of him and advises her to give him tablets in his cocoa.  We cannot have that situation.  People may consider that an offensive and ludicrous parallel but I make that point because a case has been made as if for some reason or another the provisions of law do not apply in cases where a doctor advises a patient and for the first time in history this awful Minister is intruding the sanctions of criminal law into that sacrosanct relationship.  That is not the position.  We cannot have as many laws as there are medical doctors.  We cannot have as many laws and interpretations of them as medical doctors decide are in the best interests of individual patients.  We cannot allow that in this case.</P>
    <P>Sanctions are provided in the Bill. There is no point in introducing regulations if they are not backed up by sanctions and penalties.  The sanctions and penalties in the Bill are mild but any legislation which seriously seeks to regulate the manner in which people behave must be prepared to enforce policy.  Enforcement of policy requires procedures and sanctions.  I cannot accept the amendment on these grounds because they run counter to the requirement in the Constitution.</P>

      <P>I listened to Deputy O'Donnell very carefully elaborating on her amendment but she understated its implications because there are very wide implications to the wording which is not tied up in legal or medical language that I might have difficulty in interpreting.  The wording says that &ldquo;nothing in this Act shall render unlawful any counselling or advice tendered by a medical practitioner&rdquo;.  That is very straightforward English and my interpretation is that a doctor will be given a licence &mdash; if this amendment is accepted by the House &mdash; to, as Deputy O'Dea and the Minister said, look into his own heart and ask what is the best advice he can give.  In other words he can give directive counselling and the licence is there to do so in the case of this amendment.  Deputy O'Donnell did not spell that out, or if she did I did not hear her.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>To me that is giving a licence for directive counselling and it is literally saying to throw the Bill out the window, give freedom to doctors and get rid of all safeguards and regulations. I agree wholeheartedly with the Minister when he says that the regulations in this Bill are quite mild.  I would like to see much stronger regulations and safeguards but really in a simple literal interpretation we are asked to cast all regulations, rules and safeguards aside.  I certainly would be very much opposed to that.</P>
      <P>Every profession, when one legislates for it, needs to have built into that legislation safeguards for its own sake as well as for the consumers who are availing of its services.  I have no apologies to make for supporting the provision of safeguards and rules and regulations. No profession should be exempt from rules and regulations as nobody has a monopoly of wisdom on all aspects of decision-making in relation to a professional service.  This is an extreme and wide-ranging amendment, and I am strongly opposed to it.</P>

      <P>I agree with some things that have been said about not allowing the medical profession to write its own law.  However, all Deputy O'Donnell's amendment is saying is that nothing in this Bill should render unlawful advice or counselling given by a doctor in good faith to a patient.  It is only saying that the provisions of this Bill which deal in section 5 with those matters should not supervene and overtake a doctor's advice to his patient if the doctor in good faith believes that that advice is necessary in the interests of his patient's safety and welfare.</P>

      <P>It says &ldquo;nothing in this Act shall render unlawful...&rdquo;.  If it is unlawful, apart from the Bill, it is still unlawful.  It is just saying that this Bill does not render it unlawful.  Deputy O'Donnell is not bringing in naïve, open-eyed amendments to say that doctors can do anything they like in their surgeries, or tell anybody to do anything they like with themselves.  She is saying no such thing; she is making a more subtle point, that the obligation under section 5 should be overridden by a view that a doctor who is giving advice on the basis of the doctor's best opinion as to his or her patient's medical needs should not be criminalised.  That is not the extreme proposition which Deputy Fitzgerald canvassed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might now on reflection, <Col N="851" /> take a look at the words &ldquo;nothing in this Act shall render unlawful&rdquo;.  It is merely to say that the provisions of section 5 &mdash; which tell a doctor that he must do this and that, and that he cannot advocate abortion in any circumstances &mdash; do not override a decision made in good faith by a doctor as to the medical needs of his patient.</P>
    <P>The question of whether advice to a patient that she should have an abortion is legally tenderable has been debated before and I am not going back to it. However, it is a matter of fact: a doctor can advise a patient that she ought to have an abortion and there is nothing wrong with doing that in Irish law.  He can advise a patient to have an abortion if it would be a lawful abortion.  There is nothing in Irish law which says that he cannot advise a patient to exercise her constitutional rights to have an abortion.  I do not believe that it is right for this House then to say to a doctor in a surgery &ldquo;You cannot advise somebody to do something which they are lawfully entitled to do.  You must be a neutral observer.&rdquo;  Why do we suddenly say in relation to one particular thing that a doctor cannot exercise his or her judgment in favour of the patient's welfare and safety?  What is it about this issue that we suddenly impose a new criminal responsibility on a doctor for giving advice when in every other respect a doctor is required to give advice?</P>
    <P>That is what, to some extent, I find so repugnant about this Bill and why I voted against it on Second Stage.  It is an effort by this House to tell doctors that they may not advise Irish women to avail of their constitutional rights.  They may not in the patient's best interest and in accordance with their best judgment advise them specifically on what they should do.  We are faced with real situations.  It is all very well for the Minister to say that this is airy fairy stuff; it is not.  This is real practical stuff. &ldquo;What would you do if you were me, doctor?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What would you do?&rdquo;, are the kind of <Col N="852" /> questions frequently put to doctors. Section 5 is saying &ldquo;Well now, I had better get out the list and tell you all the available options.&rdquo;  The patient asks &ldquo;What would you do if you were in my situation?&rdquo;, and the doctor says, &ldquo;I cannot help you.  I have explained it all to you before.&rdquo;  If she has a constitutional right to an abortion it seems to follow that she is entitled to have a medical practitioner advise her, in good faith, to the effect that she should or should not take one step or another.  She is so entitled.  This is the curious irony which exposes the shabby nature of the Bill. She is entitled to go to a barrister&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Or a TD.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>She can come to me, as a TD or a barrister, in either capacity, and ask what she should do, and I am entitled to tell her to have an abortion, that, in my view, she has a constitutional right to an abortion because her life is at risk.  She is entitled to go to any Joe or Josephine Soap in the street and seek advice from that person. People are entitled to come up to her in pubs and proffer their advice in her situation having heard about it in local gossip but the one group of people criminalised for expressing an opinion on the matter are doctors and counsellors. How can that possibly be just? Why is it that everybody else &mdash; people to whom section 5 does not apply &mdash; can offer any old advice that comes into their head and urge this or that course on any woman they meet, but that a doctor from whom the woman has sought advice &mdash; going back to the oncologist case &mdash; cannot give positive advice to have an abortion without committing a criminal offence?  Why is that the case?  Why is it proposed by the Minister that we select from all the groups who might tender advice &mdash; from lawyers to political activists to members of &ldquo;right to choose&rdquo; campaigns &mdash; people who have expertise and a confidential relationship with their client, the doctor, on whom the family has come to rely and trust and in whose judgments <Col N="853" /> they have faith?  If that person tenders positive advice for an abortion he or she commits an offence.  Curiously, as the Minister's explanatory leaflet points out, if the doctor tenders positive advice against an abortion that is perfectly all right.</P>
      <P>The one thing a doctor cannot do is make a suggestion to the effect that the patient should have an abortion.  I do not wish to go back over the earlier debate but if it is true, as a result of the X case &mdash; I believe it is undeniably true although people have said to me in the debate that I am dealing with far too much uncertainty &mdash; all I can do is look at the judgment and ascertain what the Supreme Court said it was deciding, not what I say it was deciding.  It says it is lawful for an Irish woman, in certain circumstances, to have an abortion in Ireland or abroad.  It is not right and cannot be correct that a doctor cannot advise a patient to avail of her constitutional rights.  I cannot see how it can possibly be argued that a person can have a right to do something to preserve their own life but may not be advised by the one person who is most likely to tender sound advice to the patient on the issue and most likely to know, compared with any other person in the community, the patient's genuine requirements.</P>
      <P>I am not worried whether Fianna Fáil, Democratic Left or Labour support the amendment.  I agree with Deputy O'Donnell that most Members should have no difficulty with this amendment. It is clear from what has been said by the Minister and Deputy Fitzgerald that rejecting this amendment means consciously intending to criminalise any doctor who tells a woman to have an abortion, on his best opinion of her position, even though that is her constitutional right.  That is what this Bill is doing and that is what this amendment is trying to prevent becoming a crime.  I do not see how it can be objected to as something wrong or putting a coach and four through the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Bill is referred to the Supreme Court under Article 26 it is highly likely <Col N="854" /> that this debate will be considered by the Supreme Court.  It is interesting that some Deputies in the House are going on record as saying they do not follow the X case, do not want to be bothered by its contents now and that maybe somebody should examine it in two years' time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though some people may not be happy with the X case &mdash; I accept there were people who thought it was a controversial decision &mdash; it is the law of the land.  Women are entitled to abortions in certain circumstances. How can it possibly be right to criminalise a doctor for advising a woman positively to avail of her constitutional rights if the doctor believes her own safety requires it?  I cannot understand for the life of me how people think this is driving a coach and four through the Bill.  It is not, it is standing up basically for women's rights.  If a woman has a right to save her own life or take steps to terminate a pregnancy to avoid a real and substantial risk to her life, she has a right to be advised she should do that.  There is no law in this land that has a right to say to a person advising her that that person must refrain from using his or her best judgment to assist a woman.</P>
      <P>The Minister is making a fundamental error.  He believes the woman can make a sound decision on the basis of a doctor reading out objective advice to her, that the doctor, who has a far better grasp of the threat to her life, should remain non-judgmental but that she should make the judgment by herself.  It is all very well if one is talking about highly educated or sophisticated people who can think calmly about their position.  In this case we are talking about a wholly different situation: people who are confused and frightened and who want to know their doctor's best opinion of what they should do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject it as contemptible that anyone <Col N="855" /> should say to a woman in those circumstances &mdash; even though she has a right to have an abortion to safeguard her own life from a real and substantial risk &mdash; that her doctor would commit a crime if he told her that was his advice to her.  That is obnoxious.  I really think it stinks.  I cannot think of any words strong enough to convey my feeling that we are dealing with women here in a demeaning way.  We do not say in any other area that any professional adviser may not advise his or her client to do something which the client is entitled to do.  We do not say it of lawyers, engineers, architects etc., but we say it suddenly in the case of a doctor.  We say that that doctor cannot advise a woman who is in difficulties, for one reason or another, of his positive view of that woman's best interest.  I regard that as deeply offensive.  The Minister seems to think this Bill is academic, that he is not dealing with real people.  I am talking about real people who go to a doctor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am willing to be brief but I also intend to make the point because this House is averting its gaze from the real implications of what it is doing.  It is saying to women: &ldquo;you do <Col N="856" /> not really matter and your rights, as declared by the Supreme Court, do not really matter and if any doctor advises you to exercise your constitutional rights he commits an offence because he did not also tell you to do other things at the same time&rdquo;.  That is a massive and sad intrusion on people's entitlement to have the best advice from their general practitioner or medical adviser, in accordance with their safety as a patient. I cannot over-emphasise that this is not a matter of a dry debate one Thursday lunchtime in this House.</P>
      <P>We are putting in place a law which is supposed to last for years.  What we are dealing with here is women's rights and their right to life.  The Minister is saying it is all right with him &mdash; and Deputy Fitzgerald seems to agree &mdash; that a woman who has a constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy may not be advised by a doctor, who knows all the circumstances, when she asks him for his opinion, that she should proceed to have an abortion.  It is flabbergasting as a proposition and the Minister should think long and hard about putting in place any law which has that effect.  It is completely wrong to require a doctor who believes a woman should have an abortion, who knows the woman has a legal and constitutional right to have an abortion, not to advise his client to avail of her constitutional rights but can give her any other advice.  Any person on the street can give her advice but if the doctor advises her to avail of her constitutional rights he commits a criminal offence.  That is wrong.</P>

He forgot to mention one right in his fantastic piece of rhetoric, that is the constitutional right to life of the unborn child.  If he factored this right into this argument he might <Col N="857" /> realise why regulations are being introduced.

It is not true to say that the Deputy, a senior <Col N="858" /> counsel, could advise a woman who visits him that she had a right to an abortion on constitutional grounds.

In the X case it was decided that a woman had a right to an abortion if there was a real and substantial risk to her life but it did not go on to say that this right could override other rights in the Constitution. In the context of first principles, under the Constitution the unborn and the mother have an equal right to life. Those rights can only be vindicated in a manner which does not transgress the freedom to information and the right to travel given in the 1992 referendum.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not want the impression to go out from this <Col N="860" /> House that under the Constitution a doctor can decide that there is a real and substantial risk to the life of a pregnant woman and advise her that she has a constitutional right to a termination without ever mentioning the right to life of the unborn which is guaranteed under the Constitution.  These are competing rights to life.  This is a very complex and complicated matter and the Deputy is not being fair in pretending that it is as simple as he is trying to call it.  The Deputy is one of the most prominent senior counsels in the country &mdash; he is recognised as an expert in law &mdash; and he is using his skills to back up weak arguments while ignoring the right to life of the unborn which could be totally in conflict with the constitutional rights of a woman.  Neither the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker, a GP or a senior counsel is in a position to tell a woman that she has a constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy.  That is why we need statute law arising from the X case.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made the case against the amendment better than I could.  The amendment is based on the X case and the Deputy's certainty that women have a constitutional right to have an abortion under the decision in that case.  While he may have been referring to the one in a million case, he gave the impression that all women have this right.  This legislation follows from the 1992 referendum and the provisions in the amendment would <Col N="861" /> breach the undertakings given in regard to referral.</P>
      <P>I agree that there has been very little feedback from the medical profession on the legislation.  Some doctors also work in hospitals and if we had not taken Committee Stage immediately after Second Stage they might have had an opportunity to make known their views.</P>

      <P>Deputy McDowell referred to directive counselling given by doctors.  It is important to refer to the value of non-directive counselling.  From my experience as a social worker, if people are given full information they arrive at the best decisions themselves. I support the Bill because it will allow women to receive proper counselling on all the options.  Many of the medical points to which the Deputy referred would be dealt with in the counselling a doctor would have to give to a patient under the terms of the Bill.  There should be greater focus on developing the counselling aspects of the Bill and ensuring that counselling is as non-directive as possible.  While there is still scope for directive counselling in some areas, in the doctor-patient relationship we have moved away from the position whereby doctors tell patients what they should do.  There is now much more dialogue between patients and doctors and most people want to know the pros and cons of treatment.  They want the doctor and patient, together, to arrive at a decision on the best possible treatment.</P>
      <P>The services available to women under the Bill could be open to abuse. We must examine the ethos of the various counselling services and women must know what is on offer.  Non-directive counselling is vital in this area.  In the case of an 11, 14 or 16 year old, the girl and her parents must arrive at a decision rather than have it imposed on her by a doctor.</P>

      <P>In this amendment I sought to protect the integrity of the counselling process, including the non-directive aspect, because there is an <Col N="862" /> insertion of criminality in respect of conversations and advices which flow from a doctor and his or her patient. The provisions place doctors in an invidious position.  The Bill attempts to police the counselling process and define conversations.  There are dangers in trying to police what is truthful and objective.  Truth and objectivity, no matter what we say here, in a subjective relationship between doctors and clients, is a movable feast.  I am beginning to believe I was mad to raise this point.  Notwithstanding that, I am still concerned about the insertion of criminality in respect of conversations and advices between doctors and patients. To penalise a doctor for words used in the context of a confidential doctor-patient relationship is wrong.  In the past extreme groups who wanted to test the constitutionality of cases involving the right to life of the unborn &mdash; I acknowledge that the unborn has a right to life &mdash; sent spies into doctors' clinics and waited as <i>agent provocateurs</i> to hear the tone of their advice.  In the same way as the doctor may advise a patient against abortion, he or she may not advise the patient to have an abortion.  Even in terms of non-directive counselling, there is still a concern&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>While this amendment protects the integrity of the counselling process, it does not attempt to legalise making appointments.  It is confined to advice and counselling.

      <P>I may not have been in the Chamber this morning, but I listened to the debate on the monitor and it strikes me that the logic of what Deputy McDowell stated on this amendment is absolutely correct.  His argument was attacked but not because fault was found with its logic.  It was attacked by attributing to Deputy McDowell statements and attitudes he neither made nor took.  Unfortunately, there is always a degree of personalisation whenever Deputy McDowell makes a logical argument and Members find it difficult to respond.</P>
      <P>Deputy McDowell's logic may chill many people both inside and outside this House, but that does not render it invalid or inaccurate.  It is crazy that, if this amendment is not accepted, under the Bill a doctor can be prosecuted and convicted for telling a patient that she would be wise to exercise what, in certain circumstances, is her constitutional right.  If this proposition is examined by the Supreme Court I fail to see how it could be upheld.  I fail to see how a citizen could be convicted for telling another citizen that he or she might be well advised to exercise certain rights which have been found by the Supreme Court to exist under our Constitution. It may be difficult for the Minister and others to leave Deputy McDowell out of this, but that is what they should do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us look at the logic of what he is saying.  That is incontrovertible. There is no point in sweeping this under the carpet with all the things we have sought to sweep under the carpet over the years.  I thought Deputy O'Donnell summed up an aspect of this Bill very well when she said that for <Col N="864" /> years the law sought to intrude itself into the bedroom &mdash; it was slowly and painfully extracted over 15 years.  One of the reasons I am here as a member of an independent party is that I said that the law had no place in the marital bedroom.  That is why I and the two Deputies beside me are here making these arguments.  I was upbraided and derided in those days, in the same way as Deputies McDowell and O'Donnell are today.  Deputy O'Donnell said that for years the law intruded into the marital bedroom.  We finally removed it, but we now have it in the medical surgery &mdash; it is not so much that it is there but that we are trying to put it there.  That is not a reasonable step to take.  It will cause huge angst and hold the country up to ridicule for years to come.</P>
      <P>The Minister and others may be uncomfortable about Deputy McDowell's argument, but they cannot contradict it and, if they cannot contradict it, they had better take it into account and had better not legislate flying in the face of it.  I read a big headline in the papers this morning that this Bill will be referred by the President to the Supreme Court.  If the newspaper reports are correct, she proposes to call a meeting of the Council of State next week &mdash; she has to consult them before she makes a referral under Article 26 and she is not bound by their views.  The President must have made that decision yesterday if it appears in today's papers. She would, therefore, have made the decision even before this House voted on Second Stage.  I do not want to attribute any views to her because I do not know her precise views, but on the basis of the public record it would seem that she has the gravest doubts about the constitutionality of different aspects of the Bill, as I do.</P>

Because of its nature, the approach taken in it, the extraordinarily restrictive attitude of some of it, the anxiety to criminalise even the most innocent and most proper relationships, this Bill must be open to great challenge and must leave in its wake a legacy of litigation and difficulty.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We are dwelling on one point, but there are a couple of points that have not been mentioned.  There is a constitutional right to life of the unborn child and an equal right to life of the mother, and these can be in conflict.  This debate is unbalanced because it does not deal with the constitutional right to life of <Col N="866" /> the unborn child.  I do not advocate that people make Second Stage anti-abortion speeches but, in any legal argument about the regulatory sections of this Bill, it is only fair to take into account that there are circumstances in which there is a conflict of fundamental constitutional rights.  The debate is also proceeding as if there is no statute law and as if, for the first time, I am introducing statute law on the issue of abortion.  The 1861 Act has not been mentioned yet, and that applies to doctors as well as to everybody else.  To talk about the Minister intruding criminality into the doctor-patient relationship for the first time without mentioning the 1861 Act is not the best practice in the debate.  If we are to debate this issue, let us debate the competing constitutional rights to life enshrined in the Constitution, and let us also debate the existing statute law. Then the House will see the difficult task that faces me in bringing forward an information Bill, which does not purport to be anything other than a Bill in accordance with the Freedom of Information (Amendment) 1992 to regulate the manner in which that information would be provided.

      <P>In page 4, subsection (1) (a), to delete lines 25 and 26.</P>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has indicated that he will be prepared either to accept some of the amendments as drafted, to have them amended on the advice of the Attorney General or table his own amendments on Report Stage to meet our desires and wishes.  On amendment No. 4, Members on all sides of the House made the point on Second Stage that the most important step we can take to reduce the number of women who decide when faced with a crisis pregnancy to go to the United Kingdom for an abortion is to ensure that as many as possible can avail of counselling services.  It is important that information should be made available to a woman who finds herself in that situation on a one to one basis.</P>
      <P>People on both sides of the argument, especially those who are pro-choice and, like Deputy McDowell, strongly disagree with this legislation on the basis that it does not go far enough, have stated clearly that it is vital the information and counselling should, so far as possible, be provided by professionals. The Minister's proposal whereby &ldquo;Act information&rdquo; may be provided orally at a meeting to which the public has access, whether on payment or free of charge, is much too wide.  I wish to ask him a number of questions so that he can clarify the matter for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> What constitutes &ldquo;a meeting&rdquo;?  Are we talking about a public meeting attended by several hundred people or by a much smaller number?  Are we talking about confining it to a specific place or area?  Who will give the information at such a meeting?  Will it be given by someone with counselling and professional experience or by someone who has no interest in the use to which the information is put?</P>
    <P>People on both sides of the argument wish to ensure that information is given by qualified professionals only.  I fail to see how we can control the giving of this kind of information if we allow it to be given orally at a public meeting.  This undermines the argument advanced by Members on all sides of the House about the need for counselling.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to limit the debate on this issue.  We all accept it is difficult to have a reasoned debate.  During the course of the debate on Second Stage yesterday tempers became frayed. People hold different views which may be polarised but we should not be apologetic.  This happens in every country in the western world when this issue is debated.  I do not want to limit the debate.  It has to take place at public meetings, in the media and this House.</P>
    <P>I fail to see how we can ensure that &ldquo;Act information&rdquo; will be given by qualified professionals only if it may be given orally at a public meeting.  Perhaps the method proposed in the amendment is not the best way to address the issue but I ask the Minister to explain how the giving of information may be controlled if it may be provided in an uncontrolled way at a public meeting to which everyone will have access, including young children and adults. While I do not want to limit the debate we are undermining the argument advanced by Members on all sides of the House that information and counselling should be provided by professionals only.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Sections 3 to 5, inclusive, regulate the manner in which information may be <Col N="869" /> given.  Section 5 regulates the manner in which information may be provided on a one to one basis by a counsellor, adviser or doctor under certain conditions. Section 4 prohibits the provision of unsolicited information.  In plain language, it bans the provision of information on billboards, in free hand-outs, newspapers and so on.  Section 3 permits solicited information.</P>
      <P>The provisions on counselling provided on a one to one basis are easy to understand.  We are all familiar with the term &ldquo;unsolicited&rdquo; but the meaning of &ldquo;solicited information&rdquo; is not as blindingly obvious as the meaning of the other terms.  The best way to describe it is that it is the opposite of unsolicited information.  In other words, in any case where a choice is exercised the &ldquo;Act information&rdquo;, under section 3, would be legal.  If a woman selects a woman's magazine rather than another, she is exercising a choice.  In that sense she is soliciting particular information.  If the magazine contains an advertisement for an abortion clinic in the United Kingdom she has exercised the choice. When she sees that the magazine contains advertisements of this kind she can buy a different magazine the next time. The same applies to newspapers, periodicals and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is clear that a public meeting, regardless of size, falls into the category of solicited information because a person is free to attend and he or she makes a conscious choice to do so.  The provisions would not allow group counselling about crisis pregnancies.  If a woman indicates that she is pregnant to a person who sets himself up as an adviser or pregnancy counsellor the provisions of section 5 will be triggered.  If a public meeting is held at which men and women are present and there is no indication that the specific purpose is to counsel pregnant women, it is a question of names, addresses and phone numbers being given, people are free to attend such a meeting.  This is analogous to receiving information in a magazine or newspaper which a person is free to buy and should not be prohibited in the <Col N="870" /> manner in which providing information on a billboard or in a free leaflet shoved through the letterbox is prohibited.  That is the reason it is included in one category rather than the other and I would not be prepared to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought for a moment that I was in agreement with Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.  I thought she wanted to scrap the ban on statements made at public meetings.  Her amendment would have that effect with the result that there would be a free for all at which anybody could do anything they wanted.  I thought for a moment she was striking a liberal vein but I now realise that is not the case.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Minister's reply to Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, am I right in thinking that section 3 means that it is an offence to publish orally at a meeting Act information unless it is truthful and objective and not accompanied by any advocacy of abortion?  That seems to me to be the case.  If that is the correct reading of this section, does it mean that if an article in a magazine, whether published in Ireland or in England, which evaluates what happens in clinics is accompanied by any material which advocates abortion, the publication and sale of that magazine in this country is unlawful?  If that is the case what will happen in relation to articles in <i>The Guardian</i> or in English magazines such as <i>Cosmopolitan</i> which might, in the course of an article which was pro-abortion, give details which would amount to Act information if they were given separately? If this Bill comes into effect, will it be an offence for an edition of <i>Cosmopolitan</i> which contains such an article to be sold in this country and can its sale be restrained by injunction?  If that is the meaning of this section, I would be more inclined to go along with Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's amendment and consider deleting the section in its entirety.</P>

I am amending the censorship Acts, in so far as it is necessary, to make the information provided under this Bill legal so that it does not run foul of the censorship Acts.  I am also advised that the general prohibition on advocacy and promotion of abortion must be maintained in law, based on the constitutional position in Article 40.3.3º Irish law could not ignore the requirements of Article 40.3.3º in respect of the life of the unborn child.  I am not doing any of the things suggested by the Deputy.  In fact, I am ensuring that the information which can be made available under this Bill will not run foul of the general prohibition on advocacy and promotion in the censorship Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy can ask if it will be enforced but that is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions, not for me.  Lectures have been given time and again by eminent lawyers to the effect that we should leave these matters to the constitutional officers of the State, that they are matters for the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions and that it is not the responsibility of the Minister to prosecute people.  If the Deputy has a problem he <Col N="873" /> should raise it with the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that it is not so much whether these sanctions are enforced but the defensive behaviour which the threat of such sanctions engenders in various people, including producers of television programmes, newspaper editors, distributors of magazines, etc?  The Minister is being disingenuous when he says that the concerns being expressed here are not relevant or are unsustainable.</P>
      <P>I considered tabling amendments to section 3 but it is so far-reaching, flawed and is such a threat to free speech in a free society that I came to the conclusion, in consultation with many other people, that the section is unamendable and, therefore, should be deleted in its entirety.  As Deputy McDowell said, section 3 restricts the dissemination of &ldquo;Act&rdquo; information.  Act information is any information that is likely to be required by a woman for the purposes of availing herself of abortion services outside the State and which relates to such services or persons who provide it. This Bill restricts the giving to the public of &ldquo;Act&rdquo; information in any form unless that information is truthful, objective and does not advocate or promote abortion.</P>
      <P>In the passing of section 3 we are endorsing censorship which will be very broad-ranging.  It applies to books, journals &mdash; even medical journals &mdash; films, television programmes and public meetings. It will affect journalists, writers, doctors, academics and artists.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a very informative answer.  Does the Minister believe that the decision last year, when the quota was introduced, to refuse 2,334 students the opportunity to pursue a higher diploma course was fair?  Many of those students would have started college on the understanding that they would pursue their undergraduate courses and then go on to complete their higher diploma course, but the arbitrary introduction of a quota has <Col N="876" /> robbed them of that right.  Does the Minister believe she has the right to restrict that career opportunity for students?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not being cautious or careful when I say I received a recommendation on this matter only on 16 February.  I am sure the Deputy is aware I have made dramatic announcements on the numbers of teachers in second level schools which must be taken into consideration.  We must consider the take-up of the transition year. Enrolments for the year 1994-95 amounted to 830, which is a significant reduction on previous years.  Representations were made to me by the Registration Council, the Association of Management of Catholic Schools and the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland to the effect that increasing difficulties were experienced in obtaining substitutes.  Seven hundred extra posts are being made available and there will be concessionary posts, some to cater for increased enrolments and others to maintain the pupil-teacher ratio.  A smaller number of students appears to be registering in the vocational sector.  The numbers expected to take up the transition year are slightly lower than anticipated.  All those considerations must be taken into account before I make a decision on the matter.</P>
      <P>There is an interesting history on the quota system.  To suggest that one would allow students to enter university, even one as important as the Cork university, without the university education department being aware of the quotas is unfair to students and parents. The year before last 1,027 students availed of the higher diploma course while last year 830 students availed of it.  One hundred and eighty five places were made available to graduates in primary teaching.  The total number of teacher training positions available to students last year was 1,015, 12 less than the number available the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must be very careful in making investments, not only in funding but in <Col N="877" /> third level places.  Statistics available from the Higher Education Authority show that only 5.1 per cent of the 755 students graduating from the higher diploma course in 1993 got permanent jobs, 55 per cent took up posts in substitute teaching and 19 per cent got work in areas other than teaching.  In providing for a sufficient number of teaching posts &mdash;generous plans have been spelt out for second level education &mdash; we must be conscious that the number of places available is relevant to requirements.</P>
    <P>New information and indicators are available to me.  The recommendations for the quota is 800.  It was believed that there would be a reduction this year and recommendations were made to close down education departments.  In light of consideration of this matter I reassure students, parents and university education departments that the Department of Education constantly updates its information.  It will make its decision in light of the information received on 16 February 1995.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister believe she has a right to deny career opportunities to students who entered college on the expectation that they would complete their undergraduate degree course and then follow on to the higher diploma course?  The measure was brought in midstream.  Does the Minister agree consultation should have taken place with the students concerned?  Irrespective of the statistics, 2,334 applicants were refused entry to higher diploma courses last year.</P>

The remit of the Higher Education Authority includes advising the Minister on places.

I reassure them I will make available to them the information, properly disseminated by the Department of Education.  I note the point about qualified staff.  The areas of qualification brought to my attention are mainly home economics and woodwork.  A H. Dip is not required in those areas as those teachers are taught in different ways.</P>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point on post-leaving certificate students but the numbers availing of education in the vocational education committee sector are being monitored as I said in my original reply.  The House can be assured that the Department of Education will meet the needs of students and the educational sector but cannot, of course satisfy everyone's wishes.  There are 12 fewer teachers training places available for graduates last year than the previous year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 6, 23 and 102 together.  Third level institutions will receive Exchequer funding to compensate for fee income foregone due to the abolition of fees.  I do not share the fears that universities may have to charge a voluntary contribution to compensate for the abolition of fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have indicated previously that the abolition of fees applies to full-time undergraduate courses only.  The decision applies to fees only and does not extend to educational materials.  It is necessary to adopt this approach because the resources available to fund this measure are limited.  I hope that, as resources become available, it will be possible to abolish fees for night students and part-time students. Students pursuing post-graduate studies are not eligible for free tuition. However, post-graduate students will continue to be eligible for tuition fee and maintenance grants subject to a <Col N="880" /> means test under the third level student support schemes.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to me about the eligibility of students attending courses in certain institutions to avail of the initiative to abolish fees. I am considering these representations at present and will convey my decision in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>As it is the Minister's intention to compensate universities for the loss of fee income would it not be a good idea to tell us how much it will cost?

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>A commitment was given in the budget that undergraduate fees would be abolished and the Exchequer would meet the cost.  The Higher Education Authority will be responsible for the administration of the new scheme and is responsible for the administration of funding to the institutions. It has been agreed to establish a working party under the chairmanship of the Higher Education Authority to <Col N="881" /> include the Department and a committee of heads of Irish universities to flesh out the implementation details.

      <P>Does the Minister accept it was her decision to implement free fees at university level, therefore, it should be her responsibility to ensure there is proper and sufficient funding for the universities?

      <P>It was not my decision but a Government decision announced by the Minister for Finance on the day of his budget.  The Government has given a commitment to recompense the universities for the abolition of third level fees.  The universities are already in receipt of 75 per cent funding from the State and we have not reneged on that.</P>
      <P>It is not a personal commitment but a Government decision and it is being underwritten by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement.  As regards details of its implementation, I do not want to pre-empt the working party.  To suggest that one might palm off work to the Higher Education Authority is not to quite appreciate the responsibility the Higher Education Authority takes on behalf of the Department of Education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will, of course, be aware that in June 1994, the Department of Education commissioned a feasibility study to examine all the options for the provision of a national 50 metre swimming pool complex to cater for the training needs of Ireland's swimmers and for national and international competitions in addition to serving as a community facility.  As the Deputy will be aware the feasibility report was completed in November 1994.  The Dublin International Sports Council's proposals for a 50 metre swimming pool complex are being considered in the context of my Department's examination of the feasibility study.</P>
      <P>The authors of the feasibility study recommend a swimming pool-leisure complex costing an estimated £17 million. Obviously a project of this scale requires very careful and detailed consideration before any decision can be made in the matter in view of the overall capital and operating costs involved.

      <P>It is on my agenda.  There was a proposal for an Olympic 50-metre pool which was knocked on the head in 1991 by the Deputy and Deputy Ahern. A proposal was brought forward to look at the provision of a 50-metre training pool.  A feasibility study was undertaken and there is a proposal costing £17 million. My annual budget is approximately £12 million.  This would be a major project. When I am satisfied that I can go to Cabinet with proposals I will do so.</P>
      <P>The Deputy mentioned the ISHOF proposal and the Dublin Sports Council. I met them once since I became Minister and they made certain proposals.  I asked for further information because the proposals were not sufficiently detailed.  I still await that information.  I had a letter this morning telling me that I would have the details within a short period.  I will re-evaluate the matter when I receive them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the history of this case.  The decision not to proceed with a swimming pool was not taken during my term of office.  If the Minister checks the position he will find that is so.  I was most disappointed that I was not able to proceed further on the feasibility study carried out at the request of the Department during my period in office.  Does the Minister accept the report's conclusions?  ISHOF is awaiting a decision from his Department. This prestigious international organisation has until 17 March to make <Col N="884" /> a decision.  If a decision is not made by then, the organisation will go elsewhere. The matter is urgent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very easy for people to bring forward proposals but my Department must put up the money to fund them.  I received proposals from the Dublin Sports Council and asked it to elaborate on them and cost them.  One of my fears in providing a complex is that we will have an ongoing deficit in the running costs which will be a millstone around the neck of my Department for the foreseeable future.  When a decision is made I want to be aware of the cost implications.  I am awaiting further details from the Sports Council.</P>
      <P>My records show that in late 1993 the proposal for an Olympic-size swimming pool was finally knocked on the head, in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  I am now attempting to put something in its place.  A feasibility study has been carried out and we are proceeding as quickly as we can.  At the end of the day I want to put up a convincing argument&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is the Minister saying he does not accept the feasibility study? All the information he requests is contained in that report.  Regardless of the ISHOF proposal, that report has been available since November 1994.  It needs his attention and support to ensure it is brought forward to Government for a decision as quickly as possible.  In the meantime, what will our international swimmers do?  Can we give them any hope?  The matter has progressed to that level and we are asking the Minister to push it further.</P>

      <P>I hope our swimmers will be successful in the months and years ahead.  I came to office on 22 December and saw the document for the first time in early January.  It is a major document and must be addressed seriously.  Until such time as I am satisfied that the costings and ongoing cost implications are <Col N="885" /> accurate I am not prepared to go to Cabinet with a recommendation.  That is fair and reasonable.  I am pursuing the matter as quickly as I can and am having discussions with the Dublin Sports Council.  They are to come back to me with information.  As soon as I receive it and take other considerations into account I will make a recommendation.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 8, 11, 18, 24, 33, 39, 40, 50 and 75 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume that the intention is to ask me if I intend to second an official from my Department to the Department of <Col N="887" /> Foreign Affairs, for the purpose of taking up a post in the Irish permanent representation to the European Union in Brussels.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies will be aware, Ireland will assume the Presidency of the European Union for the second half of 1996.  I am giving serious consideration to seconding an official from my Department to the permanent representation in Brussels as part of the programme for strengthening the resources of the representation for the Presidency. I expect to take a decision in that regard within the next three months.</P>
    <P>I imagine the Deputies are also raising the more general question of the assignment on a permanent basis of a departmental official to the representation in Brussels.</P>
    <P>To date, I am satisfied that the arrangement in my Department for managing European Union affairs have been satisfactory.  My Department has devoted substantial resources in Dublin to dealing with European Union affairs. Two sections within my Department have direct and immediate responsibility for relations with Europe.  Each is headed by an officer at principal level. Both sections are intimately familiar with European affairs.  Accordingly, I consider that I am well advised on the most effective strategies for Ireland's participation in the European Union. Officers travel to Brussels regularly to participate in and influence discussions and decision making of importance to education.  In addition, officials in the permanent representation already work closely with my Department in advancing this country's educational interests in the European Union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;within the context of the permanent assignment of a departmental official to Brussels?  I take it the Minister is adequately advised?  Would <Col N="888" /> the Minister agree that the permanent assignment of an official of her Department to Brussels would ensure greater input from the Irish side into the formulation of European education policy as, post-Maastricht, that is becoming even more part of the Commission's operations? Given that in excess of £800 million will be allocated to our education system from the ESF and European Regional Development Fund funds it would be justified.  Given the plethora of programmes such as Socrates and Leonardo, would the Minister agree there is a clear need to have such an official based permanently in Brussels to oversee Irish educational interests, be in a position to pre-empt and source the various layers of funding, track the various policy developments and so on within the Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said that I am not sending anyone.  In my reply I indicated we are giving serious consideration to seconding an official from my Department for the duration of our Presidency, in the second half of 1996. We shall be making a decision on that matter within the next three months.  I will inform the Deputy of that decision if he does not table a separate question.</P>
      <P>I might point out to the House that Ireland, even without permanent representation in Brussels, has been very successful in obtaining European funds and that an amount of almost £1,500 million has been secured for education, to be monitored here with regard to its investment.  Furthermore, I might point out that 56 per cent of the European Social Fund is being directed to education and 83 per cent of the European Regional Development Fund is similarly allocated to us, has been earmarked and will be supervised and expended during my period in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a cost factor involved in assigning an official permanently to Brussels.  The estimate I have been given is that it would amount to £100,000 per annum and would have to be met within my Department's administrative budget.  While I do perceive a <Col N="889" /> purpose in assigning an official for the duration of our Presidency, I must carefully consider whether we make that appointment permanent, always being mindful that the various sections of my Department have been very successful in sourcing funding and, second, that it would involve a cost of £100,000.  I owe it to this House, and the education sector, to ascertain if we should make that kind of investment, given the success of our relationship with Brussels, maintained in close liaison with our permanent representative there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Many schools and vocational education committees are endeavouring to establish links with European schools, under various European Commission education programmes. Would the Minister agree that not only would a permanent departmental official assigned there have a role to play in representing Irish educational interests, in terms of making an input into the formulation of European education policy but could also play a very active role in assisting our schools, and the various education committees, avail of the various schemes, develop links and secure funding?  While acknowledging our success in securing funds in the past &mdash; by all Ministers in successive Governments &mdash; is the Government in favour of assigning an official permanently to Brussels?  I take it the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;&mdash; and it would be better if that were said.  The relevant cost, £100,000, would be the equivalent of the alleged cost of refurbishing the Minister's office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome links being established between the Irish educational system and our schools.  Perhaps the Deputy is not aware of how much activity takes place in Marlborough Street, but there is an enormous amount of communication taking place under various programmes.  Funding allocated has to be administered here and in my Department there is an international section and an ESF one.  I told the Deputy that I do not intend to second an official within the next three <Col N="890" /> months but rather that we are considering the secondment of somebody for the duration of our Presidency.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate all officials in my Department who secured European Union funding.  I cannot dismiss the cost factor involved in seconding an official to Brussels. However, it is not the cost factor only, we must remember we are also talking about administrative staff, the work to be undertaken and the relationship between the permanent representation in Brussels, available to all Government Departments, which has been very successful and has secured funding of some £1,500 million.  I want to ensure there are officials here monitoring the spending of those funds in close liaison with the different sections of the European Commission.  I am considering such secondment and will inform the Deputy of the outcome of my deliberations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">

      <P>There was an application for such in 1992, when the Department of Finance refused the permanent assignment of a principal officer.  While I have much information about the history, the answer is that that application was refused early in 1992.  I will be taking a decision with regard to the latter half of 1996.</P>

      <P>A sum of £21 million has been allocated for the primary building programme in 1995.  This provision will be used for major projects, minor and emergency works, the provision of pre-fab classrooms and for the acquisition of sites.</P>
      <P>As well as funding the ongoing programme of school repair and refurbishment the provision will allow the continuation of the special sanitation scheme which was introduced last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not aware there had been a delay; of course, there was a change of Government which delayed many things slightly.  A total of 118 projects are being considered and they fall within different categories of priority.  Priority one refers to essential, very urgent, where the provision of additional places are urgently required or where existing accommodation needs immediate remedial action; priority two is designated as desirable and urgent, which would be serious and acknowledged but not to the same degree as priority one and, priority three, which would be desirable but not urgent.  It <Col N="892" /> will clearly be seen that there are projects allocated under the different ratings of priorities.  Under the primary schools capital programme for 1995 there are other elements, minor and emergency grants in respect of which there is a list, as there is in the case of prefabs, another for acquisitions, which would relate to sites for gael scoileanna, all of which will proceed.  We have undertaken, as I know has the INTO a survey of primary schools, analysis of which is just beginning.  While expressing my thanks to the INTO for undertaking its survey I will await the final outcome of both surveys before publishing lists.</P>

I am committed to inputting the available information.  It is not a simple matter of asking people to fill in forms. When the forms are returned to the Department the information on them has be inputted to make it accessible.  A unit cost study has been carried out on this and when the Deputy receives a copy of it he will realise the information was not made available to the Department in the most accessible manner.  I wish to ensure that such information is made available to the Department and when it is available we will decide what we will do.</P>

I must be satisfied that I am <Col N="894" /> aware of the needs in the school building programme and I asked that a survey be completed.  One had not been undertaken previously.  The survey has been completed and I hope it will give a fair and unbiased account of the state of school buildings.  When it is considered hopefully we will be in a position to plan for the future.  A total of £21 million is available this year to progress the school building project and I understand £27 million was allocated for it last year.  In the last two years there has been an extraordinary increase in the amount of money invested in the primary programmes and the Department has made great inroads in this area.  I am sure the Deputy is aware of projects in this area that were deferred for many years under successive Ministers. If Deputies check the position in their constituencies, they will be satisfied that the increased allocation made available to the primary sector in the past two years was spent in areas of most need.  I will continue to give that programme priority and I will welcome any help members of the Opposition can offer to secure increased funding at the Cabinet table.</P>

      <P>I would be delighted to make the figures available. When I took up office I met many deputations who had met previous Ministers. Fiscal rectitude in the school building programme in 1986 and 1987 resulted in a deterioration of some school buildings. I am satisfied that inroads have been made into the school building programme in the past two years and that will continue to be the case.  When information is accessible from the survey I am sure we will be able to meet the demands of the school communities in priority areas because I am committed to ensuring that not only is the quality of education improved for children in the classroom but the quality of the classrooms will also be improved.  On taking up office I inherited problems of poor school buildings and a sanitation programme one would not export to the Third World.</P>

      <P>The survey was conducted in 1994.  Given the condition of the schools that qualified for funding, there can be little doubt those schools required the most urgent attention. Decisions on school funding are not made solely by the Department of Education in Marlborough Street, but with the co-operation of local school inspectors. Some Deputies have asked me to meet deputations and I have catalogues of photographs showing the horrific conditions of school buildings which have been brought to my attention. Having regard to the factual evidence in this area, the enthusiasm shown by <Col N="896" /> Deputies, the co-operation of local school inspectors and the INTO, I would not say I have misspent money. One or two boards of management around the country have shown a reluctance to apply for funds.  I must be satisfied that it is not just those who shout the loudest that succeed.  Given the condition of the school buildings in which we have invested, I do not believe we have wasted money.</P>

I understand the Minister announced in April last year that a survey would be undertaken and I am sure it will reveal there are appalling conditions in many schools.  We are aware that is the case from the INTO survey. Will she not agree that, bearing that in mind and since less money is available this year in real terms, her priorities are wrong in regard to education?  She has concentrated to some extent on the third level fees element while there is the appalling prospect of children being educated in what can only be described as slums.</P>

Regarding priorities, the cost of meeting the fee element of the free fees proposal, given the abolition of covenants for educational purposes, amounts to a total of £6 million.  We are talking about £21 million.  Sums of £26 million or £27 million last year and £21 million the prevoius year were spent on primary school buildings.  However, I will not be satisfied until I have information from the survey and I am able to inform people in the classroom that their requirements will be met.  I will continue to concentrate resources on the primary sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the pupil-teacher ratio for primary schools has improved substantially in recent years. The recorded pupil-teacher ratio in the 1990-91 school year was 26.6:1.  The ratio for the current school year is 23.4:1 and the projected ratio for September 1995 is 22.9:1.  These improvements have been made possible by retaining teaching posts which would otherwise have been lost because of declining pupil enrolments.</P>
      <P>I propose to continue the policy of improving the pupil-teacher ratio.  I am satisfied that this policy, with the emphasis on targeting resources on disadvantaged schools, represents the best and most equitable use of resources available to me.  The most recent article brought to my attention suggests that money spent on pupil-teacher ratio in the classroom would be better spent on one to one tutoring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio to 15:1 would prevent many of the problems which arise in the national school system?  In some cases children who have literacy problems are not identified until they are in third, fourth, fifth or even sixth class when they should have been identified in infant classes.  It is obvious from those involved in remedial education that a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio to the numbers I suggested, would identify many of those problems quickly and would be of major benefit to the pupils concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the availability of remedial teachers.  The pupil-teacher ratio is arrived at by dividing the total number of pupils enrolled by the number of teachers.  There has been a policy of targeting resources at teachers as they become available and at the 700 teachers who have been retained in the system rather than reducing the class size although the maximum class numbers will be reduced in September to 35. Following the budget announcement no school in a disadvantaged area will have a class bigger than 29 as we will make additional teaching posts available to those schools.  We have made a number of remedial teachers available.  We target resources to tackle illiteracy problems, increase capitation grants, free books, grants to schools, teaching materials, technology and we could target more money towards improving school buildings.  A decision has been taken to reduce class size.  If the trend continues without further intervention the pupil-teacher ratio should be 20.2:1 by the year 2000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">

      <P>That suggestion must be considered.  I have said already that it would be helpful to students experiencing difficulty if they had a good assessment, not only at the end of first class but at the end of fifth class so that their needs could be identified.  We have put more psychologists into the school system because of the difficulty of having children assessed.  Having identified the needs we must satisfy ourselves that we are able to supply the resources to meet their demands.  There is a more detailed question on remedial teaching and there is more information which I will share with the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree there should be an optimum pupil-teacher ratio?  On an international league list showing the ratio of students to teachers we are at the bottom.  From a list which includes North America, the Pacific area, the European Union, other OECD countries and Central and Eastern European States, only Turkey and perhaps Spain, is in a worse position. That should not be allowed to continue. Notwithstanding the improvement we are still at the end of that league and surely there should be more emphasis on reducing that ratio.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would never suggest that I have sufficient resources for the education system.  In allocating increased resources to the educational system one must always give consideration to the way they can best be used. In 1995 the eminent researcher Peter Mortimer, concluded that, having re-examined the evidence he produced in 1994, there was no guarantee that the results of research would favour smaller or larger classes while another eminent researcher, Wendy Berline suggested that the money required to reduce class size could be better spent.  The Deputy has used international comparisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While everyone agrees that increased funding should be made available, we must be satisfied that it will be of benefit to students.  The decisions about targets, the allocation of more resources to certain communities and children and <Col N="901" /> the creation of greater links between parents and schools in some communities are based on up-to-date research. The research being conducted in Drumcondra is constantly available to me.  I hope that before I leave office &mdash; I do not intend to stay that long &mdash; we will no longer be at the bottom of the table with Turkey.  Given the demographic trends in the European Union, it is very easy for countries like Denmark to have a good pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools &mdash; the mortality rate in that country is higher than the birth rate.

It was subsequently announced in the budget that 300 of these posts would be retained within the system.

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not reduced the number of teaching posts.  Rather I have taken demographic trends into account and retained those posts.  If schools lose teachers then clearly there has been a reduction in development in those areas.  The number of children from settled communities in infant classes has dropped within the past five years.  We have retained the teaching posts and reassigned the teachers.  When I took office the average class size was 39 while today it is 35.  That is an indication that the position is improving.</P>
      <P>The costs involved are interesting and it comes down to a matter of choice.  A one unit improvement in the pupil-teacher ratio for primary schools would cost approximately £16 million per annum.  Given our educational system and that our demographic trend is now similar to that in Europe there will be a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio to 18:1 by the year 2005.  However, even at that stage I will not be happy unless additional resources are targeted towards those students who need extra help.</P>

Prevention is normally the best form of cure.  On the morning of the match I stated here that I would deal with three main areas during my term in office and one of these is crowd control and stadia safety.  Since the match in Lansdowne Road, I took a number of initiatives and examined the question of crowd control and stadia safety.  I spoke to my counterpart in Britain because my main concern is to discover how tickets <Col N="905" /> distributed by the English Football Association got into the hands of known hooligans.  I put that question to my English counterpart, but I have not yet received a satisfactory answer.  Also, I visited three stadia in London, namely, Stamford Bridge, Highbury and Upton Park, and noted the security procedures in place prior to games and the arrangements between stewards and police.

If one buys a faulty product or is given a bad meal in a restaurant, one is entitled to a refund.  Why, therefore, is that not possible in this case?

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my extreme disappointment at the decision by Robert Andrews Textiles Limited, the knitwear company in the Sunbeam Industries Group, to proceed with voluntary liquidation which will result in the loss of 108 jobs.  Unfortunately this company has had a history of sustained losses which were compounded by particular difficulties in 1994 and resulted in a loss of £300,000 on a turnover of around £2 million.  This 1994 loss was on top of very heavy losses in each year since the company was formed.  Deputies will appreciate that this is not the strongest platform from which to develop the company.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding this background, on Tuesday night last I gave the House an account of the all-out efforts being made to save this company.  I have to reiterate and emphasise to the House that in recent weeks an enormous amount of time and energy have been spent by me, the Department and Forbairt on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this exercise was to explore all avenues available to secure the company's future.  Over the past few days, I ensured that the efforts of all concerned were intensified in order to support last ditch endeavours to find a commercially viable solution.  It is a matter of great regret to me that such a <Col N="910" /> solution could not be found despite the major efforts.</P>
    <P>However, this must be seen in the context of the history of losses to which I have already referred.  It must be appreciated that a knitwear operation requires large capital investment and significant volumes must be achieved if anything other than marginal returns are to be realised in the long term.  I have directed the State agencies to give the highest priority to the question of finding a replacement industry for the area.  In view of the urgency of the situation, I had a meeting late last night with the chief executive of Forbairt on his return from Cork with a view to accelerating endeavours to secure the maximum number of jobs in a replacement industry.  I have also had discussions with the chief executive of IDA Ireland.</P>
    <P>There can be little argument about the level of State support for Sunbeam over the years.  Forbairt has provided every possible assistance to the company in its efforts to develop, including executive time, consultants and finance. Discussions are currently ongoing between Forbairt and outside investors and the company with a view to ensuring the future viability of its remaining operations.  I am most anxious to ensure that any adverse comment arising from the problems of the knitwear company should not jeopardise these ongoing discussions. There will be no let up in the ongoing efforts to secure a viable future for the remaining Sunbeam operations. Although the closure of the knitwear company is a huge disappointment, Forbairt is now actively seeking to ensure that the remaining companies can be maintained as strong commercially sound operations with maximum employment content.</P>
    <P>I have been open and frank with all Oireachtas Members representing the area.  In addition to putting all the facts before the House, I have also briefed them on the situation at a separate meeting in my Department.  I ask for their continuing support for the efforts <Col N="911" /> to secure further employment for the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure I speak for all parties when I say that the Minister has our support.  However, good intentions are not enough.  Clearly there are questions to be answered and we will use this opportunity to get answers and, hopefully, be able to guarantee the viability of the company.</P>
      <P>What grants were put into this composite Sunbeam firm in recent years and for what objectives was the finance given?  Did the company fulfil the criteria for getting grants when it spent the money?  I base my questions on remarks reported in a reputable newspaper by both management and unions to the effect that the shortfall was £300,000 which seems very little &mdash; shared out among the number of jobs in question, it is about £3,000 a job which is way below the cost of a new job &mdash; and the company was unable to fill vacancies.  I find that extremely odd and would be glad of an answer to that.  It was also said that the company was not competitive because of the lack of capital moneys to put to machinery.  However, I understand a capital grant was given to fund the purchase of machinery.  I would be glad if the Minister would address those issues.  The shortfall for a management buy-out is £300,000.  The sum of £3,000 seems a small amount per job if there could be a hope of keeping them.</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary that in a constituency with three Government Ministers from three different parties the silence is deafening, except on the part of the Minister whom I thank for coming here today.  The silence of the Government as a whole on this matter is deafening, particularly the silence of Democratic Left who have been so vocal on so many issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Rourke genuinely wants answers but it is difficult to provide them if I am continually interupted.  State grants to this industry were substantial. As can be seen from newspaper reports, £500,000 was provided for the knitwear section in return for preferential shares while additional sums were provided for the other sections.  During the past four years well over £2.5 million has been provided by way of grants.  When money was provided last year it did not take the form of capital grants for investment in machinery or equipment; it was to be used primarily to tackle the liquidity difficulties being encountered at the time and to allow the company increase sales and achieve the gross margins it hoped to achieve.  It did not achieve its aims in that it did not secure those margins or the projected volume of business.  It suffered greater losses than the previous year.</P>
      <P>The argument that all that was needed to secure a viable commercial future for the company was £300,000 is without foundation.  The difficulties facing the company were serious.  The management buy-out team, which I met with other Deputies, presented a proposal to Forbairt and spent several hours yesterday discussing it.  Both sides agreed that it did not have the basis to secure a viable commercial future for the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also raised the question of the inability of the company to recruit staff.  Although my Department <Col N="913" /> would not be directly involved I know the company were depending on the recruitment of an additional 50 staff but was unable to recruit them.  As a result it had to ship some of its product for expensive processing.  This certainly contributed to their serious losses last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need for me to remind the Minister that this industry is located in an unemployment black spot.  When did it become evident to State agencies that the management buy-out proposal was not strong enough?  What efforts were then made by those agencies to seek an alternative investor or to put an alternative funding package in place bearing in mind that the company has a strong customer base, orders on the order book to the value of £2.8 million and an excellent workforce?  The Government has done far too little far too late.  It is clear from what was said in my presence at a management-Government meeting this week that it was obvious as early as last November that the company would find itself in difficulty and was facing big trouble.  What measures were taken at that time to resolve those difficulties and avert the closure of the plant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Forbairt and the State agencies have been intimately involved with this company in an attempt to turn around a difficult situation.  This business has suffered substantial losses for four successive years.  Last year a substantial amount of money was invested to tackle its liquidity problems.  Because of the seasonal nature of its sales it requires substantial amounts of working capital.  The State provided this money but the company did not succeed in meeting its targets in terms of its margins and volume of sales.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The management buy-out proposal only surfaced in mid-February.  When consultants were appointed by Forbairt to assess this proposal and other issues it became evident that it did not meet the funding requirements to secure a <Col N="914" /> viable long term future for the company. Alternative buyers for the knitwear section were pursued, unfortunately without success.  We are still working vigorously to find alternative buyers for the remaining sections of the business and we will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>It is not a question of far too little far too late.  The Deputy does no credit to the briefings we have had if she suggests that is the case.  The record is clear: during the past four years Forbairt and the State agencies made great efforts and provided money to secure a long term future for the company and to secure employment.  It is disappointing that we have not been to do this but it has not been for the want of trying.</P>

Has the Minister had direct contact with the owners of the plant in Cork?  When interviewed on radio today some of the workers were very critical of the Minister in terms of his lack of involvement and commitment to resolving this serious problem in view of the fact that 110 jobs will be lost tomorrow.  By contrast the Minister and Minister of State were highly involved in efforts to resolve a recent dispute in Dublin for which we pay tribute to them.  Such a commitment has been lacking in relation to the dispute at Sunbeam.  The workers at that company and the people living in Cork city, particularly on the north side, feel that they have been let down in view of the fact that 110 people will be without employment tomorrow. In some instances they are the only members of their families in employment. Has the Minister had direct contact with the owners of the plant in keeping with the assurance he gave during the course of the Adjournment Debate on 16 February?</P>

The State also appointed consultants to assist in putting a viability package together to secure employment. I met the management buy-out team at its request and that of Deputies.

      <P>On my initiative and at their request I have been in daily contact with the chief executive and other executives of Forbairt.  I have enlisted the support of the job protection unit of my Department to work on this project. Last night I spoke to the chief executive of Forbairt to see how we could advance in seeking a replacement industry.  I spoke to the chairman of Forbairt after the meeting, which Deputy Wallace attended, at which the management buy-out proposal was discussed in an <Col N="916" /> endeavour to tackle the remaining issues.  These include the lack of adequate funding for the management buy-out proposal and the lack of access to the machinery and equipment belonging to the former owners.  As a result of those contacts, all those issues were fully explored by agencies working on my behalf.  Unfortunately, at the end of the day &mdash; and it was a long day and night of work &mdash; the team representing the management buy-out and Forbairt were forced to the reluctant conclusion that there was no basis for a commercially viable future for the employees in what was being put forward.  That is a matter of deep disappointment to me but I assure the Deputy that no effort has been spared on my part or on the part of those who work on my behalf to secure the future of these jobs.  I assure the Deputy also that I will continue to do that and that this issue is not lost. There are remaining parts of this company the future of which we are straining to secure.

We all expected those Ministers to meet with the management and the owners of Sunbeam in an effort to ensure this labour-intensive industry in Cork was saved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that £500,000 worth of preference shares was taken out and that £2.5 million of State money was invested in the company.  Is the Minister satisfied with the level of vigilance undertaken by the State agency?  Is he happy with the management structure of the company over the past number of years which has brought us to this sad day?  The Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, entered into discussions in Tallaght to resolve the difficulties of the industry there.  I ask them to go to Cork and discuss with the <Col N="920" /> owners of Sunbeam the real dilemma facing the workers there, most of whom are the only breadwinners in their families.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the break we were discussing my proposal to delete section 3 on the grounds that the section outlines the conditions governing the giving of Act information at meetings or in publications.  I expressed concern that the section as it stands severely restricts freedom of expression.  Article 19 of the Declaration of Human Rights, to which the State is a party, states:</P>
      <P>Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Convention on Human <Col N="992" /> Rights (1950), to which Ireland is also a signatory, provides guarantees in Article 10 of the right to freedom of expression&mdash;</P>
    <P>this right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority, and regardless of frontiers.</P>
    <P>I believe in those declarations.  Freedom of expression and the right to hold opinions and diverse views on any issue is very important in a democracy. Sections 3 and 4 deal with restrictions on freedom of expression.  Section 4 prohibits the giving of abortion information on billboards and via mailshots. That is perhaps the only section I wholeheartedly endorse.  I do not agree, and I believe the public in general would not agree, to the use of billboards to advocate abortion.  Section 3 prohibits the publication of any form of Act information.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>My amendment seeks to delete the section entirely.  Section 3 prohibits the publication of any form of Act information unless it is truthful and objective and does not advocate or promote abortion.  It is an offence to sell or offer for sale any form of publication which contains the prohibited information. This means that foreign newspapers containing the prohibited information could be banned and newsagents that stock them could be committing a criminal offence.  Literary agents and sales people from foreign publishing houses who come here to sell to Irish <Col N="993" /> book sellers books containing the prohibited information could be committing a criminal offence.  Issues of medical journals such as the <i>Lancet</i>, women's magazines and so on &mdash; the list is endless &mdash; may be banned.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated that the criminal sanctions will not be enforced, that this will be a decision for the office of the DPP.  I accept the DPP is an independent officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I did not say they will not be enforced.  I said I will not be responsible for enforcing them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I correct my statement. Of course this should be a matter for the DPP as an independent officer. Criminal sanctions will engender self-censorship and defensive behaviour &mdash; that is what I am referring to in terms of restrictions to freedom of expression. Some time ago Easons refused to import an issue of <i>The Guardian</i> which contained information of the sort prohibited in this Bill.  It is noteworthy that it did so even though at that time the only remedy against it was an injunction, not criminal sanction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Bill is passed, as is likely, the practice of defensive self-censorship will increase.  Any foreign newspaper or magazine that carries a feature on abortion and includes names and addresses is liable not to be imported because newsagents and other distributors will not want to run the risk of being prosecuted or injuncted.  The position will be similar in the case of a television debate on Channel 4 or BBC on which both sides of the argument on abortion, the pro-choice and the pro-life, are discussed. In a free society both sides of the argument should be freely debated. If in the course of advocating a pro-choice view a person on a BBC debating panel give &ldquo;Act&rdquo; information, refers to a clinic or address in England and advocates the promotion of abortion in certain circumstances, or even along the lines of the pro-choice group, that <Col N="994" /> would constitute an offence under this Bill if it is broadcast or reproduced in a newpaper here.</P>
    <P>This section is deeply flawed.  When the Minister responded on section 12 of the Censorship Act as it applies to section 3 I did not understand his argument. Did he mean that section 3 is an enabling section rather than a prohibitive section?  It is deeply regressive and repressive of expression.  Espousing a liberal viewpoint and endorsing the right to freedom of expression on this side of the House appears today to be quite a lonely job.  I feel like I am speaking from an empty grandstand when I am expressing these views.  I got no indication from the Minister of any recognition of these rights of expression.  I would like the Minister to respond to the arguments I made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is prohibiting this information from being published on billboards and from being distributed in an unsolicited way through mail-shots, etc.  Presumably, one of the reasons for that is that there is no point in the unnecessary proliferation of this information.  Yet, at the same time the Minister is allowing people to organise public meetings at which the information will be available free of charge.  It seems to me that there is a distinction between a situation where a person goes to a supermarket or shop and exercises a choice to purchase a magazine in which they know that information is contained, and where somebody goes to a meeting where they know there is going to be a charge, and, on the other hand, going to a meeting where they know the information is going to be available free of charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is as aware as I am that if a public meeting is advertised for a hall in Limerick, when this legislation becomes law, in such a way that there will be a £5 charge for admission, then the people who go to that meeting will be exercising a choice, they want the information.  I take the Minister's point in that regard.  However, if the meeting is advertised and admission is free, the <Col N="995" /> Minister knows that there will be many people who will not be able to resist the temptation to get something for nothing.  They may not immediately require the information but they may go to the meeting on the basis that while they may not need the information then they might need it sometime in the future.</P>
    <P>I find it hard to resist the logic of some of what Deputy O'Donnell said on newspaper advertising and TV programmes. Deputy O'Donnell was correct in saying that the implementation of this will be impossible.  The Minister's only response was to throw his hands in the air and say it is a matter for the DPP and the Garda but we have to bear in mind that the Garda and the DPP do not operate in a vacuum.  Their job is to enforce the laws which we pass.  If we pass laws which are unenforceable it seems to me to be, at the very least, disingenuous of the Minister who is promoting those laws to throw his hands in the air and say that it is a matter for the DPP.  It is like a hypothetical situation of a Minister for Justice announcing in the House that he or she is introducing legislation to make it a criminal offence for anybody in the country not to be, let us say, asleep by midnight and when the Opposition point out that that is unenforceable the Minister would say that enforcement was a matter for the DPP and the Garda, and leave it to them.</P>
    <P>That is a dishonest and disingenuous approach.  We promoted legislation here, which was supported by all sides, allowing people the right to travel, not because we thought it was good or desirable that people should go abroad to avail of the termination option, but because it was simply impractical to stop them.  The courts recognised, and it was implicit in the various judgments, that at some time somebody could have been injuncted even subsequent to the Supreme Court decision in the X case. Everybody recognised, sensibly, that it was impracticable to police the airports and ports to stop people leaving the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="996" /> On the one hand we were changing the law because it was impracticable to implement it and now we are passing laws which will be unenforceable.  Our only answer &mdash; we should have a better one &mdash; is to pass laws even though we know they will be impossible to implement and leave them to the people who are charged with implementing them.  I must confess that I find that approach quite difficult to understand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I would find that approach very difficult to understand as well if anybody was proposing it.  The position is that when the amendment was put to the people in 1992 all general information about abortion was legal.  There was no problem with having debates about abortion or people arguing their case up, down, over and back.  We heard enough of that argument throughout the 1980s and there was never a suggestion that either side of the argument could not conduct full freedom of speech in accordance with any charter of rights produced.  In 1992 an extension to that was voted by the people.  In other words, there was additionality.  The Censorship of Publications Acts would prohibit, in my view, some of the additionality and we are looking at what is being provided in this legislation under statute law.</P>
      <P>I would draw Deputies' attention to the first sentence of section 3 which refers to &ldquo;Act information&rdquo;.  It does not refer to information so there is no prohibition on information.  All information was free up to that.  &ldquo;Act information&rdquo; is very narrowly defined and what we are really talking about in this section is how &ldquo;Act information&rdquo;, where there is an element of choice being exercised by the person who gets it, shall be available to members of the public.  Names, addresses and phone numbers of a hospital or clinic in England which would carry out a termination of pregnancy, are available in advertisements in a newspaper whether it comes from outside the jurisdiction or locally.  That is additional, under statute law, to what the position was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="997" /> Section 3 (1) (a) (II) states:</P>
    <P>the information is truthful and objective and does not advocate or promote, and is not accompanied by any advocacy or promotion of, the termination of pregnancy.</P>
    <P>I think that is reasonable if it is presented just as information, not as advocacy or promotion.  More important, any provision in law which omitted that would not be vindicating the right of the unborn under Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution, because general legal provisions which would allow the advocacy or promotion of abortion in the jurisdiction would certainly not be vindicating the right of the unborn and would be running counter to that.  That is why that provision has been included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The person sitting at home in his or her livingroom who does not like what is on Channel Four can change channels. That is why I am saying it is solicited information.  We cannot pass a Bill that will prohibit what is transmitted on Channel Four.  On the other hand, if we are talking about RTE, I am not putting radio and television broadcasting into section 4, I am putting it into section 3 and, in reality, that will be caught by the broadcasting code which is voluntary at the moment.  For example, under their code RTE or the local stations will not broadcast advertisements about clinical testing for pregnancy or the availability of particular types of contraceptives.  I presume that they will regulate the way in which the information can be provided under their own code also.  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is working at present to put the code on a statutory basis and I would <Col N="998" /> presume that that will extend to RTE carrying advertisements about clinics in the United Kingdom.  I will be advocating that course but I am not prepared to put the provisions relating to broadcasting, whether it is sound or vision, into section 4 because if I do it will have the exact affect which Deputy O'Donnell suggested.  For example, a woman being interviewed by Marian Finucane in a radio discussion may say she had an abortion, which she would be entitled to do, and all of a sudden, may inadvertently or deliberately say she had an abortion in such a place in Sheffield.  If this provision were in section 4, she would have committed an illegal act and as the Deputy rightly points out, that measure would be impossible to enforce because when words are transmitted over the airwaves they cannot be called back.  By putting it in section 3, the broadcasting code will restrict the deliberate advertising of such information in the same way it restricts the deliberate advertising of clinical pregnancy testing and the sale of contraceptive devices.  At the same time because of section 3, it will not preclude the giving of Act information in discussion.  It dovetails with the censorship Acts.  There is a general prohibition in the censorship Acts in providing the type of information that will be legal under this Bill when enacted.  Under this Bill we will be providing additional information which is illegal at present under the censorship Acts.  The censorship Acts will have to be amended so that the information is legal and the section amending them is doing so in so far as is necessary to make this information legal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite clearly there is a fudge between the divisions.  For example, if one is listening to local radio and Act information comes over the airwaves, in one way it is solicited but one has the choice of changing channels or switching it off. That is not quite the same as a billboard that one has to pass every day on the way to work.  Similarly if the advertisement is in <i>The Irish Times</i> and one does not like it one can choose to buy the <i>Irish Independent</i> or the <i>Irish Press.</i> It is <Col N="999" /> easy to see that that is a solicited information but it is not clear-cut in terms of definition in the broadcasting area.  It would not be right to say that this was unsolicited information.  It would create major difficulties to take Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's amendments on board because Act information would come out in the context of a broadcast which would be illegal under section 4. This could not be sustained.  The Deputy is right in saying that a Minister who would state it was up to the DPP to enforce it would be in a ludicrous position.</P>
    <P>To reply to Deputy O'Dea's point, if you wander into a public meeting in a hotel, you have exercised a choice although it is not the same as buying a magazine.  Whether one pays at the door is irrelevant.  You maintain that choice if you stay inside while the Act information is being provided or you can exercise the choice to get up and walk out.  No one is compelling you to stay.  It is much better to have this position in section 3 because if it was in section 4 it would be a very strong intrusion on civil rights.</P>
    <P>Information is being provided in three ways: one to one, and most Second Stage speeches concentrated on this.  People voted in the referendum of 1992 for additionality, that is names and addresses, telephone numbers and perhaps fax numbers of clinics, principally in the United Kingdom.  They can be advertised here in the same way as in the United Kingdom, provided the services are legal, truthful, objective and do not advocate abortion.  Instead of censorship it is legislation which enables, for the first time, this information to be provided under Statutes and the necessary amendments are being made to the censorship Acts to bring this about.</P>

      <P>There was no personal animus in what I said this morning but I have a strong and passionate animus in relation to the Bill almost from cover to cover, with the exception of section 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1000" /> It seems the Minister is arguing that section 3 does not introduce a new concept into law.  He said before lunch &mdash; and he rocked me back on my heels when he told me that I should go off and check my sources, which I did &mdash; that it was an offence in any event to advocate abortion.  when I looked at the censorship Acts, in particular the 1946 Act, I discovered it was not an offence to write a book that advocates abortion.  The Censorship of Publications Board can prohibit a book written by me advocating abortion and in those circumstances when it is prohibited if somebody brings it into the country or sells it that becomes an offence.  It is not, as I understand it, an offence for me to stand up at a public meeting and say: &ldquo;I favour abortion&rdquo;&mdash; which I do not in the sense I am using it but if a pro-choice person were to stand up at a public meeting, it is not an offence for that person to adovcate abortion in Ireland.  Nor is it an offence for that person in the course of a speech advocating abortion to mention <i>en passant</i>&mdash; or frequently &mdash; what is termed Act information.  Therefore, I have come to the conclusion that this is the first occasion on which it will become an offence to advocate abortion orally at a public meeting and in the same speech to convey any Act information.  That is my understanding of section 3 and I do not regard it, as the Minister seems to do, as an enabling section to make something which was otherwise a crime not a crime.  I believe the opposite applies, that it is not an offence to make a general speech in favour of abortion.</P>
    <P>Looking at the 1861 Act in that context, it might be an offence to aid and abet, to counsel or procure a particular act of abortion but it would not be an offence under the 1861 Act to state that you generally favour abortion in certain circumstances and in that context to impart Act information.  If somebody held the view that all rape victims should have a right to abortion, that person could stand up at a public meeting and say so.  That would not be an <Col N="1001" /> offence under any statute I know of.  If that person in the course of the speech were to recite the names of ten abortion clinics in London where the service in question could be availed of, it would not, as the law stands, be an offence because it would not amount to an incitement to a particular person to have an abortion.  To advocate something in general does not amount to incitement to a particular offence.</P>
    <P>We are dealing with freedom of expression.  People are entitled to have different views on the question of abortion and to make speeches at public meetings on it.  I do not see any reason for convicting them of a criminal offence because, in the course of a speech advocating abortion to a group, perhaps none of whom is pregnant or is ever likely to want an abortion, they imparted Act information.</P>
    <P>My second point relates to newspapers and periodicals.  If there is an article in &ldquo;Cosmopolitan&rdquo; advocating abortion, under the Censorship of Publications Act, 1946 that periodical can be referred to the board who can decide whether to ban the magazine for six months or a year.  However, it is not obliged to do so.  The same applies to a newspaper.  It is not necessary to criminalise someone in Ireland who sells &ldquo;Cosmopolitan&rdquo; which contains an article advocating abortion and also contains Act information nor is it necessary to do so in order to vindicate the right to life of the unborn.</P>
    <P>Most Irish mothers-to-be are capable of deciding whether to proceed with their pregnancies.  That they can pick up a copy of &ldquo;Cosmopolitan&rdquo; in their newsagents containing an article advocating abortion and telling them where to go for one, would not affect the vast majority of them.  It comes down to a question of proportionality.  Do we want want to criminalise an article which might affect one individual who happend to be undecided or do we want to say this is something which in all practicality we cannot do anything about?  If &ldquo;Cosmopolitan&rdquo; runs such articles Irish <Col N="1002" /> people may read them.  The simple commonsense approach to the issue is to say there will be Act information available and it will sometimes be accompanied, particularly in foreign publications, by material which might be seen as advocating abortion but, as a matter of practicality, we cannot criminalise its importation into Ireland.</P>
    <P>That is a reasonable point and deserves consideration.  If &ldquo;Time Out&rdquo; or some of these trendy magazines in England run a series on the issue do we want to criminalise the sale of these in Ireland?  We do not.  If one of the more exotic channels on ITN decides to interview someone who advocates abortion, for example, the director of the Marie Stopes Clinic or whoever and she gives details of the service offered, it is not the end of the world as far as the Irish are concerned.  The unborn Irish are not put in danger by the fact that such material is available either in &ldquo;Cosmopolitian&rdquo; or on Channel 4.</P>
    <P>Easons, a distributor in Ireland of English newspapers, withdrew <i>The Guardian</i> one day because of material it contained.  It was afraid of being injuncted.  I ask the Minister to distinguish between what is theoretical and practical.  He will not save the life of one unborn child by criminalising the importation of magazines or television broadcasts.</P>
    <P>If he believes television broadcasts are covered by a voluntary code of conduct, what is the point of having a provision in section 3 making it unlawful to publish &ldquo;Act information&rdquo; unless it is truthful, objective and not accompanied by any advocacy of abortion?  What television station will that cover if not RTE?  It will cover BBC or some other channel which is not bound by his voluntary code of conduct.  I cannot see how it will have any practical effect.</P>

What is the Minister's response to that?  The Minister stated that information should be truthful and objective in section 3.  What does he means by &ldquo;objective&rdquo; and what are the criteria for determining the objectivity of a presentation?</P>

      <P>The Minister said a person can turn off the television or walk past an advertisement. There is no element of counselling in an advertisement.  An innocent mother-to-be walking down the street wondering what she will or will not do about her predicament may read an advertisement on the side of the road and accept what it says as the proper advice.  She may go ahead and have an abortion.  There are laws governing advertising.  Take cigarettes, for example.  They must carry a Government health warning otherwise the advertisements break the law.  There is no such curtailment on abortion advertisements.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Sections 3 and 4 deal with &ldquo;Act information&rdquo; being provided to everyone who buys a newspaper or whatever. Section 5 is triggered when the information is sought by a pregnant woman. They are totally different situations. Deputy Hilliard asked if there was a section which compelled people to counsel in a particular direction.  Under section 5, if a woman indicates to her doctor that she is pregnant and the topic of abortion is introduced he can opt out completely or he can decide to advise her on all the options.  If she indicates she is pregnant to an organisation such as CURA there can be directive counselling if it is directed away from the <Col N="1004" /> option of abortion.  Whoever the adviser is, he cannot advise towards the option of abortion but can give names and addresses.  I have been criticised about this.  Every newspaper one picks up states one can be directive one way but not the other way.  The reason for that is the competing right to life.  To allow advice to be directive towards abortion would, in many circumstances, unless it was a case along the lines argued by Deputy McDowell this morning, not vindicate the right to life of the unborn child.  It is extremely difficult and a question of balancing conflicting rights.</P>
      <P>It is argued that there is a hierarchy of rights.  The right to life, for example, is higher up the ladder than the right to free speech but we cannot put the right to life of an unborn child and the right to life of the mother on a scale of rights because they both have a right to life. Article 40.3.3º did not attempt to adjudicate between them.  It states &ldquo;the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother&rdquo;.  It puts them on the same level. The X case decided that in circumstances where there was a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother, the mother's right to life was superior to the right to life of the unborn child, so that the mother could have a termination in this jurisdiction.  Apart from the light thrown on this issue by the X case, the difficulty is that we are not sure how a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother would be adjudicated on in any particular pregnancy.  That was the fine line walked by the people who drafted the Bill in accordance with the policy outlined by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not making a political point, but I say to Deputy Michael McDowell that his colleagues, Deputy Molloy and Deputy O'Malley, in particular, who served on the sub-committee, faced the same difficulties because these sections are based on the heads which were agreed and forwarded by the Cabinet sub-committee, which consisted of Deputy O'Malley, Dr. John O'Connell and Mr. Pádraig Flynn.  They arranged <Col N="1005" /> this framework so that there would be one-to-one information and unsolicited and solicited information.  Later sections of the Bill were found necessary and those heads did not go to Government. The bulk of the framework of the Bill was based on those heads.  There is no attempt to restrict freedom of speech, but there is a problem in how Act information arising from the 1992 amendment is regulated.  The then Government in its wisdom said it would be regulated in this way; there would be solicited and unsolicited information and person-to-person information. Commitments were given in the Dáil to do it this way.</P>
    <P>One could argue that radio and television should be left out completely.  If I left radio and television out of section 3 completely, someone would argue that it should be inserted in section 4 or that it might be caught by the provisions of section 4.  I am putting it in section 3 in the knowledge that it will be covered by the broadcasting code, but conscious of the fact that there will be general discussions on abortion on radio and television where Act information would be given either inadvertently or advertently. I do not want to prohibit such discussion and I do not want the rúille búille which would start if someone said there was a major transgression of section 4 on Marian Finucane's show.  I do not want such hassle and that is why I am doing it this way.  I am walking a fine line and I will not accept these amendments because these provisions are better where they are.</P>

      <P>I have spent time trying to consider the conditions covering <Col N="1006" /> the lawfulness of publishing and procuring the publication of Act information. This is a complex area.  The Minister has indicated his desire not to over-restrict but to insert radio and television in section 3 rather than section 4.  When commenting on earlier amendments, the Minister indicated he was trying to deal with the additional information allowed as a result of the 1992 amendment.  He said that general information was allowed before 1992.</P>
      <P>People do not want books withdrawn from libraries or pages taken out of magazines.  Is the Minister confident that this section will not create those situations again?  The people made a clear decision in 1992 that they did not want to go into libraries and find they could not read certain books.  We do not want to rule out more papers, magazines and television programmes.  Everyone would agree that these areas, which are covered in section 4, are inappropriate. Can the Minister reassure me that this will not become a picking ground for the pro-life groups who have shown their assiduity and interest in pursuing individuals, publications and groups? Will the Minister ensure that we will not open these doors again and call into question publications and television programmes as sources of information in a way he does not anticipate, instead of dealing with this issue in a way which responds to the constitutional obligations arising from the 1992 amendment and the decision of the people?</P>

      <P>I do not want to rehash our discussion this morning and I accept the Minister's stated intention <Col N="1008" /> to consult the Attorney General again as to whether the facts and the law arising from the X case are adequately reflected in this Bill.  I am trenchantly of the view that is not so and that this Bill, in so far as it attempts to ignore the finding of the Supreme Court in the X case, is unconstitutional.  I am not worried about section 5 (b) but I am concerned with section 5 (a), which reads:</P>
      <P>Where a person to whom section 5 applies is requested, by or on behalf of an individual woman who indicates or on whose behalf it is indicated that she is or may be pregnant, to give information, advice or counselling in relation to her particular circumstances having regard to the fact that it is indicated by or on her behalf that she is or may be pregnant&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) it shall not be lawful for the person or the employer or principal of the person to advocate or promote the termination of pregnancy to the woman or to any person on her behalf, </P>
      <P>That brings us to the same question I raised this morning.  If a woman goes to a doctor in circumstances where she is entitled lawfully to have an abortion, section 5 (a) directly prohibits a doctor from advising her to avail of her constitutional rights to have an abortion in those limited circumstances.  Without raking over the coals of this morning, I reiterate as strongly as I can, my utter conviction that any Bill which attempts to prohibit a doctor from advocating to a patient in those circumstances that she should do what she is lawfully entitled to do to preserve her own life is manifestly unconstitutional.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this section and I will argue that section 6 contains provisions which are in direct conflict with EU law.  It provides, in effect, that no person or body who has any interest, direct or indirect, in any body which provides abortion services abroad may give abortion information to a woman.</P>
      <P>In the case of SPUC <i>v.</i> Grogan the European Court of Justice ruled on the validity of the injunction having regard to the provisions of the Treaty of Rome. The High Court in Ireland had referred the question under Article 177 of the Treaty.  The question asked in the reference was whether legal abortion constituted a service within Article 60 of the Treaty and whether it was lawful for the State to prohibit the distribution of information in relation to persons providing the service of abortion in other member states.  The court held that legal abortion constituted a service but that since the students in question had no economic links with the abortion clinics in England and the clinics were not involved in the distribution of information the Irish prohibition on abortion information was not unlawful.  That case is directly relevant to this section because the section files in the face of the decision of the European Court of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The logical corollary of the finding of the European Court of Justice in the Grogan case is that if the clinics had such an involvement or if such an economic link existed with the distributors of the information the injunctions would not have been lawful.  This section <Col N="1012" /> specifically targets an economic link or a financial or other interest between the information provider and the service provider and makes that unlawful.  It files in the face of the European Court decision in the Grogan case.  It is also specifically aimed at the Irish Family Planning Association, the Well Woman Clinic and Open Door.  It appears to be almost vindictive in that it targets those organisations which are providing the service at present.  Even if the injunction is lifted when the Well Woman and Open Door case comes to court, this section will slam the lid down again.  If this section passes we are on an inevitable journey back to the European Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill is also probably contrary to EU law but we have no objection to it since it would be repugnant if abortion referral were to become a business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It relates to the argument I am making.  At present the Irish Family Planning Association is a charity.  It has a link with the British Pregnancy Advisory Service.  That link has existed since 1992.  The association has been referring Irish women for assessment to the British Pregnancy Advisory Service for the past two years. This section is targeted at a charitable organisation which has been providing comprehensive family planning services and non-directive comprehensive counselling services for Irish women, the former services for the last 20 years and the latter services for the last two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section is particularly vindictive. I tried to see how an organisation such as the Irish Family Planning Association could be excluded from its provisions.  I considered accepting section 6 if it excluded a charitable organisation. However, the terms of section 6 refer not only to an economic link but to any interest, indirect or otherwise.  I could not, therefore, put down an amendment to this section without colluding in the <Col N="1013" /> flaw that is part and parcel of the section.  I came to the conclusion that the only way I could address my objections to the section and to the fact that it flies in the face of European Union law in relation to the free movement of services between members states was to propose the deletion of the section.</P>

Perhaps the Attorney General's advice would clarify whether she has to vote against the section.  There is a view that this section might conflict with European Union treaties relating to the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services, particularly Article 58 and, perhaps, Articles 52 and 59.  It would be helpful if we could have the Attorney General's advice.  It would be nonsense to include this section in the Bill in the absolute knowledge that it will be found to be in contravention of the Treaty.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I will give the Attorney General's advice as I have it.  The main purpose of the Bill is to impose conditions on the freedom to obtain or make available in the State information relating to abortion services lawfully available in other states, which freedom is provided for by the 1992 constitutional amendment.  There is a common agreement that that is the position. The amendment gives the State the right to impose such conditions because that is included in the text of the amendment. The Bill also provides for restrictions in section 8 in the making of abortion appointments and the making of arrangements from this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case C159/90 SPUC <i>v.</i> Grogan on 4 October 1991 the European Court <Col N="1014" /> of Justice ruled that a medical termination of pregnancy performed in accordance with the law of the state in which it is carried out constitutes a service within the meaning of the EC treaty provisions on freedom to provide services in the Community.  In accordance with other European Court decisions this means, on the face of it, that women in one member state are entitled to go to another member state and have an abortion in that member state, that she is entitled to obtain in her own country such information as she requires for this purpose and that the Government and Legislature of her own country may not lawfully prevent her from doing this. However, the European Court of Justice has laid down in various judgements over the years that member states retain under the EC treaty a right to impose appropriate restrictions on freedom to provide and avail of services where this is justified in the public interest.</P>
    <P>In order to benefit from this exception the national legislation in question must be designed to protect the public interest in a manner which would be recognised as legitimate by European Community law, must be appropriate for this purpose and must be unduly or unnecessarily restrictive.  Even though Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution in its original form has been amended by the 1992 referenda in so far as it concerns travel and information, it is considered that the legitimacy in European Union law of the pro-life ethic of the Irish Constitution will still be recognised by the European Court and that restrictions on giving of abortion information of the kind contained in the Bill and restrictions on abortion appointments and making of arrangements, etc. for which the Bill provides would be accepted by the European Court as legitimate and reasonable.</P>
    <P>This derives support not only from the opinion of the Advocate General in the Grogan case in which the position of Article 40.3.3º in its original form in relation to EU law was fully analysed, but also from Protocol No. 17 to the Maastricht Treaty as interpreted by the <Col N="1015" /> subsequent Solemn Declaration adopted by the member states.</P>
    <P>It goes on to say that if this was challenged, the opening position might be that under Articles 59 and 60 of the Treaty of Rome it might not be seen as a service in the accepted sense because the EU in the first instance is a common market.  If there was not a protectionist effect on commercial interests then the idea of a service might not come under the provisions of Articles 59 and 60.  I am not over stressing that but mentioning it as another nugget of information. The position in ordinary terms is that, on the face of it, the termination of a pregnancy is a commercial service within EU law and a citizen in one member state is entitled to avail of a service in another member state.  Consequently, a woman is entitled to avail of a termination of pregnancy in the UK, if that is the net point.</P>
    <P>However, these rights can be restricted in the interests of public policy.  If it is the public policy of the Republic of Ireland that the right to life of the unborn would be protected under Article 40.3.3º &mdash; although that would be somewhat restricted by the amendments made in 1992 &mdash; that statement of public policy, in the context of the pro-life ethic of the Irish Constitution, would be a defence which would be accepted by the European courts.  There would be no compulsion on the Government to not implement or strike down these provisions.  This is reinforced by Protocal No. 17 to the Maastricht Treaty as subsequently interpreted by the Solemn Declaration adopted by the member states.</P>
    <P>That is the case for, and I am quite aware that it is possible to state a case against, but that is what lawyers are for.</P>

      <P>Arising out of that, it is noteworthy that Protocol No. 17 to the Maastricht Treaty provides that &ldquo;Nothing in the Treaty on European Union or in the Treaties establishing the European Communities, or in the Treaties or Acts modifying or supplementing those Treaties, shall affect the application in Ireland of Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution of Ireland&rdquo;.  The Solemn Declaration, to which the Minister referred, states in part that:</P>
      <P>The high contracting parties give the following legal interpretation: that it was and is their intention that the Protocol shall not limit freedom either to travel between member states or, in accordance with conditions which may be laid down in conformity with Community law by Irish legislation, to obtain or make available in Ireland information relating to services lawfully available in member states.</P>
      <P>The crux issue is whether it is in conformity with Community law to prohibit any body engaged in the provision of termination facilities outside the State to be in any way involved in the counselling process within the State.  It is hard at this stage to imagine which principles of EU law would have to be conformed with in that case.</P>
      <P>It strikes me that if the students in the Grogan case were denied relief by the European Court of Justice precisely because they had no financial connection with the clinic whose services they were advertising, it seems that, at any rate, there is some kind of <i>prima facie</i> implication that if there were such a link the Grogan case might have been decided differently.  If that is the case, there is an obvious danger that the European Court of Justice will become involved in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that one could put money on either side of the <Col N="1017" /> argument.  However, it is relevant to note that whatever principle of law we establish to delimit freedom of information must be consonant with EU law. The only principle which we have laid down in sections 6 and 7 is that the bodies in question must have no direct or indirect connection with a body which is perfectly lawful in the UK, for example.</P>
    <P>It seems, on the face of it, that there is a strong argument to be made that the principles of EU law would not differentiate between bodies which provide services outside the State for the termination of pregnancies and bodies which might do so inside the State where the termination was lawful.  The European Court of Justice would frown on a distinction which solely centred around the location of the body's activities and which failed to make a similar prohibition on a body in Ireland offering a legal termination service in Ireland to a woman who was entitled under the Constitution to have her pregnancy terminated for the reasons set out in the X case.</P>
    <P>I note what the Minister said but there is a strong argument that the present wording of sections 6 and 7 is discriminatory in a way which is prohibited by EU law because it is based entirely on the domicile, as it were, of the service and nothing else.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 6, before section 7, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>7.&mdash;Nothing in this Act shall be construed as obliging any person to take part in the provision of any service or the giving of any information, or the sale or importation into the State or display of any article, which entails the supply of Act information.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In moving this amendment, I am conscious that the Minister said the opt out clause, or the scope for conscientious objection, has already been implicitly included in the Bill.  However, I have received considerable representations from members of the medical profession who are concerned that in the Health (Amendment) (Family Planning) Act, 1979 we were prepared explicitly to provide a conscientious objection clause in a section of the legislation.  It needs to be explicitly stated in this Bill.  The Minister said at the conclusion of Second Stage that he would look favourably on such an amendment.  I hope he is prepared to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, in <Col N="1019" /> requesting the Minister to insert a conscience or opt out clause in the Bill.  As the Deputy said, there is concern among professionals, particularly medical professionals. Recently, in an article in <i>The Irish Times,</i> Mr. Kieran Conway reported on a new book, <i>Irish Medical Law.</i> One of the points he made was that in the continuing absence of legislation, should a doctor decline a termination in circumstances analogous to the X case, he could well be liable for any ill effects arising during the pregnancy.</P>
      <P>This would be a matter of concern to all doctors and, in my capacity as a doctor, I am concerned that there is not a conscience clause in the Bill.  I accept the Minister told the House that there was no need for such a clause, but that is not sufficient.  If a doctor were to refuse to advise a woman or provide names and addresses, he could find himself in difficulty.  If an action were taken against the doctor, no one knows what exact result would emerge.</P>
      <P>Last week, I cited a letter from a young lady GP.  She has just returned from working in England and is working in this country.  She referred to the fact that there is an opt out clause in the British abortion Act and that her position was always respected.  She stated in the letter that she hoped this would be incorporated into Irish law, so that GPs would not be coerced into information referral.  This morning, I received a letter from a consultant obstetrician. Obviously, this type of consultant would be involved in the main under the terms of the Bill.  In the first paragraph he states:</P>
      <P>I am concerned that should the proposed legislation re: abortion information be passed, that members of the medical profession would be coerced to act against their conscience in the long term and even in the short term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious there is a widespread view among a large section of the medical profession that there should be a section in the Bill which would allow them to <Col N="1020" /> opt out if they have a conscientious objection.  I also point out to the Minister the position of other professionals involved in counselling who might have a conscientious objection.  Staff working with a doctor, for example, a secretary or a nurse in a GP's surgery, might not want to give out the names and addresses of abortion clinics in Britain if a doctor had these on a printed list. They might have a conscientious objection to handling that type of information. This is legitimate because there are people in the country who are conscientious objectors.  We must respect their views.  As a doctor, I have a conscientious objection to giving a woman any advice which would assist her in having an abortion.  I have that problem and I admit it.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, referred to the fact that a conscience clause was inserted in the 1979 Act.  This Act dealt with family planning, which we all support, and section 11 recognises conscientious objections by anybody who would be involved in the provision of such a service.  People have the right in law to opt out and this is explicitly stated in the Act.  It is even more important that this is explicitly stated in this legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the British abortion Act of 1967 is explicit in providing for conscientious objections.  Section 4 states:</P>
    <P>Subject to subsection (2) of this section, no person shall be under any duty, whether by contract or by any statutory or other legal requirement, to participate in any treatment authorised by this Act to which he has a conscientious objection.</P>
    <P>It goes on to state that in the event of any legal proceeding the burden of proof of conscientious objection shall rest on the person claiming to rely on it. If somebody has a conscientious objection, this should be provided for explicitly in the Bill.  The Minister stated that in his view there was nothing in the Bill which would oblige a professional to participate in implementing the Bill in any way.  However, it is necessary to <Col N="1021" /> insert a conscience clause, which would not change the Bill in any way.  This would satisfy professionals, who have a problem and a conscientious objection. It would satisfy them if it were explicit in the Bill that they would not be liable to litigation proceedings if they refused to provide information or names and addresses of abortion clinics to any person who might request them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in the comments made about the amendment and the reasons for it.  There may be a necessity to state positively in the Bill that no doctor should be forced to become involved in non-directive counselling against his or her conscience, although nowhere in the Bill is any doctor required to become so involved.</P>
      <P>However, as the previous speaker mentioned, a case could arise in an employment situation, for example, where a young doctor is employed by a big practice.  It may be usual in that practice to provide such non-directive counselling and the young doctor may feel in conscience that he does not want to become involved in that type of counselling or advice.  As a result of a refusal to become involved, on the grounds of conscience, such a doctor may be demoted or dismissed.</P>
      <P>There may be a case to provide protection for such a doctor because he would perhaps be unfairly dimissed if, by virtue of his conscience, he decided he could not become involved in such a service.  The Bill does not force anybody in this regard but there is a case to be made.  It would not harm the Bill to provide a positive statement on the right to conscientiously object.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another possibility arises in that a girl or a woman might go to a surgery and request counselling or seek the advice of a doctor.  If the doctor had a conscientious objection to this service, he or she might say: &ldquo;I do not deal with that type of work.  I am in conscience saying that I cannot give that advice or even discuss this whole area of abortion&rdquo;.  If that woman, in despair, committed suicide as a result of being rejected by the doctor's <Col N="1022" /> surgery, the doctor might seek protection from any liability under the Bill for personal injury or death arising from his refusal to give such abortion information counselling.  For that reason, to safeguard those doctors who have a concern and in conscience feel that they should not be obliged and should have some specific protection enshrined in this Bill, there is a case to be made for the insertion of such an amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's amendment.  I also support what both the Deputy and Deputy O'Hanlon have said.  The Minister has said that this is already implicit in the legislation.  I take it from that that he agrees with it, otherwise he would have changed the legislation so that it was no longer implicit.  If that is the case, it would be safer to spell it out explicitly. As Deputy O'Hanlon and Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn said, it is already contained in the 1979 Act dealing with family planning.</P>
      <P>Some doctors have made representations to me stating their concern about the question of civil liability if they refuse to give the requisite counselling and the woman's health or life is affected. That is not an academic point but a genuine concern.  There are a number of genuine people who are seriously worried about the lack of an explicit conscience clause in this legislation.  Deputy O'Donnell has rightly raised the case of the consequences for the employment of somebody who objects to this in conscience and is employed in a practice where it is usually carried out.</P>
      <P>No damage would be done to the Bill if this amendment was accepted.  The Minister says that it is already implicit in the Bill, which means that he agrees with it.  Since this is the case, it would be better, safer and more reassuring to those who have genuine concerns in this area to spell it out explicity.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment and I concur with the points made by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and Deputy O'Hanlon.  I also agree with the <Col N="1023" /> last case Deputy O'Donnell cited.  It could easily happen that if a girl, in desperation, went to a doctor and that doctor felt he was not able because of his objection in this area to discuss this subject, it would be extremely detrimental for that doctor if anything unfortunate was to happen to that girl.  Some protection should be given to them. While I accept the Minister's statement that it is implicit in the legislation, it would be far better to make it explicit so that at least those people who have a conscientious objection would know that they are protected under this legislation in regard to any unfortunate situations that might occur as a result of their objections to the implementation of this legislation.</P>
      <P>I exhort the Minister to take this amendment on board.  I know the Minister has, in various statements before in this House, indicated that he would not be adverse to this type of amendment.  I urge him to look positively at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with all that I have heard up to now.  It struck me that there was nothing in the Bill which could possibly be pointed to as conferring an obligation on somebody to impart Act information to another person in defiance of that person's own wishes.  After listening to Deputy O'Donnell's points on the possibility of a doctor being employed by another doctor and being told that &ldquo;That is the routine in this practice.  You must do it and if you do not do it in my practice, you can pack your bags now and go&rdquo;, it suddenly occurred to me that by making this lawful, it might be argued that it was lawful for the owner of a medical practice to direct his subordinate doctors to furnish Act information and that it would be a breach of their contract with him to disobey his instructions in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also goes wider than that.  What about people who do not print material of this kind?  Is anybody obliged to take material from other people?  Is a newspaper obliged to take an advertisement <Col N="1024" /> for which it is precontracted?  Can it say no when it sees the actual substance of the advertisement?  Are print workers obliged to print cards for this kind of material against their conscience?</P>
    <P>It might be better to adopt the phraseology that Deputy O'Hanlon was using and establish that no person is under any duty, in any circumstances or walk of life, to provide or participate on the provision of Act information against their lawful conscience.  It could possibly cover a wider range than doctors; it could well include people like receptionists, print workers, newspaper providers, newsagents or others.  If we make exceptions for medical practitioners, which, as Deputy O'Donnell's example show, is not a fanciful exception, perhaps this protection should generally apply across the community.  Since we know from this debate that there are people with deep feelings on this issue, no Irish citizen should be under any duty to participate, either contractually or otherwise, in the dissemination of Act information to any other person.</P>

      <P>I would not like it to be taken, from what Deputy McDowell said, that we were in any way trying to confine that opt out clause to medical people.  We are leaving this provision as wide as possible to include anybody who might have a conscientious objection to taking part in the provision of any such information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not have to be a provision in the Act, it might be a direction from an employer to &ldquo;Do this, hand out this card etc.&rdquo;.  The Act may not create any obligation &mdash; the Minister will probably say this &mdash; but one might well have somebody conducting a business, a practice, a printing concern or journal who would direct their employees to put such information into a publication.  The Act may not require the person to do it, but the employer's instruction may.  The Minister should think positively along the lines of Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's provision saying that somebody is never obliged, as a matter of contract or other <Col N="1025" /> law, to participate in the provision of Act information.</P>

      <P>From what Deputy McDowell said, it also strikes me that if there was an advertisement being aired by RTE or any of the radio stations as a result of this Act, some people within those organisations might have an objection to it.  It could even cause difficulties in an organisation like RTE.  I accept the Minister's statement that the section is not only restricted to doctors, but we have to be conscious &mdash; the Minister may have something to say on it when replying &mdash; in regard to the extension of this provision, not only to doctors, counsellors and those involved in printing but also to the publication of information of this sort on television or radio which could cause difficulties for those working there.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to advertising and the code of practice RTE has as regards the material it can put on air. There could be difficulties within an organisation as big as RTE and some of the national radio stations in regard to the publication under this Act.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This is not the only law that will be on the Statute Book; we cannot do everything in it. If it is widened too far and goes outside the scope of persons under the Act, we may be opening up a whole new front. What would happen if a printer and his employees, for example, were intimidated by one of the extremist organisation to exercise a conscience clause under the Act?  This is a new issue brought up by Deputy McDowell which has widened this.  I will think about it overnight and take advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issue raised by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's amendment, as everybody who contributed said, there is no compellability in the Bill to give Act information.  It stands to reason that if a doctor has a conscientious objection to giving Act information he could not be compelled to do so.  This is <Col N="1026" /> more evident in the case of organisations like CURA or LIFE.  It would be ludicrous to compel counsellors, for example, in CURA to give Act information, names and addresses of abortion clinics in the UK, when the nature of its activities is the exact opposite. Everybody agrees with that.  This has become an issue because of the discussion and I see merit in providing an explicit provision so the Bill will be more easily understood and people will not be burdened with the notion that they might have an obligation which in conscience they cannot fulfil.</P>
    <P>I reject the suggestion that a conscience clause should be enshrined to enable doctors to opt out of their constitutional obligations to give medical records or notes of medical records to women going abroad.  That is a constitutional entitlement of a patient.  In this case, it would run from the travel amendment, the information amendment and the unenumerated right to bodily integrity.  There are no circumstances in which I would entertain that type of opt clause as it would not be constitutional.</P>
    <P>The form of words proposed by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn were used in the 1979 Health (Family Planning) Act. I am disposed towards the principle of the amendment.  I will either come back tomorrow on Report Stage with the same form of words as those proposed by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn or an alternative form of words which achieve the same end on the advice of the parliamentary draftsman and the Attorney General's office.</P>

      <P>In the example put forward by me where a woman in desperation went to a doctor who in conscience found he could not involve himself in non directive counselling or any counselling on abortion and she then committed suicide or damaged herself, we seemed to be concerned about the doctor, but it would be a tragedy for the woman if that happened because of the refusal of the doctor to treat her.  When the Minister is looking at this perhaps <Col N="1027" /> he might consider placing an onus on a doctor who has a conscientious objection to giving counselling so that he will have a corollary duty to refer the woman to another doctor rather than saying he will not give information because of the conscience clause.  As a doctor he has a duty to see that she is directed to another doctor who may not have a conscientious objection.  That should be noted otherwise the assumption might be that we are more worried about the doctor than the distraught woman.</P>

      <P>I agree with the Minister that a patient has a right to medical records.  As I said on Second Stage, I have no problem with the provision of medical records for a patient.  It would be wrong and unfair to oblige a doctor with a conscientious objection to refer the patient to another doctor as the conscientious objection is to assisting a person in any way to procure an abortion. If a person has a conscientious objection, it must be respected and he is right not to participate in any way.  A doctor in a practice who would not assist a person, but would send her to doctor A or B for assistance would probably been seen as hypocritical.  One must have the right not to participate in something which in conscience one believes one should not do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not argue with you, but I fail to see how either Deputy O'Donnell's amendment or mine places an extra charge on the Exchequer.  Amendment No. 12 appears long and complicated because it is trying to achieve what Members on both sides of the House, those pro and anti the Bill, said on research, education, comprehensive family planning services and counselling.  No statutory effect is given to them in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1030" /> I appreciate that the Minister favours doing this and he seemed to indicate on Second Stage that he would include this in future legislation.  Like other Members, I am concerned about the number of women who find it necessary to go abroad to have abortions.  We do not have exact numbers or data on this and we do little research at Government or Departmental level in this regard.</P>
    <P>I spoke to pro choice organisations which have limited data available which they have no difficulty in providing to the Minister and his Department should he request it.  They are willing to co-operate in any research or education which the Minister might propose.  Like us all, they believe it necessary to educate men and women at an early age through the stay safe programme in schools, a sex education programme and at a later stage the provision of a comprehensive family planning service. These are vitally important if, as we all wish, the number of Irish women going abroad for terminations is to to be reduced.</P>
    <P>In framing this amendment I have been careful to stay away from the invasion of privacy of individual women. It is important not to turn away even the small number of women who go to various agencies or to members of the medical profession for counselling We must encourage more and more because, as the Minister said in answer to a parliamentary question tabled by Deputy O'Donnell, only a tiny minority of the 4,000 women who went abroad last year for terminations had any counselling beforehand.</P>
    <P>We know from the agencies that those who have counselling often opt to continue the pregnancy and keep the baby or give the baby up for adoption. We want to encourage that.  We want to make all of the information available and ensure that it is easily accessible to all the women.</P>
    <P>At the same time, we want to ensure that the data which can be collected and made available to the Department leads the Department and the Minister to conduct research into the reasons <Col N="1031" /> women opt for termination.  In turn, the results of that research would, I hope, help the Minister in putting together guidelines for each of the health boards on comprehensive family planning services.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Hanlon said, we are all in favour of comprehensive family planning services.  However, because the provision of these services is not mandatory and are provided through the health boards they are different in virtually each health board area.  One can get good comprehensive services which are easily accessible in urban areas but one cannot get the same access or the same comprehensive service in many rural areas.</P>
    <P>In a reply to a parliamentary question last week the Minister indicated that many of the women who went abroad for terminations of pregnancies came from rural Ireland.  There is a message in that for all of us.  I feel strongly &mdash; I hope the Minister would agree &mdash; that it is only by the Department of Health and the Minister laying down specific guidelines on what is meant by comprehensive family planning services, with, of course, an input from the health boards, that we will get the comprehensive family planning service we all would like.</P>
    <P>I hope State-sponsored and supported comprehensive counselling services will go hand in hand with a comprehensive family planning service.  On Second Stage I said that many people have enough convictions but not enough data; that we are in the classic position of, &ldquo;do not bother me with the facts because I have already made up my mind&rdquo;.  We need, above all, to know the facts on this issue.  We are all agreed, whether we are pro-choice or pro-life, whether we want to give women directive or non-directive counselling, that what we want to see is a reduction in the number of women going abroad for terminations.</P>
    <P>With regard to research I wish to make some specific points that may be helpful to the Minister and his officials.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1032" /> There is a high prevalence of emotional trauma following abortion and in any research prior to the introduction of a State supported counselling service it is important to seek information on emotional trauma.  Several aspects of the emotional complications women suffer post abortion have been identified by research experts.  The most immediate reaction is one of grief.  Most women describe distress for a few weeks similar to the normal grieving process after any loss.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Sitting suspended at 6.15 p.m. and resumed at 7 p.m.</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been talking about the research that needs to be undertaken into the emotional trauma suffered by women following abortion.  I talked about the various aspects of the emotional complications, the most immediate reaction being one of grief, that most women manifest short-lived distress for a few weeks similar to the normal grieving process after any loss.  All of us can identify with that emotion, all of us having suffered grief of one type or another because of the loss of a loved one, but anger is particularly prominent within this group, usually directed at the person who referred them for the abortion or who performed the operation.</P>
      <P>The second aspect of the problem lies in coming to terms with the specific aspects of the pregnancy loss.  These are uncommonly reported because, unfortunately, many women are afraid or are encouraged to ignore those feelings. Questions are raised by them in relation to all aspects such as what the baby might have looked like had they carried it to full term.  I am told they often avoid passing baby shops, watching programmes on television related to babies and so on.  I suppose those kinds of feelings tend to intensify at what would have been the normal time for delivery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That brings me to the third and most serious aspect of post-abortion trauma. <Col N="1033" /> Follow-up studies are difficult to conduct on this group of women.  As the Minister has said and as the various organisations involved have told us, up to 50 per cent of these women do not return for follow-up appointments. Therefore, the figures are the minimum rather than the maximum but approximately 10 per cent of women develop depressive disorders in the three months following an abortion &mdash; that is the minimum figure &mdash; very similar to the prevalence of post-natal depression which requires treatment, sometimes hospitalisation and which in some cases. may persist.  In others the illness is precipitated by a subsequent pregnancy: indeed a prior abortion is one of the risk factors for depression in pregnancy.</P>
    <P>All of us here would agree that women should have the information available to them in relation to all of these complications.  A further reason for research into the psychological complications of abortion being made available is that Irish women, indeed many women, are vulnerable to serious psychiatric complications post-abortion. We do not have any of that type of information, data or research which would be helpful to the Minister or his Department in arranging for the provision of the information, on the comprehensive family planning services or in helping to formulate policy for the Minister's colleague in the Department of Education, either for inclusion in the stay safe programme or in its continuation into a comprehensive sex education programme in schools.  I am aware that many people are very opposed to those programmes whereas I am strongly in favour of them.  Perhaps, like the Minister, that comes from having been a former teacher, when we all discover during the course of that career, when we discuss aspects of sex education, very few children get the kind of basic information one would expect in their own homes.  Sometimes I think parents have genuine difficulty in relating this kind of information to their children.  Therefore, the school must act as a type of support system in providing <Col N="1034" /> this type of educational programme but, in order to do so, we must undertake research, investigate the background and have factual information in order to formulate the programmes.</P>
    <P>When responding I hope the Minister will be able to indicate support for the proposition I am making in this amendment. Obviously I would be very anxious that it be incorporated either in the form, as drafted, or in a more concise form since we have now discovered that the Minister only can propose amendments that would place a cost on the Exchequer.  If there is a more succinct way of expressing what we want &mdash; I imagine Deputy O'Donnell would agree with me &mdash; that is, incorporating research into education and the provision of the counselling, which has been ruled out of order, into this Bill, I would be in favour of doing it that way. If the Minister can put forward a very strong argument to justify why he cannot incorporate it in this Bill, explaining why, in some way, it may not be appropriate, I will have to listen to that argument very carefully but, as of now, I am very anxious that he accept my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. I contend that research in this area would constitute a key tool to enable policy-making be properly grounded.  For example, it would be very useful had we adequate research carried out into the profile of Irish women, so many of whom travel to England for pregnancy termination, thus enabling us to target resources and policy making are particular groups.  I believe that some of the studies referred to on Second Stage demonstrate that a little over half of the women involved are under 24 years of age.  If would be useful if we could target specific age groups in our policy-making in regard to counselling services and post-termination counselling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment affords us an opportunity of looking at the women behind the statistics, the very high figures we have discussed.  For example, within the <Col N="1035" /> ten years since the 1983 constitutional amendment was passed an average of 5,000 women per annum, giving a total for that period of 50,000, have had abortions, representing a large sector who may be listening to this debate or reading about it in the newspapers.  It is very important that that sector and the issues seen from their perspective be addressed here in a very compassionate manner.  Unfortunately, the debate has polarised and the old absolutes have been resurrected.  Its important that their perspective and tragedy is addressed in this House and this amendment affords us that opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Irish Family Planning Association carried out research on this subject and Catherine Conlon, who has an MA in women's studies, in her thesis profiled a sample of 231 women who attended the IFPA centre in Synge Street in the first 12 months of its pregnancy counselling service from October 1992.  She profiled their background, their decision on whether to have an abortion, their acceptance of post-abortion medical care and their elective use of post-abortion counselling.  I understand that is unique and valuable research.  It related to the wellbeing of women following an abortion or, as Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn stated, their condition of &ldquo;not being very well&rdquo;, as is often the case.</P>
    <P>Of the 231 women who sought pregnancy counselling, 193 chose abortion. The research provides an interesting breakdown of information under various headings including which part of the country they came from, their age profile and occupations.  Of the 231 women six were at school, 31 at college, one was on a FÁS scheme, 18 were alone mothers and 41 were housewives. Those abortion figures reveal that it is not always the classic profile of a single young woman who has an abortion, the reality is that we must accept that many married women choose to have an abortion. The detailed analysis and breakdown of this category of 231 women is useful.  The research also refers to the <Col N="1036" /> costs involved which vary from £100 to £500 and that is a factor we must address.</P>
    <P>One of the key findings of that survey was the degree of isolation experienced by those women who travelled to Britain for an abortion.  A total of 69, or 30 per cent of those surveyed, had not told anybody of their pregnancy and of that number 19 stated they had definitely decided not to tell anybody.  The experience of those 69 women can only have been one of intense loneliness and isolation.  Such information which could flow from research would be useful to Members and to the Minister and officials in his Department when targeting resources and trying to reduce the number of women who decide to make that terrible choice.  Many women do not express regret following an abortion, but I am sure all women who have one have a sense of regret.  Some recover more easily than others because of their personalities.</P>
    <P>Of the women surveyed, 75, or 38 per cent returned to the IFPA for counselling. That figure emphasises that where pregnant women are exposed to a sympathetic environment at the start of their pregnancy and offered continuity of care they will opt to return to where they were counselled for medical and psychological aftercare.  For that reason I warmly welcome this amendment and I encourage the Minister to respond to it generously.</P>
    <P>As the Minister ruled out the suggestion by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and I that counselling, contraception and general family planning services should be provided on a statutory basis on the basis that that would place a charge on the Exchequer, I hope the Minister will address this issue.  In his Second Stage speech the Minister indicated that he had allocated £200,000 to improve such services and I hope even more will be forthcoming.  I am sure no party in this House would object to an amendment to the Finance Bill along those lines.  I support the amendment and congratulate Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn for tabling it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank Deputies Geoghegan-Quinn and O'Donnell for debating these issues. The debates on this amendment might be more productive in reducing the number of abortions than the debate heretofore.  On Second Stage I gave a number of commitments.  One was to provide for significant research to ascertain why so many Irish women travel abroad to have a termination of pregnancy and also to discover why so many Irish women have unwanted pregnancies in the first instance.</P>
      <P>As we move from an authoritarian type society, aspects of which we have seen during the course of this debate, some people are left with a vacuum in their lives.  If people are used to authority and being instructed on what to do, they do not know what to do when that authority is no longer there.  The only way to fill the vacuum is to ensure that through our education system and society people become fully autonomous individuals, in control of their personal lives and make the necessary decisions to ensure that is the case.</P>
      <P>As the authority with which this generation and former generations were familiar wanes, it is not appropriate that it be replaced by a total fecklessness where people do not take responsibility for their lives.  That is particularly true in respect of family planning.  Through a combination of carelessness and alcohol, both on the part of women and men, unwanted children are often conceived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment raises a wider issue to which I will refer later.  In other west European societies people appear to be more in control of their destinies, prepared to take responsibility for their lives and are not always looking to third parties, such as the law, the Church, guards and teachers, to make decisions for them.  That is missing in our society. In that respect I have given a commitment to provide for research in this area.  Perhaps the ERSI, the health promotion section of the Department or a university with the necessary resources would carry out research to ascertain <Col N="1038" /> why so many Irish women have crisis pregnancies in the first instance and why so many of them end in an abortion. Such research could ascertain what procedures or facilities can be put in place which would result in the number of crisis pregnancies being reduced? Obviously a researcher would need access to information from agencies both in the United Kingdom and Irish organisations, such as LIFE, CURA, Cherish, Irish Family Planning, Medical Services, the Well Woman Centre which I hope would be given freely and openly.  I can give an assurance that no confidential information will be revealed.</P>
    <P>I am committed, like Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and Deputy O'Donnell, to a full family planning service here.  It is possible to argue that as the contraceptive pill is the only contraceptive available on the GMS, there is a serious lack in facilities available.  I take Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's point that the availability of family planning is uneven throughout the health boards, not only in isolated and remote area but even in large centres of population, depending on the ethos of local health board managers. I would like to remedy this.</P>
    <P>My objective is to have an all inclusive family planning service suitable to the needs of women available throughout the country in a manner which would be standardised either by directive or regulation from the Minister for Health so that the same level of accessibility and range of services is available to women in every part of the country. I am not making this commitment in the way they are sometimes made in politics to a sound principle by someone who does nothing about it.  I hope to make progress in this area shortly.  I will not force my own views on individual health boards in the first instance, I will issue guidelines and allow time for consultation. Following a couple of month's consultation when health board members have had an opportunity to comment on my proposals I will issue guidelines which will make it mandatory <Col N="1039" /> on health boards to provide the type of family planning service we require.</P>
    <P>On the issue of counselling I am committed to a sum, in the first instance, of £200,000 this year as against £70,000 being spent through the health boards. I am open to advice from Deputies on how best it should be spent.  I do not need to amend the Finance Bill, or the allocation for health boards.  I have retained some discretionary spending for the remainder of the year and I will be able to allocate money for this purpose. The commitment to £200,000 is the first allocation.</P>
    <P>On the wider issue of counselling, I do not know the views of Deputies on standards, whether a code of counselling should be drawn up, whether there should be a single approach to training counsellors or whether it should be approached from a number of different agencies' positions where there would be various methods and practices rather than a standardised practice across the country.  I am subject to advice on that.</P>
    <P>I am in full agreement with the line of argument pursued by Deputies Geoghegan-Quinn and O'Donnell in respect of research on family planning and counselling.  My only difficulty is that I do not consider the Bill an appropriate vehicle in which to include an amendment to cover the items suggested. Maybe counselling should be put on a statutory basis.  If so, a general health Bill would be the place for it.  I will be introducing a general health Bill in the autumn and under its general sections I will consider whether it would be appropriate to put counselling on a statutory basis.  It may not, I have not decided the principle yet.  If it is appropriate, it may be possible to do so by way of statutory regulation rather than by primary legislation.  I give a commitment to have the matter examined.  I know the Deputy will return to the matter by way of parliamentary question, debate on the Health Estimate or wherever the opportunity arises.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1040" /> I will have research carried out but I need some weeks in which to tease out the position with whatever agency will be involved.  I do not want to be tied by Statute to terms of reference.  I take the spirit of what has been offered here as a good guideline and I do not have a difficulty with it.</P>
    <P>We already have family planning Acts.  It will be possible for me to extend the scope of family planning under the GMS by ministerial directive rather than enshrine it in primary legislation by way of amendment here.  I can meet the policy objectives of Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn in practically all respects but I cannot enshrine it here by way of amendment.  If that satisfies the Deputy we can return to these issues again and I shall keep her fully informed of progress.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy O'Donnell for her strong support for the amendment.  I also thank the Minister whose response has been helpful.  Naturally I am disappointed it is not possible to accept it either in part or in total in this legislation but I accept the Minister's bona fides when he says he already has a commitment to research.  One or more of the three ways in which he said it could be collated through the health promotion unit, the ESRI or one of the universities would be acceptable.  It is important that it is started and completed as quickly as possible.  As Deputy O'Donnell rightly said we need that research to provide the background for policy in the Minister's Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased at the Minister's commitment to an all inclusive family planning service and I am pleased he is prepared to make the guidelines to health boards mandatory.  That is very important.  The point I made initially, which was followed through by Deputy O'Donnell and reinforced by the Minister, is that we have a patchy service which is subject to the whims of members of parties who are members of health boards or of administrative staff in health boards.  That is not the way it <Col N="1041" /> should be because, at the end of the day, women do not get the service.  I am pleased the Minister can issue those guidelines either by directive or by regulation under the family planning Acts.  It is right to allow health boards time to comment and make suggestions.  I would not like the Minister to say he would issue the guidelines and that in six months' time they could come back to him.  I would like it confined to a specific period, two months would be acceptable.</P>
    <P>In regard to counselling, I am pleased the Minister said the £200,000 is a first allocation.  It is important to establish the standards of counselling available in different agencies and how, through his Department, there might be a single approach, whether it should be standardised and, if so, in what way. While we are talking about counselling for women in crisis pregnancies and post-abortion counselling it might be a good idea to extend it to include counselling in the addiction areas as the service is patchy and does not have specific standards attached.  There are good agencies and excellent counsellors at work in the whole addiction area as in the crisis pregnancy, post-abortion and family planning areas but it is not an all inclusive service, obviously because they are constrained by a lack of funding. During my Second Stage contribution I said counselling should be fully State supported if possible and available on a widespread basis.</P>
    <P>In relation to counselling &mdash; perhaps this could be done in conjunction with the Minister for Education &mdash; I would like the Minister to look at the various medical faculties of our universities who now have included, as part of the curriculum, education in communications because it is an important area in our lives.  There is scope to include counselling as part of the curriculum for medical students.  In the same way as inservice training is provided for teachers through the Department of Education, we should provide training in counselling for general practitioners.  Counselling is an expert skill which most <Col N="1042" /> people do not have naturally &mdash; one has to be trained in it.  I hope the Minister will take this point on board when looking at the issue of counselling.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister's assurance that he is committed to doing what the amendment asks him to do.  However, I am disappointed that this legislation is not the proper vehicle under which to do this.  The Minister has said that he will introduce a general health Bill some time this year.  If Deputy O'Donnell and I had our way, it would be introduced before the summer recess.  On the basis of the Minister's commitment that he will include in the health legislation the aspects to which I have referred.  I will withdraw my amendment.</P>

    <P>These amendments are designed to limit the criminal sanctions imposed under the Bill I have serious concerns about the impact of the legislation in that it <Col N="1043" /> will impose criminal sanctions on certain people, thereby affecting their rights.  The legislation could be said to approach the issue of information from the negative rather than the positive end of the spectrum.  It contains a series of prohibitions backed up with the threat of criminal sanction.  For example, doctors, counsellors, booksellers and ordinary men and women may be pursued through the criminal courts for committing one of a number of offences.  It is this criminal aspect of the legislation about which I am concerned. During the debate on an earlier amendment we referred to the ways in which the Bill could be made positive.  As it is currently drafted, there is very little that is positive in the Bill.  The Minister has given commitments to introduce positive provisions in regard to the giving of information</P>
    <P>As evidenced in the 1992 referendum, the majority of people have adopted a commonsense approach to the provision of information on abortion services. While they do not want to see advertisements on billboards extolling the virtues of abortion clinics or to receive unsolicited mailshots on these clinics, they have no major objection to people being given Act information at meetings, in newspaper advertisements or on television programmes.  After all, the vast majority of these people will not be pregnant women.  Most people do not support the criminal tone of the Bill and I, therefore, propose that the only prohibition which should be backed by a criminal sanction is the one in section 4 which prohibits advertising on billboards and mailshots.  The other prohibitions can stand but they need not be backed by penal sanctions.  This is a commonsense approach to this issue.  If I had drafted the Bill I would have approached this issue from the positive rather than the negative end of the spectrum.</P>
    <P>I can anticipate the Minister's response &mdash; one cannot expect to have a prohibition without a criminal sanction. However, there is a precedent for this in <Col N="1044" /> section 6 of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, which provides that it is unlawful for persons to communicate with certain officers of State, including the DPP, for the purposes of attempting to influence them in the discharge of their duties.  My amendment would remove the criminal tone from the Bill. As the late Mr. Justice McCarthy said in the X case: &ldquo;Legislation may be both negative and positive, negative in prohibiting absolutely or at a given time or without meeting stingent tests and positive by requiring positive action.  The State may fulfil its role by providing necessary agencies to help, to counsel, to encourage, to comfort and to plan for the pregnant woman, the pregnant girl, and her family&rdquo;.  This view was endorsed by the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Proinsias De Rossa, during the debate on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1992, when he said: &ldquo;The mind-set which sets the question of information solely on the basis of how it can be restricted rather than how it can be provided is starting from the wrong end of the spectrum&rdquo;.  That is the basis of my amendment and, although I can anticipate it, I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I appreciate Deputy O'Donnell's absolute commitment to the wellbeing of women and, therefore, I will not simply say one cannot have law without penalties. I intend to be more reflective.</P>
      <P>I read the late Mr. Justice McCarthy's judgments in the X case on a number of occasions and was very impressed by them.  I am fully in accord with the principle that in vindicating the right to life of the unborn the State should do so positively as well as by way of prohibition. The debate under Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's amendment on a commitment to research, full family planning and counselling is a step in the direction suggested by the late Mr. Justice McCarthy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1045" /> It is true that one cannot have law without prohibitions.  Deputy O'Donnell gave as an example a case involving communications with the DPP.  The functions of the DPP were exercised by the Attorney General prior to the establishment of the office of the DPP under separate statute.  The Attorney General, Declan Costello, set up the independent office under the Cosgrave Government in the 1970s.  One of the great controversial issues of the time surrounded Deputies making representations in respect of prosecutions to the new office of the DPP.  The Irish solution to the problem was to make it illegal to do so, but sanction was not provided for fear Deputies would run foul of the law. There is a famous anecdote in our party about the late and well respected Deputy John L. Sullivan who received a letter from Declan Costello stating that it was improper to make representations on behalf of a constituent and pointing out that it could involve the penalty of a jail sentence.  At a meeting of the party, the late Deputy Sullivan stated he had been jailed by the British, the Black and Tans and by the Irish Government, but he would not be jailed by a Government he supported by his vote in the House.  I accept that is not relevant in this case.</P>
    <P>Throughout the debate, Deputies &mdash; and I include myself in this &mdash; referred to the right to information and the right to travel, but the amendment does not refer to them as rights, they are freedoms. There is a right to life of the unborn and an equal right to life of the mother, but the Constitution refers to a freedom to travel and to obtain information and Deputies should note that.  I do not propose to define where a right stops and a freedom starts or <i>vice versa,</i> but a right and a freedom are two different matters.  The State has an absolute obligation to vindicate the rights of a citizen under the Constitution, but it does not have a responsibility to vindicate a freedom.  A citizen should be enabled to exercise a freedom.  As well as conflicting constitutional rights there <Col N="1046" /> may be an element of conflict between a freedom and a right.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There will be no sanction on a person who receives information, only on those who give information.  If the Bill did not provide for sanctions and a person referred a woman with a crisis pregnancy to a clinic in the United Kingdom, made the travel arrangements and supplied money for the trip, in enabling the freedom of information and travel to be exercised, would we be by statute vindicating the right to life of the unborn? It is not as simple as merely inserting advisory or admonitory sections in the Bill without providing for sanctions because it comes down to the question of the competing right to life of the unborn child and the equal right to life of the mother, both of which must be vindicated.  It is extremely difficult to do that.  We are all aware of the decision in the X case where the Supreme Court ruled that the right to life of the mother was superior to that of the unborn.  In a pregnancy where there is not a real or substantial risk to the life of the mother and a person makes arrangements for that woman to travel to England to have an abortion, including paying the travel costs and so on, the State is no longer vindicating the right to life of the child. That cannot be condoned in law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept what Deputy O'Donnell stated in regard to women with crisis pregnancies having enough problems without the rigour of the criminal law being imposed on those who try to help them in accordance with their rights. That is why section 10 is phrased in the manner it is.  Deputies will be aware that the court does not normally impose maximum penalties, courts have discretion in terms of penalties.  Prosecution for an offence under this section can be brought only with the consent of the <Col N="1047" /> Director of Public Prosecutions.  It is not a question of the local garda sergeant or superintendent deciding to prosecute a counsellor in an advice clinic whom he or she believes has offended.  Neither is it a question of a local garda sergeant deciding to prosecute a local GP whom he or she believes has offended.  Prosecution can be made only with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. It was a question of striking a balance and coming up with this solution, which is a reasonable one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that offences under this section carry a maximum fine not exceeding £1,500.  Surely this indicates there is an element of duplicity or hypocrisy in the Bill.  If we are really intent on vindicating the rights of the unborn and believe it is a terrible crime to refer a woman to a clinic abroad for an abortion, surely the offence should carry a more hefty penalty.  In saying that, I am not encouraging an increase in the penalties, but the level of penalty characterises the complexities of the issue.  I appreciate the difficulties the Minister has had in trying to steer the course, in not being too penal but yet trying to vindicate the rights of the unborn enshrined in Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution.</P>
      <P>I note that prosecution for an offence can be made only with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions, who holds an independent office.  There is always a danger that the DPP of the day could be very interested in bringing prosecutions.  There is always a subjective difficulty and human factor in delegating responsibility to bring charges to one independent officeholder.  One DPP might be happy not to bring to bear on information providers or a doctor who makes a referral the full force of the criminal law, but another might be well disposed to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not press my amendments to a vote.  I tabled them merely to enable me <Col N="1048" /> express my concern that, apart from billboards and unsolicited leaflets, the panel and criminal sanctions introduced in the Bill are inappropriate.  I thank the Minister for his response.  It was reflective and generous to the spirit of my amendments, but I note he has his own mind on this issue.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I again thank the Deputy for her remarks.  I have stated why I will not drop penalties under these sections.  I want to make clear that there is no duplicity in this. The alternative, if one wanted to be more onerous, would be to impose a prison sentence and not increase the maximum fine, because the court has discretion anyway as to the fine it imposes.  If we make the fine £2,000 or £3,000 it is not really more onerous and it would be out of line with comparable law.  As a matter of policy neither I nor the Government is prepared to have the sanction of a prison sentence underpinning this.  It is not duplicity but a policy position.</P>
      <P>In regard to the question of the Director of Public Prosecutions, it is not that a DPP would be softer or harder in his approach than a Garda Superintendent. However, there is only one DPP but several Garda Superintendents.  The point is not to have a more or less onerous approach but to standardise it so that everybody can be treated equally by an individual office holder.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Donnell made a valid point about how different Directors of Public Prosecutions might look at this area.  This is <Col N="1049" /> something I found extremely frustrating. The Minister and Deputy O'Donnell will have heard of the frustrations of Garda Superintendents and individual gardaí who, having done all the ground work and sent the file to the DPP, find that a different decision from the one they expected is made.  This is particularly so in cases of sexual abuse where the Garda Síochána feel they have a watertight case but the DPP decides that there is not enough evidence to prosecute.  The victim concerned, the parents and family of that individual and the Garda are frustrated and, because of the independence of the office of the DPP, there is no way the DPP can explain why he came to a particular conclusion.  I welcome the proposal in the Programme for Government to provide for office holders such as the DPP, the Attorney General and the Garda Commissioner to appear two or three times a year before a body such as the Committee on Legislation and Security to report, but not necessarily about specific decisions.  This proposal was discussed between the Leader of my party and the Leader of the Labour Party in November and December in the context of the reformation to the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government.  I welcome its inclusion in this Government's programme.  Such a procedure would allow for such individuals to be questioned by the Members of the House about their general policy on the implementation of law where, up to now, Ministers have consistently carried the can on their behalf.  Because of what Deputy O'Donnell said, I felt I should raise this and compliment the Minister and his Government on acting in this area.</P>

      <P>Yesterday I raised with the Taoiseach the issue of the lack of a facility to review decisions by the Director of Public Prosecutions not to go ahead with a prosecution following the forwarding of a file by the Garda to <Col N="1050" /> him.  The Taoiseach persisted in maintaining the traditional stance that because of the independence of the Office of the DPP it is not possible to facilitate accountability on the part of the DPP to this House or anybody.  I suggested, and the suggestion was accepted by the Taoiseach, that where a prosecution does not proceed the victim of a serious crime, who is often devastated when a prosecution is not proceeded with, should be notified in writing of that fact.  It should not be necessary to state the reasons because that might prejudice the accused person or witnesses.  That organ of the criminal justice system, the office of the DPP, should not be so independent as not to be accountable.  There should be some method of redress for the victims of serious crime when for some reason, despite the fact that nine people might have made separate affidavits to bring charges against a person for, say, sexual abuse over many years, the prosecution is not taken.  Those people are entitled to an answer from the State as to why it is not championing their cause and answering their calls for justice.  Because this section introduces a role for the DPP under this Act it gives us an opportunity to yet again put on the record the need for accountability on the part of the DPP in general policy areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This section relates to the forfeiture provisions which are wide-ranging and consequent on sanctions and other powers such as forfeiture or seizure of documents or possessions, excluding medical records, which might be in the surgery of a doctor and which, with a view to collecting evidence, the State is empowered to seize.  Similar sections are contained in the Misuse of Drugs Act and the Larceny Acts which deal with the recovery of stolen goods.  In light of my earlier comments that I am worried about the tone of the Bill as it introduces the concept of criminality, I register my disapproval at the inclusion of such provisions.</P>
      <P>Where the Garda or other officials of the State raid a doctor's surgery with a view to collecting evidence the Bill anticipates that the doctor may take a court action to recover his property.  This is an indication of just how draconian these measures are, having regard to the compassionate service doctors provide.</P>
      <P>This raises the spectre where one strays too far in providing non-directive counselling, of a doctor's surgery or clinic being entered, by force if necessary, to collect evidence.  This is anathema to me and many others.  I do not think anyone envisages this happening and I hope it does not.  By providing for these powers in legislation backed up by sanctions, under which the State will have the power to raid and seize the property of a doctor, we are painting a very sorry picture.</P>

While it may seem onerous, it is normal to include such a provision in law.  A similar provision is contained in <Col N="1052" /> many Acts.  I hope everyone will comply with the terms of the Bill and these powers will not be invoked.  They are limited in scope.</P>
      <P>On the question of non-directive counselling, there is no question of one straying too far in one direction.  Where is the evidence in the relationship between a doctor and a woman to suggest that one has?  I cannot envisage a prosecution being grounded on that example but I could easily envisage the grounds on which a prosecution could be based where, for example, leaflets and pamphlets which openly advocate and promote the termination of pregnancy are available in a particular premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs for coming in to respond.</P>
      <P>I have raised previously this issue of the alleged radiation emissions from British Army Border look-out posts in the south Armagh area.  It has been ongoing for many years and has been the subject of a number of reports by eminent specialists in this area, including a Mr. Coghill and a Mr. Royds, in which they expressed concern about the level of emissions from look-out posts which they believe is unnecessary.  The British Army has indicated that microwaves, radiowaves and infra-red rays are emitted from these posts but that the level is well below the internationally recognised safety threshold. The people in the area, however, have their suspicions about this and while I do not wish to add to them if they are unfounded, there have been a lot of unexplained circumstances in the area. One general practitioner in Crossmaglen is concerned about the number of people coming to see her with problems that she relates in some way to the emissions from these checkpoints.</P>
      <P>When I raised this matter on a previous occasion there was an ongoing conflict in the area and I suppose, from the point of view of the British Army, there was a need for these checkpoints. However, the people living in the area would not agree.  Despite the fact that we have had peace for the past six months the checkpoints remain.  The people in the area want these turrets removed forthwith as well as the various other equipment causing emissions.  If it is logical to withdraw troops from the streets of Belfast, it is logical also to withdraw the troops and their turrets from the Border areas.  I made this case on a previous Adjournment in regard to a Border incursion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I travelled to Armagh some weeks <Col N="1055" /> ago for the episcopal ordination of Fr. Sean Brady and I was stopped three times along the route.  My car was actually buzzed at one stage by two helicopters. It is a fallacy, therefore, to say that the Army presence is being reduced because the reality in those areas is that it is still there.</P>
    <P>I diverge from the topic I wished to raise merely to make the point that as we have had peace for over six months, there is surely a case for the authorities here to ensure that the British remove these turrets and the surveillance equipment as soon as possible.  They are no longer necessary and perhaps the Tánaiste would concur with that.</P>
    <P>If these are to remain for the foreseeable future &mdash; and I hope they will not &mdash; I ask the Tánaiste and his colleague, the Minister for Health, to request an independent examination of the emissions from these turrets.  I make that suggestion only if the turrets are to remain, which I hope will not be the case.  Perhaps the Tánaiste and the Minister for Health will have co-operation from the authorities on the other side of the Border in this investigation. If this is done it will allay the fears not only of the people in South Armagh but of the people in my constituency of North Louth.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Ahern for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I understand the worries people have both in the Deputy's constituency and in South Armagh.  We raised this issue previously with the British authorities through the Joint Secretariat and were told that the equipment used by the Army in South Armagh is not harmful to health.  Our own experts in these matters, including the Department of Health and the Nuclear Energy Board, have given us the same opinion.  They are satisfied that there is no evidence to indicate that this equipment gives rise to health hazards.  That is the expert opinion and it is important <Col N="1056" /> that people living in North Louth-South Armagh should be aware of this view.</P>
      <P>People are worried when they read about health risks from one source or another.  That is perfectly natural. Nobody wants to live or work in an environment which poses significant danger to health or well-being.  The public is well aware of such concerns nowadays and it is important that public authorities should be able to assure people as far as they can so that there is no unnecessary worry, especially on such a sensitive matter as this.</P>
      <P>I know that a particular report, that by Dr. Roger Coghill last year, renewed the worries which people in the area of South Armagh-North Louth have regarding Army surveillance equipment in Crossmaglen.  The Department of Health here has examined the report very carefully.  The South Eastern Health Board in Northern Ireland has also looked at it.  All the health bodies covering the Louth-Armagh areas continue to keep a close watch on all health statistics and consult each other when reports, such as that by Dr. Coghill, are made public.  All these bodies do not agree with Dr. Coghill's conclusions for various reasons.</P>
      <P>It is important to remember that the health authorities have all relevant statistics for cancers and other diseases, locally and nationally, and can compare smaller population samples with the larger ones, which is very important when drawing conclusions of this kind.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the health statistics available to them, the health authorities are satisfied that the surveillance equipment used by security forces in Crossmaglen and other areas along the Border is not detrimental to the health of the population of South Armagh and North Louth.  I understand there is not any evidence to suggest significant change in the pattern of disease presentation in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1057" /> The South Eastern Health Board in Northern Ireland concludes.  I understand, that the recent report offers no authoritative evidence to suggest a link between electromagnetic fields and cancer or brain haemorrhages.  It strongly contests the report's finding that people in the Crossmaglen area are three times more likely to suffer brain haemorrhages compared with the rest of Northern Ireland.  The data on all death from cancer and brain haemorrhages in the Crossmaglen area between 1986 and 1993 show that mortality rates were below the expected levels based on data from the whole of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>There have been reports in the media and elsewhere over the years regarding the dangers of radiation.  As the Deputy knows, the Department of Health continues to monitor this question carefully here.  People are understandibly worried, especially when they read contradictory opinions.  A great deal of research has been ongoing internationally on this question for many years.  The health authorities here draw on this work.  They point out that the general body of evidence to date has not established a casual relationship between electromagnetic radiation and cancer.</P>
    <P>I hope this will help to allay fears and worries among the people of South Armagh-North Louth.  The two Departments of Health will keep the situation under close scrutiny and will consult as and when necessary.</P>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned the expected consequences of the ceasefires.  With the peace process now well under way, we hope that the difficulties experienced by people in Border areas through the presence of the security forces in large numbers and a related security installations will be greatly reduced.  A number of positive steps have already been taken including the opening of previously closed cross-Border roads and the recent dismantlement of the patrol base at Kilturk.  We hope that further <Col N="1058" /> changes will follow so that for the people of Crossmaglen, as for others living in Border areas, these problems will quickly become a thing of the past.  In the meantime, Deputies can be assured that my Department will continue to follow closely developments in these areas.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised his own personal experience of his trip to Armagh some weeks ago.  I will take up that matter with the authorities because we have had many reports in the past few months that that problem had been alleviated.  I will certainly raise the issue because we all hope for the peace dividend which will allow people to travel North-South and <i>vice versa</i> without interruption which should be the norm these days.</P>

      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this important issue on the Adjournment. The problems of the Border region have been well recognised by the European Union which recognises all frontier regions as disadvantaged.  In particular it recognises the problems we face in Ireland.  The EU has allocated additional funding to Ireland in the Delors package to alleviate problems created by the violence of the past 25 years.  Those who contribute to the International Fund for Ireland also recognise the problems of the Border region.  The United States has contributed $20 million for this purpose and will host a conference in Washington which is being held to attract industry to the Border regions.</P>
      <P>There are serious problems in the Border areas in terms of infrastructure compared with the position within a 20 mile radius of Dublin.  If we continue the way we are going in Ireland the whole population will live within 20 miles of Dublin by the year 2010.  Action must be taken to make other areas of the country more competitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1059" /> Last week I asked the Minister for Finance the initiatives he was taking to make the Border areas more attractive for inward investment and to encourage existing industry to grow.  I asked the same question yesterday of the Minister for the Environment.  I also asked both Ministers if the money from external sources would be additional and both said it would.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, said it is his intention to ensure the moneys are additional and that he would give a 100 per cent guarantee that would be the case.  The vast bulk of the money under the INTERREG Programme will be used to rectify infrastructural deficiencies and to make the Border counties an attractive investment location.  The Minister said that is important in view of the cessation of violence.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, said that additional benefits are set to accrue to Border regions on foot of INTERREG II and that a further community initiative is intended to support the peace process. He went on to tell me about all the money that would be available under the INTERREG Programme.  To my absolute amazement and horror, when I received details of road allocations for my constituency I discovered there is a reduction of £800,000.  Much more serious is that £2.5 million has been taken from our funding and it is replaced with INTERREG money.  In other words the allocation has been reduced.  The Minister has taken almost £3.5 million of Exchequer funding from my constituency in return for £2.5 million of INTERREG money, which was supposed to be additional.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State &mdash; I thank him for coming in to reply to this matter &mdash; to press the Ministers in Government to honour their commitment that the money, particularly from external sources &mdash; from the European Union, IFI, the Delors package and the United States &mdash; targeted to Border areas, will be additional.  If that is done <Col N="1060" /> we will be able to correct the infrastructural deficiencies recognised by the Minister for Finance, make the Border area competitive and benefit from the cessation of violence.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the measures to assist investment infrastructure in the Border region.  A modern economy needs modern infrastructure.  This has been acknowledged, both by the Government and the European Union, through the emphasis on infrastructural investment in the Community Support Framework, the related operational programmes, and the Cohesion Fund.</P>
      <P>Investment in the services for which my Department is responsible &mdash; roads, treatment and disposal of water borne wastes, water supply and urban regeneration &mdash; will exceed £2.5 billion in the period 1994 to 1999.  This will pay dividends in the short term through direct and indirect employment on the schemes and in ancillary industries.  In the longer term, an enhanced infrastructural base will allow us to compete effectively and promote economic and social development.</P>
      <P>Apart from its share of the above resources, additional benefits will accrue to the Border region through a number of initiatives which should substantially boost economic progress in the region, and significantly enhance the infrastructural base on which this progress depends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commission approval was recently given to the Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG Programme.  While this is a multisectoral programme comprising a wide range of measures, roads and environmental services are two important components.  Together, these services have been allocated more than <Col N="1061" /> 35 per cent of the available EU assistance for the land borders element of the INTERREG initiative.</P>
    <P>A monitoring committee representative of the various interests involved &mdash; the European Commission, Government Departments and other relevant interests such as the Border Regional Authority &mdash; will oversee implementation of the programme.  As was the case under INTERREG I, the monitoring committee will, among other things, ensure that the principle of additionality is adhered to.</P>
    <P>As recently as yesterday, I gave the House a full account of the position on roads investment under INTERREG II this year, and it would be superfluous to go over the same ground in detail.  The House should note that the 1995 allocations are but the first <i>tranche</i> of an INTERREG II programme which will continue until 1999, and which will see investment exceeding £20 million in roads in the Border regions.</P>
    <P>Investment in water and sanitary services builds capacity in the economy in several ways: it directly services development sectors; it enables the environment safely to absorb additional development; it protects the natural resource base for expansion in tourism, agriculture and food; and it underpins the competitive advantage which a clean environment can create in these areas.</P>
    <P>INTERREG II will support investment for all these purposes in the Border region and will amount to some £14 million in the period to the end of the decade.  More than £2.5 million will be available to the water and sanitary services programme in 1995, and I intend to notify eligible local authorities of the schemes to be included in the 1995 programme in the near future.</P>
    <P>Additional EU funding is being provided to support the Northern Ireland peace process.  Draft guidelines have been approved by the Commission and are being examined by the European Parliament, the Committee of the <Col N="1062" /> Regions, the Economic and Social Committee and the Management Committee on Community Initiatives.  Formal adoption of the initiative is expected around the end of April and the operational programme should be approved, following full consultation with local interests, before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The Border counties on the southern side should benefit under this initiative by an injection of EU aid of about £16 million per year over the next three years.  Thereafter, funding over the following two years will be the subject of a review by the Commission.  I am reluctant to speculate about the extent to which services under the remit of my Department and local authorities are likely to benefit, except to say that there is every prospect of additional funding, within the figure of £16 million per year being made available for measures related to urban and village renewal.  It is worth nothing also that the International Fund for Ireland has already given considerable assistance for these purposes.  I will keep in close touch with developments on the peace process initiative.</P>
    <P>I am fully confident that the Border region will continue to see substantial ongoing investment in infrastructure in the years ahead.  This, together with other measures, will support economic and social progress in the region and, I earnestly hope, peace on this island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that it is necessary for me to raise this issue on the Adjournment.  I speak of a very special school in my constituency in Cashel, County Tipperary, a school called Scoil Chormaic which deals with mildly handicapped children.  At present it caters for 135 pupils aged five to 18 years.  Scoil Chormaic was built to cater for children with mild learning difficulties but because of its generosity it caters for children with multiple disabilities <Col N="1063" /> such as physical disability, hearing disability, visual impairment, autism, behavioural disorders, language disorders and moderate learning disability.</P>
      <P>In recent days much has been spoken here about a caring society.  If we were a caring society.  I would not need to raise this item on the Adjournment.  The children catered for in Scoil Chormaic are special children with special needs who deserve special accommodation.  It is with some embarrassment that I say that the students of this school are studying in appalling conditions.  The teachers are trying to cope and help those children in totally unsuitable circumstances, to such an extent that during the heavy rainfall of the past few months the classrooms were leaking and, for safety's sake, these special children had to be removed from the school and taken home.  Must we not question the aims and aspirations of our educational system if students such as those in Scoil Chormaic are not getting the type of facilities and the environment they need to make progress?</P>
      <P>No words of mine could express my admiration for the principal and staff of that school.  Is it right that the principal of that school had to meet public representatives to obtain for her students proper accommodation that should come automatically from the Department of Education?  But for the generosity of the board of management, the parents and the people of South Tipperary who continually helped to raise funds for facilities, I shudder to think what sort of facilities I would be seeking for that school now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem can be solved overnight and it is not in many circumstances that one can make that statement.  It can be done because of the provision of a new community school in Cashel.  Excellent premises are available to Scoil Chormaic from the Christian Brothers community in Cashel.  While the situation is being looked at no decision is forthcoming and there is red tape, delay, many phone calls and letters.  I am not <Col N="1064" /> prepared to allow that to continue for much longer.  I will stand up for the students of Scoil Chormaic and I admire the work being done there by the principal and teachers.  Will anybody disagree with me when I say that they deserve proper accommodation?  Do they have to be in a school where the roofs are leaking, where students can trip and fall?  These students need the best quality of educational services that we can deliver.  The staff and parents of the school are very patient but I must warn that they are not prepared to accept these conditions any longer.</P>
    <P>We all welcome better facilities for schools but I apologise to no one for saying that schools such as Scoil Chormaic in Cashel deserve priority.  I hope I will have a positive response tonight and that very shortly the Department of Education will make available to the school the premises that are being generously offered by the Christian Brothers.  Those premises are in good repair, vacant and waiting to be filled but for the red tape and hassle.  If the Department does not act quickly there will be an accident in that school which will cost a lot of money.  I do not want that to happen.  I do not want any child to be fearful of any kind of dangers.</P>
    <P>I want those teachers who give 100 per cent of their energies and resources to those students to have a proper environment and I hope that my plea on their behalf will be successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining my Department's intention in relation to the provision of suitable permanent accommodation for Scoil Chormaic, Cashel, County Tipperary.  I understand the frustration, impatience and concern of Deputy Ahearn because she has described the position in very graphic detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background information on the school is that the current enrolment is 131 pupils and the staffing comprises the <Col N="1065" /> principal and nine assistants, plus a concessionary temporary teacher.  A slight increase in enrolment is forecast.  Scoil Chormaic was originally built to cater for children with mild learning difficulties but now caters for children with multiple disabilities, as stated by Deputy Ahearn.  They are children with physical, hearing, visual impairment, autism, behavioural disorders, language disorders and moderate learning disabilities. The age profile of the pupils attending the school ranges from five to 18 years.</P>
    <P>My Department's policy is to transfer mildly mentally handicapped pupils to ordinary national schools where feasible. However, only a small minority of students tend to transfer back to ordinary schools once enrolled at Scoil Chormaic.  Pupils at present enrolled at this special school are considered long term enrolments.  Long term accommodation arrangements are therefore necessary to accommodate these pupils. In addition to the existing mildly mentally handicapped pupils attending this school, a group of autistic pupils are also enrolled.  The intention is that a class will be formed specifically suited to the needs of the autistic children.</P>
    <P>My Department is fully aware of the unsatisfactory condition of the accommodation at Scoil Chormaic and has been actively engaged in measures to alleviate immediate problems and to secure a satisfactory long term solution. The existing accommodation of Scoil Chormaic consists of eight permanent classrooms and ancillaries.  In addition, two new prefabricated classrooms with toilets were approved on a rental basis by my Department in September 1994 to replace the unsuitable accommodation then in use for two classes.  The two prefabricated classrooms are now in use as classrooms.  Access ramps were also provided to ensure pupil safety.  It was decided to supply the classrooms on a rental basis rather than on a permanent basis pending a policy decision on <Col N="1066" /> the future of the school premises.  The offer of vacant spare classrooms in other schools was unacceptable to the school authority.</P>
    <P>Due to rationalisation in Cashel at second level, an existing secondary school together with adjoining buildings became vacant in June 1994.  The second level school is now accommodated in a new community school which has been operational since September 1994 in a new building.  This has left the old school vacant.</P>
    <P>The Department was approached with a view to utilising the vacant secondary school, together with other buildings and grounds within the complex as well as a playing field, as a future home for the special school &mdash; Scoil Chormaic.  This offer meant that a thorough examination and assessment of the suitability of the existing Scoil Chormaic, the possibility of future expansion, costings and feasibility had to be undertaken so that comparisons could be made with the secondary school option. Both schools had to be considered before a decision on the best option for the future of Scoil Chormaic could be made.  The possibility of an exchange of buildings was also raised by the representatives of the secondary school.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Department's professional advisers were asked to carry out a detailed survey of both schools and to recommend the upgrading requirements, the feasibility of expansion and the detailed costings involved in each case.  This assessment and some detailed necessary investigations arising from the surveys indicated that identifiable problems required further investigation. Further assessment is still ongoing in my Department.</P>
    <P>It is expected that this process will shortly be finalised and it will then be possible to engage in meaningful negotiations with the agents of the secondary school.  In view of the strong argument put forward very effectively tonight by Deputy Ahearn, I am hopeful that a <Col N="1067" /> satisfactory long term solution to the accommodation problems of Scoil Chormaic will soon emerge.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity of raising this matter on the Adjournment, and I am also grateful to the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, who has special responsibility for harbour development, for being present.</P>
      <P>The Minister will recall that last June during the debate on the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Bill, when we were both Opposition spokespersons I raised, as he did, concerns about an increase in the movement of heavy freight traffic through Dún Laoghaire as a result of the development.  Deputy Woods, who replied on behalf of the then Minister for the Marine, Deputy Andrews, said:</P>
      <P>The principal development will be in the area of passenger and car services... With the introduction of B &amp; I's new super ferry, the proportion of trucks going through Dublin Port should increase and the Dún Laoghaire share decline.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State confirm that this is the case?  What is his view on capping the freight volume through Dún Laoghaire at 1993 levels?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is aware that a lobby group has proposed that all truck traffic be re-routed through Dublin port, that car traffic be maintained at a level suitable for the existing road capacity; that the total number of ferry sailings into and out of the harbour should be restricted; that a speed limit of eight knots be imposed on ferries in the area between the Kish lighthouse and the harbour and, finally, that the transport of hazardous cargo should not be allowed.  I am sure there should not be a great deal of difficulty in implementing <Col N="1068" /> some of those proposals.  Of major concern is the level of traffic through Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>When the development was initiated it was generally expected that the Carlisle pier would be redeveloped for leisure and amenity use.  I would like the Minister to give an assurance that this will take place and that moneys will be made available as soon as possible to fulfil that expectation.  I am concerned that European funding for the development does not appear to have been approved as of yet and I would like to know the position in regard to this funding. Will the Minister state the up-to-date position on European funding?</P>
    <P>The traffic problem is of major concern in Dún Laoghaire.  This predates the involvement of any lobby group.  As I stated during the debate on the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Bill, there must be an effective plan for town and port generated traffic.  At present port generated traffic accounts for less than 10 per cent of all traffic through Dún Laoghaire but that underlines how essential the traffic plan is as there is a traffic problem. Even though the environmental impact statement says there will be no significant impact caused by traffic following the development of the ferry terminal and the implementation of traffic management measures, there are grave concerns that, in fact, it will.  It is essential that the fears that have been aired are allayed.  I support wholeheartedly the establishment of a committee to advise on and monitor traffic.  What support can the Minister give to ensure that any work done is effective?</P>
    <P>The Minister realises all too well the difficulties we have in Dún Laoghaire. As a constituency colleague he was very involved in the county council before being appointed Minister of State.  I hope he will be able to respond to the many problems raised, particularly over the past number of months by the local representatives on the county council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore) Eamon Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Keogh for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  She raised this matter with me on a number of occasions since I took office.  The redevelopment of St. Michael's Pier in Dún Laoghaire harbour is the first step in implementing the comprehensive blueprint for the harbour which has drawn up by the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Board, following a lengthy process of public consultation and which will provide for a balanced development as between commercial, leisure and recreational use.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the new high speed service vessel will be a world first for Ireland and Dún Laoghaire and is at the cutting edge of technology from a shipping and port point of view.  The vessel combines the speed of the fastest sea transport with the comfort of a modern passenger liner.</P>
      <P>These developments must be seen in the context of national port development policy and, in particular, the parallel developments at Dublin port.</P>
      <P>The development of ferry facilities now in progress in both Dublin port and Dún Laoghaire means that each port can concentrate on the business to which it is best suited.  It is government policy to encourage Dublin port as the main entry-exit point for all freight including trucks.  Major investment has taken place in Dublin port since 1989 and further investment is planned.</P>
      <P>The introduction of Irish Ferries' new super ferry on to the Dublin to Holy-head route will put Irish Ferries in a position to carry significantly larger volumes of freight traffic.  This service will be in direct competition with Stena's HSS service and will be targeting aggressively the freight market.  The recent announcement of a £100 million port access route for Dublin will further reinforce this business for Dublin port.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1070" /> Dún Laoghaire is an attractive entry point for tourist traffic.  This has been its role in the past and the new facilities are aimed at copperfastening its role in this market.  The ferry service in Dún Laoghaire plays a major role in the local economy in terms of direct employment, and the expenditure of the many tourists who travel to and visit the town.  I am, of course, aware of concerns about the traffic implications of the new development.  In this regard, we must bear in mind that the project has been subjected to the full rigours of the planning process.</P>
    <P>We will, of course, co-operate fully with the Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council on traffic planning.  I have, since taking up office, held discussions with a wide range of interests concerning the development and its possible traffic implications.  I hope to be in a position to make a fuller statement in the near future arising from these discussions.  I hope that statement will allay the fears that have been expressed about the traffic implications. However, some of the claims about traffic are greatly exaggerated.</P>
    <P>On securing EU funding for the development of tourism-leisure facilities in Dún Laoghaire, the position is as follows. To obtain grant-aid for leisure tourism it is necessary, in the first instance, to identify particular projects which are then, in the case of projects in Dún Laoghaire, submitted to Dublin Tourism for consideration by Bord Fáilte towards grant-aid from the Operational Programme for Tourism.  Such applications must be made by the developers of appropriate tourism related ventures.  My Department's officials and the Dún Laoghaire harbour management, are doing all in their power to facilitate the drawing up of such proposals.</P>
    <P>The Department is preparing applications for assistance towards a number of tourism related projects at Dún Laoghaire harbour under the product <Col N="1071" /> development-tourist information and marketing initiatives of the Operational Programme for Tourism.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keogh asked me to address the application for funding for the <Col N="1072" /> development of the ferry facility.  Discussions are taking place between my Department and the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 10 March 1995.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 55 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="922" /> I am very concerned about the problem of children not attending school. This may arise because of failure to enrol them, refusal to accept them or because they have been expelled or suspended. The available evidence suggests that the incidence of non-attendance is on the increase.  This is a difficult area which has to be looked at on a number of related fronts.</P>
    <P>School enrolment policy is part of the issue.  This is a matter for the managerial authorities of each individual school but it is very important that decisions on admission be fair and objective.  To this end, in 1993 I agreed with the managerial authorities that selection on the basis of academic ability must be discontinued. Policy on discipline and suspension is also central to this issue.  My Department, following full consultation, has issued broad guidelines to both primary and post-primary schools on this aspect.  The guidelines lay considerable stress on the use of suspension only as a last resort and I am satisfied that schools also see it in that way.  Where a pupil has been suspended as a result of disruptive behavour and where alternative arrangements need to be made, my Department's Inspectorate actively assists with the placement of the student in either the original school or in another school.</P>
    <P>In addition to the measures which I have mentioned a number of initiatives have been taken in an effort to increase school attendance among pupils who may be at risk.  These include: the appointment of a Minister of State with responsibility for children at risk; the establishment of a working party to examine the School Attendance Act, 1926 and the publication of the Truancy report.  Subsequent to the publication of this report the Minister of State set up a task force within the Department to examine submissions on the report and to make recommendations for further action; the expansion of the Youthreach programmes which provide two years integrated education, training and work experience for young people who have <Col N="923" /> left school early; Youth Encounter Projects accommodate children who for various reasons including behavioural problems, are not participating in mainstream education and the appointment of additional psychologists to facilitate the early identification of children with behavioural or emotional problems. These initiatives will be kept under close review and any necessary additional action taken in order to deal with this complex problem.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 74 and 84 together.</P>
      <P>I had meetings with the three teacher unions in late January on <i>A Government of Renewal</i> policy agreement.  At each of these meetings the issue of early retirement for teachers was referred to in the context of the provision in the policy agreement on the &ldquo;conclusion of negotiations on optional retirement for teachers&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A joint claim from the teachers' unions for early retirement has been discussed at the Teachers' Conciliation Council.  Discussions on the teachers' claim involved three element viz: (i) early retirement for teachers who no longer find themselves able to function at an acceptable level of professional performance; (ii) early retirement for <Col N="924" /> teachers who are surplus to requirements but who cannot readily be transferred elsewhere; and (iii) general early retirement for teachers.</P>
    <P>Progress in negotiations on early retirement arrangements for teachers experiencing professional difficulties and for surplus teachers could not be advanced because the teacher unions would not discuss these issues further until they received a response to the question of a general early retirement provision.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the Teachers' Conciliation Council on 10 February 1995 a response was made to the question of a general early retirement provision on the basis of equalising early retirement provision for post-primary and primary teachers.  However, the teacher unions rejected the response and discussions were adjourned.  Since then officials of my Department have had informal contacts with the teacher unions and arrangements for the resumption of discussions with the assistance of a facilitator have been agreed.</P>
    <P>I have, in consultation with Government colleagues and with the agreement of the teacher unions, appointed Mr. Seán Healy, Director of the Advisory Service of the Labour Relations Commission, to facilitate the discussions and to report to me on the outcome of these discussions.  As discussions under the facilitator have commenced I am sure that the Deputies will agree that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further.</P>

      <P>A voluntary oral Irish test conducted according to guidelines issued from the Department is available in the junior certificate.  This option is taken up by very few schools.  The testing of ability in the spoken language is mainly through the aural examination which tests listening and comprehension skills and forms a significant element of the examination.  It is the intention to have a full scale oral examination as soon as this can be achieved but I am not in a position at this stage to state that it can be introduced in the 1995-96 academic year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="927" /> The main obstacle to an oral Irish examination at this level is that it depends on agreed arrangements for school-based assessment.  Any other arrangement would involve unacceptable levels of disruption to schools and interruptions to teaching time.  Up to this point it has not been possible to negotiate a mutually acceptable system of school-based assessment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>My view is that the college should use the leaving certificate German results for the purpose of the second selection.  The effect of the special college examination is that students who may have good German results in the leaving certificate and who wish to take German in their degree course might be obliged in their degree course to choose an alternative subject. Moreover, as the CAO offers are still in progress, the timing of this special examination is unfortunate.</P>
      <P>However, the selection of students for admission to the college is a prerogative of the college and I have no function in the matter.</P>
      <P>This special examination is a departure from general practice where leaving certificate results are accepted as a recognised level of proficiency for admission to third level.  To my knowledge, it is the only instance where another layer of examinations is used by a third level institution to select students for study of a foreign language.</P>

      <P>Labour Court recommendation dated 13 November 1992, referred to, was that higher order attendants in regional technical colleges be linked with class aides in the Dublin Institute of Technology for the purposes of establishing pay levels.  The pay of higher order attendants was increased to the level of class aides with effect from 1 January, 1993.  Accordingly, my Department considers that it has honoured in full the terms of the Labour Court Recommendation.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the trade union representing the grade concerned has recently sought the payment of special allowances to higher order attendants. This claim is separate from the issues determined in the Labour Court recommendation and should be pursued through the normal industrial relations' procedures and under the terms of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> Pay Agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of national surveys of pupils' reading attainment in Irish primary schools have been conducted since 1972.  Average reading standards of the pupil population tested improved between 1972 and 1980 by approximately eight months in terms of reading age.  However, there has been <Col N="929" /> no significant change in reading standards since 1980.</P>
      <P>In an international study of reading literacy conducted by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) in 1991, Irish nine year olds scored above the average for industrialised countries, ranking tenth out of 24 countries.  Irish 14 year olds, however, scored below average in their comparative group, ranking 19th out of 24 countries.  The relatively poor performance of 14 year olds compared to that of nine year olds is a cause of concern and raises questions about the teaching of reading in the higher classes in primary schools.</P>
      <P>I am very conscious of the need to continue improving literacy standards at primary level.  Among the measures that I have introduced to improve standards, is a significant extention of remedial provision.</P>
      <P>An additional 55 remedial teachers will be appointed in primary schools this year.  This will bring the total of such posts to 1,200.  By the end of this year the number of remedial teachers will have increased by 25 per cent since 1992.</P>
      <P>Courses on the identification, remediation and prevention of learning difficulties in pupils remain a priority within the expanded programme of in-career development for primary teachers.</P>
      <P>I believe access to library facilities helps stimulate interest in reading.  I have therefore increased the grants for library services by 96 per cent this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of other measures, designed to have a beneficial impact on the general educational attainment of primary pupils, will also contribute to improving literacy standards.  These include the further reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio, adjustments to maximum class sizes, the Early Start programme, the extension of the <Col N="930" /> psychological services and the expansion of the home school liaison programme.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to extend the provision of general purposes facilities in primary schools as resources permit.</P>
      <P>On my initiative last year, general purposes rooms were provided in new primary school building projects in respect of schools of four classrooms or more.  This provision will be continued in respect of projects in the 1995 capital programme.  In the case of expanding schools of four or more class teachers, where general purpose facilities already exist, additional classroom accommodation is being provided so that the use of the general purpose room as a classroom is not necessary.  Also, in projects where a school currently has four class teachers but projected enrolments indicate that it will have three teachers in the long term, provision is made for a general purpose size classroom in addition to three permanent classrooms.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied, therefore, that progress is being made towards the extension of these facilities generally.  However, the pace at which the programme can be achieved is dictated by the financial resources available and the priority must remain the provision of essential classroom accommodation and the elimination of existing substandard classrooms.  Regrettably therefore, it is not possible at present to provide grant-aid for general purpose rooms in existing schools.</P>

Data for the 1994 Appropriation Accounts is currently being compiled for audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and will be published later in the year.</P>
    <P>The allocation of resources required to provide details of all projects which will be funded in 1995 would be disproportionate. I would be glad, however, to provide full details of any project in which the Deputy has a particular interest.</P>

      <P>The school transport scheme provides a basic service for about 50,000 eligible primary school children who might, otherwise, find it difficult to attend school regularly.  It was never intended to provide a door-to-door service for all eligible pupils.</P>
      <P>Arrangements exist to provide transport for approximately 11,000 ineligible primary school children on State services, on a fee-paying basis, where it is possible to do this without incurring additional costs.</P>
      <P>The cost involved in extending existing transport services to all pupils attending primary schools, numbering in excess of 500,000 pupils, would be prohibitive and unsustainable.</P>
      <P>The safety of school-going children is obviously of paramount importance. The overall operation of the school transport scheme is constantly under review to ensure that the best and safest possible service is delivered.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to extend the general visiting teacher service to all primary schools.  Given the special focus of the service, there would be no justification for extending it to all schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the general visiting teacher service is to assist ordinary <Col N="937" /> school staff in meeting the special educational needs of children with certain types of disabilities.  At present, this service extends to the needs of children attending ordinary classes who suffer from visual or hearing impairment and Down's Syndrome children.  The work of the visiting teacher can involve instruction to individuals or groups of pupils, together with an advisory and support service for both teachers and parents.</P>
    <P>Where the need for support from a visiting teacher is identified, my Department's inspectorate, who manage the service, make the necessary arrangements.</P>
    <P>I should also point out that in recent years my Department has introduced a new innovation whereby a special resource teacher can be attached to a school in a local area to meet the needs of groups of children with disabilities attending ordinary schools in that area.</P>
    <P>To date, a total of 26 resource teachers have been put in place and I have recently announced my intention to appoint an additional ten resource teachers with effect from September next.</P>
    <P>While the role of the resource teacher is similar to that of the visiting teacher, the resource teacher model can be the more appropriate response in situations where a significant number of pupils with special needs are identified in a local area.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that this dual approach, coupled with the additional resource teacher appointments to which I have referred, will have a significant impact on meeting the needs of children with disabilities who are attending ordinary primary schools.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that there is a separate visiting teacher service which is dedicated to the needs of traveller children attending ordinary primary schools.  A total of 12 visiting teachers are currently involved in this service and I propose to appoint a further five teachers to this service with effect from September next.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 44 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>Conductive education involves the use of skills traditionally associated with a number of professions &mdash; physiotherapy, nursing, occupational therapy, speech therapy and teaching &mdash; by one person, known as a conductor.  The conductor interacts intensively with the child using a high degree of physical manipulation.  This system is used with children who have severe physical disabilities, usually due to cerebral palsy. The philosophy behind this approach is that motor development underpins development in other areas of functioning such as general physical development, co-ordination, speech and language development, perceptual and intellectual development.</P>
      <P>The Montessori diploma, awarded on successful completion of the three year full-time course at the Montessori College, Dundrum, is already recognised by my Department in the special education area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teachers with this qualification are eligible to teach in the following five categories of special school; schools for mildly mentally handicapped; schools for moderately mentally handicapped; schools for children who are deaf or hard of hearing; schools for emotionally <Col N="939" /> disturbed children and schools for children with multiple handicap.</P>
    <P>I have no immediate plans to extend recognition of Montessori qualified teachers to other categories of special school or to recognise Montessori qualifications specifically in the context of conductive education.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 46, 76 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to bring the capitation grant rates for primary schools to the level applying in the case of secondary schools.  The difference in grant level reflects the fact that maintenance costs for secondary schools are greater on a unit cost basis than in primary schools. In addition, the second level grant contains an element towards the cost of teachers' salaries.  Consequently, grants are higher than for primary schools where there is no similar requirement.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a small number of schools have experienced particular financial difficulties in the past.  I have in place a measure whereby schools in such a position may apply for once-off grant support from the disadvantaged fund.  A total of 69 schools benefited from this measure in 1994.</P>
      <P>I have secured substantial increases in the capitation grant for primary schools since taking office.  The standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from a level of £28 in 1992, to £33 in 1993, £38 in 1994 and £40 in 1995.  These increases amount to a cumulative 43 per cent increase on the 1992 rates.</P>
      <P>Significant additional funding, over and above the standard capitation increases, is provided in the case of pupils with special needs and also for schools designated as disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the increases I have made represent a very positive step towards improving the financial position of primary schools.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 58 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following improvements in the administration of the student support system were announced and implemented in 1994; the requirement of separate academic attainments for the award of a third-level grant was abolished; applicants who have secured a place on an approved third-level <Col N="942" /> course are now deemed to have automatically satisfied the academic requirements; new rules for second chance cases; for the first time students who dropped out of college can qualify for a grant to study at the same level as they studied previously after an interval of five years; the provision of a special budget to assist students at college who are encountering financial hardship; and the simplification and earlier issue of the student support schemes at the end of April 1994 which was several months earlier than the date they were issued in the previous years.</P>
    <P>As well as the above I also propose to implement the following recommendations: &mdash; the processing of grant applications and payment by the Central Applications Office; transfer of the means test to the Revenue Commissioners and transfer of the appeals function from the Minister for Education to the Appeal Commissioners under tax law.  I have already announced that I will not be proceeding with the above administrative changes in the 1995-1996 academic year because of the complexity and detailed planning work associated with such changes.</P>
    <P>I have now also published the report of the advisory committee.  I am anxious to take careful note of the debate which the publication of the report has generated before reaching conclusions on remaining recommendations of the Advisory Committee.</P>
    <P>The perceived inequities and anomalies in the third-level student support means-testing arrangements have led to considerable debate in recent times.  I will be taking particular account of the public reaction to the proposed changes in the means-testing arrangements as recommended in the report of the advisory Committee.</P>

      <P>In the recent circulars on this issue &mdash; No. 2/95 to primary schools and No. M4/95 to post-primary schools &mdash; I have requested schools to begin the process of developing their policies at this time so that they may start to include programmes of relationships and sexuality education and the wider aspects of social, personal and health education in their curricula in the school year 1995-1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The circulars acknowledge the right and duty of parents to provide for the religious, moral, intellectual, physical <Col N="944" /> and social education of their children. With this in mind, individual school policies will make provision for the rights of parents who hold conscientious or moral objections to the inclusion of programmes of relationships and sexuality education on the curriculum and will state how the school intends to address this situation.</P>
    <P>While programmes of relationships and sexuality education are not mandatory, all schools must have a policy in this area, developed in collaboration between the partners &mdash; school management authorities, teachers, parents and, where appropriate, pupils.  I should emphasise that what is involved is a process of development which should commence now and which will result in good quality programmes being delivered in schools in accordance with the wishes of parents, the ethos of individual schools and related to the needs of children and young people.</P>
    <P>As regards the delivery of programmes, the teacher, in his or her professional capacity, ideally is the person who takes responsibility for delivery of the school-based element of the programme. However, in the unlikely event that all teachers in a school feel unwilling or unable, for any reason, to deliver elements of a programme of relationships and sexuality education, the school policy will have to state how the school intends to provide the programme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56, 77 and 90 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Responsibility for enforcement of the School Attendance Act in Dublin city and in certain other parts of the country rests with the relevant school attendance committees and the school attendance officers.  In all other areas, <Col N="946" /> responsibility rests with the relevant Garda Authorities.  Data on the number of cases which came to the attention of school attendance officers or the Garda is not readily available to my Department.</P>
    <P>None of the ordinary national schools located in Dublin 1 reported any case of pupils in ordinary classes dropping out of full-time education to my Department for the school year 1993/94, the most recent school year for which data are available.  Data are not available for numbers dropping out in these schools ten years ago.  There was one national school in the area which caters for traveller children drawn from outside the locality and which reported 11 pupils as leaving school without proceeding to another school or training centre.</P>
    <P>Recent analysis of data by my Department indicates that for the State as a whole, between 1 to 1.5 per cent of pupils attending primary schools fail to transfer to second level.</P>
    <P>My Department estimates that in 1993-94 there was a drop-out rate before the junior certificate of approximately 10 per cent for pupils attending second-level schools in the Dublin 1 area.  The corresponding rate for the country as a whole is 5 per cent.  A further 15 per cent left these schools before completing the leaving certificate compared to a corresponding average of 13 per cent for the State as a whole.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the current lack of adequate data on non-school attendance. This deficiency was one of the issues identified in the report of my Department's working group on school attendance/truancy.</P>
    <P>In keeping with its commitment to address the problems of truancy and early drop-out, the Government has charged my colleague the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Austin Currie, with special responsibility for this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State recently announced the establishment of a special Task Force to: examine submissions received from interested parties in response to the truancy report, <Col N="947" /> and examine the measures required to address this problem.  The task force has already had a number of meetings and the question of improved data availability is one of the key issues being addressed.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State is maintaining a direct interest in the progress of the work of the task force and has directed that it report at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>The number of pupils availing of school transport service to the three post-primary schools in Youghal is 231.</P>
      <P>The present position is that the central set-down point, a normal feature of the school transport scheme, is located near the Loreto Convent.  Pupils attending the vocational school and the Christian Brothers School have to walk 0.7 miles in the morning and again in the evening.</P>
      <P>I understand that the walk in the morning for these pupils involves a climb up a steep hill.  Therefore, as an exceptional matter, it has been agreed to establish a second set-down point in the morning only.  This will bring the pupils in question to a point very close to their own schools.</P>

      <P>Civic, social and political education (CSPE) commenced as a pilot project at junior cycle in September 1993 and it will conclude in June 1996.</P>
      <P>In 1994-95, 107 schools with almost 300 teachers and 12,400 students are involved in the project.  The pilot phase of the project will conclude in 1995-96 with a projected 150 schools, 570 teachers and 24,000 students involved.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the pilot project it is intended that a new junior cycle short course in civic, social and political education will be finalised and will be available for dissemination to all post-primary schools for the school year 1996-7.</P>
      <P>Civic, social and political education will replace the existing civics programme, as a mandatory element of the junior cycle curriculum.  It is envisaged that CSPE, unlike the existing civics programme, will be assessed and certified as part of the junior certificate.</P>
      <P>The broad area of civic, social and political education is a recommended area of study within the transition year programme and the leaving certificate applied.  The potential for the CSPE as a full leaving certificate subject is under consideration at present.</P>

      <P>The Department of education has among its inspectoral staff at second level an agricultural science inspector.  Despite the fact that the inspector has professional responsibilities in other areas nevertheless a full range of examination, assessment and curriculum development duties are carried out.</P>
      <P>The embargo on recruitment to the Civil Service since 1983 has prevented an expansion in the number of inspectors at second level in any area.</P>
      <P>The scope and size of the agriculture and food industry makes agricultural science a very important subject in the second level school curricula.  The agricultural science syllabus in the leaving certificate programme is under revision by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment at present.  It is expected that the revised syllabus will be more relevant not only for students in rural schools but also for students in urban schools, who aspire to further education and training and a career in the agriculture and food industry.</P>
      <P>It is also expected that in the revised syllabi in both biology and agricultural science there will be only minimal overlap or common material.  This will allow students to choose both subjects, a choice which is not available at present.  The numbers who took agricultural science in the leaving certificate in the various years is as follows: 1960 - 256; 1970-743; 1980 - 894; 1990 - 2,160; 1991-2,296; 1992 - 2,175; 1993 - 2,326; 1994 - 2,198.</P>

The College of Art and Design is located on the site and moneys have been spent in refurbishing and up-grading the existing facilities. Given its location and the physical and educational infrastructure already in place, the site provides an ideal location for expansion, at minimal cost, in meeting the growing demand for third level places in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>The status of the college will be determined following consideration of the recommendations of the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education.</P>

      <P>Provision has been made <Col N="955" /> for an additional 700 posts at post-primary level with effect from the beginning of the 1995-96 school year.</P>
      <P>These additional posts, as well as providing for projected increased enrolments will cater for additional remedial, guidance, resource and home-school links posts.  They will also provide for the appointment of a second vice-principal in the larger schools in the free education scheme, the expansion of the visiting teacher service for travellers at second level and the establishment of a welfare service for teachers.</P>
      <P>As regards recruitment, teaching posts in the vocational and community and comprehensive sectors are normally filled through public competition. Recruitment to teaching posts in secondary schools must have regard to the terms of the redeployment scheme, where appropriate.</P>
      <P>At primary level 342 posts which would have been lost due to declining enrolments in the 1994-95 school year are being retained.  The retention of these posts will allow the pupil teacher ratio for primary schools to be reduced from 23.4:1 in September 1994 to 22.9:1 in September 1995.</P>
      <P>The retention of these posts will also facilitate an improvement in the staffing schedule, a two unit reduction in the general maximum class size guidelines, the allocation of additional remedial, resource, home school liaison and visiting teacher posts and a reduction in the pupil teacher ratio for the special schools.</P>
      <P>Teachers in primary schools whose posts are no longer warranted because of declining enrolments are placed on diocesan panels for redeployment.  A board of management which has a teaching vacancy must fill the post by taking a teacher from the appropriate panel.  If the appropriate panel is clear the post may be filled by open competition.</P>

      <P>Final plans are being developed for the introduction of a national drug testing programme in Irish sport this year.  The national governing bodies of sport have been consulted and are in favour of such a programme. Extensive discussions are being completed with relevant experts and the sports councils in Northern Ireland and Britain on their drug testing systems.  Details of the programme here will be announced at a later date.</P>

      <P>There are no grants paid directly to students suffering from specific learning difficulties such as dyslexia. However assistance is provided by way of remedial teacher apointments to schools to deal with specific learning difficulties.</P>
      <P>All trained remedial teachers in post-primary schools are capable of identifying pupils with such difficulties, to diagnose their specific problems and to devise appropriate programmes of treatment.  They are supported, where needed, by psychologists from the Department's psychological service.  A significant number of post-primary schools now has at least one trained remedial teacher on their staff.  Provision has been made in the 1995 budget for the appointment of 75 more remedial teachers in post-primary schools to bring the total appointed so far to 277.</P>
      <P>Special arrangements can be made for students with specific learning difficulties when sitting the certificate examinations. These include arranging for the examination paper to be read to the student and, where warranted, having the script dealt with by a special examiner.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the absence of a superannuation scheme for school caretakers employed under a grant scheme set up by my Department in 1979.  I have no plans to introduce such a scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="958" /> This question was explored fully in 1985 when a superannuation scheme was being established for secretaries in primary schools.  At the time the age profile of the caretakers employed under the scheme rendered the proposal impractical.  The position regarding the age profile has worsened in the interim due to the embargo on recruitment which applied from 1983.</P>
    <P>The expansion of caretaking services in primary schools is now being funded through a scheme of additional capitation grants.  Consequently there will be no expansion of the old scheme which might significantly lower the age profile.</P>
    <P>Through the discretion afforded by the capitation scheme, primary schools apply diverse arrangements for caretaking services.  These individualised arrangements preclude a central superannuation scheme.  They also preclude the construction of a common superannuation scheme through which younger persons employed under the new scheme might be joined with the small number under the old scheme that might elect to join a superannuation scheme if it were on offer.</P>

    <P>The provision of health education, including substance abuse education, at <Col N="959" /> primary school level is being reviewed by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, taking into account the experience of programmes developed in conjunction with a number of the regional health boards.</P>
    <P>A major programme of substance abuse education for post-primary schools, entitled &ldquo;On My Own Two Feet&rdquo; has been developed jointly by the Departments of Education and Health in conjunction with the Mater Dei Counselling Centre, Clonliffe Road, Dublin 3, with support from the Commission of the EU.  This programme was launched on 18 October 1994 and is being disseminated, as a resource, to post-primary schools generally.</P>
    <P>In order to support the dissemination process, training courses for teachers have been organised at 15 centres throughout the country in the school-year 1993-94 and at 11 centres throughout the country during the current school-year 1994-95.  In arranging the in-service courses, priority has been given to areas where substance abuse is regarded as a serious problem.  The programme has been evaluated independently with a positive outcome and it is highly regarded at EU level.  Additionally, the programme has been well received in the schools.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment on 30 September of a particular year. The enrolment of the school referred to <Col N="960" /> by the Deputy on 30 September 1993 was 135 which warrants a staffing of principal plus four assistants for the current school year.  The enrolment on 30 September 1994 was 113 which will warrant a staffing of principal plus three assistants for the 1995-96 school year. The school also has an amalgamation staffing concession, the services of a remedial teacher and a concessionary disadvantaged teacher, giving it a very favourable staffing ratio compared to other schools.</P>
      <P>In light of the fall in enrolment the school is due to lose one assistant teacher for the 1995-96 school year.  I regret that it will not be possible to allow the retention of this post.  The teacher has advised the Department that he will allow his name to be placed on the panel for redeployment to another school for the 1995-96 school year.</P>

      <P>The position regarding participation by primary schools in the stay safe programme is as follows: 99.7 per cent of schools have availed of teacher training, 80 per cent of schools have held information meetings for parents, and just under 60 per cent of schools are already teaching the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of schools teaching the programme can be expected to increase close to the number that hold parent meetings.  The experience is that there is a small time lag between the holding of parent meetings and actual commencement <Col N="962" /> of teaching in the school.  It would be reasonable to expect the number of schools teaching the programme to rise above 80 per cent in 1995.  The rate of implementation has been slower than originally anticipated due to some opposition to the programme.  However, I am satisfied that the rate of implementation has improved significantly over the past year.</P>
    <P>I remain firmly committed to the programme and my Department will continue to actively support the work of the Child Abuse Prevention Programme, CAPP in ensuring the maximum implementation rate in schools.  In particular I have committed specific funding to support the creation of a wider network of teachers capable of assisting with parent education and the further in-service needs of teachers.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Eastern Health Board has placed three young people, two aged 17 years and one aged 16 years, in bed and breakfast accommodation in Buckingham Street since January of this year. The placement of these young people in bed and breakfast accommodation in Buckingham Street was the only option available to the board at the relevant times.

    <P>I do not regard the placement of children in bed and breakfast accommodation as an acceptable response to the problem of youth homelessness.  If, in <Col N="964" /> cases of emergency, there is no alternative to the placement of a homeless child in this type of accommodation, my Department has advised health boards that immediate steps should be taken to secure an appropriate hostel, residential or family placement for the child.  The Eastern Health Board, in particular, is pursuing a number of strategies to reduce its use of bed and breakfast accommodation and the number of young people in such accommodation has been reduced significantly in the last few months.

      <P>It is difficult to be precise on the number of schools that have taken firm decisions not to implement the stay safe programme.  The most recent reports available to my Department suggest that nationally less than 5 per cent of schools are currently in that category.</P>
      <P>The number that may ultimately refuse to implement the programme may be gauged best from the returns for the Eastern Health Board area.  The programme was piloted in that area and has operated longest there.  In this area, the number of schools still reluctant to implement the programme has now fallen to 10 or 1.6 per cent of all schools in the area.  In time I would expect the national figures to correspond to the experience in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="970" /> School authorities expressing themselves as unwilling to implement the programme have volunteered a number of reasons for the position they have adopted.  These include criticism of the use of &ldquo;Yes/No&rdquo; feelings as a guide to conduct rather than the moral values of right and wrong.  It is also claimed that the programme interferes with child-family relationships, basic family values and parental rights and is of doubtful origin.  Some schools have simply indicated that they are unwilling to introduce the programme at present but may do so in the future.</P>
    <P>The introduction of the stay safe programme in primary schools is being organised by the Child Abuse Prevention Programme Company (CAPP) which operates under the auspices of the Eastern Health Board.  Through regular contact with CAPP my Department monitors progress and acquires data on the implementation rate.  CAPP obtains its information through regular contacts with the schools concerned.</P>
    <P>I remain firmly of the view that the stay safe programme is eminently suitable for implementation in primary schools.  I believe it is proving beneficial to all concerned in this very sensitive area.</P>

      <P>My Department, in co-operation with the Department of Health, has prepared a set of educational resource materials on HIV/AIDS for post-primary schools. These materials were disseminated to <Col N="971" /> all schools in October, 1990.  The purpose of the materials was to assist post-primary schools in developing education programmes on HIV/AIDS.  The focus of the resource materials was on pupils in post-primary schools, including the age range mentioned in the Deputy's question.  Training days for teachers on the use of the materials were held at 27 centres throughout the country.  These took place during the two years following the dissemination of the resource materials.  A summer school for teachers on HIV/AIDS, and on related issues, has been held each year since 1990.  The summer school is supported by the Departments of Education and Health. A survey of the use of the resource materials, conducted on behalf of the two Departments by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, suggests that the vast majority of post-primary schools use them and find them helpful. The feed-back from the training days and summer schools, mentioned above, supports this view.</P>
      <P>I have decided to proceed with arrangements for the introduction into all schools of relationships and sexuality education.  Schools have been requested to begin the process of developing their policies so that they may start to include relationships and sexuality education and wider aspects of social personal and health education in their curricula in the school year 1995-96.  I have no doubt that, with the co-operation of school authorities, teachers and parents, all children and young people will have access to good-quality programmes in this area.</P>

      <P>All schools are invited annually to participate in the vocational preparation and training programme by my Department at both VPT-1 and VPT-2 level, but the take-up to date has been predominantly in the vocational sector.  VPT-2 courses are more commonly known as post leaving certificate <Col N="975" /> courses, and are certified within the NCVA framework of awards.  The Department provides a pupil teacher ratio of 1.25 per group of 20 students to support the programme, together with additional grants towards equipment and materials.  In addition, quality assurance measures are funded through investment in in-career development and national assessment and certification via the National Council for Vocational Awards.</P>
      <P>The vocational training opportunity scheme needs to be co-ordinated locally on an area basis and with other services for the long term unemployed, to ensure that viable groups are maintained, and to make the best use possible of the range of services and education and training options in a locality.  For this reason, the programme is administered and funded through the vocational education committees.  Programmes are provided in separate class groups located in schools or in other centres. Vocational education committees are encouraged to involve all schools to the greatest extent possible consistent with the effective delivery of the scheme and to give them appropriate financial and other support.  Eligible unemployed people may also participate in vocational training opportunity schemes through attending second level courses in any school by arrangement with the vocational education committees concerned within the overall limit of places allocated to them.  My Department provides funding to the vocational education committees to cover tuition, administration and overhead costs, payment of allowances to students in lieu of social welfare entitlements, and provision towards the cost of books, meals and travel.  Staff development and assessment and certification measures are also funded.</P>

      <P>The audited figures for County Westmeath Vocational Education Committee for 1993 are not yet available.  The local government auditors visited County Westmeath Vocational Education Committee late in 1994 to carry out the 1993 audit. However, the audit has not yet been completed.  The local government auditor is responsible for the scheduling of each vocational education committee for audit.</P>
      <P>The monthly returns furnished to my Department by vocational education committees provide information on the main financial scheme only.  These returns showed that the vocational education committee was remaining within budget on the main financial scheme during 1993.  However, the 1993 annual return which was received in April 1994 showed that the vocational education committee had exceeded the main financial scheme budget by £79,000.</P>
      <P>The vocational education committee is also responsible for the running of ancillary programmes.  The programmes are not included on the monthly returns but are included in the annual financial statement.  The vocational education committee is required to provide separate annual returns for these programmes to the Department.</P>
      <P>The annual financial statement for 1993 showed that the unaudited deficit at the end of 1993 amounted to £450,000, an increase of £137,000 over the previous year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference between the overrun <Col N="982" /> of £79,000 on the main financial scheme and the increase in the deficit of £137,000 during 1993 is accounted for by overruns on some of the ancillary programmes run by County Westmeath Vocational Education Committee.</P>
    <P>The difference between the figures given in the monthly returns and the annual return has been attributed by the vocational education committee to the omission of some programme expenditure from the monthly figures.  The reasons for this omission are being examined as part of the overall consideration of the financial management of County Westmeath Vocational Education Committee.</P>

      <P>The 1995 abridged Estimates included an Exchequer allocation of £221.395 million for community employment, which with EC funding of £11 million approximately, resulted in a total provision of £232.3 million for the programme in 1995.  This would have provided for an average participation level of 35,000 throughout 1995 with an end-year participation level of around 26,000. However, in the context of the budget I secured additional Exchequer funding of £23.2 million, taking total funding for the year to approximately £255.7 million. This level of funding will provide an <Col N="985" /> average participation level of 38,500 on community employment (CE) throughout the year, with an end-year participation level of 35,000.</P>
      <P>Although the average participation on the programme during 1994 was 30,960, there were around 40,000 on the programme at the end of the year.  FÁS has been requested to manage the necessary reduction to an end-1995 level of 35,000 as sensitively as possible and with as little disruption as possible to its programme of existing or new projects.</P>

      <P>EU regulations governing area aid provide for payment for peas sown with the intention of harvesting them in their dry state.  Vining (green) peas, which are harvested in a green state and which are artificially dried, are not eligible for area aid.  I intend to press the EU Commission to try to have this crop included in the arable area payments system.</P>

      <P>The consultancy assignment is almost complete and I expect to receive the final report shortly.  With the benefit of this input I will as soon as possible be bringing a draft strategic plan for the forestry sector to the Government, and I expect to be in a position to publish the plan by the summer.</P>
