      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I do not wish to interrupt the House but I ask for your assistance.  All the questions on Northern Ireland put down by Fianna Fáil Members today were transferred to the Tánaiste and the next Question Time to him will be on 23 February. These are fundamental questions with which the Taoiseach's predecessor dealt directly.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Deputy not do me the courtesy of letting me know he intended to raise this matter?  It is most unusual, and probably unprecedented, that we have such an interruption when we are about to embark on Taoiseach's questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that but, in <Col N="542" /> our view, all the letters we received this morning, which refer to questions of fundamental importance on matters relating to Northern Ireland, have been passed by the Taoiseach to be answered during Question Time on 23 February.</P>

      <Qid>1</Qid>
      <asker>Miss Harney</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>his Government's views on the continuation of punishment beatings in Northern Ireland; if he has made direct representations to Sinn Fein and other parties about this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1497/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government deplores all punishment beatings, from whatever quarter.  I call upon those involved to put an end to this brutal activity, which has no part to play in the peace process in which we are all engaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I indicated in the House last week, I have raised this issue directly with the Sinn Féin Leader, who has appealed for an end to punishment beatings, as have Mr. David Ervine of the Progressive Unionist Party and Mr. Gary McMichael of the Ulster Democratic Party.  I believe we must all work closely together to bring an end to these violent attacks.  The Government will continue to take a close interest in this matter <Col N="544" /> and to use its influence, in whatever way it can, to bring about a complete halt to so-called punishment beatings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach will state if the Tánaiste insisted that all questions on Northern Ireland be transferred to him because I also had questions put down that were transfered? In the Taoiseach's meeting with Mr. Adams, did Mr. Adams express his condemnation of punishment beatings, not just appeal that they would end?</P>

      <asker>Miss Harney</asker>
      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>the detailed instructions issued to members of his Government on taking office; if he will have a copy of the instructions placed in the Dáil Library; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the Government Procedures Instructions &mdash; copies of which were circulated to Ministers, Ministers of State Barrett and Rabbitte and the Attorney General at the first meeting of the Government on 15 December last.</P>
      <P>The instructions were last revised in 1983.  They are currently being updated to take account of changes in procedures in the interim.  These include the proposals dealing with conflict of interest in the Ethics in Public Office Bill.</P>
      <P>When the instructions have been updated following the enactment of this Bill, it is proposed to publish them, in line with the commitment given in the Government's Programme for Renewal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I used the same wording that Minister of State Rabbitte used in Opposition so that is where I got the instructions from.  Will it be in order for Ministers to be involved in the management of companies or for Ministers to have shares in companies or has the Taoiseach instructed them to have trustees appointed to manage shares they might have in private companies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not in order for Ministers to be involved in the management of companies.  It is not, however, required of them to dispose of their shares.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not think it would be preferable if Ministers <Col N="546" /> had to appoint trustees to manage shares they might have?  Would it be in order, for example, for Ministers to hold shares in companies that might be the subject of applications for citizenship?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be desirable for Ministers to appoint trustees to manage their shareholdings wherever possible and appropriate.  I am not aware of any incidents to which the Deputy is referring in regard to Ministers holding shares in companies applying for passports.  If the Deputy has such information she should make it available to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply asking the Taoiseach about his policy position.  Is it acceptable that Ministers could be involved in AGMs and EGMs of companies as shareholders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe Ministers should take an active part in the management of companies, and attendance at EGMs and AGMs would come within that compass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach intend to ask his Ministers not to play such a role in companies in which they might have shares?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have indicated to Ministers that I would not wish them to be involved in any way in situations which might involve them in a possible conflict of interests.  The number of situations where that can arise are many and, to some degree, it is sensible to allow Ministers to assess that for themselves. In general I wish that they would not engage in the type of activities described by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the instructions issued to Ministers in relation to conflicts of interest also apply to programme managers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be no conflict of interest for programme managers either.  That is very important and <Col N="547" /> is being dealt with in the ethics Bill.  In the meantime I will be ensuring that the standards laid down in the ethics Bill with regard to the avoidance of conflicts of interest are adhered to by all programme managers and other senior Government appointees or those who have an influence on policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand from what the Taoiseach has just said that, in addition to the requirements proposed in the Ethics in Public Office Bill that conflicts of interest should be notified, the Taoiseach is bringing the matter further and warning all Ministers in his Cabinet that they are not to get involved in such situations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I stress it is for the Government to regulate its own internal proceedings.  I am most anxious to ensure that no Government member would engage in anything that would be perceived as involving a conflict of interest.  It is not possible to provide in advance, in theory or on some <i>a priori</i> grounds, for every conceivable circumstance where a conflict of interests might arise.  It is, therefore, wise that Ministers should use their own good judgment to ensure that the general principle of avoidance of conflicts of interest is adhered to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harney, I need finality on this question. There are many others and time for questions to the Taoiseach today is strictly limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very important matter and Government members raised this many times over the last couple of months.  What is the sanction for a Minister in breach of what the Taoiseach wishes him to do in relation to this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As anybody in politics knows, the ultimate sanction for a Minister or, indeed, anybody acting in a manner that is contrary to the wishes of <Col N="548" /> his colleagues is that he ceases to function in his job.  Intermediate steps can be taken where the breach is of a minor character and this, again, is a matter of judgment.  In our anxiety to make regulations of all kinds to govern everything, we must recognise that no set of regulations will cover every conceivable situation and there needs to be an area for judgment.  In the final analysis, this House, in choosing the person in whom it reposes its confidence as Taoiseach, is selecting such a person on the basis of ability to exercise judgment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I plan to visit the United States in March.  I will be meeting President Clinton in Washington in the St. Patrick's Day period, for discussions on Northern Ireland and other matters of mutual concern.  I very much look forward to this meeting, at which I will be renewing the invitation to President Clinton to visit Ireland.</P>
      <P>I also intend to have meetings during this visit with as many as possible of the friends of Ireland in political and business life and the Irish community in America.</P>
      <P>My programme for this visit is not yet finalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that it is important to renew the relationships built up by his predecessor, Deputy Reynolds, with the Irish-American community and, most importantly, with President Clinton and the Irish-American Economic Board? The Taoiseach will be aware that the hasty change of Government here and the changes in Congress give cause for great concern among Irish-Americans. Will the Taoiseach outline how he intends to address that?  Does he think it desirable that he should spend a considerable amount of time with our friends in the United States over the <Col N="549" /> next few months as we work on the framework document on the North and other important issues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is yes. I will be meeting not just President Clinton but also senior figures in both Houses of Congress which, as the Deputy said, has a new majority party. I will also be chairing a meeting of the Irish-American Economic Board while in Washington.  I regard the activities of the Irish-American Economic Board as of great importance in promoting investment in Ireland and a better understanding of the potential opportunities in the Irish economy among American businessmen generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The framework document may not be published by the time the Taoiseach goes to the US, but will he give us his views on how we could facilitate a close involvement in the political dialogue by the representatives of the Loyalist organisations prior to its publication?  Will the Taoiseach be talking to some of their colleagues in the US on how we could achieve success in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Ahern on his ingenuity in managing to get in the question he wanted to ask.  I am happy to answer it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Taoiseach not answer it in the first place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Because, unlike the Deputies opposite, I believe in sharing responsibility within the partnership Government.  I do not believe in doing everything myself.  Perhaps it was proclivity towards trying to do everything himself that led to some of the difficulties experienced by Deputy Ahern's predecessor.  I am most anxious to facilitiate participation in the political process by the political organisations representing the Loyalist community.  I referred to two by name, the Progressive Unionist Party and the Ulster <Col N="550" /> Democratic Party, in a recent reply to Deputy Harney.  I will do anything I believe is appropriate to bring them into the political process.  For example, I support the moves at the Forum to be involved in Outreach in relation to the Loyalist community &mdash; a number of people who do not represent Loyalist political parties but are of a Loyalist political persuasion have already attended and taken part in sessions of the Forum.  That is welcome.  I wish to express the view also to the British Government that it should do everything possible to involve Loyalist political organisations, as well as Sinn Féin, in constructive dialogue.  If there is anything I can do while I am in the United States that is relevant in that regard, I will most certainly do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  All we want is to be helpful on these issues, but if we are frustrated by only being able to ask questions on a monthly basis, it will become impossible.  I know that is not the Taoiseach's wish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that, in the run up to the publication of the framework document and, more importantly, after its publication, there will be a necessity to find some mechanism of outlining the plans and discussions that take place which would be helpful to the Loyalist organisations? It is frustrating when people believe that there is some plan &mdash; I doubt that there is &mdash; to frustrate their efforts at participation. Could the Taoiseach find a mechanism to allow people participate at an early date?  An early date is more appropriate as, after publication, the Taoiseach may run into difficulties which is not what he nor I would wish. I suggest that prior to publication he look at ways in which he could reach an understanding with Loyalist and Unionist groups as to what can be achieved and how their concerns can be properly dealt with.</P>

Would he further accept that the programme <i>A Government of Renewal</i> was put together hastily and without the same care and deliberation as the previous programme?

      <P>The Government is fully committed to a programme of equality legislation and action to promote equality in society.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform outlined this to the National Economic and Social Forum on 25 January where he dealt <i>inter alia</i> with the follow up to the Commission on the Status of Women report, the enactment of the Employment Equality and the Equal Status Bills and the implementation of gender balance on State boards, funding for family counselling and mediation services, the implementation of measures of childcare, and support and resources for the implementation of the task force report on the travelling community, among a number of other matters. There is no doubt about this Government's commitment to equality in society.  This Government's programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i> includes a large number of important matters which were not included in the programme of the previous Government, including more detailed fiscal policy parameters than existed then, a commitment to a White Paper on training and <Col N="555" /> reform of the Ministers and Secretaries Act.</P>

      <P>I support the participation of those bodies in the National Economic and Social Forum which has considerable input in many of the matters being dealt with in the development of social partnership.  I would like to see them more closely involved, together with the self-employed and others, in the framing of the programme following the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and having an input to the deliberations of the National Economic and Social Council which will do some of the ground work for the next programme. This is a matter I will consider in some detail and would welcome views from all sides of the House.  There are appropriate degrees of involvement by different organisations.  Obviously the question of strict pay negotiations is a matter for employers and employees but there are other aspects of the programme where wider involvement would be appropriate and I would welcome views on that.</P>

It had reservations about the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i>, it opposed the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and had trenchant views about the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> On 16 May the Taoiseach described it at the Ard Fheis as a complacent and cosy consensus which damaged jobs.  He said Fine Gael had the courage to oppose the programme.  Will he admit that his replies to two questions today represent a blatant U-turn once again?  Will he give a commitment to continue to meet the social partners in the future?  He was always against the idea of social partners and considered them to be outside the political system.

      <P>As the Fine Gael amendment to this motion says, we support the concept of social partnership.  We believe that the pay terms in this programme are good and reasonable from the point of view of the commercial sector of our economy.  The pay terms for the public service are also reasonable and the special pay increases which have been postponed must now be paid.</P>
      <P>On the amendment Fine Gael tabled, which is reported at column 738 of the Official Report of 19 February, I indicated a number of areas where I had reservations about the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> I am glad to be in a position to do something about ensuring that those reservations can be taken into account when the next agreement is being negotiated towards the end of 1996.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 25, 26, 41, 81 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>The policy document <i>A Government of Renewal</i> makes clear that the Government is committed to holding a referendum on divorce in this year.</P>
      <P>A Cabinet sub-committee chaired by me has been established to make recommendations to the Government on proposals for the referendum.  The sub-committee has begun work on the matter and will be reporting to the Government as quickly as possible.  The details of the Government's decision on the constitutional referendum proposal will be made known in due course by way of publication of the Bill to amend the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The definitive proposals of the Government for an amendment of the Constitution on divorce must, of course, be in the form of a Bill since a precondition of the holding of any referendum is the initiation of a Bill in the House. The date of publication of that Bill will be determined largely by the date on which the Government proposes to hold the referendum.  The timing of the referendum will take account, as may be necessary, of the case that is under appeal to the Supreme Court concerning provisions in the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.</P>
      <P>The cost of holding the referendum is provided for out of the central fund which is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision of £500,000 is made in my Department's Estimates for a Government information programme in the run-up to the divorce referendum.  That <Col N="564" /> figure is contained in the 1995 Book of Estimates.  The heads of expenditure will be on similar lines to those in recent referenda which provides for press and billboard advertisement and information booklets and leaflets.</P>
    <P>A considerable framework of laws on marriage breakdown already exists by way of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989 and other legislation concerning maintenance and protection of spouses and children and protection of the family home.  The White Paper on Marital Breakdown &mdash; 1992 &mdash; gives an overview of those laws and of administrative procedures such as legal aid, mediation and counselling. Since publication of that paper major advances have been made on implementation of measures to better protect and support families.  Many of those measures are the responsibility of my Department.  The matters currently in progress give a good idea of how much progress is being made.  In that context I should like to mention that the Family Law Bill, 1994 is before the House at Report Stage.  It has measures aimed at protecting and safeguarding the institution of marriage.  It raises the age of marriage from 16 years to 18 years and provides for notice of marriage.  It provides substantial powers to the courts to deal with financial consequences of marriage breakdown in cases where a foreign decree of divorce is entitled to recognition in the State.</P>
    <P>In substance those powers will be the same as the powers in any legislation on domestic divorce.  They include wide powers in relation to maintenance, inheritance, and property generally, including the family home and pensions. The Bill repeals and re-enacts with amendments provisions in the Judicial Separation Act of 1989.  The amendments include new provisions giving the courts powers in separation proceedings to make orders in relation to pensions.</P>
    <P>Provisions dealing comprehensively with the tax aspects of marriage breakdown &mdash; capital gains, capital acquisition and probate tax and stamp duty &mdash; have been drafted and have been tabled <Col N="565" /> for incorporation into the Family Law Bill, 1994 by way of amendments on Report Stage.  They will be model provisions for any divorce legislation.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare is preparing heads of legislation to ensure that no spouse will be disadvantaged in terms of his or her social welfare entitlements as a result of his or her legal status being changed from married, separated or deserted to divorced.  Those provisions are required as a follow-on of provisions in the Family Law Bill, 1994 and, again, would be model provisions in the case of provision in our law for domestic divorce.</P>
    <P>The Maintenance Act, 1994 was enacted by me in November 1994 and enables ratification of EU and UN Conventions which will make it easier to recover maintenance from a person living abroad.  Arrangements are now being made by the Department of Foreign Affairs to have the conventions ratified.</P>
    <P>The domestic violence Bill is at an advanced stage of drafting and will be published as soon as possible.  It will strengthen the powers of the court to make orders for protection of persons and will strengthen the powers of arrest of the Garda in such cases.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the Bill to put the scheme of civil legal aid and advice on a statutory footing will be published in the next few days.</P>
    <P>A sum of £6.2 million has been provided in this year's Book of Estimates for the Legal Aid Board.  The unprecedented increase in funding which I secured in 1994 allowed the board to provide a total of ten new full-time and four part-time law centres.  The 1995 funding will also allow the opening of additional new centres.</P>
    <P>A special provision of £750,000, an increase of 150 per cent on the previous year's funding was provided in 1994 for the assistance of bodies involved in marriage guidance and counselling to enable them to expand their services and a sum of £750,000 is also provided in this year's Estimates.</P>
    <P>Development plans for the family <Col N="566" /> mediation service were also put in place in 1994 with significantly increased funding of £300,000.  That figure is proposed to be maintained in 1995 to allow for further developments.</P>
    <P>All avenues of approach to the problem of marriage breakdown are under active consideration by the Government. The policy is to address the problem as comprehensively as possible so as to meet all needs.  In that context the policy considerations are not confined to questions of reform of the law but extend also to the areas such as tax and social welfare codes, our education programmes and voluntary services.  Submissions continue to be made to me from persons and groups in support of changes to tackle the various issues involved in marriage breakdown and these are being taken into account in the formulation of policy within my Department.</P>
    <P>During the previous Government I consulted with the leaders of the Progressive Democrats, the Green Party and the Fianna Fáil Party including its present leader.  However, I would be happy to consult with the leader of every party who wishes to meet me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, the Programme for Government provides that the referendum will be held in 1995. The final date to be determined must await consideration of a number of matters, not least of which is the still pending appeal in a case challenging the constitutionality of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  In the High Court the claim of alleged unconstitutionality of the Act was unsuccessful but an appeal was made to the Supreme Court which is still pending. I understand an application is to be made to the Supreme Court to seek a speedy hearing of that action but I cannot say or prejudge what date may be <Col N="567" /> fixed for the hearing of that appeal or when that judgement may be given. Those are the considerations that apply. I can assure the House that it is the Government's intention to proceed with the referendum as soon as all necessary procedures, including the disposition of that appeal, are in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend dealing with the issues concerning the family home remaining to be resolved which I know he is very anxious to resolve in the first instance?</P>
      <P>Following the unconstitutionality of the previous Bill has the Minister any proposals to remedy the position, given that no action can be taken in this area? What are the Minister's plans regarding the position of the family home in advance of holding a referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The position regarding the family home and its disposition on marital breakdown is covered in the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  The intent of the matrimonial homes Bill, which, regrettably, was found unconstitutional, was to deal with the disposition of the family home in non-breakdowns.  Under the terms of the 1989 Act the family home and its contents, the family business, the family farm, bank accounts, insurance policies and all aspects of matrimonial property are on the table for division, as appropriate, at the discretion of the courts.  Those dispositions of the family home, family business and so on are dealt with daily in the Circuit Courts. No new action in the event of marital breakdown is required in the case of the family home.  The only aspect of property not covered under the 1989 Act is the difficult question of pensions and that remaining item of property is being addressed in the Family Law Bill, on Report Stage in the House tomorrow. On completion of that Bill, all property, including pensions and the matrimonial home and its contents will be available for disposition by the courts in the event <Col N="568" /> of separation and in the event of divorce. This will happen immediately in the case of foreign divorces recognised here and ultimately, if the referendum is passed, in the case of domestic divorces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will realise that social welfare entitlements are very important in this debate.  Is it his intention that legislation will be brought before the House and passed in advance of the proposed referendum or is it merely a matter to which the Government is committed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that legislation on social welfare questions, on which I had many lengthy discussions with the Deputy in his prior incarnation, will be brought to the House and completed before a referendum.  The thrust of such legislation will be to ensure &mdash; and I understand it will &mdash; that no person will lose out in a social welfare context as a result of a change in status from married to separated or deserted to divorced.  The question as to whether a separate Bill will be introduced to deal with that or if it will be incorporated in the main social welfare Bill has yet to be determined.  It is intended to enact such legislation and to have it in place in advance of the referendum.  Initially the application of such legislation will be confined to the case of foreign divorces recognised here because, obviously, one could not introduce social welfare legislation dealing with domestic divorces unless and until the proposed referendum is held and passed.  The format of the legislation in terms of laying down the rules in the case of foreign divorces recognised here will be the format and base plan extended to domestic divorces in the event of a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote when a referendum takes place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 34 together.</P>
      <P>I have previously announced in the House that I am bringing forward legislation to extend legal redress against discrimination in relation to employment and non-employment areas.  The proposed legislation will apply to persons with disabilities as well as to other groups, and will prohibit discrimination in employment, in the provision of goods, facilities and services, including recreational facilities, entertainment, transport and professional services, accommodation and the disposal of property.</P>
      <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, which I appointed in 1993, is considering what additional action is necessary to advance the interests of people with disabilities. When I receive its recommendations, I shall examine the general situation to determine what other measures, in addition to the proposed anti-discrimination legislation, may be required by me or by other Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to the achievement of the 3 per cent quota for the employment of people with disabilities throughout the public sector. The latest information available to me indicates that the quota has been reached in the Civil Service and I am continuing my efforts to ensure that it <Col N="570" /> is reached throughout the wider public sector.</P>
    <P>In 1994, the Government provided £2 million for a pilot programme of supported employment of people with disabilities in viable business projects.  A sum of £100,000 was also provided last year to assist voluntary organisations to improve transport arrangements for people with disabilities, particularly for adapting vehicles to facilitate easier transport of people with disabilities, to services and facilities.  My Department was involved in planning the expenditure in relation to these projects.</P>
    <P>An interdepartmental transport accessibility committee is operating under the aegis of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications with a view to ensuring that transport in general is made more accessible to people with disabilities.  My Department is represented on that committee.</P>
    <P>I assume the reference to &ldquo;equality proofing&rdquo; is intended to ascertain whether the proposals and recommendations emanating from the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities will be disability proofed.  I understand that this issue is currently under consideration by the commission and will be addressed in its report which is expected to be completed in the next 12 months or so.  I look forward to studying the commission's views on that question and, in particular, on how the practical aspects such as costs, personnel practices and similar considerations, might be accommodated in an overall strategy.</P>
    <P>I recently attended a very useful session of the National Economic and Social forum on equality proofing and I will ensure that its findings are taken into account in policy formulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of a recent survey carried out by the Irish Wheelchair Association which found that 74 per cent of its members are not involved in education or training of any kind while 87.5 per cent, nearly 90 per cent, are not in open employment? Does he agree those figures represent an inequality which should be addressed now?  I asked what proposals the Minister has to tackle this problem to ensure that people with a disability can avail of an opportunity to get a job at present. The Minister said he is awaiting the findings of the commission and I am certain they will be comprehensive and valuable, notwithstanding that, we are approaching a budget and in every budget there is an opportunity to do something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the forthcoming budget, will the Minister ask his colleagues to take action to at least begin to repair the disgraceful and discrediting position whereby many people with disability cannot get employment?  As the <Col N="572" /> Civil Service has reached the 3 per cent target &mdash; the Department for which I had responsibility has exceeded it &mdash; in advance of the findings of the Commission, would he not consider setting the target at 5 per cent and lead in this regard?  Notwithstanding that the Commission will produce a comprehensive report, further action involving cost and expenditure should be taken in the context of the forthcoming budget.  That is what I would like to hear the Minister talking about.</P>

      <P>I agree that the rate of employment of people with disabilities is unsatisfactory, but this has not arisen since 15 December 1994; that position has pertained for some time.  I am taking positive steps by introducing anti-discrimination legislation that will address discriminatory practices against people with disabilities, something which has never been done before.  Major work in that regard was done during the tenure of the previous Government and I am anxious that it continues and that the anti-discrimination legislation for people with disabilities is introduced as quickly as possible.  I am not aware of the report to which Deputy Woods referred, but no doubt it will be brought to my notice and I will examine it carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as quotas are concerned, my primary concern is to bring the public sector, apart from the Civil Service, up to the 3 per cent level.  At my request major initiatives have been undertaken in the Department of Health in the contest of health boards, voluntary hospitals and so on and in the Department of the Environment in the context of local authorities.  It would be a major step forward if the broader public service could be brought up to the 3 per cent level achieved in the Civil Service. I agree that the Department for which Deputy Woods has responsibility has been to the forefront in going out of its way to employ people with disabilities; it has been a trail blazer in that regard. After many years of effort, the Civil <Col N="573" /> Service met the 3 per cent quota during the period of the last Government.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> addresses the question of the private sector in this regard.  In the context of that programme my Department will continue to discuss with people in the private sector particularly larger firms the methods they are prepared to undertake to introduce a quota arrangement. The question of quota imposition, such as that which applies in Europe, is also under examination in my Department. The question of quota imposition, such as that which applies in Europe, is also under examination in my Department. The budget will soon be introduced and I will communicate with my colleagues in Government to ascertain what can be achieved in that regard.</P>

      <Quest>the reason equality was omitted from the programme, A Government of Renewal; if he intends to implement all of the elements included in the equality programme in the Programme for a Partnership Government, 1993 to 1997, or the Programme for Competitiveness and Work, 1994 to 1999; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Keogh's question as it affords me an opportunity to put on record in the House that this Government is firmly committed to the equality agenda of my Department contained in the last Programme for Government and indeed to the range of equality commitments enshrined in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In fact A Government of Renewal adds to the existing equality agenda providing as it does commitments to pay <Col N="574" /> social welfare equality payments and build on the work of the Commission on the Status of People with Disability.</P>
    <P>In addressing the National Economic and Social Forum on Wednesday last, 25 January, I outlined in some detail the Government's manifesto for equality on which I will be focusing for the remaining lifetime of this Dáil.</P>
    <P>The measures which I propose to bring forward in the short to medium term would include co-ordinated follow-up to the report on the Second Commission on the Status of Women; the introduction of a new broad ranging employment equality Bill and an equal status Bill, which will prohibit discrimination on a wide range of grounds; the fullest implementation of the requirement of gender balance on State boards; funding for family counselling and mediation services, and civil legal aid in conjunction with a major family law reform programme, culminating in a divorce referendum; implementing measures on childcare, and genderproofing of CSF expenditure; support and resources for the Task Force on the Travelling Community and action on foot of its report, and steps to facilitate the establishment of the Council for the Status of People with Disabilities, and ongoing support to the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department will be taking action arising from the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> on a range of measures including promotion of the adoption of equal opportunities policies and programmes and positive action measures for women throughout the public sector; the monitoring and review of the code of practice on sexual harassment in consultation with the Employment Equality Agency; consideration, in consultation with the social partners, of the question of using the processes of public funding and the award of contracts to promote equal opportunities; the introduction of child care measures envisaged under the CSF and the development of a programme to implement measures arising out of the <Col N="575" /> report of the working group on child care for working parents.</P>
    <P>The work of my Department on all these issues is being progressed and a number of measures have already been put into effect.  As recently as yesterday, I signed the commencement order and regulations which brought the Maternity Protection Act, 1994 into effect.  Later today I will introduce the Second Stage debate on the Adoptive Leave Bill in this House.  Recent months have also seen progress with the publication of the code of practice on measures to protect the dignity of women and men at work and the launch of a major pilot scheme on child care for disadvantaged areas by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not consider it outrageous that the subject of equality was omitted from the Programme for Government?  Does he not agree that the way to show the Government is firmly committed to equality measures is to include the programme on equality in the agreement between the partners in Government?  Surely the combined wisdom of Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left should have been able to take account of the importance of such provisions.  As a result of this omission, is the Minister not disappointed by the commitment of his colleagues in Government?  I received a copy of the Minister's speech to the National Economic and Social Forum which outlines a number of the measures he considers worthy and which I agree are necessary.  Nevertheless, on commitment to equality, does he not consider that those should be enshrined in the agreement drawn up by the Government parties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure most people would agree that the test of the success of a policy is the extent to which it is implemented and not its mere inclusion in a document.  The reason for the exclusion of equality from the document is regrettable and was explained by the Taoiseach earlier this afternoon.  When <Col N="576" /> I addressed the National Economic and Social Forum I enunciated at length the equality programmes to which the Government and I are fully committed. We will be content to be judged on what we produce.  Frequently, in the past programmes have not been fulfilled or brought to fruition.  It is my intention while I am Minister for Equality and Law Reform and a member of the Government to implement those measurements which I enunciated in detail.  In time we will be judged on our results rather than on our promises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach state in the House that we should measure the progress of this Government against the agreement drawn up?  It is difficult to measure progress when there is nothing with which to compare it.  I accept the bona fides of the Minister and the commitment given in his speech last Wednesday but against what are we to measure progress?  Are we to measure it against every speech every Minister delivers in the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>My progress and success in this Ministry will, no doubt, be measured against the detailed policy provision of a key note speech delivered to the National Economic and Social Forum on Wednesday, 25 January 1995. I will be happy to have the results of the equality issues of this Department and this Government measured against that speech in which I deliberately set out to remedy the unfortunate omission from the programme of the equality intentions of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask the Minister about the importance of long term social security cover for women in the home.  This matter has been dealt with in the Report of the National Pensions Board which proposed a wide range of measures for women in the home to ensure that they can participate in the pensions system and not remain as dependants of their husbands, not only up to but beyond pension age.  One of the first issues which needs to be tackled is the post-pension age years to enable women who work full time in the home to accumulate entitlements which would ultimately entitle them to pensions on retirement.  Many improvements have taken place in the past and, as a result, the gap in the financial cost is not so great as it used to be.  What measures are proposed by the Minister and the Government to provide that equality of treatment for women?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Legal Aid Board that it does not maintain information on all applicants for legal services in a manner which would enable it to give the precise percentage of its clients who are women.  However, from experience they estimate that about 75 per cent of its clients are women.</P>
      <P>The Bill to put the scheme of civil legal aid and advice on a statutory basis has been drafted, and I am glad to be able to inform the House that it will be published very shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Legal advice on civil law matters in general, including matters which may become the subject of proeedings before tribunals is available under the scheme since its establishment in 1979. However, legal aid is not available for the purpose of proceedings before tribunals. That policy, which has been <Col N="579" /> maintained by successive Governments since 1979, has been the subject of review in the context of preparation of the legislation concerning the scheme. The policy details enshrined in the legislation will be announced in the normal way by way of publication of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said in reply to an earlier question that he expects to have the Bill within a matter of days. Can the Minister assure the House that the board will be independent in its operation and in the appointment of its staff?  It is important that the board should operate as an independent semi-State body under the aegis and general guidance of the Minister and arrange for the appointment of its staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in accordance with the usual practice, must await the publication of the Bill to see what the precise nature of these structures will be.  Suffice to say that the board has always operated independently to the extent that there was no interference by me or any previous Minister for Justice who was responsible for the civil legal aid service, so far as individual applications for approval for legal aid in a particular case was concerned. Obviously, there would be no independence so far as the administration of the board is concerned for the simple reason that one is dealing with the expenditure of substantial amounts of taxpayers' money for which I am answerable to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under no circumstances could I avoid answering questions on expenditure of money or on procedures in the Legal Aid Board by saying that the board is independent and that I wash my hands of its affairs.  Public money is being expended and the position of the Legal Aid Board could not be compared with the position of a semi-State body which is running businesses and so on.  The Legal Aid Board is an arm of the State funded by the taxpayer.  The Minister is answerable in the House to the Members.  When I was an Opposition <Col N="580" /> backbencher I raised questions about this and I have no doubt my colleagues opposite will do likewise and I must answer them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I trust the Minister will understand the fears on this side of the House, particularly following the direction &mdash; mentioned here last week &mdash; to staff not to inform their superiors on the board of a discussion which had taken place with an official from the Department of Justice.  That was an extraordinary event.  I trust that under the provisions of the forthcoming Bill that will not take place again because it would lead to the destruction of the board.  The board is <i>ultra vires</i> the Department unless there is some extraordinary case. I am a little uneasy about the reply the Minister has given and I would ask him to give much thought to the matter before finalising the Bill.  We will have an opportunity to discuss that Bill shortly but I would like the Minister's assurance that the operation of the board on a day-to-day basis will be truly independent.</P>

Some of the quotes he gave on the Monaghan transaction are not in accordance with the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge the Deputy to exercise caution in accepting quotes, as he appears to do, from newspapers which are inaccurate in very many respects, not least of which was the statement that the chairperson of the board and six persons were about to resign, a statement that was immediately denied by the chairman.  He has not resigned and neither has any other member.  The procedures adopted by the staff of my Department, experienced, senior, knowledgeable people, were perfectly in <Col N="581" /> order and undertaken in an exemplary manner.  The taking of papers was done by prior arrangement with the chief executive of that board.  The matter will be dealt with in greater detail in response to a later question, assuming that question is reached.</P>

Will it provide that the Legal Aid Board will be independent in the exercise of its functions &mdash; for example, in areas such as choosing its staff?  The Minister will be aware there have been many complaints about alleged ministerial interference in this area, some of which emanated from the Legal Aid Board itself.  On the newspaper article referred to by my colleague, Deputy Woods, the allegation is that confidential files were taken away as a result of a visit that took place at a time when the chief executive and deputy chief executive were not present. The person who called from the Minister's Department asked the staff not to mention he had called and to give no details of his visit.  Is that true?</P>

      <Quest>the current situation regarding his request to all political parties to indicate their positions regarding the issue of the dual mandate as outlined by the Second Commission on the Status of Women; the way in which he intends to pursue this reform; and the steps, if any, he and his Department have taken in order to pursue it to date in 1994 and 1995.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <P>The current position in relation to the dual mandate is as outlined in the First Progress Report on the Implementation of the Recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women which was published in June 1994.  Political parties were asked, in advance of the publication of the progress report, for their views on the matter and their responses were taken into account in the compilation of the report.  I understand that the Chief Whip also discussed the issue with all party Whips who felt this was not within their area of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="583" /> The second progress report is being prepared and the views of the political parties who did not respond previously have been sought again.  I would urge those parties to let the secretariat of the monitoring committee have their views as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>An amendment to the law to prohibit the holding of a dual mandate would be the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever about the Minister's copy of the report, mine is certainly gathering dust.  Would the Minister agree that his credibility is being tested by lack of attention in progressing the issue of the dual mandate and the whole area of equality?  I understood that the main objections by the last Government in terms of the dual mandate were from the Fianna Fáil party.  Given that we have a new Government which does not include Fianna Fáil, will the Minister promise real progress in implementing the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women as they refer to this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>On the issue of the dual mandate we must, in the first instance at least, achieve consensus.  According to my information, the Fianna Fáil Party, the Labour Party and the Green Party are the only parties that replied to the query.  The Fine Gael Party and the Progressive Democrats have not replied.  The response of the Fianna Fáil Party is that it accepts the practice of Deputies exercising a dual mandate in terms of posts on local authorities except where they are appointed Ministers or Minister of State.  Members of Fianna Fáil who are selected as European Parliament members may stand for election to the Dáil or Seanad but, if successful, they must resign their seat in the European Parliament.  The Labour Party position is that it considers undesirable the holding of seats simultaneously in the European Parliament and the Dáil.  The Labour Party accepts <Col N="584" /> the practice of Deputies exercising a dual mandate in terms of seats on local authorities.  The Green Party supports the commission's recommendation in this regard.  I urge the Fine Gael Party and the Progressive Democrats to let us have their replies so that the matter may be considered in an overall context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fascinated and intrigued to hear the Minister say that consensus is required on this matter.  Is it a new departure in the operation of Government that there be consensus on matters of policy?  It certainly is unique in my experience in the Dáil for a measure to be held up for such a long time because we have not been able to reach consensus.  Consultation has normally been the order of the day.  Is this a new departure or is the Minister equating consultation with consensus? This has great implications &mdash; positive implications &mdash; for Government and it should not be held up.</P>

It is a position that has pertained in the country for a very long time.  Replies have not yet been received from all the political parties, who, no doubt, are examining the issue.  Obviously the broadest possible consensus must be sought initially.  When the positions of all political parties are known I will bring the matter to Government for examination and determination on the action which may be appropriate, depending on the responses received. This is not an issue which is likely to be determined or adjudged on in the short term.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that but this is my first question.  Has the Minister set a deadline for the submission of the views of the parties which have not yet responded to these requests?  Will he continue the process of consensus in other policy areas?  I look forward to being consulted on other areas. Obviously the fact that some people do not want to respond should not be allowed to impede progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not set any deadline for political parties in so far as replying to this issue is concerned.  I believe they will reply, and it is a matter for each political party to consider its policy position.  I ask them to convey their policies in this regard to me as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I will always seek to achieve consensus on all policy matters where possible, and that certainly includes Deputy Sargent. I consulted the Deputy on the divorce issue and I will be happy to continue this process in regard to other key issues.  The more consensus we can achieve on this island the better.  That has always been, and will continue to be, my aim in achieving policy objectives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure of the question number but I certainly read the report in one of the files.  The question may be grouped with other questions but if the Deputy has a particular question on this issue I do not mind dealing with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="586" />
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not get a clear reply from the Minister on whether the section of the report in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> to which I referred was correct. Did an official from the Minister's Department call to the offices of the Legal Aid Board, remove confidential files and tell the staff to keep quiet about his visit?  If this is true, was that official acting with the sanction of the Minister?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I received representations from two trade unions which represent the staff employed by the Legal Aid Board, namely MSF and SIPTU, alleging that the appointment of the head of the Legal Aid Board's new office in Monaghan had not been made in accordance with the proper procedures. I felt I had to take the allegations by the two trade unions seriously and after consultation with the Department of Finance I appointed a former departmental secretary, Mr. Keegan, to conduct an inquiry into the allegations, to ascertain whether there was anything in them, whether the appointment had been made properly in accordance with the procedures and to report back to me on that issue.</P>
      <P>To enable Mr. Keegan to conduct his inquiry in a proper manner I requested a principal officer in my Department to call, by prior arrangement with the chief executive of the Legal Aid Board, to the office and obtain the file in connection with the appointment.  The expression &ldquo;confidential files&rdquo; is pejorative. The official was asked to obtain, and did so by prior arrangement, the file in connection with the appointment. This was required to enable the referee, Mr. Keegan, to conduct his inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no question of this being done without the knowledge of the chief executive &mdash; it was done with the prior arrangement of the chief executive. Admittedly, the chief executive was not there at the time but he knew that the official was coming for this file, which was duly sealed and handed over to Mr. Keegan to enable him to conduct his <Col N="587" /> inquiry on the propriety or otherwise of the appointment to the Monaghan post. There was no question of the officials being told not to tell their senior officers about the matter &mdash; they knew about it as it was done with their prior knowledge &mdash; but they were requested not to talk to anybody about the inquiries which the principal officer had made about what had occurred in connection with the appointment.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise clearly that nothing I am saying here is to be taken as a suggestion that there was something wrong with the Monaghan appointment. I have no idea whether there was anything wrong with that appointment, and the purpose of the inquiry by the referee, Mr. Keegan, is to ascertain whether there was anything wrong with it.  When I receive his report on this issue I will make it public and give it to the Deputy and the House in the ordinary way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that this visit was carried out by prior arrangement with the chief executive. Did the chief executive agree a specific day for the official to call?  Is the Minister clearly telling me that the newspaper reports to the effect that the official who called instructed the staff to say nothing about his visit and not to give details to anybody about his visit is false?  The Minister referred to the referee, the independent adjudicator appointed to ascertain the rights and wrongs of the case.  Can the Minister say from where the referee is operating and whether he is receiving remuneration from any source for his services?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that in accordance with normal procedures the referee gets remuneration for the inquiry.  He is a former Secretary of the Department of Labour and is very well experienced in all matters relating to the <Col N="588" /> appointments of staff and ensuring that they are carried out in a proper and fair manner.  He operates from an office provided for him in my Department. According to the information given to me about the visit by the principal officer concerned, the allegations in the Sunday newspaper about the principal officer in my Department are totally incorrect and untrue.  That is the information furnished to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 29 and 90 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planned equal status legislation will deal with discrimination on grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, disability, race, colour, nationality, national or ethnic origin and membership of the travelling community.  The Bill will cover discrimination on these grounds in the areas of education, provision of goods and services and disposal of property or accommodation.  Services will be defined broadly to include access to public places, banking and insurance services, entertainment and facilities for <Col N="589" /> refreshment and transport.  The Equal Status Bill will also address discrimination on the aforementioned grounds by registered clubs against members or applicants for membership.  There will be a separate Bill &mdash; the Employment Equality Bill&mdash; to deal with discrimination in the workplace.</P>
    <P>The Equal Status Bill is currently being drafted and I intend to bring it forward as soon as possible.  I totally reject the suggestion in Deputy Molloy's question that the provisions in the Bill on education are &ldquo;regressive&rdquo;.  This implication is misconceived.  These provisions will simply preserve existing arrangements for denominational schools pending the introduction of comprehensive legislation by the Minister for Education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>In his statement to the National Economic and Social Forum last Wednesday &mdash; to make up for the omission in the Programme for Government &mdash; the Minister said the Equal Status Bill would not be the easiest legislation to frame or steer through the Oireachtas; that is probably the reason it is so long in coming.  What is the reason for the difficulty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The grounds covered by the intended legislation are broadly based.  They include gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, disability, race, colour, nationality, national or ethnic origin and membership of the travelling community. The range of matters addressed is also wide.  When the legislation is eventually published it will be seen to be complex both in respect of the groups it seeks to protect and the areas in which it seeks to provides cover.  It will be essential to provide for exceptions to cover these.  It has been particularly difficult to frame the legislation and one has to be careful to ensure that the net is not cast too wide or narrow and that the right pitch is achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nonetheless the broad outline of the <Col N="590" /> scheme has now been prepared and forwarded to the Attorney General's office for drafting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, I do not think the Minister answered the question; he may have learned something from his colleague across the Chamber in a previous existence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the lack of progress has more to do with the lack of commitment rather than with the lack of resources?</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding what he said, does the Minister agree that the passage of this Bill is inordinately slow?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to the Deputy's allegation or suggestion of a lack of commitment no previous Government conceived the concept of legislation of this type until it was initiated, drafted and worked out in great detail with great difficulty by the previous Fianna Fáil-Labour Government. I hope it will be brought to fruition by the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Previous Governments did not conceive the idea, let alone take any tentative initial steps to draft, conceive or bring it to fruition.  This legislation is now at an advanced stage and the Government is committed to it.  The Taoiseach reiterated the commitment I gave in connection with it.  The Bill was prepared with great difficulty because of the complexity of the multifarious issues involved.  It was approved by the previous Government and sent to the Attorney General's office for drafting.  I cannot say how long it will take to draft it but the work is ongoing.  Consultations between my Department and the Attorney General's office are also ongoing as are the consultations with the numerous interest groups concerned about various aspects, including IBEC <Col N="591" /> and the ICTU, to mention two of the biggest.  I met representatives of ten or 12 organisations, some of whom think we have gone too far, while others think we have not gone far enough.  We have to devise a scheme of legislation in what is a new area for us which will be fair and balanced and seen to be so.  When the Bill is published in due course all aspects will be discussed in the House.  I look forward to that debate.  I will keep an open mind on the detail of the legislation and will be happy to discuss amendments on Committee Stage if the Deputies opposite can suggest any which will improve its thrust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I also hope that the equal status legislation will have a quick passage.  I understand that the terms of the legislation are very wide but has the Minister borne in mind the fact that it has been alleged that from time to time people can encounter discrimination because of their political persuasion bearing in mind the circumstances surrounding the fall of the last Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear on what the Deputy is driving at but if he would like to be more specific I will consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>With the long litany of grounds outlined by the Minister people should not be discriminated against on the grounds of political persuasion in making appointments.  This should be provided for in equal status legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Given its complexity this legislation will be very challenging and as a consequence it should be excellent legislation.  When does the Minister expect to be in a position to publish it? Will it be published late in the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I always hesitate to make <Col N="592" /> predictions about matters which are outside my control but I expect the Employment Equality Bill to be published first and the Equal Status Bill to be published sometime this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister will be able to answer my question as it is broadly similar to the one asked by Deputy Woods.  Does the Minister realise that this legislation has been in gestation for so long that there is a great deal of impatience?  If he could give an indication at an early stage as to when the Bill will be before the House it would be a valuable contribution.</P>

The board and management of Brink's Allied, its senior staff members and perhaps members of the Garda and the Minister for Justice could be called before the committee and, in an orderly way, even without the need for questions, make statements to the committee.  In that <Col N="739" /> way, we could allay, without acrimonious exchanges in this House, public concern about the many difficulties the Minister for Justice has faced over the past week.  If the Taoiseach will consider it, this side of the House will make appropriate arrangements and will not even engage in questioning.  If everybody involved were to make a statement, the wider public would see the position for themselves.</P>

      <P>We are anxious to have the committees established as soon as possible.  I am sure Deputy Ahern is aware of the risks attendant on allowing this House to investigate any matter currently also under investigation by the Garda Síochána from the point of view of the possible prejudicing of any prosecution. In that regard I draw his attention to a reply given by Deputy Raphael Burke when he was Minister for Justice to the effect that it has never been the practice for Ministers for Justice to report to the House on the progress of specific Garda investigations and that he did not intend to depart from that practice.  Deputy Burke would have said that for good reasons that still apply under our legal system.</P>

We would prefer the committee to meet and hear statements by the people involved, at least we would be wiser.  There are rumours all over the city and people are asking if there was film in the video machines when the fence was unscrewed, when the ditch was put in place, and many other questions which I do not wish to mention.  It would be far better to have such questions aired at a committee.  This is a reasonable request.

I have no doubt other Members of the House will be making their views known before and after the contribution of the Minister for Justice.  It is not as if debate is not taking place on the subject.  It is important to recognise that nothing should be said that in any way risks prejudicing either a Garda investigation or a fair trial at the end of such investigation.

The document states it is important that the Taoiseach is seen to answer to the Dáil for issues of overall Government policy, that a practice had grown up whereby Taoisigh transfer questions, put down for answer by the Taoiseach himself, to other Ministers and that Fine Gael would introduce clear and transparent rules governing this practice to ensure that questions may not be arbitrarily transferred to other Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am very pleased to bring the Bill before the Dáil at last.  The Bill was well received in the Seanad where it was given detailed but constructive scrutiny. I look forward to a lively and helpful debate in this House also.</P>
      <P>Legislation for adoptive maternity leave was favoured by the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  I am glad to record that the Bill will give concrete effect to that specific recommendation of the Commission.  However, the initial proposal for the introduction of adoptive maternity leave was made in the 1992 Budget Statement of the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern.  Subsequently, in 1993, the Programme for a Partnership Government gave a firm commitment to the introduction of legislation for adoptive maternity leave.  Enactment of the present Bill will also fulfil these commitments.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to redress an imbalance between the way a new adoptive mother is treated with regard to leave as compared with a natural mother who has given birth.  Each natural mother has had a statutory entitlement to leave from work on the birth of a child since enactment of maternity protection legislation in 1981.  The Bill makes provision for analogous leave for each new adopting mother by giving her a minimum of ten weeks statutory leave from work at the time of the placement of a child with her for adoption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are obvious health and safety reasons associated with the provision of statutory maternity leave for a natural mother at the time of a birth.  There is an equally obvious absence of any similar health and safety reasons in the case of adoption.  However, every mother <Col N="746" /> will be only too aware of the opportunity presented indirectly by maternity leave, which arises primarily from health and safety considerations, for the integration of a new baby into the household and for the development of the mother-child bond in the crucial initial weeks of the relationship.</P>
    <P>It is the perceived value of the leave in facilitating these opportunities that has been the focus of calls for similar leave for adoptive mothers.  In the end, the policy to extend maternity protection leave to adoptive mothers has been very much a decision to address this anomaly for the minority of women who become mothers without having given birth.  These women, up until now, have been perceived as disadvantaged on this ground alone.  In so far as practicable, the legislation seeks to replicate all the relevant benefits of maternity leave for women whose motherhood arises from adoption.  The length of the leave, the option for additional leave, the protection in respect of return to work and other key conditions are modelled on the maternity leave provisions.  The leave will be available also to a man in circumstances where he is the sole adopting parent.</P>
    <P>This Bill will redress a small but significant anomaly in our treatment of adoptive mothers as compared with natural mothers.  In the medium term, I would welcome the development of a framework of law and practice that will facilitate all workers, whether men or women in combining their working life and family responsibility.  I regard the development of a viable proposal for parental leave as a key element in any framework of this kind.</P>
    <P>A draft EU Directive for parental leave was considered by the Council of Social Affairs Ministers at a meeting on 22 September last.  Unfortunately, after more than a year of work on the dossier, the Council failed to reach the unanimity of agreement necessary for adoption of the Directive.  The initiative is now with the European Commission to bring forward a new proposal.  I expect that the Commission will present a new <Col N="747" /> parental leave proposal for consideration and that they will do this sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>The old draft Directive envisaged that each working parent would be entitled to a minimum of three months leave from work during the initial years of a child's life.  The draft Directive also envisaged short term leave to deal with certain family difficulties.  It remains to be seen what shape the new proposals will take.  It is my view that they are likely to be at least as generous as the old draft Directive.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been well disposed towards the proposal for parental leave since work re-commenced on the dossier during 1993.  Indeed, an intervention of mine was instrumental in broadening the scope of the proposal to bring adoptive parents as well as natural parents within its remit.</P>
    <P>The essential feature of parental leave is that leave should be available as a right to each working parent individually. The leave would encourage each working parent, whether mother or father, to participate fully in the parenting of their children and they would be facilitated in doing so with statutory time off from work.</P>
    <P>The development of parental leave arrangements can be expected to have important implications for gender equality.  Such arrangements would foster a new social acceptability for an enhanced role for men in the upbringing of their children.  At the same time, the arrangements could be expected to give women more freedom to pursue equal careers with men in the world of work. Future work in my Department will focus on consideration of the options for parental leave, especially in the context of the new proposals in the area that can be expected to emerge from the EU Commission fairly soon.</P>
    <P>I note the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women has adopted a broadly similar framework to that which I would like to see advanced.  They welcomed the proposal <Col N="748" /> for adoptive maternity leave and identified the need to supplement existing provision for maternity leave with parental leave.  In this connection, they mention particularly the proposal for an EU Directive on parental leave and the introduction of paternity leave.  These recommendations will be considered fully in the development of any future policy proposals for family leave.</P>
    <P>I would now like to outline to the House some of the main features of the Bill.  Part I, comprising sections 1 to 5, contains preliminary and general provisions.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the grant of adoptive leave to women employees on a basis similar to maternity leave.  There is provision also to grant such leave to a man, if he is a sole male adopter and in certain other limited circumstances.  In particular, it should be noted that the leave arrangements apply to all eligible employees regardless of hours worked or length of service.  It also applies to workers with fixed term contracts, up until the date of expiry of their contract of employment and to agency workers. In the past, there may have been some confusion in employment protection legislation as to whether an employment agency or the agency's client availing of the employer's services was the employer.  Under section 2, the party liable to pay the employee is deemed the employer for the purposes of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Part II covers the grant of adoptive leave and additional adoptive leave.  It also sets out the notification procedures with which an employee must comply in order to avail of the benefits of the legislation.  The notification procedures are similar to those contained in the Maternity Protection Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides for the grant to an employed adopting mother or to a sole male adopter of ten weeks adoptive leave beginning on the day the child is placed for adoption.  To qualify, section 7 requires an employed adopting mother or sole male adopter to give the employer at least four weeks notice of her intention to take adoptive leave.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> She must also notify her employer in writing, as soon as is reasonably practicable, of the expected day of placement and furnish appropriate evidence of the placement.  These provisions will ensure that the employer is given adequate notification of the employee's intention to take leave.</P>
    <P>In line with existing provisions on maternity leave, section 8 allows an employee to take up to four consecutive weeks additional adoptive leave, immediately following the adoptive leave.  In the case of a foreign adoption, some or all of the period of additional adoptive leave may be taken before the day of placement.  This flexibility in the timing of leave will facilitate an employee who needs to travel abroad for the purpose of familiarisation with the child to be adopted.</P>
    <P>Sections 9, 10 and 11 entitle an adopting father to adoptive leave and/or additional adoptive leave as appropriate where the adopting mother has died within 14 weeks of the day of placement of the child.  The House will be aware that similar provisions were introduced in the Maternity Protection Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>An employee availing of her entitlement to adoptive leave is required to furnish her employer with a certificate of placement.  Section 13 requires the agency placing the child for adoption, or the Adoption Board in certain circumstances, to issue to the adopting parent within seven days of her request a certificate of placement.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill contains provisions relating to contracts of employment. Complementary to the right to take adoptive leave is the employee's right to return to work afterwards and to have her employment rights protected during her absence on such leave.  Under the Bill, the right to take adoptive leave and to return to work afterwards may be freely exercised, provided the employee complies with the requisite notification procedures.  Part III provides the necessary protections for an employee availing of her rights under the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 15 requires that an employee absent on adoptive leave must be <Col N="750" /> treated as if she had not been absent. All her employment rights, except the right to remuneration, will remain unaffected by the fact that she is absent on adoptive leave.  Section 15 also provides that employment before the absence on additional adoptive leave will be regarded as continuous with employment following such absence and that periods of probation, initial training and apprenticeship, will be suspended during leave.</P>
    <P>Sections 16 and 17 confer protection against dismissal during adoptive leave or additional adoptive leave.  Section 18 entitles an employee to return to work after adoptive leave and additional adoptive leave and to the job she held before the leave.  However, where it is not reasonably practicable for an employer to allow her to return to her usual job, section 19 allows for the offer of a new contract of employment.  Here the new contract must offer work suitable to the employee concerned and its terms must not be substantially less favourable than the old contract.</P>
    <P>Under section 20, an adopting parent must give her employer notice in writing of her intention to return to work after adoptive or additional adoptive leave at least four weeks before the due date of return to work.  However, where there is a general interruption or cessation of work at her employment, such as that arising from a strike or lay-off, section 21 allows for the postponement of the resumption of work by an employee.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill ensures that other relevant enactments take specific account of the position of an employee on, or returning from, adoptive leave or additional adoptive leave so as to guarantee her rights under other social protection legislation.</P>
    <P>Under these provisions, the failure by an employer to allow an employee, who is otherwise entitled to do so, to resume work after the leave will be deemed to be an unfair dismissal&mdash; unless there are substantial grounds justifying it.  In addition, the dismissal of an employee solely or mainly for reasons connected with the exercise of rights under the Bill <Col N="751" /> will be deemed to be an unfair dismissal. There are also amendments to the redundancy payments and minimum notice legislation to protect the rights of workers on adoptive leave.</P>
    <P>Part V establishes redress procedures in the event of a dispute relating to entitlement under the Bill between an adopting parent and her employer. These procedures are similar to those in the Maternity Protection Act, 1994 and similarly provide that any dispute relating to dismissal will be dealt with under the unfair dismissals legislation.  The main features of the redress procedures in cases other than dismissals are a right of redress in the first instance to a rights commissioner, followed by a right of appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal on the facts and to the High Court on a point of law.  Provision is made for compensation of up to 20 weeks remuneration.</P>
    <P>Part VI of the Bill was introduced on Committee Stage in the Seanad.  It sets down transitional arrangements to grant of adoptive leave in the initial period following commencement of the legislation or where a child is placed with an employee before the commencement date of the legislation.  It also deals with where an employee commences employment shortly before the day of placement.  I have introduced these provisions so as to ensure that an adopting parent who would otherwise be entitled to leave under the Bill does not lose out on her entitlement to leave and to return to work under the Bill for purely technical reasons &mdash; for example due to her inability to comply with the notification requirements set out in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in recommending this Bill to the House.  It represents real progress and a real improvement in the rights of adopting mothers and I commend it to the House accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is important legislation. I have a high regard for the Minister and the work he is doing.  I find it difficult to be critical of him when I see <Col N="752" /> him labouring so hard to bring about change in this area.  Therefore I was relieved when he said he looked forward to a lively and helpful debate.  I felt at ease because I must disagree with the Minister.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which introduces adoptive leave on a statutory basis for adopting mothers but I am opposed to what I regard as blatant discrimination against men inherent in the Minister's approach.  It is also unfair to mothers that fathers are excluded by and large from this measure.  Instead of removing inequality between men and women the Minister perpetuates it in this Bill.</P>
      <P>This is a simple and inexpensive measure.  It is new legislation in which the Minister can and must provide for equal treatment.  To fail to do so would be a failure for his ministry and a failure to reflect the changes which have taken place in society and the more complex positions in which families find themselves today.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the Bill meets a commitment in the Fianna Fáil/Labour Programme for a Partnership Government and also gives effect to a recommendation made by the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  It will give statutory leave to adopting mothers on a basis similar to that provided for a natural mother under existing maternity leave legislation.  The Bill provides for a minimum of ten weeks leave.  This will attract a social welfare benefit on the placement of a child for adoption.  The Minister for Social Welfare will introduce the necessary legislation to provide for this.  According to the explanatory memorandum the costs of providing this adoptive leave scheme nationally are insignificant, estimated at approximately £200,000 per annum.  Since that is an initial estimate, one can take it that it will probably amount to somewhat less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for four weeks unpaid additional adoptive leave to be taken by an adopting mother in the period immediately after her paid leave. The £200,000 per annum is insignificant compared with an expenditure of £3.9 <Col N="753" /> billion and Members will recognise that the financial cost cannot be a concern in this case.  I am quite satisfied that it is not a concern.</P>
    <P>All of these provisions are welcome as is the new flexibility in the case of a foreign adoption, to allow some or all of the adoptive leave to be taken before the day of placement.  Since the implementation of the Adoption Act, 1991, on 31 May 1991, to 31 December 1993 a total of 422 foreign adoptions have been recognised and registered by the Adoption Board here.  In many of those cases the adopting parents needed to spend some time outside the country making arrangements for the adoption and becoming familiar with the child or children to be adopted.  The provisions here will greatly facilitate the adopting mother in that respect.</P>
    <P>The Bill as a special concession also provides new arrangements for adoptive leave for a sole male adopter and for a man whose partner may have died during the period of leave.  The Minister set out in detail how this will work.  I welcome this small recognition of the role, function and importance of the male partner in adoption but it does not go far enough: adoption, unlike maternity, is not a health matter; both parents may have an equal role, function and status in the adoption and care of the child. Accordingly, I call on the Minister and the Government to extend the right to adoptive leave to the father on the same basis as will apply to the mother.  Either the father or mother should be enabled to avail of the adoptive leave and to benefit from the payments scheme to be administered by the Department of Social Welfare.  Will the Minister request the Minister for Social Welfare to introduce and implement that payments scheme immediately?  There is no need for delay.  It should be brought into operation at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The total number of adoptions approved and registered by the Adoption Board in 1993 was 500.  As the explanatory memorandum confirms, there is no significant cost involved but <Col N="754" /> there is one of equal treatment of men and women, fathers and mothers alike; there arises an issue of equal status in respect of the father and mother.  This is not a health or maternity matter and, in that sense, is not related to maternity benefit.  It is simply a question of the mother and father having an equal right to adoptive leave to arrange care for an adopted child.</P>
    <P>There is a need also to make adequate provision for the adoption of children with special needs, children with physical, mental or emotional disabilities needing special support during adoption.  Therefore, the adopting mother and father need an opportunity to bond with the child who suffers from such a disability.  Again, the adoptive leave arrangements provided for in this Bill should be made available to both adopting parents, depending on the choice of the father and mother, since both can be regarded equally in the circumstances surrounding adoption; if you like, both are expecting.</P>
    <P>The experience of those concerned with the placement of children for adoption has been that fathers take a much more active part in adoption than was the case heretofore and, accordingly, need the opportunity to share in the period of adoptive leave with the mother.  On that basis, I call on the Minister to provide adoptive leave for fathers in this Bill.  I intend tabling an amendment to that effect on Committee Stage but I would be quite happy to see the Minister table such an amendment, when he would have the support of this side of the House.  If he does, I can assure him of my full support and that of my party.</P>
    <P>The Minister continued at some length to stress that the adoptive leave will be available to a male in circumstances in which he is a sole, adopting parent, and in other very limited circumstances. However, there is no reason for not providing equal treatment of the father and mother in the case of adoptive leave.  From what the Minister said in the course of his <Col N="755" /> remarks, it is obvious that he thought the same way when he said:</P>
    <P>In the medium term, I would welcome the development of a framework of law and practice that will facilitate all workers, whether men or women, in combining their working life and family responsibility.  I regard the development of a viable proposal for parental leave as a key element in any framework of this kind.</P>
    <P>Those two sentences express the Minister's sentiment on the overall development of parental leave which I too believe will be particularly important in the future.  Although I know there is great resistance to it in many quarters. As the Minister said also, it has not been possible to make progress on a draft European Union directive on parental leave which was considered by the Council of Social Affairs Ministers as recently as 22 September last.  I note also that the Minister visualises the Commission returning, in the very near future, with additional proposals in this area.  As he knows well, that is a major issue, a substantial development in regard to equal treatment which will lead to a great deal of discussion and consideration.  There will be substantial financial implications which will have to be addressed in the future.  The Minister said that in the medium term he would foresee a development along those lines.</P>
    <P>That supports the case I am making today because, if that is where we are going in the medium or longer term then, as far as this Bill is concerned, we should take action now and include a provision for adoptive leave for men as well as women in the case of adoptions here.  I am familiar with many adoption cases and feel very strongly that men and women should be treated equally in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>We are afforded an opportunity today to take an important, if small, step in that direction.  I would not be put off by the statements of people who fear long term European Union developments <Col N="756" /> indicated by the Council of Ministers and the Commission.  I suggest that the Minister, if necessary, table an amendment for Committee Stage in order to provide equal treatment of mother and father in the case of adoptive leave.</P>
    <P>I have pleasure in supporting this important legislation which represents an improvement in family law.  I trust that the new social welfare adoptive leave benefit scheme will be introduced without delay.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing it forward and he will have our full support in ensuring it is implemented as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill but the Minister should not expect too many brownie points for introducing it after all this time.  It is indicative of an attitude towards equality, which perhaps the Minister does not share, that provision on equality which affects relatively few people should have taken such a long time to process.  The gestation period of this Bill has been longer than any pregnancy.  However, I am pleased it provides for adoptive leave on a similar basis to maternity leave.  As the Minister said, it fulfils the promise given in a statement made by the then Minister for Finance on the 1992 budget.  It is remarkable that we managed to secure that promise at the time.  The then Minister said:</P>
      <P>The Government are particularly conscious of the pressures placed on adoptive parents by the lack of provision to facilitate absences from employment related to the adoption of young children.  I am, therefore, very pleased to announce that we will be promoting legislation to provide for leave from employment for adoptive mothers and intend making available a benefit to these mothers along the lines of the existing maternity benefit scheme for women in employment. These new arrangements will operate for ten weeks immediately following the placing of the child with the adoptive parents, and will be introduced later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> As we know now, the Bill goes a good deal further than was promised at that time.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bertie Ahern.  On foot of welcoming the recognition by the Government of the needs of adoptive parents, the Second Commission on the Status of Women endorsed this decision by Government and in addition the need for a number of day's paternity leave to enable fathers to take on responsibility in caring for their children and to facilitate bonding.  That should also apply to adoptive fathers and I take on board the point made about them. We know, in general, that adoptive leave has been available in the public service and by some enlightened private employers.  The one thing adoptive parents do not have is the usual nine months' preparation for parenthood.  I do not know if the weeks make up for that but it reinforces the need for a period of bonding between the parents &mdash; particularly the mother &mdash; and their new child.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has taken a long time to get the legislation to this stage.  I wish to refer to the genesis of the Bill.  As originally framed, it was introduced in the other House in November 1993.  At that time there was criticism as to how long it took to have the legislation produced. Obviously that is not the fault of this Minister as the delay covers many years. On checking the Official Report I was surprised to find that while Committee Stage was taken in November 1994 a full year had elapsed since Second Stage was taken.  On Committee Stage the Minister produced a number of amendments. I have no difficulty with them and they are now incorporated in the Bill but I take issue with the way the Bill was initiated and then left in abeyance for such a considerable time.  The good outcome of this is that the provisions of the Bill are in concert with those in the maternity protection Bill. The Bill, as initiated, did not make provision for additional adoptive leave for <Col N="758" /> the adopting father when the adopting mother dies.  Those provisions are incorporated in the Bill and are welcome. The Minister said he is open &mdash; and I believe he is &mdash; to accepting amendments to legislation but unfortunately not all amendments.  We should examine the area of parental leave for adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary it took so long to introduce the legislation.  Unfortunately, that is indicative of how slowly our society moves, particularly in relation to equality and how our laws reflect it.  The Bill recognises the increasing participation of married women in paid employment and, albeit in a limited way, that children have parents, not just mothers.  That relates to the question raised by Deputy Woods regarding leave for adoptive fathers.  The reality of women working outside the home has met with real, if not overt, discrimination from adoption agencies. Although not specifically part of some rule or regulation, the stringent investigation of the suitability of the prospective adopting parents was accompanied by, in many cases, an assumption, if not a tacit agreement, that the adopting mother could not &mdash; or should not &mdash; work outside the home.  The fact that an increasing number of single parents, women in the main of course, choose to rear their children rather than place them for adoption is one of the reasons the number of children adopted each year has fallen from a figure of thousands in the 1960s to approximately 500 in 1993.  That, too, places extra pressures on parents who want to conform to what may be presented as traditional family roles in their anxiety to have children.</P>
    <P>A number of interesting points not directly related to the Bill were raised during the debate in the other House about the wider area of adoption.  One was the notion of a contact register.  At the time the Minister gave a commitment to raise some of these issues with the Minister for Health.  Has he had an opportunity to pursue that?  At a time when increasingly we have anecdotal <Col N="759" /> evidence of people, particularly in early middle age, who have a great wish to know about their origins, particularly their so-called &ldquo;natural&rdquo; mother, it should be possible to have such a register which could be used in a sensitive fashion.  While it may well be that couples who wish to adopt will opt for the mother to stay at home, I emphasise that this should be the result of discussion and agreement, not pressure.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that many single parents now prefer to raise their children rather than arrange to have them adopted. There has been a considerable change in social attitudes, allied to legislation, about legitimacy and social welfare support that makes this more feasible now. I know that many women would have wished to have had the choice to rear their child rather than to have been hidden in a home, as happened a long time ago, until their child was born and, in many cases, practically forced to give their child away.  Conversely, many children who have been adopted by loving parents enjoyed a secure and loving home because of adoption and many childless couples have experienced the joy of parenthood.</P>
    <P>However, now that different social situations apply it is essential that adoptive parents receive the same protection as natural parents.  In terms of adoption, it is impossible to ignore issues which are not part of this Bill.  Regarding the procedures of the various agencies, women, in particular, may feel under some degree of pressure to work inside the home rather than to continue to work outside it.  It is right that the procedures of the adoption agencies and so on should be open to public scrutiny by way of the Minister's Department or the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>Obviously adoption agencies have stringent regulations about the suitability of adopting parents but there is no regulation that provides that pressure should be put on women not to work outside the home.  However, a <Col N="760" /> restriction applies in respect of age limits. Many agencies automatically disqualify parents even if the mother is only in her mid-30s.  I am not suggesting that a child should become the only child of elderly parents, but it should be acknowledged that natural mothers have babies well into their 40s.  It is unfair that a couple who are rejected by an agency should not know why their application was unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>It is significant that there has been a great deal of pressure to deal with the question of foreign adoptions.  The Adoption Act, which dealt with foreign adoptions, was introduced to cater for couples who longed to have children and adopted them from places such as Romania.  For various reasons many of those couples were unable to adopt children here and were emotionally affected by the appalling plight of the children in Romania.  The protections which apply in the context of foreign adoptions are very important.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in the Bill. Those of us who availed of maternity leave will recall how grateful we were to have had an opportunity to spend time with our babies.  The birth of a baby is a most important event in the life of a couple.  While adoptive mothers do not have the experience of pregnancy and giving birth, they face the responsibility of caring for and bonding with the child. This applies equally to fathers.  Any legal enactment that reinforces the rights and responsibilities of fathers should be upheld.  The responsibilities of fathers for their children should be the subject of debate.  The decision in the Joseph Keegan case on unmarried fathers in 1994 should encourage us to challenge the traditional concepts of male and female role models.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Woods that there should be equal treatment in terms of adoptive fathers and mothers.  That should be the case not because the cost to the Exchequer would be negligible but because we have re-examined the role of parents and acknowledged the rights <Col N="761" /> and responsibilities of fathers in terms of their children.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to giving birth, a mother is allowed time off work, apart from the ten week maternity leave limit, for a post-natal check-up.  Adoptive parents should be given similar time off work to attend counselling agencies and so on. While I am sure that is incorporated in the spirit of the Bill, adoptive parents should not be discriminated against in that regard.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the Council of Social Affairs Ministers failed to reach agreement on adoption of the directive on parental leave.  I was pleased to note that the Commission will introduce a new parental leave proposal for consideration &ldquo;sooner rather than later&rdquo; but it is difficult to know when such a proposal might be implemented.  Will the Minister find out what is meant by &ldquo;sooner rather than later&rdquo;?  I congratulate him on his intervention in broadening the scope of the proposal to bring adoptive as well as natural parents within the remit.  It is important that the word &ldquo;sooner&rdquo; in this regard should mean very soon.  As Deputy Woods stated, we should not wait around and merely follow Europe.  We should have the confidence to introduce legislation and, to a large extent, this legislation will implement effective measures.  I am sure the Bill will be welcomed by the small number of people involved and with very little tinkering it should become excellent legislation.  I congratulate the Minister on introducing it and I will support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the legislation which is long overdue, but perhaps good things take additional time. While only a few will avail of it, I am sure they will welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The words &ldquo;parity of esteem&rdquo; have been used frequently in recent months. This Bill goes some way towards increasing parity of esteem between adoptive and biological parents and I welcome that.  Like Deputy Woods,  I <Col N="762" /> hope that when paternity leave is introduced similar rights will apply to adoptive parents.  I know the Minister will take that on board because in his fine Second Stage speech it appears he is anxious to get this right.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods appears to be held up as the champion of equality.  It was difficult to recognise this in his speech because he was the Minister for Social Welfare who held forth on the biggest inequality issue in the State involving of a large number of women.  However, I am sure Deputy Woods would not accuse us of being cynical about what he says on equality.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the legislation it forms yet another part of the sometimes impenetrable jigsaw of our adoption law.  In practice, our adoption law remains riddled with anomalies which I hope the Government will address, preferably through the introduction of an adoption Act which would consolidate all adoption laws and give us effective legislation in an emotional and important part of our lives, namely, the care, protection and adoption of children.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to establish a contract register which would ease the process whereby adoptive children on reaching adulthood could trace their natural mothers.  While it is important that the Minister extends paternity leave to adoptive fathers, he should also consider extending to adoptive children the rights which children on reaching adulthood have in terms of their natural mother.  Now that we have become more open about our past &mdash; often a cruel past &mdash; we have heard many women in their 50s and 60s talking about the intolerable pressures they faced as single mothers having babies in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s.  They were not informed of the options available to them &mdash; in most cases they had no option other than allow their children to be adopted, something from which they have never recovered.  They do not have the right to try to find out the whereabouts of their children. <Col N="763" /> The protection afforded to the natural mother could equally be afforded to adoptive children seeking their natural mother.  If the child does not want to have contact with the mother, so be it. As of now, if the natural mother does not want contact with the child, that is the end of the process.  The same rights could be afforded to the natural mother depending on the circumstances.  I am sure all Members would agree that mothers, by their nature, are not hard-hearted or cold.  There are usually exceptional reasons for a mother putting her child up for adoption and those reasons can be dealt with by the agency dealing with the mother.  I ask the Minister to examine this area.</P>
    <P>Any contact between natural mothers and adopted children must be strictly regulated to protect the individual's privacy and to ensure that psychological and emotional strain is kept to a minimum. However, there are already strict regulations governing the rights of adopted children to trace their natural mothers and these regulations can easily be adapted for the reverse situation.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the regulations governing adoptions today.  At present, adoption procedures are largely determined by individual adoption societies.  That is what I meant earlier when I spoke about a consolidated adoption Act to make adoption easier.  I hope that all adoptions can be regulated because they cannot continue in the manner which operated in the past.  This legislation is merely a worthy first step.</P>
    <P>Many of the criteria applied to prospective adoptive parents are too stringent and, in some cases, militate against the child's best interest.  Children for adoption who, by definition, are vulnerable must be placed in a stable and secure environment.  However, current practice effectively excludes many prospective parents for financial or age reasons.  I do not believe anyone agrees that the poor or people without a large income should not have children.  Therefore, to apply this rule to an adoption procedure is unjust.  This area comes <Col N="764" /> within the remit of the Minister and it should be regulated.  Age barriers in respect of adoptions should no longer apply.  Neither financial nor age constraints prevent one from being a natural mother.  If this legislation aims to have adoptive parents treated as natural parents, then we must look at these factors.  Reasons which would not prevent them from becoming parents in the natural course of events need not prevent them providing a loving and stable home.  We see examples of this every day of the week.  I would like to see a regulatory system which is transparent, unbureaucratic and takes full account of the individual circumstances of all concerned &mdash; children, natural parents and adoptive parents.</P>
    <P>In recent years we have become aware of the plight of many children in our society abused and neglected by those they trust and, most disturbing of all, children who are abused while in care.  I welcome the guidelines for the employment of child care staff issued by the Minister.  The voluntary sector may be facing a crisis in this regard so we must put in place mechanisms which will ensure there is not a breakdown in child care services.</P>
    <P>The full implementation of the Child Care Act, 1991, promised by <i> A Government of Renewal</i>, will do much to redress these problems.  The Government's programme is committed to child welfare in a number of areas.  I hope the Minister will undertake a thorough review of adoption procedures.</P>

      <P>My contribution on this Bill will be brief.  In Opposition, a position I have not occupied previously, some people think one opposes for the sake of opposition, but I do not necessarily subscribe to that theory.  By and large, I commend the Minister on introducing this legislation and because I agree with it, it is difficult to make a long dissertation on the Bill.  It is interesting to note that the maternity protection legislation came into force only in 1981.  As my children were born after that time my wife was covered by the Bill.  If such legislation did not exist, there would be an outcry that we were not looking after mothers.  I am amazed that the legislation has been in force for such a short time.</P>
      <P>When I read this Bill I immediately began to think in terms of its cost &mdash; this probably comes from my accountancy background.  Frequently, we introduce measures without thinking of the cost to the Exchequer.  I was pleased to read in the explanatory memorandum that the estimated cost is only £200,000 which, in the context of general public expenditure, is peanuts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was appointed as spokesperson on Equality and Law Reform I jokingly said to some of my colleagues that I would be trying to get equality for men because everyone was talking about equality for women.  Now I am not sure if it was funny because Deputy Woods referred to it, and there are provisions in the Bill which appear to give more support and adoptive leave to the woman, even in the case of marriage. He suggested bringing forward an amendment on Committee Stage.  If we are talking about the whole area of equality, why should a man not have the same rights as a woman?  They should be able to choose whether the man or the woman takes the adoptive leave. That is one possible flaw in the Bill.  The only case where the male is covered is where he is the sole adopter.  Obviously, I am not an expert in this area but I doubt if there are many such cases, particularly bearing in mind that the number of babies for adoption has <Col N="766" /> decreased significantly and is now down to about 500 per annum.  It is highly unlikely, where there is so much competition &mdash; if we can use that word &mdash; that a male would be the sole adopter.  I ask the Minister to examine this area again in the context of men rather than women getting the maternity leave.</P>
    <P>Obviously, there is a certain bonding between parent and child in the case of a natural as well as an adoptive mother. The child &mdash; by and large we are speaking about small babies &mdash; does not know whether the parent is the natural parent or an adoptive parent and regardless of which is the case bonding will occur. This measure is extremely important. There was an anomaly whereby people adopting children were not granted leave, but young babies, regardless of whether they are adopted, need great care and adoptive leave should be granted.</P>
    <P>The last few speakers mentioned age constraints in that adoptive boards tend to allow adoptions only to people aged up to mid-thirties.  It seems ridiculous that people over that age are not allowed to adopt children.  This is not a matter for this Bill but perhaps the adoption agencies would consider it.</P>
    <P>Section 8 refers to the four weeks the adoptive parent may take in addition to adoptive leave.  I assume, as in the case of maternity leave &mdash; this is not clearly spelled out &mdash; those four weeks would be taken at a cost to the person.  I do not know whether that is laid down in the legislation.  I see the Minister nodding and I am glad that is the case because employers must also be taken into consideration in terms of cost of disruption to them.</P>
    <P>Section 12 deals with placement for a period of less than 14 weeks and notice must be given by the employee if he or she intends to go back to work before that.  I welcome the regulations on foreign adoptions which are an improvement on the previous position.  I particularly welcome the four weeks pre-adoption provision for people adopting foreign babies.  I understand the 14 <Col N="767" /> week provision primarily refers to foreign adoptions.</P>
    <P>We process only 500 adoptions each year, but in the unlikely event that adoptive leave is granted and after a period of ten weeks the child is taken back by the adoption board or the authorities, and a few months later another baby is placed with the couple, are these people entitled to a second period of adoptive leave?  I am also thinking of the employer whose business would be disrupted.  What rights would the employer have in this regard?</P>
    <P>We may bring forward amendments on Committee Stage.  This is important legislation which gives the lie to the view that parents of adoptive children are held in less regard by the State. Under this legislation they are entitled to the same treatment as other parents. I commend the Minister on the Bill and I welcome it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on bringing it in.  It is extraordinary it has taken such a long time to introduce legislation to give rights to adoptive parents.  It is ironic the legislation is introduced when the number of adoptions is decreasing. The number of foreign adoptions may be on the increase but adoptions in Ireland have declined dramatically.</P>
      <P>I welcome the commitment from Fianna Fáil to support parental and paternity leave.  I hope the Minister, when bringing in legislation in these areas, will receive the support given today by Deputy Woods for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke to a woman this morning who adopted a daughter 19 years ago.  When she went into work on the Monday morning and told her employer she had brought home her adopted daughter, her employer congratulated her and told her to stay at home until the baby settled.  She was very pleased he gave her leave at his discretion.  This Bill makes such leave obligatory.  The absence of legislation in this area up to now shows our attitude to adoption although some adoption agencies do not <Col N="768" /> now insist that the mother is working at home full time and are more flexible in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that many people have spent such a long time lobbying for this legislation and it has taken so long to bring it in, as in the case of the register of stillbirths legislation and the Interpretation Act.  It is very important that the Government is committed to reform and to introducing necessary legislation speedily and effectively.  To this end it must ensure there is a sufficient number of people working in the Bills Office. Ministers should ensure that the necessary social legislation is enacted as quickly as possible.  Our job is to react to changing social circumstances quickly and effectively.  People have become disillusioned with politics because politicians and Governments do not react quickly enough in bringing in legislation when needed.  There have been undue delays resulting in legislation being out of touch with the real needs of people.</P>
    <P>This legislation addresses an anomaly that existed since maternity leave was introduced.  It gives equal rights to women who adopt children and who were previously excluded from these arrangements.  I welcome the improvements made by the Minister as a result of the EU Directive in 1994.  A period of 14 weeks is now granted for maternity leave &mdash; these rights were extended under the 1994 Bill.  The changes in the social welfare code will also be welcome.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that this is simply a first step in his examination of reconciling work and family responsibilities.  We have given too little attention to this matter to date and questions arise in this regard.  I congratulate the Minister who supported discussions at European level on parental leave.  I note in his speech he said he has been responsible for ensuring that adoptive arrangements are included in EU Directives and this is important.  It is unfortunate that Ministers were not able to support the draft directive being reviewed by the Commission before being discussed by the <Col N="769" /> social partners under the social Protocol arrangements of the Maastricht Treaty. The matter will come back to Council but will not require unanimous support for adoption.  I look forward to the outcome of those discussions and the introduction of legislation here to make it possible for women and men to combine work and family responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods referred to the need for men to be able to take leave at the time of an adoption.  I assume the Minister is dealing with this point in the context of the EU Directive on parental leave.  I look forward to hearing his views on this.</P>
    <P>In recent times there have been strong economic arguments against the introduction of adoptive or paternity leave.  As I said in the debate on the maternity protection Bill, it must be borne in mind that countries with very good progressive legislation and which have provided long periods for maternity leave also have very high productivity rates.  There is a terrible fear that such leave will lead to a decrease in productivity and employers will not be able to bear the costs.  However, I agree with the well made arguments that happy workers are productive workers and factors such as the atmosphere in the workplace and employee satisfaction with the terms of employment are very important when it comes to productivity.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about equal opportunities then the way in which we handle maternity and paternity leave is critical.  The Minister has made provision for leave for men but, unfortunately this will only be in the sad circumstance where the mother dies or where the man is the sole adopter.  The previous speaker said that such cases will be rate and while this may have been the case to date in Ireland, in other countries there is a trend among single parents to adopt.</P>
    <P>There is not much argument about the details of the Bill and we must, therefore, debate the wider issues such as social benefits in the workplace, the need to ensure a good balance so that <Col N="770" /> employers do not think it is more difficult to create jobs and support for employees.  I think the Minister said during the debate on the maternity protection Bill that he intended to create a climate for debate on this issue.  I hope he will do so.</P>
    <P>We have the second lowest birth rate in Europe and the trend is towards smaller families.  The changed pattern in women's economic and social roles will lead to a continuation of this trend. Other countries have adopted very pronatal policies to deal with this trend, for example, longer maternity and paternity leave and improved child care facilities. It is important to point out that far too much lip service has been paid to supporting families and the ideals of family life and not enough practical support given.  It is worth stating that we have the second lowest provision in publicly funded day care services in Europe &mdash; I think only Great Britain is lower.  This tells us much about the priority given to families.  Much work remains to be done.  This legislation continues the improvements for children and families, areas which require serious consideration.</P>
    <P>We have the lowest participation rate in the European Union of working mothers with dependent children. However, that pattern is rapidly changing. In 1985, 18 per cent of such mothers were in employment while the figure had risen to 38 per cent by 1991.  The figures suggest that the younger the child the more likely it is that the mother will be employed.  I believe this trend will continue.</P>
    <P>The period of 14 weeks maternity leave is much too short.  The Bill includes a provision which will enable a Minister to change the order.  I hope some Minister will change it upwards and that the country will be in a position economically to support such a move. Many women who have availed of maternity leave believe 14 weeks is too short and would like a more flexible arrangement.  Our attitude to career breaks and job sharing is too rigid and <Col N="771" /> employers must give more consideration to flexibility in the workplace. Under our law men and women must have conditions of employment which enable them to reconcile work and family responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on taking up the recommendations of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  It is important that this House monitors the implementation of those recommendations. It is important also that employees be allowed to take the additional four weeks adoptive leave immediately following the 14 week period. The fact that this leave can be taken before the placement of the child will be very useful, particularly for those families considering foreign adoptions which clearly involve much travel.  The Bill will ensure that the protection afforded under other legislation dealing with the workplace will apply equally to adoptive families.</P>
    <P>Some very good points were made during the debate in the Seanad.  The Minister took up some of those points and, I think, passed them on to the Department of Health.  Some people trying to trace their natural parents still receive unsatisfactory information and support, and there is scope for a more comprehensive and consistent approach to such matters.  Reference was made to the transparency of adoption societies and the age of adopters.  This issue needs to be re-examined and consideration given to the introduction of a comprehensive package which will ensure that people are given the best legal advice and emotional support.  I commended the many voluntary organisations which have made great efforts to give this service to individuals.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the introduction of welcome and long overdue legislation.  The fact that it is overdue is not the Minister's fault; he brought it before the House as quickly as possible.  Even though the number of families who will benefit from the legislation is decreasing nevertheless it is welcome.  I welcome, in particular, <Col N="772" /> Fianna Fáil's commitment to parental and paternity leave and urge the Minister to look at the implications of the EU Directive for Ireland.</P>

      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill.  When I returned from maternity leave after having my fourth child I was surprised to learn that this Bill was still before the House.  Perhaps it is a comment on the inefficient legislative capacity of this House that in 1995 we are debating this uncontentious and modest Bill which has broad support.</P>
      <P>Speakers have debated different aspects of the Bill.  Deputy Lynch made an interesting contribution on the topic of adoption. Between June 1981 and February 1982 I was Minister of State at the Department of Health with special responsibility for child care.  During that short period I worked virtually full time on this legislation and promised &mdash; I thought this was realistic &mdash; to introduce within a period of months a comprehensive child care Bill which would have covered the areas of juvenile justice, child case, illegitimacy and adoption which was also to be the subject of a separate Bill.  It is interesting to note that almost 13 years later some legislation has been introduced.  While the Child Care Act and the Status of Children Act have been enacted no substantive legislation on adoption has been introduced and we are still waiting for a juvenile justice Bill.  I, therefore, welcome the appointment of Deputy Currie as Minister of State with special responsibility for this area and hope that this may lead to this legislation being treated with urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kenneally sent a shiver down my spine.  As he admitted, he approached the issue from an accountant's point of view.  I am glad he has discovered that this measure will only cost &ldquo;peanuts&rdquo;.  Perhaps if it were to cost more he may not support it.  He will have to come to terms with the fact that these socially desirable objectives have to be supported.  As Deputy Fitzgerald suggested, there is an economic return <Col N="773" /> in terms of happy and contented employees and a healthy society.</P>
    <P>As usual Deputy Woods, in his new role, proved to be intelligent and reforming and provided the Minister with a challenge which he will have to meet.  That is not to say that in an earlier role the Deputy did not engage in activities which were seriously criticised. Deputy Lynch also referred to this. Deputy Woods will, however, have a contribution to make and while he is a man to watch he is usually more constructive than destructive.</P>
    <P>In 1991 I began to draft a Private Members' Bill on this issue.  A previous speaker referred to the fact that in 1992 the Minister gave a commitment to introduce legislation.  This is a simple and just reform and the Minister deserves commendation for bringing it before the House.  The Bill extends to adoptive parents comparable rights to leave as to those that have been available to natural parents since 1981.  As such it should be warmly welcomed and we should speed its passage through the House and into law.  We should also commend our colleagues in the Seanad for the work done in amending the Bill to bring it into line with the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, 1994 and the requirements of the pregnant workers' directive.  Each week that passes workers are left without the protection of this legislation unless they are lucky enough to be in State or other employment where local arrangements exist.  Even in those schemes the entitlement to social welfare payments would cause problems.</P>
    <P>This Bill makes one minor reform in parental leave.  In introducing the Bill in the Seanad in November 1993 the Minister said the Bill marked the first step in his examination of the entire area and in reconciling work and family life.  I regret that in 1995 the story is still the same; we are awaiting an EU agreement before we move any further in this regard.  I do not accept that this is an adequate response unless it is a confession that social reform will only follow agreement on a EU directive.  The <Col N="774" /> arrangements in most other countries are more advanced than ours.</P>
    <P>There is hardly a Deputy in the House who is better placed to know about the problems associated with reconciling work and family responsibilities. Some of my male colleagues have families as young as my own and it would be interesting to hear their views on this topic.  Deputy Kenneally showed an interest in these matters and referred to the importance of bonding. Life as a public representative is an interesting topic because it is particularly difficult to reconcile work and family responsibilities, especially for those who do not live within the city where the parliament is located and have to travel great distances.  To speak here involves making provision for the shift change at home when the childminder leaves, the children need to be picked up from friends' houses and partners have to liaise to make it all work. It is no accident, therefore, that participation rates in the workplace for Irish women are so low because there is virtually no support available for parents who wish or need to work.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Gay Byrne Show&rdquo; today was interesting.  In dealing with this issue Joe Duffy was surprised at what he described as the anger of all those involved on both sides of the discussion. He tapped into a well of anger of women, and some men, who are trying to provide care for children without any State assistance or adequate leave entitlements to take time off work to provide this care themselves and retain the right to return to work.  There is also the knock-on effect on child care workers who are on low wages and often have no social protection.  This area has been neglected unlike most other European states on which we wish to model ourselves.  This is surprising for a country which prides itself on the value it places on children and the family.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that our labour force participation rates are so low?  For example, based on the 1991 statistics, <Col N="775" /> the most recent to hand, our participation rate for women was approximately 41 per cent for the particular age group referred to whereas in the United Kingdom the figure was almost 65 per cent and 77 per cent in Denmark.  The figure was lower in Spain, Portugal and Greece and then only marginally.  The rate in Scandanavian countries ranged between 71 per cent and 81 per cent.</P>
    <P>The 1992 annual report of the European Commission Network on Child Care &mdash; I read parts of this report into the record of the House during the course of the debate on the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Bill &mdash; summarised the leave arrangements for employed persons in EU countries. While we wait and hide behind EU directives most other countries have maternity leave entitlements in excess of ours, many at pay levels in excess of ours, and many have statutory parental leave entitlements.  In France, for example, it applies for the first three years of a child's life.  Interestingly &mdash; this is welcome &mdash; in many countries there is a non-transferable right to leave for fathers also.</P>
    <P>In extending to adoptive parents the pitifully inadequate entitlements to leave currently available to working mothers and to fathers on the death of the mother only I urge the Minister to ensure that progress is made on the broader issues as a matter of urgency.  I hope he will take the opportunity at the end of Second Stage debate to outline his thinking on this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> contained a number of commitments to equality.  Progress has been piecemeal, this legislation being one of the pieces.  If the commitments on equality for women in employment and other spheres are to be met a huge increase in output, in terms of commitments, legislation and funding, will be needed.  I appreciate fully that the Minister has to cope with enormous demands in his Department, in terms of the divorce referendum and substantive <Col N="776" /> equality legislation, but it strikes me that it was an oversight not to include a section in the programme.  The Minister should have sought the assistance of one of the spare Ministers of State to pursue some of these issues as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>I regret the Minister was unable to make progress on the position outlined in 1993.  In welcoming the Bill, therefore, I ask him to pardon, but not to ignore, the impatience of women concerning the snail's pace of progress in giving family duties the financial and legislative support they deserve.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill which is designed to give adoptive leave to employees similar to that given to their colleagues who avail of maternity leave.  The Bill redresses a long standing gap in the existing maternity legislation as far as adopting mothere are concerned.  I am pleased a Labour Party Minister is introducing this particular reform.</P>
      <P>As the House knows, the Labour Party was instrumental in creating the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  The decision to create such a Department was both ground-breaking and radical.  The Labour Party sought the creation of this Department to ensure that equality, through reform, is a right for all our citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the creation of the Department of Equality and Law Reform my colleague, Deputy Taylor, has undertaken a great amount of work in this area.  The Government is committed to implementing change in a manner that <Col N="777" /> will facilitate greater participation of women, who comprise more than half the population, at every level of life.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been on the stocks for a considerable time and I am glad that it will soon become law.  During the time the Bill was in circulation, it has been improved by a number of amendments. In short, the Bill gives leave from work to adoptive mothers.  It proposes to give a ten week period of leave, in addition to social welfare payments, and an option of an additional four weeks which will not attract payment.  Comparable leave is already available to natural mothers and it is only fair and proper that a similar right is extended to women adopting children.  I could never understand why there was one law for a natural mother but a different one for the adoptive mother.</P>
    <P>The Second Commission on the Status of Women specifically recommended the introduction of such a proposal to correct the anomaly whereby some women can get leave as a matter of course and others cannot.  It is only correct that this anomaly will now be reversed.  Those women who were not afforded such leave have been excluded from availing of this right.  Not only did this anomoly affect adoptive mothers, it affected adoptive fathers and, more importantly, the children who were being adopted.  The stage at which an adopted child joins a new family is an important one.  It is the stage where parents and children need as much time as possible to lay the foundations of the parent-child relationship.  This bonding phase is of crucial importance to the child and the parents.  It is only fair that this right is afforded to adoptive mothers and I am glad the Bill covers fathers in circumstances where he is the sole parent adopting a child.</P>
    <P>The Bill also represents, in a small but important manner, the Government's commitment to the family.  Such leave gives women who adopt children the scope to work outside the home and devote the necessary amount of time to their children.  Without doubt, the family is the most fundamental basic group <Col N="778" /> in society and the State must play a role in protecting and helping all families.  In this case the State is helping parents who decide to adopt children and the Minister for Equality and Law Reform should be commended for introducing this progressive legislation.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note also that the Bill is sensitive to the reality that adoptive parents may not always have the opportunity of advanced notice of the impending adoption of a child.  While they must give four weeks notice of their general intention to adopt, there is no fixed time for notifying the specific date for the placement of a child.  I particularly welcome the provision of section 20 which gives adoptive parents the necessary flexibility when returning to work.  For example, if the adoptive mother cannot give the required four weeks notice of her intention to return to work, it can be dealt with in a flexible manner.</P>
    <P>This Bill is part of a broader package of measures designed to protect workers' rights and, in particular, to assist women in reconciling work and family responsibilities.  I look forward to the introduction of many more positive social reforms during the lifetime of this Government.</P>

      <P>I broadly welcome this Bill which should have been enacted a long time ago and I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Taylor, on its introduction.  I remember having a heated debate with Deputy Woods in this House some years ago when I was my party's spokesperson on social welfare. I could never understand why we did not have this particular provision.  I am sure there must have been many good reasons at the time but I am unaware of them.  I know many adoptive parents and there are some other points which I would like to bring to the Minister's attention.</P>
      <P>I could never understand why an adoptive mother was not entitled to the same benefits as those bestowed on a natural mother as they both face the same problems.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but now that the provision has been delivered, it is only reasonable and fair that I compliment the Minister for Equality and Law Reform on its introduction. Most people throughout the State who are interested in adoption will welcome this legislation.</P>
      <P>It is important that employers take note of this legislation.  I hope there will note be any difficulty in that regard because the conditions of employment are important and if we are to have a satisfied workforce and, more importantly, a satisfied and fulfilled family environment, the child and the mother must be given the chance to bond.  This seems to be the new &ldquo;in&rdquo; word but we all understand what it means.  The pychologists tell us that unless bonding takes place in the initial stages of a child's life, society will pay the price at a later stage.  This Bill is a step along that road but many other measures will need to be implemented in so far as that is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the various agencies involved in adoption.  In my ten or 15 years as a public representative I have never seen such joy as that brought to parents lucky enough to adopt a child. The decision in a case heard by the European Court of Justice some months ago cast a cloud over adoption in certain circumstances and I will mention it briefly.  The judgment handed down by the European Court means that babies cannot be legally adopted unless the birth father has been informed.  Many people will think that a most necessary and sensible condition.  However, where the father is not available or the mother does not want him identified, problems can arise.  It is a nightmare for social workers who, on the one hand, have to meet the conditions laid down by the European Court of Justice and, on the other, ensure that babies are placed with caring, loving adoptive parents.  In <Col N="780" /> the present impasse, there is a real danger that children will become the unfortunate pawns in the legal process. I find it difficult to understand why a father who has demonstrated a lack of responsibility towards his new baby should be notified about the mother's intention to place the baby with an adoptive agency.  This legal ruling may also affect the attitude of potential adoptive parents.  Some parents may not wish to live under a legal cloud where the natural father of the child may turn up some day with certain legal rights.</P>
    <P>Many more persons want to adopt children than there are children available for adoption.  For instance, for the period since 1 January 1994 to date only 15 babies were adopted in the Western Health Board area of Galway.  Mayo and Roscommon.  It is estimated that there are about 400 babies nationally in circumstances where legal adoption cannot take place.  In 1975 the combined total of children who were legally adopted was 1,400.  In 1992 this had fallen to under 600.  The literal interpretation of the new law is that if the father does not know about the adoption the child cannot be legally adopted irrespective of the mother's wishes.  Social workers see many cases where the mother does not know who the father is or where he lives.  That might seem strange but I am told it is common.  In other cases the mother refuses to divulage the father's name for a variety of reasons.  Countless thousands of parents have been enriched by the adoption of children to the mutual benefit of parent and child.  Because I am not a legal person I do not fully understand the legal implications, but social workers are under great strain.  Children are available for adoption and there are adoptive parents waiting anxiously for children who will enrich their lives, but because the natural father must be told about an impending adoption, the job of social workers is made most difficult.  The law should provide that every effort must be made to notify the natural father but where that is not possible he should, after a short period, have no rights <Col N="781" /> whatsoever and the child should be able to be legally adopted.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Taylor, on this Bill and ask him to take to heart what I have said.  I accept that is somewhat outside the parameters of the Bill but it is certainly very much related to the issue of adoption and I am thankful to have been given the opportunity of putting it on the record because it is so important.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate for their very constructive contributions. It is generally agreed that this Bill, which will entitle adopting mothers to leave on a similar basis to natural mothers, is to be welcomed and I am pleased with the response from all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Keogh and other Deputies referred to the delay in the processing of the Bill through the Oireachtas.  I acknowledge that there has been an unusually long delay in processing this legislation.  In mitigation I can only say that I was concerned to ensure correspondence between the provisions of this Bill and the provisions of the Maternity Protection Act, 1994 which was passed just before Christmas.  The maternity legislation was introduced to give effect to the EU pregnancy directive and was given priority in my Department.  Because of my wish to ensure consistency between the two Bills I had to introduce a large number of amendments to this Bill on Committee Stage in the Seanad and that was a contributing factor in the delay.  I very much appreciate the supportive remarks of Deputy Woods about the work of my Department.  However, I refute his suggestion that this Bill offends the principle of equality.  It was Deputy Woods' colleague, Deputy Ahern, who first proposed adoptive leave for mothers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not ask the Deputy to do that, but we all know that by constitutional law unanimous consensus decision are given in Government so the consequences inevitably follow. Furthermore, the Second Commission on the Status of Women saw the merit of adoptive leave for mothers in the context where parental leave would be available.  There is a view, propounded by Deputy Woods and others, that because it is unlike maternity leave owing to the absence of direct health and safety considerations, adoptive leave should be available to new adoptive fathers as well.  I am surprised that Deputy Woods has not sought extension also of the ten weeks leave to natural fathers as well as to adoptive fathers because, if it is a question of equal treatment for men and women that would have to pertain also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the debate relating to adoptive fathers arises from a failure to see the broader context within which the Adoptive Leave Bill is set.  There are two distinct elements to the family leave agenda envisaged in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and in the Programme for a Partnership Government.  The first element concerns enhanced protection for women at the time of pregnancy and maternity.  Deputies will be aware that the Maternity Protection Bill was passed in 1994, just before Christmas. The Adoptive Leave Bill is part of this first element.  It sets out to treat adopting mothers, with regard to leave from work, in a way that is analogous to the maternity provisions where this is appropriate.  The other element of the <Col N="783" /> family leave agenda is the question of parental leave and paternity leave.</P>
    <P>As I indicated to the House on opening the Second Stage debate, I regard the development of a viable proposal for parental leave as a key element in the development of a framework of law and practice that will facilitate all workers, whether men or women, and enable them to combine their working life and family responsibilities.  I outlined developments that have taken place to date towards the achievement of that objective.  I have been fully supportive of the initiatives take by Commissioner Padraig Flynn in this area and that support will continue in the further initiatives he has indicated he proposes to take.</P>
    <P>In the area of parental leave, I agree wholeheartedly with the arguments that favour the granting of leave equally to fathers and mothers.  I accept also that parental leave would be appropriate in the case of both adoptive and natural parents.  Indeed, as I said, an intervention of my own at a meeting of Ministers at EU level did succeed in broadening the debate at European level concerning parental leave to include adoptive parents also.  In the meantime and pending developments in Europe, all this Bill before us intends to do is to redress a significant anomaly for those working women who adopt children each year.  The approach I have adopted to this proposal, which confines eligibility primarily to women, arises solely from the maternity leave blueprint which alone gives a basis for dealing with adoptive leave in this way.  I wish to assure the House that the approach has no implications for future policy as regards parental leave and leave for family reasons.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keogh mentioned that the question of a contact register was raised in the Seanad and that I had undertaken to raise the matter with the Minister for Health, whose responsibility it is.  The previous Minister for Health published a national health strategy and that has been endorsed by the present Minister <Col N="784" /> for Health.  The strategy contains a commitment to put in place formal arrangements to facilitate contact between adopted children and their natural parents, Where such is sought and <i>vice versa.</i> I understand that that commitment will be brought to fruition as soon as other immediate priorities in the child care area, including full implementation of the Child Care Act, are implemented.</P>
    <P>I want to confirm my full commitment to advancing the important issue of child care in every way possible. Members will be aware that once again the Estimates for my Department include the provision of £1 million towards a number of pilot projects on the issue of child care.  That scheme, which I initiated in 1994, is now well under way and some 70 child care projects have already been approved.  That child care programme is run for the Department by Area Development Management Limited, the management company of the local boards and I invite Members who may have contact with local and voluntary groups in deprived areas in particular who may know of a voluntary group anxious to set up pilot programmes in the child care area to make application to my Department for assistance funding during the current year, now that moneys have been made available by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch spoke very constructively about the Bill and I thank her for her considered contribution.  The question of extending rights which an adopted child has to the natural mother is one primarily for the Minister for Health and I will bring Deputy Lynch's concerns in that regard to his attention. It is very useful in considering this Adoptive Leave Bill to bear in mind the overall adoption context in which the adoptive leave arrangements apply. There were references during the debate to many matters which, strictly speaking, do not fall within the ambit of the Bill but which are referable to the broader issue of adoption.  Some of the questions raised include the question of <Col N="785" /> age limits, the contact register and so on.</P>
    <P>I understand there are no statutory age limits operated by the adoption agencies.  I also understand from the Department of Health that each case of adoption is considered on its own merits. There is the notion abroad that there are age limits &mdash; perhaps there are unofficial age limits &mdash; but the information I have is that there are no statutory age limits.  Deputy O'Dea has a particular knowledge of this from his time in the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>The question of time off from work to see social workers and to consult with the agencies and so on in connection with adoptions was also raised.  There is no specific provision in the legislation for leave for those purposes.  In drawing up this Bill every effort was made to facilitate the needs of the adopting mother but at the same time I had to ensure that no undue or unfair burden was placed on employers.  They are an important part of the equation and their needs have to be considered.  It was considered that an adopting mother could reasonably meet the requirements of seeing social workers and so on outside normal working hours on during leave periods.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenneally expressed appreciation for the availability of this type of leave.  I agree with him, as I said the proposed legislation is very good value for money.  Deputy Woods said the actual cost is relatively low in budgetary terms but, nonetheless, it is an important contribution to our legislative plan in the parental area.  The adoptive parent who, for the first time, will get leave under the Bill, will find it an invaluable help and a tremendous contribution to their need to bond with the child.  Deputy Kenneally also referred to the question of achieving a balance regarding the burden the Bill will impose on employers and he spoke fairly and objectively on that subject.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="786" /> As I said, I made every effort in preparing the Bill to strike a fair balance between providing the essential elements of adoptive leave protection for employees while at the same time trying to ensure the employers are facilitated to the greatest possible extent in the orderly conduct of their business. This is evident from the various requirements to give the employer prior written notification before an employee can lawfully exercise her rights under the Bill and the fact that her reinstatement after her adoptive leave may be to an equivalent job and that re-engagement may be offered to her in certain circumstances as an alternative to reinstatement.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputies we are trying to strike a balance.  Generally speaking employers are entitled to know at the earliest possible date that a placement by way of adoption is to be made in order to make plans to conduct their business.  Many employers would rely on a particular employee to carry out certain vital functions in the course of the business and it is only fair that reasonable notification be given to the employer so that he can have an opportunity to find a replacement.  In larger firms it is not such a problem because they can redeploy staff but it can be quite disruptive in a small firm to have a key member of staff take adoptive leave.  We owe it to employers that they be given the maximum notice reasonably consistent with the needs of the adopting mother.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenneally was concerned about the position of an employee who takes adoptive leave where, due to some unfortunate circumstance, the placement of the child has to be terminated at an early stage.  Such a person could be given the opportunity to avail of the placement of another child, possibly quite soon afterwards.  He asked what the position would be in such a case while conceding that this position would not often arise.  The legislation allows <Col N="787" /> such an employee to avail of adoptive leave in respect of both the first and second adoption.  Accordingly, the balance of the legislative provisions are weighted in favour of the adopting parent on this issue.  We felt that was fair and appropriate in the rare cases in which it would arise.</P>
    <P>The legislation allows an employer to require an employee to return to work before the end of the adoptive leave period in the case where a placement has been terminated, in other words, if the placement terminates before the end of the ten week period it is open to the employer, under the Bill, to require his employee to return to work earlier than the ten week period if the placement ceased in the intervening period. That is a fair <i>quid pro quo</i> given the generous allowance for further leave if a new placement arises shortly after the previous one terminated.</P>
    <P>I welcome the comments by Deputy Fitzgerald on reconciling work with family commitments indicated in the Bill.  This is a matter of major concern and I will seek every opportunity to advance the very progressive agenda in my remit in this area covering a broad spectrum of family activities.  Much of the legislation at various stages of development in my Department recognises that fact and had its genesis during the period of the previous Government. I am grateful for the support of my former colleagues in its preparation.  I draw attention to the specific contribution which child care provisions can make in this regard.  This is an area I want to progress.  We are looking at ways of advancing it through the pilot project underway in my Department and also by implementing, in every way possible, the report of the child care committee.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty spoke from experience and expressed impatience at the lack of progress on parental leave issues.  I understand that concern but would point to the presentation not only <Col N="788" /> of this Bill but also to the enactment of the revised Maternity Protection Act, 1994.  I can report substantial progress on the major employment equality areas and the equal status legislation areas we discussed at Question Time.  I know Deputies on all sides are anxious to see progress in those areas as quickly as possible.  They absorbed a large amount of time and energy in my Department and with my colleagues in this and the previous Government.  Two years of difficult work went into producing the two schemes approved by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>While there is undoubted support across the House for parental leave, real concern is being expressed by employers and this requires consideration. Leave and other measures which reconcile work and family responsibilities have a positive value for employers, as Deputy Flaherty and others pointed out.  Benefits in terms of increased productivity and improved morale should not be overlooked by employers, some of whom wish to resist this type of progressive legislation.  It has in-built benefits not only for employees who get the leave but for employers in terms of improved output and morale in the workplace.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Moynihan-Cronin for her contribution and succinct evaluation and description of the key issues.  Her identification of the nature of the notification requirements and their suitability to the real circumstances of adoption is appreciated.  The arrangements caused some confusion in the course of Committee Stage debate in the Seanad and I am glad to note that they make sense to some of the contributions in this House and have been broadly welcomed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton welcomed the Bill and I thank him for his contribution. He showed a real interest in adoption arrangements and rightly acknowledged the valuable work undertaken by the adoption societies.  I join him in paying tribute to the work of the <Col N="789" /> Adoption Society and the Adoption Board who have done so much to assist many families.  It is regrettable that this legislation was not in place years ago when the number of children for adoption was higher than it is at present.</P>
    <P>Many families would have welcomed the opportunity to take leave when a newly adopted child came into their life. Indeed one would argue that, in many ways, the need is even greater in the case of adoption than in natural child-birth, when there will have been preparation in the preceding nine months, mental and physical, leading to the birth of the baby.  It is quite different in the case of adoption, when a child arrives suddenly without any period of preparation. Indeed many adoptions take place at short notice.  I have heard cases of days' notice only having been given to adoptive parents by adoption societies or some of the boards, which causes difficulties.  It highlights even more the importance of giving every opportunity, in particular, to the adopting mother &mdash; and in due course, to the adopting father &mdash; of being with the child, bonding with it and facilitating the whole family in the vital change in the family circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton expressed his concern about the impact on social workers of new developments arising from adoptions following the recent European Court of Justice case.  That kind of issue is not covered in this Bill and I should like to see any problems encountered in this area overcome.  Certainly, I shall bring these matters to the attention of the Minister for Health with whom I join in paying tribute to our many social workers who give so much. Many of us do not realise the very difficult, traumatic and demanding work they undertake in a variety of ways.  The recent European Court of Justice case referred to, dealing with the rights of a father, will have to be carefully examined and amending legislation may be <Col N="790" /> required to take cognisance of that decision.</P>
    <P>I intend bringing forward a number of Government amendments on Committee Stage, perhaps three or four of a purely technical nature, in addition to one substantive Government amendment, the latter having become necessary because of an inconsistency which has arisen for employers between the provisions of this Bill and the Employment Equality Act, 1977, following a Labour Court determination concerning adoptive leave.  I am advised that the outcome of this Labour Court determination, might leave an employer in breach of employment equality legislation if adoptive parents covered by the Bill are treated in a manner more beneficial in regard to adoption than to employees generally.  This amendment is at present being considered in the Office of the Attorney General and I hope to have it available for circulation to Members in good time for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I look forward to going into the detailed provisions of the various sections of this Bill with my colleagues on Committee Stage.  I should like to see the provisions of this Bill enacted without further delay; unfortunately, they have been subjected to delay in the Seanad which I do not want to see recur here.  At the same time I do not want to be overworking my opposite numbers, Deputies Woods and Keogh; we seem to have had a busy day today and, as observed from the schedule of business this week, it appears we will be heavily engaged again tomorrow and perhaps again on Thursday.</P>
    <P>As this is the first occasion on which we have met in our new roles, I know I will have the co-operation of my opposite numbers, in particular Deputies Woods and Keogh, on all the interesting and important issues which will arise in the near future.  It is an interesting brief for me and for Deputies Woods and Keogh in the <Col N="791" /> knowledge that the legislation we are preparing will be new, containing major benefits for our people.  In many cases, it is regrettable that all this legislation has taken so long to introduce.  In particular, I welcome the experience Deputy Woods will bring to his role, the various portfolios and Ministers he held which will be of great help to us, particularly on Committee Stages, as we deal with the minutia of legislative provisions. I am anxious to implement this Bill but am also anxious that we get it right.  If it takes some little extra time to do that, all the better.</P>
    <P>I understand that the former committees of the House have not yet been formally reconstituted; I understand that to be the technical position.  I am not sure whether, ultimately, this Bill will be considered by a committee of the whole House or by one of the new special committees to be established.  If necessary, I am sure I can move an additional motion to cover such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Once again, I thank all my colleagues who contributed so constructively to this debate and look forward to working with them until we complete all Stages.</P>

      <P>In the time available to me perhaps I might address the provisions of section 4, having already addressed many other issues arising under this Bill.  The point I had made in relation to this section is that it is confusing. I am really not sure what the Minister set out to achieve and should like him to answer my questions.  For example, section 2 provides that the Bill replaces the common law rules, a laudable objective, because they are obscure, confused and in need of change but, unfortunately, from my reading of the Bill, the Minister replaced them with new rules which are also vague, confused and unclear.  I am afraid the Minister will achieve a result diametrically opposed to the one to which he aspires.  Having thrown the common law rules out the window, he is possibly allowing them in the back door.  I find the section confusing but I am not a lawyer. I await clarification from the Minister.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government, in the light of the Brinks-Allied raid and the continuing level of serious crime, especially drug-related crime, to review and apply the necessary resources and to put into effect additional legislative measures in order to tackle and defeat the crime wave and to provide a proper and effective level of security for people in their homes and their streets and for business and other property.</P>
      <P>The events of the past week have demonstrated clearly that organised crime is alive and flourishing in Ireland.  The audacity of last Tuesday's Brink's-Allied robbery appears to have left the Minister for Justice breathless and confused. At a time when all the resources of the State need to be focused on the arrest of the perpetrators and the recovery of the cash, all we have heard from the Minister are self-serving and contradictory statements designed to protect the Taoiseach and herself from the consequences of their statements to the Dáil last week.  The Administration that promised openness and transparency has delivered obfuscation and paralysis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has the Minister done in the past week to assist in the fight against organised and ruthless lawlessness?  At a time when the citizens of this country were entitled to expect that every possible assistance would be given to the Garda Síochána in their pursuit of these criminals, the Minister for Justice occupied her time, with her colleagues, in consideration of weighty matters such as <Col N="794" /> how many extra Ministers of State needed to be funded by the taxpayer in order to keep disaffected Government backbenchers in line.  At a time when action was needed the Government of openness and transparency sat behind closed doors seeking to increase and divide the spoils of office.</P>
    <P>Over the past week money laundering and its consequences have been a topic of conversation at every crossroads in this country.  At any stage during that week did it ever strike the Minister for Justice that she might usefully lift her pen and give effect to the provisions of section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994?  Is it too much to hope that a legislative provision specifically designed to provide for measures which could be taken to prevent money laundering might be used at a time when criminals are in possession of millions of pounds in unmarked notes?</P>
    <P>The Minister, by her inaction in this regard &mdash; and it gives me no pleasure to say this &mdash; has presented the perpetrators of this crime with an incalculable bonus.  Why is it that a week has gone by and this provision has not been introduced?  Why is it that a measure which provides for the imprisonment of bankers who fail to take reasonable measures to establish the identity of persons involved in financial transactions involving £10,000 or more has not been given effect at a time when one of the greatest money laundering operations in the history of the State is probably under way?</P>
    <P>The fact that the robbers have been given a head start is bad enough.  I would submit that what is worse is that continued inactivity appears to be the order of the day.  There is no indication that the Minister proposes to rectify her lethargy of last week.  There is no indication that her colleagues intend to prod her into activity.  I am afraid that this is not a Government of action or resolve on the basis of this evidence, it is a Government of inactivity and indecisiveness.</P>
    <P>Providing gardaí with the necessary measures to effectively counteract crime <Col N="795" /> unfortunately does not appear to be very high up on the Government's list of priorities.  The criminal events of last week require that there be an immediate and detailed review of existing legislation to ensure that our laws provide the gardaí with all the armoury necessary to tackle organised thuggery.  Is is too much to hope even now that the Government with its ever increasing army of advisers, managers and handlers might have conducted such a review over the past week?</P>
    <P>Does the Minister realise that there is no effective mechanism known to the criminal law which would permit the gardaí to freeze or seize the proceeds of last week's robbery if they suspected them to be held in a financial institution? We, in Fianna Fail, are of the view that the gardaí should not be required to confront organised crime with one hand tied behind their backs. If, as is clearly the case, sophisticated criminals are able to manipulate the complexities of banking and financial law to their own advantage, then the gardaí must have the legislative ability to pursue them and courage must be shown for once by the Government.</P>
    <P>We consider that in order to effectively fight organised crime of the type we saw last week the gardaí must have the power to freeze moneys in accounts in any financial institution within the State where they suspect that it represents the proceeds of specified criminal activity.  Since this Government appears unwilling or unable to provide any legislative response to last week's robbery, we have prepared and will introduce a Bill to give this power to the Garda.</P>
    <P>We believe that, in the same way as the Minister for Justice has power under the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1985 to require any bank to pay moneys into the High Court where their true ownership can be determined, the Garda Commissioner should have the same power in relation to money which he believes to be the proceeds of a specified crime.  Persons <Col N="796" /> who wish to claim ownership of that money can go to the High Court in the ordinary way and by evidence seek to prove that the money is theirs.  The proposed legislation is simple, effective and needed.  I invite the Minister for Justice to demonstrate a commitment on this occasion to openness by supporting its passage through the House.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil are determined that Ireland will not become a haven for organised crime.  Where legislation is necessary and introduced we will support it &mdash; where it is necessary and not introduced, we will introduce it.</P>
    <P>It is clear that whether induced by addiction or greed, the abuse of drugs is at the root of a considerable amount of criminal activity in this country.  For the last number of years the amount of drugs coming into Ireland has increased dramatically.  This has been illustrated by the fact that there have been many substantial seizures over the past four to five years and the majority of these seizures came from the south, namely Cork and Kerry.  While the gardaí, the Customs and Excise, and the Navy must be congratulated on their vigilance, the reality is that they cannot hope to police 2,000 kilometres of coastline with the meagre resources and personnel available to them.  Ireland is on the outer perimeter of the European Union and Ireland continues to be viewed by the traffickers as a potential transit country.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances every Irish and European parent will want the Irish coastline zealously guarded against highly organised and ruthless criminals who prosper in human misery.  It is incumbent on the Minister to call upon the European Council and the European Commission to make adequate resources available to stop this trafficking now.  Such a response is owed not just to the children of this country but to the children of Europe.</P>
    <P>The drug problem is so complex that it must be clear that no one agency or country can resolve it.  There is a need for a national drugs enforcement agency in this country which will include all law enforcement agencies liaising at all <Col N="797" /> times with one another and with their European counterparts.  There must be a recognition that the drug problem is not confined to Ireland but is an international problem.  I respectfully suggest that it be tackled at two distinct levels utilising the aforementioned agencies. First, the money laundering process which I previously mentioned must be addressed now.  Second, there must be a shift from concentrating completely on those at the top of the pyramid of the drug market to tackling those at the mid and lower levels.  Greater emphasis must be put on law enforcement at the lower level.  Of course, it remains necessary to monitor and, if possible, detect the operations of those at the top of the pyramid and this might best be done by chipping away at the middle and bottom of the pyramid.  Seizures of drugs and money at these levels can help to destabilize the pyramid of the network. Third, national drug enforcement agencies should be co-ordinated and assisted by an overall agency or commissioner under the aegis of the European Union.</P>
    <P>Of course, criminal activity here is not confined to organised crime.  Burglaries, car thefts, assaults, robbery from the person and other serious crimes are sadly everyday occurrences on our streets and in the countryside.  In 1993, for example, the incidence of indicitable offences throughout the country increased by 3.7 per cent compared with the figures for 1992, with the largest increase in larcenies and crimes against property with violence.  In the Dublin Metropolitan Area, the number of indictable offences increased by 7.7 per cent.  The total value of property stolen was more than £46 million, an increase of £2 million on 1992.  The number of motor vehicles circulated as stolen increased to more than 2,000, a substantial increase &mdash; 39 per cent &mdash; on the figure for 1992.  Included were 1,500 motor cars worth a total of £5 million. Unauthorised takings totalled 13,000, with 72 per cent of these in the Dublin Metropolitan Area.  The aforementioned figures are quite serious and indicate an immediate need for an <Col N="798" /> increase in Garda personnel and resources.</P>
    <P>The peace process presents a golden opportunity to this Minister.  Scarce resources which were unavailable to holders of her portfolio in the past 25 years can now be used to tackle the serious level of crime here.  Sadly, there is no evidence that this will happen.</P>
    <P>The statement accompanying the Book of Estimates claimed &ldquo;we are providing for 350 Garda recruits in 1995&rdquo;. This creates the misleading impression that there will be 350 additional gardaí, forgetting about retirements from the Force.  The salaries, wages and allowances of the Garda Síochána show an increase of only 2 per cent, less than the rate of inflation.  In other words, the numbers in the Force, or certainly Garda overtime, is if anything being cut back.  Will the Minister for Justice tell us the full complement of the Garda Síochána on 1 January and how many she expects to be in the Force by the end of this year?  In the interests of openness, transparency and accountability, the Dáil and the public are entitled to know the Garda strength as outlined in the Book of Estimates, and to understand that there are no plans to increase its strength.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the following measures be given serious and immediate consideration. Bail laws should be examined in the context of habitual criminals. Our citizens are rightly outraged at the sight of previously convicted criminals walking free from court on bail committing further and often more serious crimes.  There is also the ludicrous spectacle of criminals who have been convicted in court appealing their convictions and in the course of awaiting their ultimate punishment inflicting further misery on their fellow citizens.  We must have a court system which is expeditious in dealing with criminals; this is sadly lacking now.  There is no point making additional resources available to the gardaí unless the courts can deal with them swiftly and appropriately.</P>
    <P>Juvenile offenders must not be allowed to be seen as gaining kudos and <Col N="799" />&ldquo;street cred&rdquo; through being arrested and charged.  It is obvious that if these young people are sent to Mountjoy or Loughan House, only to be released within 48 hours because of overcrowding, the punishment, far from fitting the crime, is often perceived as a social feather in the cap.  Alternative forms of sentencing must be explored. The areas of community service should be expanded but must have increased funding to ensure that each sentence is closely monitored.  The type of community service must be appropriate in terms of location, duration and worth to the community.  There is a fine distinction between the punitive, perhaps humiliating, aspect of such service and the objective of installing in the offender a sense of community and civic spirit.</P>
    <P>There is no point pussyfooting around the question of incarceration.  Certain criminals must be removed from society for the greater good of all.  More places of detention must be built or created as a matter of urgency.  The last Government gave its approval to the sitting of a prison in Castlerea, County Roscommon. This must proceed without delay.</P>
    <P>It is widely acknowledged that the Garda have enormous difficulties in prosecuting some of the more colourful master criminals in our midst.  Increased powers might be given to a special division of the Revenue Commissioners in relation to the unaccounted funding of material acquisitions and perhaps measures might be introduced for the appropriate attachment of such moneys and/or assets until satisfactory explanations are forthcoming.</P>
    <P>The securing of private property might be made more attractive by the introduction of some method of tax incentive in relation to the installation of burglar alarms, alongside a reduction in insurance premiums.</P>
    <P>Changes in criminal law should not come about piecemeal.  In recent times changes have resulted from media reaction to a particular case.  Criminal law reform should be approached from an overview position and necessary <Col N="800" /> reforms carried out on an overall basis to reflect today's society.</P>
    <P>This is not a lawless country but there are more sophisticated criminals against whom more sophisticated legislation and technology must be used.  Many people believe that the legislation and resources utilised in the fight against crime are either archaic or inadequate. The Brinks-Allied raid must have sent shivers down the spines of people living alone in cities, towns and rural areas. The spectacle of a criminal gang meticulously and successfully raiding one of our largest security firms must have given them little cause for optimism in relation to the safety of themselves or their property in their homes.  Sadly &mdash; again, it does not give me pleasure to say this &mdash; the Government's response will give them little cause for encouragement. Where action and decisiveness were called for, helplessness and dithering became the early trademark of this Minister and this Government.  We have seen sufficient inactivity, foot-dragging and paralysis.  The people of Ireland need and deserve better than this.</P>

      <P>I hope Deputy Eric Byrne in his contribution will apologise to the Garda Síochána.  To refer to them as the laughing stock of the criminal world is a grave insult to the Garda who have served us so well.  People are particularly concerned at the recent crime wave: the Brinks-Allied robbery &mdash; the largest cash robbery in the history of the State &mdash; the brutal murder of James Hurley in Fairview at the <Col N="803" /> weekend and the shooting of a journalist, Veronica Guerin, last evening.</P>
      <P>I support the call by the Fianna Fáil Leader today that the Select Committee on Legislation and Security be convened to deal with all aspects of this crime wave and the unanswered questions, particularly in regard to the Brinks-Allied robbery.  What do we have to contend with at this stage?  We have had an increasing number of armed robberies, an increase in violent crime, in particular against women, an increase in the availability of drugs and robberies associated with that problem, an increase in muggings, crimes against old people and so on.</P>
      <P>Traditionally, Fine Gael has regarded itself as the party of law and order.  It is now up to the Minister.  The people want action on these latest developments. Many questions need to be answered in respect of the Brinks-Allied robbery of £3 million in Clonshaugh. Rumours are circulating in Dublin as to who was involved, the facts of the robbery and so on.  The dogs on the street seem to know the answers to the activities of the godfathers, the thugs and the criminal gangs generally.  They appear to be known to all concerned and yet the Garda cannot convict them.  That is a major problem which needs to be addressed.  Tough legislation is now needed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and my colleague Deputy O'Donoghue has outlined the specifics in that regard.  We need changes in the criminal law but we also need the political will of this House to bring about those changes.  The Minister's predecessor, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, introduced the much needed Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994 to give the Garda Síochána adequate powers to deal with incidence of crime on our streets.  Yet there was an outcry from many interested groups throughout the country at the powers <Col N="804" /> given to the Garda Síochána.  In giving new powers to the Garda Síochána the Minister will meet with opposition but she will have to persevere.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994 was a welcome move and I wish the Minister success in introducing the new legislation.</P>
      <P>The laws in relation to the right to silence, the revolving door system, crimes committed by persons on bail, reform of the courts and the need for more resources for the Garda should be examined and action taken as quickly as possible.  We need to get the Juvenile Justice Bill on the Statute Book as quickly as possible.  The laws on fraud and on bail and the changes in court procedures are urgent in view of the incidents which have taken place in the last few days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We need answers about the Brink's-Allied plant robbery. What are the procedures for cash transit? What rules and regulations will be introduced in this area?  What security procedures were in place at the Brinks-Allied plant?  These questions need to be answered by the Minister.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice failed to inform the Dáil of a Garda intelligence operation which was under way and of an internal Garda red alert memo.  The Dáil did not get full and complete answers last week.  There is no point in blaming the Garda Commissioner. The buck stops at the Minister's desk and she failed in her first test as Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many law abiding citizens are shocked at the brutality of the incident involving the killing of James Hurley in Fairview at the weekend.  Something needs to be done.  I ask the Minister to give us an update on inquiries in that regard.  I have no doubt the people of that locality in particular are extremely concerned because somebody must have seen something.  I ask the Minister <Col N="805" /> to insist that the Garda give every urgency to the solving of this crime.</P>
    <P>Veronica Guerin, whom I knew as a former member of Ógra Fianna Fáil, drifted into journalism and has found a niche there.  She is widely respected as an investigative journalist.  I condemn outright the shooting of Veronica Guerin last night.  We need answers and decisive action with regard to these criminal thugs who are preying on ordinary people and, even more sinister, on journalists.  We need answers on the level of security and whether it is proposed to provide security for the journalist in question.</P>
    <P>People are very concerned.  They want more gardaí on the beat; they want support for their &ldquo;Neighbourhood Watch&rdquo; schemes; they want a Garda presence and more foot patrols.  I ask the Minister to deal with those issues expeditiously, to put more resources at the disposal of the Garda and to leave administrative matters to those who have more time to deal with them.  We need action.  The people are concerned. I await the Minister's response to the questions I have asked.</P>

      <P>A Government spokesman said last week that the crime figures for last year had fallen and they were lower now than ten years ago. Does anybody believe this country is a safer place than it was ten years ago?  If anybody is suffering from that illusion, let them ask the people of Clare and south Galway where a number of sadistic murders took place last year, some of which are not yet solved.  Let them ask the people in urban areas who are witnesses to crimes of gangland slayings carried out in broad daylight in the presence of dozens of witnesses, some of which have not yet been solved; let them ask the elderly who cower in their homes, afraid to answer their door at night and, sometimes, by day; let them ask some of the elderly and those who live alone who have been the victims of violent assault.  Let them ask some of the victims of crime &mdash; the perpetrators of which have been brought before the courts and were seen walking the streets a month or two later because the prison system did not have the capacity to hold them &mdash; their views on law and order and on the administration of justice.  As people from my constituency said to me at the weekend, there are people serving sentences for non-payment of TV licences while the largest robbery in the history of the State took place in Dublin last week.  The Garda were tipped off about the robbery.  It is a feeble-minded excuse to say the information was not sufficiently specific.  What did they expect: the exact date, time and place, down to the last second?  The biggest robbery in the history of the State took place in Dublin last week and the Garda were tipped off.  The whole country knows who did it, yet the prospect of anybody being convicted and punished for it is so remote as to be almost negligible. People find that incomprehensible. Those people should be asked what they think of the administration of justice and law and order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="807" /> The official statistics lie.  The reality is that more and more crime is unreported. Many people nowadays report crime only to collect the insurance or out of a sense of civic duty.</P>

      <P>Taking 1973 as a baseline, the number of indictable offences committed since then has trebled and the number of non-indictable offences has more than trebled.  Crime such as sexual assault, rape and so on has exploded out of control, beyond expectations.  The extent of white collar crime has increased so much in the past ten years it is unknown.  The rate of detection of serious crime has dropped by almost 50 per cent in the past two decades.  Figures show that the rate of detection of indictable offences in 1973 was 47.7 per cent. That figure has dropped to 32 per cent this year.  There was a detection rate of less than one in three indictable crimes in 1993&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, said, much of the crime explosion, particularly in urban areas, is drug related.  Last week the Minister for Justice announced yet another drugs initiative.  I hope it is more successful than some of the initiatives announced in the past.</P>

      <P>The Minister will forgive me if I confess to pessimism.  Many <Col N="808" /> people genuinely believe that this area of crime is out of control.  In remote rural villages drugs are now freely available almost on demand and the Garda seem powerless to do anything about it. In the larger urban areas, particularly Dublin, the hard drug problem has escalated out of all proportions while the Garda, forces of law and order, victims and people affected look on helplessly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The hard drug problem is practically out of control in Dublin and there are signs that it is spreading to other large urban areas.  No Government to date has developed a coherent policy to deal with the hard drug problem in large urban areas.  It is more than a national problem, as my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, said.  I ask the Minister to consult with her colleague, the Minister for Health, to see what is being done with regard to the undertaking given to me by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, and senior officials in the Department about an expansion of the methadone maintenance programme for people who wish to come off drugs.  Many of the drugs imported into this country will be reexported, but many of them are made available here.  Because we have 2,000 kilometres of coastline and because of out position on the periphery of the European Union, this country has become the gateway for the importation of drugs onto the European mainland from abroad.  We are the junky junction of the world.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, raised the question of assistance from Europe.  There is a fund in the European Union to assist in policing the outer perimeters of the Community. We have been seeking an allocation of £12 million from that fund specifically to cover the matters I have dealt with and I ask the Minister for Justice to urgently pursue that matter.</P>
      <P>On the immediate problem we are discussing, there is not doubt the hands of the Garda are tied.  The law on the right to silence must be considered as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that professional criminals leave no forensic evidence.  Consequently, if a hardened criminal can withstand Garda interrogation for 12 hours, inevitably he or she will walk free.  In those circumstances the law on the right to silence must be changed.  I ask the Minister for Justice to contact the Law Reform Commission as a matter of urgency to see when it will produce its proposals on bail.  The Garda have informed me, and I am sure also informed the Minister for Justice, that the laws on bail need to be considered as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister consult with the Garda Commissioner about two recent directives given by him to staff at a <Col N="810" /> lower level?  The first relates to detectives having to give the names of confidential informants to their superior officers.  This will reduce the level of detection.  I would also ask the Minister to consult with the Commissioner about the change of tenure policy whereby people are wafting in and out of the detective branch like Lanigans Ball. They are in the detective branch for three years and then revert to uniform duty.  That is not calculated to increase confidence in the administration of justice. It has created a crisis of confidence in the Garda and as a result there is a crisis of confidence in the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>Various changes are needed in criminal law and in personnel policy.  The security system in place at present costs the taxpayers an enormous amount of money and we must ensure we get the best possible value for that money.  I would like the Minister's comments on the following: a review of the rural policing scheme; progress on the installation of close circuit television monitoring in city centre areas; the extension of community-based projects as recommended in the 1992 report on urban crime and disorder; the present status of the information technology plan promised by the Minister's predecessor to ensure the Garda will not waste too much time on paperwork and to increase the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the Garda; the upgrading of the Garda Communications network for which money was provided in last year's Estimates and the upgrading of the Garda fleet.  I would like an honest, open and transparent response to the questions raised by my colleague on what the Minister knew about last week's robbery, how much she knew and when she heard it.</P>
    <P>We need answers to those questions. Since the Government took office on the basis of accountability and transparency, that is the least it owes this House.  If we cannot get information from the Minister for Justice on communications between her and the <Col N="811" /> Garda, if we have to read the newspapers to get that information, the only transparency is the excuses she has given for her lack of accountability and openness in this regard.  There is a crisis of confidence in the administration of justice.  The people who carried out the largest bank robbery in money terms in the history of this State will more than likely remain free.  The largest money laundering operation in the history of the State is at present in progress.  The Minister should give her reaction to Deputy O'Donoghue's proposals on the seizure of assets.  Why has she not communicated with the banks and other financial institutions who are, at a leisurely pace, preparing guidelines to put the money laundering provisions of the 1994 legislation into operation?  Those provisions should have been put into operation long ago.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="812" /> To delete all words after &ldquo;That,&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann recommends and supports the commitment of the Government to improve and enhance the effectiveness of the criminal justice system and</P>
    <P>&mdash;notes, in particular, the commitment given by the Minister for Justice to provide the Garda Síochána with all necessary resources to deal effectively with the crime situation, especially with regard to serious and violent crime;</P>
    <P>&mdash;recognises the Government's determination to address the issue of drug-related crime as a matter deserving of the utmost priority;</P>
    <P>&mdash;welcomes the Minister's announcement to bring forward to Government, as soon as possible, detailed proposals designed to provide for a co-ordinated and cohesive response to the drugs situation by all of the law enforcement agencies concerned;</P>
    <P>&mdash;supports the plan to establish a community drugs team, which would incorporate counselling, medical treatment and rehabilitative support services;</P>
    <P>&mdash; looks forward to the introduction of a juvenile justice Bill, which will streamline the process of early intervention, and will deal with the need for suitable custodial facilities for young offenders, and the involvement of parents in dealing with offenders, particularly repeat offenders;</P>
    <P>&mdash; welcomes the commitment to draft a charter for victims of crime which will include a review of the criminal injuries compensation system; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; notes the commitment to extend community policing, with gardaí based in community units working in co-operation with the local community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="813" /> I must express my abhorrence at the shooting of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> journalist, Veronica Guerin, last night in her home.  This crime has appalled us all and reminds us in a most chilling way of the kind of criminals who operate in our midst.  I commend Veronica Guerin as a person and journalist of great courage and wish her a speedy and full recovery from her injuries.  I assure her that a full and thorough investigation of this shooting is under way and understand the Garda are questioning a man about the crime.  I have no further information on this shooting and whether it is related to Ms Guerin's work as a journalist and-or the robbery last week.</P>
    <P>There can hardly be a doubt that the backdrop to Deputy O'Donoghue's motion is the raid at the Brink's-Allied premises in Clonshaugh last Tuesday about which he and many others recently expressed concern.  I am sure the House will understand if I devote the time available to me this evening to this issue.  I am utterly bemused by the contributions of Fianna Fáil Members. Where have they been for the past seven years?  Have they been on a slow boat to China?  If the litany they gave to the House tonight is anything to go by, they must recognise that they did nothing during that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly grateful for the opportunity afforded me to deal in the House this evening with the crime at Clonshaugh.  I want to deal as comprehensively as I can, and as best I can, with all that has been said including, of course, what I and the Taoiseach said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government and I are outraged at this robbery.  A most thorough examination is being carried out and any problems exposed by that examination will receive urgent attention from me and the Government.  I will not shield <Col N="815" /> any lapses or any individuals that should not be shielded.</P>
    <P>I want to try to draw the lines between fact, fiction and opinion.  Over the past few days, both in media coverage and otherwise, these lines have at times been somewhat blurred.  I do not seek to blame anybody for this confusion. It is not at all unusual for confusion of this kind to arise following criminal actions which give rise to serious public concern.</P>
    <P>I want to spell out the risks associated with widespread speculation concerning certain aspects of this robbery.  I am duty-bound as Minister for Justice to address this very important topic at this time.  I want to refer to resources and to openness, transparency and accountability in Government &mdash; the express commitment of this Government.</P>
    <P>Before I proceed to deal with the facts &mdash; and, more importantly, to separate fact from fiction and opinion &mdash; I would make an appeal.  We, as responsible parliamentarians, must try to maintain at least some focus on the fact that what happened was that a group of armed criminals, reckless as to the consequences, carried out an outrageous crime by breaching security at what was believed to be a most secure cash-holding location.  We must leave those concerned in no doubt that it is our view, as it is of all decent law-abiding people, that it is the criminals, and nobody else who are the culprits.  It is they who are and ought to be the focus of public odium.  They are not heroes.  They are the ruthless, dedicated and heartless enemies of the people.</P>
    <P>I do not for one moment suggest that the Garda, nor indeed any politician, should be immune from criticism if the investigation proves this is deserved.  My appeal is simply for a sense of care, proportion and fair play in what we do and what we say about the crime in Clonshaugh. We may rest assured that shifting the focus of attention away from the perpetrators of this crime will assist nobody but the criminals.  We should <Col N="816" /> maintain a sense of balance and not forget who are the real enemies in all of this.  I know that Deputies will recognise the validity of my appeal on this score.</P>
    <P>Turning to the facts, fiction and opinions, all information about crime that I or the Taoiseach has given, or will give, to this House is based on the information we receive from the Garda authorities. The same is true of the information which has been given to the House by other Taoisigh and Ministers for Justice.  What I have to say now is based on both the briefing I got last Wednesday and further briefings by the Garda Commissioner to the Secretary of my Department, and what has been conveyed by the Garda authorities to my Department in the course of numerous other contacts since this crime took place.  The basic facts of this robbery, which I gave to the House last Wednesday, are already well known.</P>
    <P>Last Wednesday I was informed by the Garda authorities that they had general intelligence last November to the effect that a vehicle with cash in transit could be the subject of a criminal attack. I informed the Dáil that there was generalised intelligence but, on advice, I did not go into details, nor did I go into any details in the Dáil concerning the security operation mounted on foot of that intelligence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Listen, please.  I want to stress that the information, both then and now, about the intelligence received and the nature of the Garda operation only covers a certain level of detail.  I did not then, nor do I have now, all the details, nor would it be appropriate for me to insist on having them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Although I did not know about the existence of the collator's report on Wednesday last, it contains nothing in the way of detail which I did not know from my conversation with the Garda Commissioner, but it contains more detail concerning what the Garda knew and what they were doing about it than I would ever give to this House or anybody else.</P>
      <P>As the report is now, unfortunately, in the public domain, the intelligence as to timing that the Garda had last November was to the effect that an attack, on what was then thought would be a van in-transit, would take place well before Christmas.  At that point, an appropriate Garda operation was launched with minimal internal circulation of information which is standard procedure to avoid leaks of the kind displayed since I spoke in the Dáil last Wednesday.</P>
      <P>Once sufficient time after the expected period of an attack had elapsed, again in accordance with normal practice, a collator's report was circulated more widely within the Garda and in tandem with the winding down of the intensive operation which had been mounted on foot of the general intelligence received in November.  It is this collator's report that was leaked to the press.  The fact that it happened to be circulated days before the Brinks Allied robbery occurred is a coincidence of time and should not be read by the House as a specific warning of a crime about to occur.  I am told by the Garda that collators reports are regularly circulated internally as a sweeping exercise and no SOS message is attached to them.  That is as much as I can prudently say about the details of any intelligence the Garda had, but I can say more about the actions the Garda took.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not a fact that the Garda had an indication that any premises would be the subject of an attack.  I will come to the matter of opinions later &mdash; because there is a view that the existence of strong suspicions based on intelligence ought reasonably to have given rise to further suspicions &mdash; but, at this point, I <Col N="818" /> want to stick to the facts.  The facts which I have been given by the Garda Commissioner were that the Garda had information that there would be an attack, but their intelligence both as to timing and target was wrong.</P>
    <P>The Garda Commissioner has confirmed that it is a fact also that the Garda superintendent in Santry visited the management at Brinks-Allied a few weeks before the robbery.  According to the written report of the superintendent, he did this because there had been a change in management at the premises and, as local superintendent, he thought it appropriate that he should introduce himself to members of the new management team.  He said that he discussed various matters of a security nature with those concerned, but did not indicate to them that their premises was likely to be the subject of an attack because there was, according to the Garda authorities, no intelligence to the effect that any premises would be attacked.</P>
    <P>I have also been informed that there had been contact by phone from the Garda to this company along with other security companies warning generally of the possibility of an attack on a vehicle with cash in transit.  I am assured that, on this occasion, the Garda made no reference either to the possibility of an attack on the premises or any premises of any other security company because that was not the intelligence they had. Contacts were a continuing part of the specific security operation that had been launched in November.</P>
    <P>There have also been references to a circular issued to its employees by Brink's-Allied and that this circular refers to the possibility of an attack on the Brinks-Allied premises.  They are the only people who can answer why their circular refers to premises as opposed to cash in transit and I do not want to speculate about the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister ask them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="819" />
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that the company's warning to its employees signalled, on the part of the management of Brinks-Allied, that there was concern on their part about the vulnerability of the Clonshaugh premises.  The Garda had noted that the company was extremely confident about the quality of its security arrangements at this location.  The company's view was that security arrangements at Clonshaugh were state of the art.  The possibility of a successful attack on a vehicle inside the premises was one that did not appear to be contemplated by the company nor by anybody else either.  They will have to consider this now.</P>
      <P>Returning again to the details, it has been put about as fact that the Garda had surveillance on this premises and that they had an armed guard on the premises who was supposed to have left the vicinity two hours before the robbery took place.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there is no truth in either of these statements.  This has been put about as fact with so much sincerity and conviction that I have checked it several times with the Garda authorities.  This morning I received an absolute assurance from the Garda Commissioner that this information, that there was no surveillance, represents the factual situation.</P>
      <P>There is another suggestion which has been put forward as fact with such sincerity and conviction that it, too, is something which I have checked and rechecked with the Garda authorities.  It has been suggested that individuals in this company and others were warned by the Garda, as part of the security operation mounted in November, to take care for their personal safety. Again, I am assured that this is not the case.  If there is information to the contrary, I will be glad to receive it.  If it is true, I will have to raise questions with the Garda authorities of the most serious kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Returning again to the details, it is said to be a fact that the company was alerted not by its staff but by somebody else that a raid was taking place on its <Col N="820" /> premises.  It is a matter for the company to address issues of this kind, but the information I have received form the Garda indicates this statement is also untrue.  I do not wish to be tied to this Garda comment at this stage as a statement of fact.  More investigation will be required before we know everything we need to know about what care the company did or did not take, what actions its own employees took and so on.</P>
    <P>According to at least two reports, it was 20 minutes before the first Garda car got to the scene of this crime.  My information, again from the Garda authorities, is that this is not the case. According to the computer printout from the Garda command and control centre, which was brought to my Department yesterday morning by the Commissioner, the Garda were alerted about the robbery at 18.33 p.m. and the first car got to the premises about five and a half minutes later.</P>
    <P>There has been a report to the effect that the Garda were either not admitted or were delayed by security staff in getting into the premises.  Again, my information from the Garda authorities is that this is untrue.  There was no delay in admission.</P>
    <P>I have tried to address most of the matters that have been put about as fact and have tried as best I can to distinguish fact from fiction.  If I have omitted any matters which have been put about as fact &mdash; and they are matters that I can reasonably be expected to deal with in this House &mdash; I shall be glad to do so.</P>
    <P>I have to explain at this point that there are certain matters which have been put about as matters of fact on which I cannot comment, not because they are true and may therefore be embarrassing to somebody or other, but because of the distinct possibility that they would be damaging to this investigation, to criminal investigations generally or to the interests and safety of private individuals.  I will return to this point.  Lest anybody accuses me again of misleading them about the Brinks Allied robbery, as Minister for Justice, <Col N="821" /> I receive information about crime generally and I have information about aspects of this crime, about evidential matters and so on, which I cannot and will not disclose.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that I was economical with the truth and misled this House.  These allegations are without foundation.  I have no wish to labour the suggestion that I set out to mislead or that the Taoiseach did so.  It would be stupidity to do anything of the kind at any time.  It is an accusation which is devoid of substance and I do not want to lend substance to it, unwittingly, by pretending that it is the core issue we have to deal with this evening.  It is a red herring raised, not out of any base motive, but partly because of misinformation from various sources and partly also for straightforward political reasons &mdash; no more, no less than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I must refute any suggestion that my not knowing about the collator's report is proof that the Garda Commissioner, when he met me last Wednesday, was holding back on information. This was a routine circular, the existence of which made no difference to the crime and to the quality and range of intelligence which the Garda had received about two months earlier. The Commissioner had come back to me within 24 hours of the occurrence of a major crime, at a time when the number one Garda priority was to apprehend the guilty parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is always a grave risk, in giving information so soon after an occurrence of this kind, that something to which some may later seek to attach an exaggerated significance will not be mentioned. I do not have the slightest doubt, now, that this was one of the primary reasons my predecessors, in the immediate aftermath of major crimes, refused to give any information, as a matter of standard practice.  There are several exJustice Ministers in the Opposition benches who will be in a position to confirm <Col N="822" /> this, without my having to produce any evidence for them.</P>
    <P>The genuine effort to be helpful by providing information carries its risks. For the Minister and the Garda authorities there is, sadly, the risk that they will find themselves accorded higher priority in the queue for the dock than the criminals who carried out the crime. I did not mislead, the Taoiseach did not mislead and the many people who have made this allegation know full well that it is an allegation without substance.</P>
    <P>Turning for a moment to matters of opinion as distinct from fact, the principal matter I wish to comment on is the opinion that, in the light of the intelligence to them, the Garda should have been able to prevent this robbery.  I cannot criticise anybody for holding opinions.  Each and every one of us is entitled to form opinions on matters of this kind or on any other matter on which we may choose to opine, but they are still opinions, not facts.</P>
    <P>On this subject, what I have given to the House are the opinions of the Garda Commissioner who is head of the police force.  My advice, from the Garda Commissioner is that, in a situation where the Garda has intelligence about a possible attack and it turns out that both the suspected object of the attack and the likely date of attack are wrong, it is not possible for it to mount an effective preventative strategy, by which it means a strategy which is virtually guaranteed to succeed.</P>
    <P>I am advised that, in a high proportion of cases where intelligence is near the mark &mdash; and very often when it is not so near the mark &mdash; preventative strategies work and that would-be attempts by criminals are frustrated in many situations but, unless the intelligence is precise, the Garda &mdash; and this applies to all police forces &mdash; simply cannot guarantee success.</P>
    <P>I am given to understand that intelligence of all kinds comes into the Garda Síochána on a daily basis.  It mounts operations based on that intelligence &mdash; it mounted a very substantial operation <Col N="823" /> on the basis of the information received in this instance &mdash; but, as a matter of operating practice, it is obliged to discontinue the operations after a certain stage.  When it seems that the intelligence was wide of the mark or simply unfounded, it makes operating sense to wind down and to concentrate on bringing to fruition other intelligence sources.</P>
    <P>The Garda &mdash; like all police forces &mdash; also has to guard against the possibility that misleading intelligence will be deliberately fed in for the sole purpose of diverting resources and generally creating confusion.  There was, for example, a hoax call to a nearby shopping centre around the time of the Brinks Allied robbery.  I do not wish to suggest that the hoax was directly related to the robbery because I have no proof that it was.</P>
    <P>In summary, on the question of opinions, the position is that I gave to this House the information which I received from the Garda Commissioner. I recognise, however, that people are entitled to form other opinions as to what might have been achievable, given what they know of the intelligence available to the Garda.</P>
    <P>The next matter and, by far the most important matter which I have to deal with here this evening, deals with the risks that can be associated with the speculation concerning certain aspects of this crime.  In this connection, I have to say &mdash; in agreement with the Garda Commissioner &mdash; that it is a matter of the greatest regret and concern that some person or persons, totally reckless as to the consequences of his or her action, saw fit to leak a confidential document concerning Garda intelligence and operational matters.  The Garda Commissioner is investigating this matter.  I want to say no more about it at this point beyond that it signals a level of recklessness and disloyalty which dishonours the calling of the individual or individuals involved.</P>
    <P>In mentioning risks, I want to make it absolutely clear that I am not talking about any particular crime, nor am I <Col N="824" /> seeking to make any connection between one crime and another.  Were I to do so, I would simply add to the risks, some of which I now wish to identify.</P>
    <P>First there is the risk, in talking and speculating about Garda intelligence and operations, that criminals will want to know how the Garda has come into possession of information about criminal plans.  There is the risk that they will draw conclusions, free from any concerns about fair procedures or fair trial and there is the grave risk that they will act with merciless savagery on foot of those conclusions.</P>
    <P>Second, there is the great risk of damage to intelligence-gathering generally which is an essential tool if we are to deal with the activities of criminals. Good intelligence is the life blood of all police work.</P>
    <P>Third, there is the risk that publicity about identifiable individuals &mdash; I again stress that I am not referring to any particular case &mdash; could seriously damage the prospects of a successful outcome to criminal investigations.  The allegation that there has been prejudicial publicity is a standard and understandable issue that may be raised by way of defence.</P>
    <P>Fourth, and not without considerable importance, is the risk that the image of the Garda force itself would suffer serious damage.  The Garda success rate, by international standards, when it comes to dealing with serious crime, is quite impressive.  Contrary to what has been said publicity in recent days about the incidence of aggravated burglary and armed robbery, I understand that the figures under these headings will show a massive drop of 20 per cent for last year, including a 28 per cent drop in the Dublin Metropolitan Area.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that there was no problem about resources in this particular case, nor was there any question of the Garda operation being would down because of lack of money for overtime payments.  It is perfectly reasonable to expect, within all employments, that there will be a tendency to highlight resource issues when something goes wrong.  When <Col N="825" /> additional resources are required for the battle against crime, they are and will continue to be provided.  I am assured by Garda management that there was no resource problem in this case.</P>
    <P>Were there faults and failings in this case?  Clearly there were.  The Government and I are deeply concerned about what happened.  All aspects of what took place will be examined in detail and we will take whatever lessons are to be learned.</P>
    <P>I do not want to pre-empt the outcome of the investigation which is already under way but we can safely say that at least four matters require attention. First, there is an urgent need for security firms carrying or holding large amounts of money to review the adequacy of their own security arrangements. They owe a duty to the public and the taxpayer to do this.  It is simply not acceptable that criminals can come into what was supposed to be a &ldquo;state of the art&rdquo; premises, in security terms, and drive away with almost £3 million. If the process of raising standards can be assisted by legislation or by means of regulations, I will certainly take appropriate action.  I welcome Deputy O'Donoghue's support for that and wonder why his Government did not do it a long time ago.</P>
    <P>Second, there is an urgent need to examine Garda and Army escort arrangements.  In particular, the practice of departing immediately that the escorted cash is inside the cash holding centre will have to be reviewed.  This will have cost implications which I and the Government will need to consider and discuss with the private concerns in question.</P>
    <P>Third, there is a need to bring into operation those sections of the 1994 money laundering legislation which, when brought into force, will impose disclosure obligations on financial institutions and other bodies, in the light of the EU Directive on money laundering.</P>
    <P>These obligations will relate to procedures for identifying customers and the reporting of particular transactions. At present, the various institutions and <Col N="826" /> bodies on whom such obligations will be imposed, are making the necessary administrative arrangements, including drawing up detailed guidelines.</P>
    <P>A steering group set up under the auspices of the Department of Finance is overseeing this process and I have asked my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to give the matter top priority. It will clearly require staff training and other measures of this kind, and it is important to get it right but it is also important that it be given priority and my intention is that it will.  I ask again why the outgoing Fianna Fáil Administration did not expedite the work of that committee under the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern.</P>
    <P>Fourth, there is need to examine our general law to see whether we can remove the insult in our midst of the criminal godfathers and their agents who go about, not just in this country but in all civilised countries, safe in the knowledge that they can abuse the basic rights and protections enshrined in our laws.</P>
    <P>We need to examine these protections but we also have to acknowledge to ourselves, honestly, that the notion that we should, for example, modify the presumption of innocence until proven guilty, provide that inferences may be drawn from the refusal to answer questions, abolish the right to bail, and severely limit the option of early release from custody has to be examined in a measured way in the overall context of our democratic legal system.</P>
    <P>We know that when the furore associated with individual outrages dies down, it becomes notoriously difficult to secure wide support for suggestions that, at a time like this, appear to enjoy much wider support.</P>
    <P>Then, there is the question of openness, transparency and accountability in Government.  The information that the Taoiseach and I gave the Dáil last week, which has since been called into question, was gained by me in the direct briefing by the Garda Commissioner.  In the intervening period, as more facts and details about this robbery emerged <Col N="827" /> from the investigation, I have tonight been able to outline some of this information and clarify some of the issues that Members of this House and the media have raised.  I stress, however, that in the information I give tonight, and even in the extent of this information, I have been conscious that anything I say must not and cannot be prejudicial either to the effectiveness of Garda operations or to a successful prosecution.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and I fully appreciate the concern expressed about the effectiveness of the fight against crime.  We share the goal of bringing the criminals to justice.  He and I &mdash; and the Government &mdash; are at one in our determination to have the Garda operation before, during, and after this crime fully investigated. In addition, we want to see Brinks Allied security measures fully investigated.  We want to assure the House that any lapses that may have occurred will be uncovered and acted upon.</P>
    <P>I doubt if anybody, following the statement that I have now given to the House, will be able to garner much in the way of support for the proposition that I have been less than forthcoming on the Clonshaugh robbery within the strictures of my office.  In fact, I have said considerably more than any of my predecessors would have said in a similar situation, particularly because of leaks to the press that have thrown incorrect slants on the actions of the Garda.</P>
    <P>I am sure that we can take it that nobody in this House really subscribes to the notion that openness in Government requires that the Minister for Justice should disclose information which could put the safety of others at risk and which, in the end, would aid criminals rather than their victims.</P>
    <P>That kind of exposure does not assist the public, it does not assist Members of this House, it does not assist the Garda. It assists the true villains in all situations of this kind &mdash; the criminals who are the <Col N="828" /> enemies of all decent law-abiding people in this State.</P>
    <P>I have devoted the time available to me this evening to what I have no doubt is the central issue which gave rise to this motion.  I did so because of the damage that this incident and its surrounding publicity has caused to public perception of the effectiveness of the law and order system.  We will have time tomorrow evening to answer a number of questions raised on general policy issues.  Deputies know that considerable progress is under way in respect of the various matters to which I have adverted in the amendment.</P>
    <P>I commend the amendment to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Brinks Allied crime has created a crisis.  People across the country are living in fear because of what happened in Dublin, in the Minister's constituency.</P>
      <P>In the past few days people have blamed the Garda for increased crime. That is like shooting the messenger and ignoring the message.  Deputies have said that crime is rampant, that nothing can be done about it and that the criminal is winning.  These comments are coming from the Government parties and that worries me.  My constituents are asking what can be done to save their property and premises from the rule of the criminal.</P>
      <P>There is no point in increasing the number of gardaí unless we tackle the system.  There is no point in the Minister blaming this side of the House for what happened in the past seven years or in the past 20 years.  She is in the driving seat now and I recommend that she take action as a matter of urgency to correct a very embarrassing situation.</P>
      <P>One of the problems is that sentencing is erratic.  There is a harsher sentence for driving with 80 milligrams of alcohol in one's blood than there is for serious crime involving serious bodily harm.  There is no consistency in sentencing in any court in the land when sentencing those who have caused hurt and damage resulting in people having to be hospitalised.  Until such time as there is some consistency in sentencing crime will increase on our streets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The revolving door syndrome in our prisons has been mentioned.  Because of the Minister's decision to release more republican prisoners, which I welcome because of the climate of peace, there will be more space so that there will be no need to operate a revolving door system.  There will be no need to allow <Col N="830" /> prisoners out on Friday night and back on Sunday morning.  They can be kept in.  I urge the Minister to make maximum use of the extra spaces and keep crime off our streets so that people can be safe in their homes.</P>
    <P>Another point that has been made is that hours of Garda time are taken up with paper work.  That must be changed as quickly as possible.  When the gardaí give evidence in court it is they who are on trial.  It is they who are interrogated, not the criminals.  Many of our gardaí, the finest people in this country, are nervous of going into court to face being put on trial with no one to defend them. That is why we have such a high level of crime on our streets and a nervousness on the part of gardaí of doing the kind of job they should.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not concentrate just on Dublin where there is a high level of crime, and that rural Ireland will not see a major onslaught of criminal activity as a result of criminals moving from city to rural areas.  Because the incidence of crime is greater in Dublin than in other parts of the country, the Minister may put all her resources into the city.  However, rural Ireland has been under attack for some time.  If there is a lesser emphasis on policing rural areas we will see more crime there. There are people in rural Ireland who live in fear of attack by criminals, and there have been many such attacks in recent times.  I want to see an even-handed approach by the Minister as between rural Ireland and the Pale and the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>In spite of what happened at Brinks Allied, bank money in transit will receive less attention because we are led to believe that it was at risk from subversive elements.  The reduction in the level of activity by subversive elements will mean the availability of more manpower to improve security on the streets for ordinary citizens.  Things have changed rather fast in favour of the Government and the Minister will have an easier task in the Department of Justice than any previous Minister.  The reduction in the activity of subversive <Col N="831" /> elements is the result of the great work done on the peace process from Charlie Haughey's day onwards.</P>

      <P>The question of the right to silence has been mentioned.  I admire the Minister in many ways.  She comes from a family that has kept the best traditions of law and order up front.  I do not want to turn this country into a police State, but I believe there must be some change in regard to the right to silence.  Otherwise we will not have the kind of law and order that is necessary to protect the vast majority of our citizens.  Only just before Christmas Deputy Kemmy made a statement to the effect that he wanted to retain the right to silence. Deputy Eric Byrne was concerned recently about the level of crime.  The Minister has an enormous task to hold the line and put things right in this rainbow coalition Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Mulvihill is here.  I have no doubt that he is a law abiding citizen.  I appeal to Deputy Mulvihill to ensure that the community policing system is not put in place in Youghal, in the east Cork district. Community policing does not work.  I want the Deputy to go back and tell that to the people of east Cork who are in favour of the green man.  The green man does not address the problem of policing, it is only an item on the door, not even a work of art.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many cases where people have been convicted of having stolen goods but have not had to pay compensation to their victims.  I can quote <Col N="832" /> instances where goods ranging in value from £1,500 to £3,000 have been stolen from garages, workshops and utility areas but the culprits have simply been fined and have not had to pay full compensation to their victims, who in many cases have been put out of business.  The ball is in the Minister's court and it is up to her to tighten this area.</P>
    <P>We have witnessed the shooting of Veronica Guerin.  Will every journalist now be under attack?  Are those who write about crime safe in their homes tonight?  I have to pose that question because the <i>Sunday Independent</i> carried a two page story on a certain individual and what is happening in Dublin.  Now that decent honest journalist, who has been identified with law and order, has been shot in the leg.</P>
    <P>Rural crime is the biggest single issue today outside the capital and should be addressed.  The Garda Síochána has insufficient resources and, when it detects someone, the courts are not in its favour.  Our bail laws are the greatest weakness in the system because someone on bail can commit further crimes. We need to tighten our bail laws.  This may mean a constitutional change which will meet strong opposition but the Minister has the wherewithal to do business and I appeal to her to tighten these laws in the interests of law and order.  If this does not happen this will be one of the worst Governments to have served the nation in terms of law and order.</P>
    <P>The robbery referred to would not happen in San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles or London.  It was scandalous that one could see a section of a security railing being removed and that trucks and wagons could then enter the premises.  People in the European Union ask if there is law and order in Ireland or if there is even a Government. That is the harsh reality of life.  I have never seen such a reaction in my lifetime to a crime, even in instances of violent crime.  The people whom I represent in Mitchelstown to Mallow are living in fear because the criminals from Cork city drive their vans through their <Col N="833" /> areas at night.  If something is not done quickly we will have a total breakdown of law and order.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána is seeking additional powers which it will exercise if it gets them from the people in authority. Will the Minister initiate and implement whatever legislation is necessary in support of our citizens?  It is vitally important to change the system of community policing.  Pooling the resources of the Garda Síochána in one station and having them serve the outlying area in their cars from that station will not work, that is not policing.  Community policing is a proposal from Garda management and I ask the Minister to end this system because I want to see a Garda in every station.  Furthermore, the green man system does not work and if it is to be used it should be a more up-to-date technological system.</P>

      <P>We hoped that the Minister would clarify the disclosure she made to Dáil Éireann last week but in many instances her speech tonight has created more confusion.  I suggest she makes some admission that she did not give the full details to the Dáil last week.  In her speech she said: &ldquo;I informed the Dáil that there was generalised intelligence but, on advice, I did not go into details nor did I go into any details in the Dáil concerning the security operation which was mounted....&rdquo; That implies the Minister was in possession of those details and in possession of information pertaining to the memo which was subsequently revealed in the media and to which Deputy Harney alerted her in the House.  Implicit in that paragraph is a significant admission that the Minister did not give the full details.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a week now since the robbery and I do not think it is good enough for the Minister to come into this House and say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> There have also been references to a circular issued to its employees by Brinks-Allied themselves and that this circular refers to the possibility of an attack on the Brinks-Allied premises. They themselves are the only people who can answer why their circular refers to premises as opposed to cash in transit and I do not want to speculate about the matter.</P>
    <P>Members should know whether such a circular existed, who authorised such a circular, the background to it and how the information in it appears to be more specific than the information the Minister or the gardaí had.  I do not think it is good enough that the Minister inserts such a paragraph one week later.  My colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, has already referred to the following sentence: &ldquo;I do not wish to be tied to this Garda comment at this stage as a statement of fact.&rdquo; Which almost implies qualified confidence in the Garda Commissioner and the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Read the whole paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the full paragraph and I can quote it: the Minister said: &ldquo;It is a matter for the company itself to address issues of this kind, but the information I have received from the gardaí indicates this statement is also untrue.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister then qualifies that by saying: &ldquo;I do not wish to be tied to this Garda comment at this stage as a statement of fact.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister should stand by the Garda information.  I think that comment should be withdrawn, the Minister should come before the House confident in the information she has received from the Garda Síochána or she should not put such statements before the House.  It does not add to confidence generally in our security apparatus or the Garda Síochána that the Minister comes in and has qualified confidence in the information they have given her.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also disappointed that paralysis <Col N="835" /> and obfuscation have become the hallmark of the Minister's approach to this issue.  The measures proposed in the Minister's speech on the issue of reform of bail laws for instance can be taken as a code for inaction, for example the Minister talks about matters that have &ldquo;to be examined in a measured way in the overall context of our democratic legal system&rdquo;.  When something of this magnitude happens people expect action to be taken.  All the Minister said is that she has asked the Minister for Finance to give priority to legislation dealing with money laundering.  It is important that action be taken immediately to restore public confidence in our law and order system.  It is pathetic to say that the Minister has been asked to give the legislation priority.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter.  I wish to share my time with Deputy Coughlan. A number of other Deputies indicated they wished to contribute on this issue because it affects all Border Deputies &mdash; Deputies Brendan Smith, Leonard, O'Hanlon, Kirk and Dermot Ahern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Successive Ministers for Finance have received representations from time to time on behalf of people living in the Republic but working in Northern Ireland.  It is estimated that between <Col N="836" /> 20,000 and 30,000 people are involved. Their argument is they are caught in a draconian double tax trap.  They have noted remarks by the Taoiseach that he was confident that if this case was taken to the European Court of Human Rights it would be struck out on the basis of discrimination.  I am sure the Taoiseach, now that he is no longer in Opposition, realises it is a complex issue.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to look at the matter carefully in an effort to remedy any obvious injustice or discrimination. There are two areas which can be dealt with without too much difficulty.  I understand the Revenue Commissioners look at the gross earnings of the individual in Northern Ireland, translate that into Irish pounds and assess the tax accordingly.  I suggest that the Minister ensures that the appropriate sum is calculated as the gross amount less the charges deducted by the banks foreign exchange section which can be as high as 4 per cent of total salary when translated in simple terms. Similarly any of the moneys apart from tax deducted in Northern Ireland such as national insurance should be taken into account at that time.  In other words, tax should be reckoned on the actual amount in Irish pounds credited to the receiver in the Republic.</P>
    <P>The current agreement was signed in 1976 and Fianna Fáil returned to power in 1977.  The then Minister for Finance, the late Mr. George Colley, accepted the argument that the extra burden of taxation was imposed rather suddenly on the people concerned.  He agreed to refund 50 per cent of the first year's payment on a once-off basis.  Part of the 1976 agreement ensured that natives of the UK working in Northern Ireland but living in the Republic were exempt from paying tax in the Republic provided they were employed and paid by the State.  I am now told that some, such as teachers, have been brought into the tax net here on the grounds that they are paid by governing bodies and not by the State.  I hope justice and fair play will ensure these people are given a similar <Col N="837" /> deal and refund.  The crux of the matter is that salaries in Northern Ireland can sometimes be as much as 30 per cent lower than salaries in the Republic yet they are taxed at the higher rate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with everything my colleague said about this problem. Many of those who live in the Border areas travel to Northern Ireland to work due to economic necessity.  Their wages are often much less than those of their counterparts in the Republic yet they are expected to pay at the Irish rates.  The exemptions given under the 1976 double taxation agreement created inequality.  There are now even greater inequities.  I ask the Minister to change this draconian measure before the budget is brought in.  It is a matter of extreme importance to those who live in the Border areas.  Given the economic circumstances, even greater numbers of people will travel to Northern Ireland to work and they also will be caught in this trap.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish residents are taxed on their worldwide income wherever it arises.  Irish residents who are cross-Border workers are, therefore, liable for tax on their income accruing in Northern Ireland.  Under the 1976 Double Taxation Agreement with the UK, cross-Border workers are given credit on their tax liability here for tax paid in Northern Ireland.  As some rates of taxation are higher in the Republic than in the UK, this in effect means that cross-Border workers, resident in the South, are liable for some Irish taxation in addition to UK taxation.  This is in accordance with the general practice adopted by <Col N="838" /> most member states of the European Union in regard to foreign income earned by residents and ensures that residents who earn all or some of their income in another State contribute, through the taxation system, to the services provided by the State of which they are resident.</P>
      <P>Some member states of the European Union have included in their double taxation agreements provisions in regard to frontier workers and in the majority of these cases taxation is based only in the country of residence.  If we decided to adopt this system of taxation of cross-Border workers &mdash; this could only be done with the agreement of the UK authorities &mdash; the net position of Irish resident cross-Border workers would be exactly the same as under the current system.</P>
      <P>The position here is that, except where the PRSI allowance applies, a cross-Border worker pays exactly the same amount of income tax and levies as another Irish resident with the same income.  The PRSI allowance of £286 is only available to taxpayers who pay the full rate of PRSI here.</P>
      <P>Some cross-Border workers claim they are discriminated against on grounds of nationality.  I do not accept this.  With the exception of a small group of public servants, all residents in the State who work in Northern Ireland are subject to Irish taxation, with credit given for tax paid in the UK.  Under Article 18 of the Ireland/UK Double Taxation Agreement, the exemption from Irish tax applies only to public servants working in Northern Ireland who meet the following criteria: that they are Government employees or employees of local government; that they are British nationals or have both Irish and British nationality; and that the service is rendered in the discharge of functions of a governmental nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be seen that the exemption from Irish taxation only applies to a very restricted group of public servants, that is to say, a person with British nationality, working for the Civil Service or a local authority in Northern <Col N="839" /> Ireland and resident in the South.  If this restricted exemption was to be extended, for example, to all cross-Border public servants, then the non-public service cross-Border worker could rightly claim that she or he was being discriminated against.  If the exemption was given to all cross-Border workers it would mean that Ireland was out of line with the common practice adopted by our European partners.  It must also be pointed out that the favourable treatment of certain cross-Border public servants derives from standard international practice based on the model OECD Double Taxation Convention.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of court cases recently brought by cross-Border public servants.  The courts have upheld the Revenue Commissioners position in these cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach are aware of the concerns expressed by some cross-Border workers and are having the whole question examined.  As Deputy McDaid said, it is a difficult and complex area.  It may be impossible to find a solution which caters directly for the individuals affected which is fair to all the taxpayers involved, that is, both cross-Border workers and all other Irish resident taxpayers. It is important, therefore, that expectations of relief or some special arrangements should not be built up, particularly since successive Ministers for Finance have failed to resolved this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with the issues of main and county roads and national primary and national secondary roads.  When the peace initiative was taken an order was made for opening Border roads.  I congratulate the Department of the Environment on having moved so quickly and providing Monaghan County Council &mdash; in whose local authority area the greatest number of Border crossings were closed &mdash;<Col N="840" /> approximately 50 &mdash; with £340,000 for their repair over the following three months.  The Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland is charged with responsibility for bridges and culverts, as our Department is responsible only for the region up to the Border.  In the instance I cite Monaghan County Council and the Department of the Environment in the North are to be congratulated on the speed, efficiency and manner with which that work was carried out.</P>
      <P>However, it creates problems for Monaghan County Council because some of those 50 roads were mere <i>culsde-sac</i>, in some cases of four or five miles, serving as accommodation roads only for the people living along them. When traffic resumes on these roads we should be faced with a very substantial bill for reconstruction to accommodate that traffic.  It must be remembered that practically all the concrete, gravel and stone products for the northern part of the county will be taking the shortest route across those roads.  In addition, from the point of view of tourist development and cross-Border trade it is vital that funds are made available to render those roads passable.</P>
      <P>The second problem is in relation to the cross-Border Operational Programme for Transport in which, when announced, it had been hoped that the Dublin to Derry and Dublin to Cavan, the N2 and N3 would have been included.  We were led to believe that massive amounts of money would be spent on the N3, the Dublin to Derry road, with by-passes of a number of towns in the county, such as Carrickmacross, Castleblayney and Monaghan. Yet it transpires that out of a total of £1,099 million Cavan-Monaghan will receive £14.5 million, or 1.3 per cent of the total allocation.  There are indications also of a further programme involving expenditure of £40 million but we will have very little hope of receiving much of that allocation if the same rule of thumb is applied as in the case of the original programme.</P>

    <P>The Minister and the Government <Col N="841" /> should urgently rethink this because I do not know how Ministers of any Government could justify funding for cross-Border development with an allocation of 1.3 per cent of the total.  Even more blatant was the fact that funding was provided for the east coast, for the Dublin to Belfast and Sligo to Ennis-killen corridor, the national primary route.  The national secondary route from Belfast is through Monaghan, Cavan and Galway to the west for which a sum of £275 million was provided under that programme, but not one penny was allocated to my constituency which has the worst roads structure east and west of Cavan town.</P>
    <P>This fact belittles all the talk of initiatives, of cross-Border additional funding and the supposed interest in ensuring, with our counterparts north of the Border, that we will be able to develop initiatives in agriculture, tourism, energy or any other sphere.  The only way we will be able to do so will be through an adequate roads structure. I appeal to the Minister to re-examine those two programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity afforded me by Deputy Leonard to address the House on this important issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Border roads merit priority because of their peripheral location in a national and European Union context and this was recognised in the EU INTERREG I Initiative which benefited certain non-national roads in Border areas.  A framework for a joint INTERREG II Programme for Northern Ireland-Ireland has been submitted to the European Commission.  The Commission is expected to give approval in principle to this programme shortly.  I am confident that substantial funding will be available under INTERREG II.  I will invite relevant local authorities to nominate projects for consideration for funding under this programme in the very near future. This programme will offer Border counties a good opportunity to improve deficiencies in their road network and <Col N="842" /> make this region more economically viable.</P>
    <P>The speedy reopening of cross-Border roads is an essential part of the peace process and I echo Deputy Leonard's sentiments in this regard.  I am glad that good progress can be reported in this regard.  By April 1995 it is expected that work will either be completed or under way on reopening the 113 public roads which were the subject of closure orders by the Northern Ireland authorities, with the exception of 14, 12 of which involve the building of large bridges, the funding for which is expected to come from the Northern Ireland authorities.</P>
    <P>The reopenings on this side of the Border were made possible by additional grants totalling £677,500 provided by the Department of the Environment to the Border counties last year. The total cost of reopening all cross Border roads &mdash; excluding the N3 which is the responsibility of the National Roads Authority &mdash; is now estimated to be approximately £1.78 million.  I am committed to making sufficient resources available to the Border counties this year to enable the reopening of cross-Border roads to be substantially completed in so far as this side of the Border is concerned.</P>
    <P>In the case of national roads, the sole cross-Border route which has been cut because of the Northern troubles is at Aghalane Bridge on the N3.  The broad outline of the works and financing for the reconstruction of the bridge have now been agreed between the two road authorities concerned.  Funding of the works on the Southern side is a matter for the National Roads Authority but preliminary design work is already in hand.  It is expected that construction will commence in 1996.</P>
    <P>The aim of the cross-Border dimension to the Operational Programme for Transport is to link with the Northern Ireland arterial road network to provide, over time, a coherent strategic road network for the island as a whole. Road investment over the period from now until 1999 will concentrate on <Col N="843" /> routes included in the trans-European road network which includes a number of cross-Border routes the A1-N1-N11 Larne - Belfast - Dublin - Rosslare, the N16-A4 Sligo-Belfast and the A5-N21-N1 Derry-Dublin roads.  There are regular liasion meetings between the two roads administrations to discuss matters of mutual concern and to advance all those issues.</P>
    <P>As regards non-national roads generally, responsibility for their maintenance and improvement is a matter for individual local authorities funded from their own resources, supplemented by annual State grants from my Department. I must point out this fact as many people are under the misapprehension that the Government exclusively is responsible for ensuring that non-national roads are maintained to the adequate standard.  Therefore, I would encourage local authorities to allocate more funding from their own resources to ensure that the very substantial level of State funding is matched by a realistic level of local authority expenditure.</P>
    <P>State funding for non-national roads is now financed generally by way of an annual discretionary grant to local authorities and grants under a European Union co-financed scheme for specific improvement road projects which promote employment and economic activity.  In particular, under the latter scheme, co-financed projects must have a significant and quantifiable economic impact, particularly as regards tourism, employment, agricultural and rural development.  Local authorities prepare and submit annually to my Department proposals in respect of improvement works on non-national roads which can be considered for funding under this scheme.  All proposals received from local authorities for funding in 1995 under the European Union scheme are currently being evaluated.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises the need for substantial State funding to supplement local authorities' own expenditure on the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads and will <Col N="844" /> provide support for the Border region consistent with overall budgetary strategy and demands for funds generally.  I am at present considering the position in relation to this year's road grants and I will notify local authorities of their allocations at an early date.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Tenant Purchase Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you a Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this issue.  It is common case among all Deputies that the vast majority of people on this island wish to own their homes.  That is borne out in the home ownership figures which are the highest in Europe, if not in the world.  That is why this Parliament has always been a great supporter of the tenant purchase scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tenant purchase schemes have allowed people in local authority housing to buy out their homes.  In recent times a number of schemes were introduced. A famous scheme introduced in 1988, commonly known as the &ldquo;sale of the century&rdquo;, was an extremely successful one.  While it may not have gone down well with local authorities, there was a huge take-up of the scheme.  The most recent scheme introduced some time ago has been unsuccessful.  That will be borne out by the experiences of most Deputies.  Just because there was a change of Government, and I am raising this matter here, does not mean I have not always been of this view.  My objections to the way in which this scheme was set up will be on the Minister's file. The figures will show that the take-up of the scheme generally and by people on low incomes is extremely small.  To my knowledge few, if any, social welfare recipients in my county are participating, would or are allowed to participate in this scheme.  Local authorities are very reluctant to allow such people to participate in this scheme.  People who applied under previous schemes were in a position to obtain finance through their local authorities but under this scheme applicants are advised to <Col N="845" /> approach a bank or a building society to secure the necessary finance in a lump sum rather than on an annuity basis as was the case heretofore.  That causes severe problems for those in receipt of social welfare benefit.</P>
    <P>A family in my constituency who are all in receipt of social welfare benefit raised this matter with me.  They have endeavoured through various channels to have the scheme changed.  The Minister of State, Deputy McManus, having been involved with the travelling community, will appreciate the concerns of the family in question as they are former travellers who have been living in a local authority house for the last 27 years and are paying a rent in the region of £30 to £35 per week.  They want to buy the house and have been offered it for £14,000, but they cannot secure the necessary finance from a bank or building society and their local authority cannot help them.  Such people should be targeted because the present position is unfair.  Surely it would be far better if people who pay £30 to £35 per week for a rented house and who have put money into improving their house over the years were facilitated in purchasing their houses.  However, they cannot call their house their own and will never be able to do so because the banks or the building societies will not lend them what, in effect, is a small amount of money to purchase their house.  This family is one of a number of families in this bind who, for one reason or another, did not take up the sale of the century perhaps because some of them were unable to read or write and were unsure of the financial implications.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is to make a name for herself, she should examine this scheme. I know it is an open ended scheme, but some effort could be made to change it. The excuse I was given when I raised the matter previously was that the scheme was only new and it should be given time to develop.  It is high time the scheme was changed to enable people, such as those I instanced, to avail of the tenant purchase scheme to buy their houses so that the income going into the <Col N="846" /> house would in effect be put into the bricks and mortar of the house rather than into the coffers of a local authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of the current tenant purchase scheme do not exclude social welfare recipients or, indeed, any other category of persons who wish to participate in the scheme and fulfil their aspirations to become home owners.</P>
      <P>The source and level of income of a potential purchaser under the scheme is relevant only in so far as it affects a purchaser's ability to meet the purchase price and the continuing cost of subsequently maintaining the dwelling. Unfortunately, some tenants in their present circumstances would not be able to purchase their dwellings and may have to wait some time to do so.</P>
      <P>The 1988 scheme was a once-off one, the terms of which made clear at the time that it would not be repeated.  The discounts under the 1993 scheme, therefore, reverted to levels which had been the norm under schemes prior to 1988. A significant change was, however, made in the way purchase was to be financed, in so far as purchasers were required to raise the purchase price by way of a mortgage loan.  This arrangement was introduced to ensure that finance accured up front from payment of the purchase price at point of sale as a contribution towards the cost of the construction of further local authority dwellings to meet the needs of persons on waiting lists.  This source of funds for further house building is given added emphasis by the expanded local authority housing and social housing programme of the new Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As in previous schemes, the administration of the 1993 tenant purchase scheme, in their area, is the responsibility of respective local authorities.  It is, therefore, important that they promote the scheme and its benefits and assist in making home ownership available to as many of their tenants as possible. Mortgage loans may be sought <Col N="847" /> from either the local authority or a commercial mortgage lender.  Any tenant who is not in a position to obtain a loan from a commercial lender may apply to the local authority.  It is a matter for the authority, in each case to decide if the applicant is capable of meeting the loan repayments.  Naturally, I am anxious that authorities make every effort to facilitate interested tenants.  As a general guideline, authorities were asked to seek to ensure that 50 per cent of their purchase transactions are financed from commercial sources but this was not to be a binding requirement.  Authorities should be prepared to make loans available to tenants interested in purchasing who seek a loan from the authority and who are capable of meeting the repayments. Adequate funding is available to local authorities through the Housing Finance Agency, at fixed and variable interest rates.</P>
    <P>I am aware there have been some concerns that tenants who are social welfare recipients are being excluded from the scheme.  This is not, nor should not, be the case as all tenants who meet the eligibility criteria, no matter what the source of their income, should have their applications considered by the local authority.  There will always be tenants who do not wish to purchase and also those who cannot afford to buy and subsequently maintain their homes, no matter what type of scheme is in operation.  However, dependence on welfare payments does not, in itself mean that a tenant is not allowed to purchase.  Returns received from local authorities show that frequently dwellings have been frequently bought by those on low incomes.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, the terms of the purchase scheme are now being reviewed by me with a view to making it more affordable for tenants to purchase their homes.  The outcome of this review will be announced as quickly as possible.  I can assure Deputy Ahern that I, too, recognise the urgency of the case and I share many of the concerns <Col N="848" /> he expressed tonight regarding the limitations of the existing scheme.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, I am anxious to ensure that all eligible tenants who wish to purchase, and who are in a financial position to do so, are facilitated by local authorities. Should the Deputy wish to give me the details of any individual application he considers is not being processed in accordance with the terms of the scheme, I will happily take the matter up with the relevant local authority.</P>

      <P>Hundreds of farming families in the midlands area are in a state of distress as a consequence of the flooding of the Shannon.  Tens of thousands of acres of farmland are under water with agricultural practice not possible.  This flooding is the worst in living memory and must not be seen as an annual rural whinge or as the farming community crying wolf.  Will my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, use his influence to speed up the proposed changes in the disadvantaged status of farmland in the midlands plain?  There is a dire need for such designation which has been in the pipeline for years but, as yet, remains unapproved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My constituency of Laoighis-Offaly, and the adjoining midlands region, due to its Leinster affiliation, is treated as if it were an affluent area, thus missing out on significant European Union grant aid.  County Offaly is often regarded as a fortunate county when compared with the traditional so-called poorer areas of <Col N="849" /> Connacht.  This comparison is more apparent than real and is without foundation as farm incomes in the midlands and County Offaly are on a par and sometimes lower than those west of the Shannon.  It is fundamentally unjust that farmers on the east bank of the River Shannon do not qualify for benefits which are available to their colleagues across the river.  How can one justify the fact that citizens on one side of a river can enjoy income supplements and those on the other lose out?  Are we being told by officialdom that the River Shannon floods on only one side?</P>
    <P>The reclassification of the now underwater farmland, which resembles a huge lake comprising the entire Shannon valley, would at least breathe a measure of life into an area drowning before our eyes.  The difference between handicapped and more severely handicapped status, in terms of benefits to individual farmers, is a matter of life or death in rural midland areas.  I have been in touch with the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister of State in charge of the Office of Public Works, Deputy Hogan, to ensure the setting up of an appropriate programme of works to address this matter.  I must stress the importance of having the midlands area, and the Shannon valley, reclassified as more severely handicapped as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I thank Deputy Flanagan for allowing me to share his time and wholeheartedly support the points he made about the need for urgent action in this regard.  A certain level of flooding in the Shannon valley is expected every year but this year's flooding is unprecedented.  There have been many calls to have the area reclassified but that call has never been as urgent as now and I hope the Minister can respond favourably.  The social and economic indicators of the midlands are as bad if not worse than many areas in the west and Deputy Flanagan's case deserves an urgent response from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many areas in counties Laois and <Col N="850" /> Offaly which were never flooded before experienced dreadful flooding in the past week.  There has been exceptional flooding in villages, towns and houses and the Government must help those affected.  In addition, there has been severe damage &mdash; including subsidence &mdash; to regional and county roads.  The European Commissioner Karel Van Miert, stated this evening that the European Commission would have to assist those affected by the dreadful flooding in Central Europe.  Will the Government make a case to Europe for emergency help for this country, in particular, the midlands?</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the county council, Civil Defence and fire and ambulance services who rendered assistance in recent days and appeal to the Minister for an emergency Government response to this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry also examine the serious flooding in the Galway area where the problem is very serious in six locations?  Houses have been evacuated and cut off from other areas, farmyards, sheds and slatted houses have been flooded; in some cases, entire farms are under water.  The fear gripping the community in the south Galway area is unreal.  Flood levels have reached their highest ever and continue to rise.  I have contacted the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Hogan, in this regard and he visited the area.  I hope a plan to deal with the serious flooding problem in south Galway will be put into operation this year.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputies' concerns at the hardship being suffered by farmers in those areas of the midlands and Galway which have been hit by the recent heavy rains.  Regarding the disadvantaged status of these areas, I can report that the Irish submissions on <Col N="851" /> extension and reclassification of disadvantaged areas are at present being examined by Commission officials.</P>
      <P>A number of detailed queries have been raised on the submissions which have been or are in the course of being answered.  Further bilateral meetings will be held as soon as possible, with a view to concluding an agreement on the areas to be included in the Community list of less-favoured areas, and on those areas which have been proposed for reclassification to more severely handicapped status.  I am conscious of the need to bring these negotiations to a speedy and successful conclusion.  I will use all the influence I have to ensure that this aim is achieved.</P>
      <P>Because the submissions are under examination at present, I cannot comment on the inclusion or otherwise of specific areas.</P>
      <P>At present all counties west of the Shannon are designated as less-favoured areas, with all but a small area of south-east Galway and South Clare being classified as more severely handicapped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To the east of the Shannon, all areas <Col N="852" /> which are near to the Shannon are classified as disadvantaged.  In addition, a continuous strip, extending from Athlone in County Westmeath southwards to below Banagher in County Offaly was classified as more severely handicapped during the fourth review of disadvantaged areas in 1991.  It was recognised at the time that, in addition, to these areas satisfying the criteria for reclassification, the periodic flooding was an additional justification for more severely handicapped status.  Further areas on the southern shores of Lough Derg, in County Tipperary, are also more severely handicapped.</P>
    <P>I will take up with the Government Deputy Gallagher's appeal for EU funding for flood damage that should be pursued.  I assure Deputies Flanagan and McCormack that the Government is concerned about flooding in all parts of the country and the hardship it causes for many rural dwellers, including farmers. If it continues, the Government will review the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 25, 26, 41, 81 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>The policy document <i>A Government of Renewal</i> makes clear that the Government is committed to the holding of a referendum on divorce in this year.</P>
      <P>A Cabinet sub-committee chaired by me has been established to make recommendations to the Government on proposals in relation to the referendum. The sub-committee has begun work on the matter and will be reporting to the Government as quickly as possible.  The details of the Government's decision on the constitutional referendum proposal will be made known in due course by way of publication of the Bill to amend the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definitive proposals of the Government for an amendment of the Constitution on divorce must, of course, be in the form of a Bill since a precondition of the holding of any referendum is the initiation of a Bill in the House. The date of publication of that Bill will be determined largely by the date on which the Government proposes to hold the referendum.  The timing of the referendum will take account, as may be necessary, of the case that is under <Col N="594" /> appeal to the Supreme Court concerning provisions in the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.</P>
    <P>The cost of holding the referendum is provided for from the Central Fund which is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Provision of £500,000 is made in my Department's Estimates for a Government information programme in the run-up to the divorce referendum.  That figure is contained in the 1995 Book of Estimates.  The heads of expenditure will be on similar lines to those in recent referenda which provided for press and billboard advertisement and information booklets and leaflets.</P>
    <P>A considerable framework of laws in relation to marital breakdown already exists by way of the Judical Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, and other pieces of legislation concerning maintenance and protection of spouses and children and protection of the family home.  The White Paper on Marital Breakdown &mdash; 1992 &mdash; gives an overview of those laws and of administrative procedures such as legal aid, mediation and counselling.  Since publication of that paper major advances have been made on implementation of measures to better protect and support families. Many of those measures are the responsibility of my Department.  The current matters give a good idea of how much progress is being made.  In that context I should like to mention the following. The Family Law Bill, 1994 is before the House at Report Stage.  It has measures aimed at protecting and safeguarding the institution of marriage.  It raises the age of marriage from 16 years to 18 years and provides for notice of marriage.  It provides substantial powers to the courts to deal with the financial consequences of marital breakdown in cases where a foreign decree of divorce is entitled to recognition in the State.  In substance, those powers will be the same as the powers in any legislation on domestic divorce.  They include wide powers in relation to maintenance, inheritance, and property generally, including the family home and pensions. <Col N="595" /> The Bill repeals and re-enacts with amendments provisons in the Judicial Separation Act, 1989.  The amendments include new provisions giving the courts powers in separation proceedings to make orders in relation to pensions.</P>
    <P>Provisions dealing comprehensively with tax aspects of marital breakdown &mdash; capital gains, capital acquisition and probate tax and stamp duty &mdash; have been drafted and have been tabled for incorporation into the Family Law Bill, 1994, by way of amendments at Report Stage.  They will be model provisions for any divorce legislation.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare is preparing heads of legislation to ensure that no spouse will be disadvantaged in terms of his or her social welfare entitlements as a result of his or her legal status being changed from married, separated or deserted to divorced.  Those provisions are required as a follow-on of provisions in the Family Law Bill, 1994, and, again, would be model provisions in the case of provision in our law for domestic divorce.</P>
    <P>The Maintenance Act, 1994, was enacted by me in November, 1994 and enables ratification of EU and UN Conventions which will make it easier to recover maintenance from a person living abroad.  Arrangements are now being made by the Department of Foreign Affairs to have the conventions ratified.</P>
    <P>The Domestic Violence Bill is at present at an advanced stage of drafting and will be published as soon as possible. It will strengthen the powers of the courts to make orders for protection of persons and will strengthen the powers of arrest of the Garda in such cases.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the Bill to put the scheme of civil legal aid and advice on a statutory footing will be published in the next few days.</P>
    <P>A sum of £6.2 million has been provided in this year's Book of Estimates for the Legal Aid Board.  The unprecedented increase in funding which I secured in 1994 allowed the board to provide a total of 10 new full-time and 4 <Col N="596" /> part-time law centres.  The 1995 funding will also allow the opening of additional new centres.</P>
    <P>A special provision of £750,000, an increase of 150 per cent on the previous years funding, was provided in 1994 for the assistance of bodies involved in marriage guidance and counselling to enable them to expand their services and a sum of £750,000 is also provided in this year's Estimates.</P>
    <P>Development plans for the family mediation service were also put in place in 1994 with significantly increased funding of £300,000.  That figure is proposed to be maintained in 1995 to allow for further developments.</P>
    <P>All avenues of approach to the problem of marriage breakdown are under active consideration by the Government. The policy is to address the problem as comprehensively as possible so as to meet all needs.  In that context the policy considerations are not confined to questions of reform of the law but extend also to the areas such as tax and social welfare codes, our education programmes and voluntary services.  Submissions continue to be made to me from persons and groups in support of changes to tackle the various issues involved in marriage breakdown and these are being taken into account in the formulation of policy within my Department.</P>
    <P>During the previous Government I consulted with the Leaders of the Progressive Democrats, the Green Party and the Fianna Fáil Party including its present Leader.  However, I would be happy to consult with the Leader of every party who wishes to meet me.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30, 40 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has responsibility for, among other matters, the Family Mediation Service and Exchequer funding of marriage guidance and counselling services, in addition to legal aid and reform of family law.  In each of these areas I am engaged in implementing a comprehensive programme of legislation and administrative measures of protection and support for couples who, for one reason or another, are in difficulty with their marriage.</P>
      <P>In the context of marriage breakdown I am very aware that immediate resort to the law could affect the prospect of reconciliation or of voluntary settlement. Therefore, where there is a possibility of a reconciliation people should be encouraged and facilitated to avail of counselling.  It is equally important that where parties can settle the terms of their separation they should be facilitated to do so by way of mediation.  The importance of this was recognised in the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, section 5 of which requires a solicitor acting for and applicant for a decree of separation to ensure the applicant's awareness of alternatives to separation proceedings and to assist attempts at reconciliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £300,000 was provided for the Family Mediation Service in 1994, which was more than double the 1993 <Col N="598" /> allocation of £124,000.  That increase has allowed for arrangements at present being put in place for the opening of a second centre to be located in Limerick, the direct employment of full-time mediators and, in order to enable the service to be provided on a wide geographical basis, the employment of private mediators on a contract basis.  A similar figure £300,000 has been provided in this year's Estimates to enable further expansion of the service.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1994 grants to marriage guidance and counselling organisations were paid on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and there was neither a formal procedure for evaluating the requirements of the various organisations concerned nor was there any central departmental responsibility for the funding of those organisations. There had been little increase over the years in the amounts provided to the various organisations.  In 1994, when I took over responsibility for marriage counselling, I was successful in obtaining £750,000 for voluntary organisations involved in marriage guidance and counselling &mdash; an increase of guidance per cent over previous allocations.  A particular aim of the increased funding was to enable these voluntary organisations to expand and develop their services.</P>
    <P>Last year, a total of 54 marriage counselling organisations were grant-aided.  I am also happy to be able to say that a further £750,000 has been provided in my departmental Estimates for funding of these voluntary organisations this year.</P>
    <P>Marriage Counselling Services Limited was one of the 54 organisations to receive funding last year.  In 1994 that organisation received a grant of £67,000, which represented an increase of some £30,000 on State funding provided to them in 1993.</P>
    <P>In the course of the next few weeks the 1995 grant application forms will be issued by my Department to the organisations concerned with delivery of marriage guidance and counselling.  The 1995 allocation of grants will be determined as quickly as possible following <Col N="599" /> receipt of the completed application forms.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Task Force on the Travelling Community has been making substantial progress to date in its deliberations.  It submitted an Interim Report to me on the 14 January 1994, which I am studying at present.  The Minister for Education and the Minister for the Environment have implemented some recommendations in relation to education and housing, respectively.  The expectation is that it will furnish its final report to me by late spring or early summer of this year.</P>
      <P>Following the resignation of Deputy Liz McManus, as chairperson of the task force on her appointment as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, I appointed Senator Mary Kelly as chairperson with effect from 9 January 1995.  Senator Kelly has been a member of the task force since its establishment in July 1993.  I would like to thank Minister of State McManus for her work as chairperson and to wish Senator Kelly well in her new appointment.</P>
      <P>I am quite satisfied with the progress made to date by the task force in carrying out its work.

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child was ratified by Ireland on 28 September 1992, and entered into force for the State on 28 October 1992.  The Convention codifies and develope international norms applicable to children, and reflects a broad consensus on the obligations of families, society and the international community towards children. The Convention was ratified on the basis that there were no changes in domestic law necessary to permit Ireland to ratify it.</P>
      <P>The Convention was signed, subject to ratification, by Ireland in 1990.  Prior to ratification the then Government undertook an examination of legislative and other steps necessary to enable Ireland to become a party to the Convention. That examination involved a number of Departments and it concerned mainly the Departments of Justice, Health, Social Welfare and Education. Two main items in the civil law area, for which my Department now has responsibility, were identified by the Department of Justice as requiring initiatives to facilitate certain objectives of the Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Article 11 of the Convention requires States to take measures to combat the illicit transfer and non-return of children abroad and to that end to promote the conclusion of bi-lateral and multilateral agreements or accession to existing agreements.  Ireland was in a position to fully comply with that Article when legislation which was promoted in 1991 &mdash; the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Custody Orders Act &mdash; enabled the State to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Recognition <Col N="601" /> and Enforcement of Decisions concerning Custody of Children and on the Restoration of Custody of Children, and the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. Those Conventions came into force for Ireland on 1 October 1991.</P>
    <P>Article 27, paragraph 4 of the Convention requires States to take all appropriate measures to secure the recovery of maintenance for the child from persons having financial responsibility for the child both within the State and from abroad.  It also requires States to promote the accession to, and the conclusion of, international agreements for the recovery of maintenance where the person having financial responsibility is in a state different from that of the child.  A range of measures have existed for some time to enable the State to comply with this Article of the Convention.  However, I am glad to say that our position has been strengthened somewhat by the Maintenance Act, 1994, which I promoted last year and which enables the State to ratify European Union and New York Conventions which are aimed at assisting persons to recover maintenance from persons abroad.  The Department of Foreign Affairs is now making arrangements to have those two Conventions ratified.</P>
    <P>The Family Law Bill, 1994, which is before the House on Report Stage, also has provisions which help to accord with the principles and spirit of the Convention. The relevant provisions in that Bill are those in relation to a new age of marriage of 18 years, notice of marriage and the strengthening of the courts' powers to order maintenance in support of children.</P>
    <P>It is up to each state to adopt whatever measures it considers necessary or advisable to implement the Convention. In that context our position in relation to the Convention can, of course, be strengthened even further.</P>
    <P>My Department is engaged in a wide programme of reform of family law and administrative measures and when that programme is completed it will have the effect of extending the measures which <Col N="602" /> help Ireland to comply with the objectives of the Convention.</P>

      <P>On publication of this report I immediately brought it to the attention of Government.  Since then Departments, along with other interests to which the recommendations were addressed, have been availing of the report of the Working Party on Childcare for Working Parents as a reference base for childcare measures.</P>
      <P>The report promotes the partnership in childcare concept and encourages co-operation between employers in the public and private sector and parent and community interests to increase the supply of quality childcare.</P>
      <P>Last year my Department set up a scheme of local childcare projects administered through local partnership structures.  I am pleased to say that FÁS has indicated its intention to co-operate in such schemes, and to assist in developing childcare enterprises and community-based childcare facilities through childcare actions under the Community Employment and Community Training schemes.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, under the human resource operation programme of the National Development Plan which will be launched shortly, the need to develop childcare facilities to support women's access to training and employment schemes is acknowledged, and childcare initiatives to be undertaken by FÁS and the Department of Education will be developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the regulatory aspects of the Childcare Act will be introduced <Col N="603" /> next year.  No one can doubt the importance of this commitment given the wide childcare policy concerns which continue to arise in our society and which this Government is determined to address fully.</P>
    <P>The progress being made on these measures represents an initial response to the working groups recommendations.</P>
    <P>Based on these initial efforts and the drawing on the report of the working group I shall strive to maintain the current momentum of advance of childcare provision.  The necessity for a childcare authority will be examined in due course.</P>

      <P>The Supreme Court decision that the Matrimonial Home Bill, 1993 was repugnant to the Constitution represented a set back to the idea that joint ownership of the matrimonial home should be automatic within marriage.  However, it has always been my view that the law should promote joint ownership of the family home to the greatest extent allowable within the parameters of that judgment. Among the options I am considering is one for legislation which would facilitate simplified arrangements for voluntary conveyances of family homes into joint ownership.  The aim of such legislation would be to enable couples to give full and effective recognition to the contribution made by the spouse who works in the home, without having to undergo needless expense or formality.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Law Reform Commission published a report on the Civil Law of Defamation which embodies a large number of recommendations for change in this area under fifty-nine separate headings.  In addition, the National Newspapers of Ireland have made proposals for change which, despite some points of difference, are substantially in accordance with the Law Reform Commission's recommendations.</P>
      <P>This area of the law is a complex one. It involves striking a balance between the competing interests of freedom of expression, on the one hand, and the citizen's right to his or her good name, on the other.  It draws upon influences derived from the common law, from statute (the Defamation Act of 1961) and from the fundamental rights enshrined in our Constitution.  In summary, therefore, any reform of the civil law of defamation will not be an easy task.  Nor is it one which can be accomplished very quickly.</P>
      <P>My Department is already deeply committed to a legislative programme which involves fundamental reform in the broad areas of family law and equality law.  These are priority areas for me and, until such time as the necessary progress has been made in these areas, a radical reform in existing defamation legislation is unlikely.  I shall, however, be keeping the matter under continuing review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to add that the Bill is the subject of a preliminary examination at present by the Attorney General's Office following a reference of the Bill to that Office by the Taoiseach last year, <Col N="605" /> and that that examination when completed will be taken into account in due course when the matter comes before the Government for consideration.</P>

      <P>The strategy of the Government in relation to child care in general is set out in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> under which the Government is committed to dealing with a range of matters affecting children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to the rapid implementation of the provisions <Col N="606" /> of the Child Care Act having regard to the resources, training and staff that will be required.  A Cabinet sub-committee to co-ordinate the provision of services for the care, protection and nurturing of children is to be established.  Already a Minister of State to specifically co-ordinate key areas has been appointed with special responsibility for all aspects relating to child care and childrens policy, particularly the implementation of the Child Care Act; with special responsibility for special education; and with special responsibility for the proposed Children Bill aimed at updating the law dealing with young offenders.</P>
    <P>Other areas of the law affecting the welfare of children, including adoption, guardianship and child sexual abuse are also to be assessed under the Government's programme with a view to being updated.  There are no proposals at present to establish a Commission as suggested by the Deputy but it is a matter which can be considered further in the context of the active review of policy on children which is being undertaken by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the position regarding children under our laws as they stand is of special importance and that constitutional and statutory provisions and administrative policies reflect that.  My Department's responsibilities concern the civil law aspects as distinct, say, from the criminal law aspects which are the responsibility of the Department of Justice and the child care and health aspects which are the responsibility of the Department of Health.  As regards civil law aspects I should like to mention, for example, the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964 which provides the very important principle that any court in deciding questions relating to children shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.  The civil law in relation to children has been updated and developed on a systematic basis in recent years and we have a body of law that is comparable with the best in other countries.  Important provisions in relation to children have been provided <Col N="607" /> for in the Family Law (Maintenance of Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981, the Status of Children Act, 1987, the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989 and the Child Abduction and Enforcement of Court Orders Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>In 1994 I initiated the Maintenance Act which enables the State to ratify a European Union and a United Nations Convention to assist the persons in the recovery of maintenance abroad.</P>
    <P>The Family Law Bill 1994, which I also initiated and is at Report Stage before the House, has important provisions in relation to maintenance of children, it raises the age of marriage from 16 to 18 years and where family law proceedings in the courts are concerned it puts the reporting role of the health boards and welfare officers on a statutory footing.  A Bill is also being prepared in my Department to strengthen the law on domestic violence.</P>
    <P>The extensive provisions which already exist in our laws in relation to children are, as I have said, being reviewed and they will be updated as necessary under the Government's programme of renewal.</P>

The deed of transfer of the land was executed and the purchase price was paid by the Commissioners in 1986, but a succession of queries of a technical legal nature which have been raised by the Land Registry have delayed the registration in the Land Registry of the change of ownership of the lands, which involves certain supplementary provisions concerning rights of way.  The latest of these queries, which concerns a problem arising from rights of way, was raised by the Land Registry in September 1990.  This necessitated the obtaining by the Chief State Solicitors's Office of further instructions from the Commissioners of Public Works, and consideration of the question whether the execution of a further deed by the vendor would be required.  As a result of further correspondence in 1994 and this year, it is considered that it should now be possible to satisfy the Land Registry and complete the registration, in the near future.</P>

      <P>This Government have a strong commitment to maintaining and developing viable community structures throughout the west, including on our off-shore islands.  The appointment of Mr. Donal Carey TD as Minister for Western Development and Rural Renewal, with special responsibility for the development and improvement of living conditions on our off-shore islands, is a clear expression of this commitment.</P>
      <P>As far as Achill is concerned, the Western Development Partnership Board, which was established as a consequence of the &ldquo;Developing the West&rdquo; initiative led by the Catholic bishops of the region, has been given the task of producing an action plan which will ensure population stability in the region by the end of the decade at 1991 census levels.  This unique focus on maintaining the population of the region will complement and reinforce the work of current local development structures and ensure that the particular problems of the western region are given priority.</P>
      <P>Minister of State Carey will also have responsibility for overseeing the implementation of a pilot programme for a more integrated approach to the delivery of public services in remote rural areas.  The pilot programme will develop new systems of delivery which will help maintain the viability of isolated communities. While individual Ministers remain responsible for services delivered by their Departments and agencies, the focus for the needs of remote rural areas, especially the islands, provided by Minister Carey's appointment will facilitate a coherent response to the needs of these communities.</P>

      <P>The Government are committed to working to ensure that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty emerges from the forthcoming Review and Extension Conference further strengthened, with increased membership and support, so that its role in combating the threat of nuclear proliferation will be further enhanced.  This objective reflects the keen interest of successive Governments, in the promotion of nuclear non-proliferation, since the original Irish initiative at the UN which led to the conclusion of the NPT.</P>
      <P>To this end, Ireland has been working actively, together with EU partners and like-minded countries, in the preparatory meetings for the Review and Extension Conference which will take place in New York next April.  I will be attending this conference.</P>
      <P>A major issue under discussion has been that of the length of time for which the Treaty should be extended.  We are opposed to a short extension because we believe that this would undermine the credibility of the Treaty, weaken its effectiveness and lead to a situation where a number of states would be tempted to pursue policies, in anticipation of the ending of the Treaty, that could lead to the proliferation of nuclear weapons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the 1990 Review Conference, Ireland stated its belief that the Treaty should be extended indefinitely in 1995. The European Union, which did not have a common position at the 1990 conference because of France's non-adherence to the Treaty, subsequently adopted the same position.  It was also adopted by all 52 member states of the <Col N="614" /> Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe at the Budapest Summit last December.  It is the position of many other non-nuclear weapon states.</P>
    <P>We see the strengthening of the NPT as crucial for ongoing efforts to achieve nuclear disarmament.  Under the provisions of Article VI of the Treaty, the nuclear weapon states commit themselves to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures to end the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament.  Some progress is now being made in this direction.  We would be extremely concerned if this were to be jeopardised as a result of a failure to reach agreement at the Review and Extension Conference.  We also believe that it is not only entirely legitimate but also desirable that the non-nuclear weapon states should continue to press the nuclear weapon states, pursuant to Article VI, to offer adequate security assurances to non-nuclear weapon states in return for having foregone the nuclear weapons option, and to pursue negotiations on the reduction of nuclear weapons, with a view to their ultimate elimination.</P>
    <P>Indefinite extension will also permit the continued implementation of the provision in Article VIII of the Treaty for the holding of review conferences at five-yearly intervals, with the object of reviewing the operation of the Treaty. This objective is in accordance with the Government's commitment, in the programme for <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, to seek such reviews.</P>
    <P>Agreement on a comprehensive test ban Treaty is another step which would strengthen the non-proliferation regime. We continue to urge the conclusion of such a Treaty at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>With regard to plutonium, the Government are concerned at the level of production of weapons-grade nuclear material, including plutonium.  The abundance of nuclear material is another factor increasing nuclear proliferation risks.  In line with their commitment in the Programme for a <Col N="615" /> Government of Renewal, the Government strongly support the banning of the production of all fissile materials for nuclear weapons.  We hope that negotiations for a &ldquo;cut-off&rdquo; agreement, which would lead to the ending of the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons, can commence in the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva shortly.  Such an agreement would represent a significant contribution to the future strengthening of the non-proliferation regime.</P>

      <P>Ireland has on several occasions, in the course of its own bilateral contacts with Australia, raised the issue of East Timor; the subject has not been taken up with Australia by the EU.  During his visit to Australia in September of last year, the then Taoiseach discussed the issue with Australian Prime Minister Keating.</P>
      <P>In addition, officials of my Department have outlined to the Australian Ambassador Ireland's concerns at the situation in East Timor and asked the Australian Government to use its influence with Indonesia to achieve an improvement in that country's record in East Timor.</P>

      <P>First-time applications for passports and those in respect of minors must be accompanied by the long form birth certificates; however, in the case of applications for renewal (other than minors) a previous passport is accepted instead of a birth certificate.  This means that, in practice, birth certificates are required in only about 50 per cent of applications.</P>
      <P>The requirement that applicants produce the long form of their birth certificate is important in helping to reduce the risk of fraud.  The short form of the birth certificate states the district where the birth was registered but does not list the place of birth nor the date of registration, neither does it list the parents' names nor the father's occupation. These details &mdash; which are supplied on the long birth certificate &mdash; can be important in dealing with certain applications, especially those by or on behalf of children, and experience shows that they can be crucial in detecting attempts at fraud.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, the father and mother of a child are its joint guardians, subject to any qualifying court order as provided for in this Act.  To safeguard the rights of parents as laid down in the Act, the Passport Office requires that the written <Col N="617" /> witnessed consent of both parents be obtained when an application is being made by or on behalf of a child.  The long form of the birth certificate provides evidence that those giving consent are in fact the child's parents.</P>
    <P>In the case of an adopted child, the Passport Office requires not only the written witnessed consent of the child's guardians but also proof of the child's Irish citizenship.  Under the terms of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, a child who is not already an Irish citizen becomes one upon an adoption order being made under Irish adoption law, provided that at least one of the adoptive parents is an Irish citizen.  The long form of the birth certificate issued in such cases indicates not only the names of the adoptive parents &mdash; which enables the validity of the consents to be checked &mdash; but also the country of birth of the child.  If it transpires that the child was not born in Ireland, the parents are required to prove that at least one of them is an Irish citizen.  The short form of the birth certificate would clearly not be sufficient in these cases.</P>
    <P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956, provides that Irish citizenship shall not be conferred on children born in Ireland to persons who, at the time of the children's births, are entitled to diplomatic immunity in Ireland.  It is therefore important for the Passport Office to establish the occupations of parents.  That is best done by seeing the long forms of birth certificates.</P>
    <P>The Passport Office is anxious not to put applicants to any unnecessary inconvenience; however, passports are important and valuable documents and the application procedures must reflect this.  In particular, passport applications by and on behalf of children must continue to be processed very carefully because of the number of sensitive issues relating to parents' rights to which they can give rise.  I would therefore not envisage a change in the existing requirements as suggested by the Deputy; however, the situation will be kept under review and I have asked the <Col N="618" /> Passport Office to monitor any problems for applicants arising from present procedures.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that on average it can take three to four weeks from the date <Col N="619" /> of application to the date of issue of a C2 certificate.  It should be noted of course that while some applicants may receive their C2 certificates in less than three weeks, others may take longer than the average three to four weeks period, depending on how well the application is completed and presented.</P>
      <P>There are two main reasons for delay. First, applicants are required to satisfy specific legislative provisions designed to minimise tax evasion and fraud.  Each application must be thoroughly examined in order to ensure that all statutory requirements are fully satisfied.  Some of the provisions require to be supported by documentation which must accompany the initial application.  The main cause of delay is failure by applicants to supply the required supporting documentation with their initial applications. The second delay factor arises from the processing method necessary to produce the modern C2 &ldquo;Photocard&rdquo;. The new format introduced in 1993 is designed to prevent fraudulent use and processing it can take five to six working days.</P>

      <P>The proposals in <i>Tackling Poverty, Unemployment and Exclusion</i> submitted to me by the Conference of Religious of Ireland with recommendations for the 1995 budget suggest a partial basic income for all financed by means of a 50 per cent tax rate on all income.  This means the abolition of all <Col N="620" /> tax allowances and reliefs.  The proposal is based on a paper by Mr. Seán Ward, <i>Towards an adequate income for all,</i> published in 1994.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have analysed the original proposal in Mr. Ward's paper and have found that the tax rate on all income which would be needed to finance the basic income as described would be between 55 and 59 per cent.  The lower figure would apply if the savings outlined on the administration and public expenditure trades offs were realised, the higher one if they were not.</P>

This certificate was not put into effect by the school as the taxpayer was employed by the Department of Education and not the school.</P>
      <P>This information did not reach the tax Inspector until December and was the main reason for the delay.  A new tax-free allowance certificate was issued subsequently on 20 January, 1995.  It will be in operation for the payment due on 5 March, 1995.</P>

      <P>It is understood that the Deputy is referring to the review of the C45 system for sub-contractors promised in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> In view of the concerns which had been raised in relation to the C45 system, the Black Economy Monitoring Group was asked under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> to carry out a thorough review of the operation of the C45 system and to make recommendations on action to curb any abuse and to improve the system generally.</P>
      <P>The group which is made up from representatives of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Department of Social Welfare and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners provides a forum for an open and frank exchange of views on black economy issues.  The group submitted its report last July to the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> which endorsed its recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of the group's recommendations concerned closer monitoring of the system by the Revenue Commissioners, improved information flow between the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare and the redesign of forms to ensure that sufficent information is available to match income tax and social welfare records.  The implementation of these recommendations has commenced and all administrative recommendations will be implemented by the start of the tax year i.e. 6 April, 1995.  Two of the recommendations require statutory changes to carry them into effect.  These relate to the introduction of a form that both parties should sign verifying that the C45 system is the most appropriate system and to the withdrawal of the special recognition given to the gang or group system within the C45 regime. These recommendations are under <Col N="622" /> examination within my Department and will be considered by me in good time for this year's Finance Act.</P>

      <P>Double taxation treaties are primarily entered into to facilitate commercial and other relations between Ireland and other countries.  Such treaties eliminate, where possible, incidences of double taxation.</P>
      <P>Major changes were introduced in the Irish taxation system in the 1970s with the introduction of capital gains tax and corporation tax.  Older double taxation treaties entered into by Ireland prior to 1976 did not adequately reflect the new tax regime and it has been necessary over time, and as staff resources permit, to update these treaties.  Current policy with regard to the negotiation of double taxation treaties is to extend our network of treaties and to update older treaties.</P>
      <P>The negotiations listed below, therefore, took place either to broaden Ireland's network of double taxation treaties or to update existing treaties to take account of changes in our taxation rules or those of our partner countries since the original treaties were signed.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Austria:</i> Discussions have taken place at official level between the Revenue Commissioners and Austrian officials on a Protocol to amend the existing treaty between the two countries. Further discussions on this Protocol will probably be necessary before it can be presented to Government for approval.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Finland:</i> A new treaty with Finland entered into force in December 1993. No further negotiations have taken place in the interim.</P>
      <P>
        <i>France:</i> Negotiations on a replacement treaty have taken place at official level.  Further negotiations will be necessary before the text of the new treaty is finalised.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Greece:</i> Negotiations on a treaty have reached an advanced stage.  It is hoped that this treaty will be signed during the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <i>Italy:</i> Negotiations on a replacement <Col N="624" /> treaty have taken place at official level and are also at an advanced stage.  It is hoped that this treaty will be signed during the coming year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>United Kingdom:</i> The 1976 treaty with the United Kingdom was the first treaty signed by Ireland following the introduction of the tax changes of the 1970s.  In this respect it is a relatively modern treaty and comprehensively caters for the tax regimes of both countries. A Protocol amending this treaty was signed in November 1994 so as to make a minor adjustment to the provisions. This Protocol provides for the addition to the treaty of a new article which provides for the recognition by each State, in certain circumstances, of occupational pension schemes of the other State where such schemes have members in both countries.  The addition of this provision was necessary to take account of changes in UK pensions tax law since the signature of the treaty.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the flooding which took place in the Mulclair catchment area and particularly in the vicinity of Cappamore, County Limerick, towards the end of December 1994, when one person was close to death by drowning before she was rescued and substantial damage was done to houses and other property in that area; the steps, if any, he proposes to take to prevent a recurrence of such flooding which has now occurred on a number of occasions; and if he will immediately put into operation a major flood relief scheme which would clear the many obstructions in the main channel of the Mulcair and its principal tributaries.</Quest>

      <P>I am aware of the recent flooding which occurred in the Mulcair catchment area and I recently visited a number of locations, including Cappamore, where I met local public representatives and others to discuss the problem.</P>
      <P>The position regarding this river is that over the past few years the Commissioners of Public Works have been engaged in the survey, design and economic evaluation of various drainage options for the catchment.  All prospective costs and benefits have been included in the various analyses undertaken but it has not yet proved possible to devise an economically acceptable scheme.</P>
      <P>In their efforts over the years the commissioners have maintained close liaison with the Muclair drainage society to ensure that all relevant factors are accounted for and are in fact currently awaiting information from the society in relation to the possibility that benefits could arise from a successful scheme because of lower production costs rather than as a result of increased production.</P>
      <P>On a more positive note proposals by the Commissioners to amend the provisions of existing drainage legislation, to enable them to deal with localised flooding problems in particular urban flooding such as that referred to here, are under consideration in the Department of Finance.</P>

      <P>The inspection of premises engaged in the sale of food for public consumption is carried out by environmental health officers from the health boards under the Food Hygiene Regulations 1950-89.</P>
      <P>The food hygiene regulations set out the statutory requirements in relation to food hygiene and food premises.  They prohibit the sale for human consumption of food which is diseased, contaminated or otherwise unfit for human consumption. The regulations require that adequate precautions shall be taken to prevent the contamination of food intended for human consumption at all stages of its importation, manufacture and distribution.  These include the maintenance of hygienic conditions in food premises and observance of certain hygienic precautions by food handlers. The regulations also provide for the seizure and destruction of unfit food. They also provide for the registration of certain categories of food premises and food stalls.  In certain circumstances, the chief executive officer of a health board may apply to the district court for an order to close a food premises or stall.</P>
      <P>Following consultation with the various interests involved, I will be introducing new food hygiene regulations later this year which will give national effect to the European Council Directive 93/43/EEC on the Hygiene of Foodstuffs.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>My immediate priority in the area of adoption is to address the issues raised in the judgement of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Keegan <i>v.</i> Ireland.  This involves the introduction of amending legislation to give fathers of children born outside marriage a greater say in the adoption process.</P>
      <P>When this urgent task has been completed, attention will then turn to the implementation of the two specific commitments relating to adoption that are contained in the health strategy.  This will necessitate the preparation of further legislation to provide arrangements to facilitate contact between adopted persons and their birth parents, and to enable the Hague Convention on Inter-country Adoption to be ratified here.</P>
      <P>In relation to birth mothers wishing to re-establish contact with children whom they gave up for adoption, I am not aware that they are currently treated any differently from adopted persons seeking to contact their birth parents.  My understanding of the position is that an adoption agency will arrange contact between parties to an adoption where both parties desire it.  I do appreciate, however, that there may be variations in practice among the different agencies involved in post-adoption tracing work and it would be my intention, when putting in place formal arrangements, to devise a standardised procedure which is equitable and has due regard to the rights of the respective parties.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The accident and emergency department of Beaumont Hospital provides a 24-hour service.</P>
      <P>Because of the nature of the work, it is not possible to predict the workload of hospital Accident and Emergency Departments at any particular time.  At all times, however, priority is accorded to those patients most in need of immediate medical attention.  Because of the unpredictable nature of the workload which may present, it can happen that on occassion patients must be placed in temporary accommodation pending the availability of more appropriate beds.  I can assure the Deputy that every effort is made to keep this practice to a minimum.</P>
      <P>All patients, whilst in the Accident and Emergency Department, are under the care of medical and nursing staff. Every endeavour is made to make patients as comfortable as possible and this includes the provision of food to patients while they are awaiting a hospital bed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="635" /> The position regarding the accident and emergency departments is monitored by my Department on an ongoing basis.  In this regard, shortly after coming into office I approved a sum of £850,000 as an immediate response to recent problems experienced by the Dublin Accident and Emergency hospitals.  Difficulties which have arisen in recent weeks have not been caused by a shortage of acute hospital beds but are due to insufficient step-down facilities for patients who are no longer in need of acute hospital care.</P>
    <P>In relation to Beaumont Hospital, there have been a number of occasions in recent months when, owing to the Accident and Emergency Department being particularly busy, some patients have been accommodated on trolleys for a period until a bed has become available.  To counteract this, elective admissions have, from time to time, been cancelled and an action plan has been put in place in Beaumont Hospital to ensure that beds are made available at the earliest opportunity for patients being admitted through accident and emergency.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy of my continuing concern that the accident and emergency hospitals in Dublin are unabled to respond effectively to the demands placed upon them and that I will continue to monitor the situation with a view to taking further action if required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Open heart surgery operations for adults, including coronary artery by-pass grafts &mdash; CABGs &mdash; are currently performed for public patients at the National Cardiac Surgery Unit in the Mater Hospital, Dublin and at Cork Regional Hospital.</P>
      <P>The number of CABGs performed in the Mater Hospital and Cork Regional Hospital in 1994 was 797 and 153 respectively, giving a total of 950.  I should point out that, in addition to coronary artery by-pass graft procedures, the two hospitals also perform other open heart procedures.</P>
      <P>The number of patients currently on the waiting list for all open heart surgery in these two hospitals is 1,710.  The scheduling of surgery is a matter for the clinical judgement of the consultant concerned, is based solely on the patients condition and not on the length of time on the waiting list.  Emergency cases are given priority.</P>
      <P>In 1993, a sum of £1 million from the waiting list fund was allocated to enable the necessary facilities to be put in place at the National Cardiac Surgery Unit, Mater Hospital to increase the annual throughput of open heart surgery at the hospital from 750 to 1,000 &mdash; an increase of 33 per cent.  In addition, in 1993 and 1994, capital funding of £2.8 million was provided to facilitate the doubling of cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital from 200 to 400 patients each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over 1993 and 1994, in excess of £2 million revenue and £3.5 million in capital was allocated to the Mater Hospital for cardiac surgery and related developments. The building works which <Col N="642" /> were associated with this development were completed in mid-1994, include additional cardiac maintenance beds, intensive care facilities and high dependency facilities which are required to support the cardiac surgery programme. These new facilities at the hospital have now become operational and the additional cardiac surgery activity has commenced.</P>
    <P>The developments at the Mater Hospital, together with the development for cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital which were opened in November, 1994 will have the effect of increasing the number of cardiac surgery operations performed on an annual basis in the public hospital sector by 47 per cent from 950 to 1,400.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been a number of recent developments in Kenmare District Hospital including the provision of two day rooms, which were provided by the Friends of Kenmare District Hospital at a cost of £25,000, all of which was obtained through local fund raising.  The Kerry Hospice Foundation has also donated funds to upgrade one of the bedrooms in the hospital for terminally ill patients.  The Southern Health Board are satisfied that full use is being made of the existing facilities at Kenmare District Hospital.  The question of the provision of long-stay accommodation in <Col N="643" /> Kenmare will be considered in the context of the boards' development plan for community hospitals which is presently being formulated.</P>
    <P>I might add that short-stay and long-stay nursing care is provided in two registered nursing homes in the Kenmare area to which the provisions of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 apply.  There are also proposals to develop sheltered housing for the elderly in Kenmare and these proposals will be the subject of discussions between interested parties in the Kenmare Community Council and Kerry County Council.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in a reply to questions from Deputies O'Malley and Bruton on 22 February last, there are no proposals to provide incentives to employers in respect of childcare facilities in the workplace.</P>
      <P>An increasing number of employers are coming to appreciate the value of such facilities particularly as an aid to retaining trained and experienced staff who would otherwise have to consider giving up their jobs.  However, workplace nurseries may not be viable in most employments and in many instances parents already avail of alternative home-based or community-based facilities.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to ensuring an expansion of childcare provision and, as a contribution to the efforts of employers, parents and community interests, I have launched the childcare pilot scheme for disadvantaged areas last year.</P>
      <P>I believe that this pilot scheme, operating as it does on a national basis but targeted at disadvantaged areas, will make a substantial impact in increasing childcare provision and should encourage and prompt further involvement by employers in supporting childcare expansion whether at workplace or community level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of the latest information available to me, which relates to year-ending 31 December 1993, the position regarding the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service is that the 3 per cent quota had been exceeded.  In the case of the health boards and local authorities, the percentage of employees comprising people with disabilities was 1.02 per cent and 1.25 per cent respectively.</P>
      <P>My Department is in regular contact with the Departments of Finance, Health and the Environment to ensure that human resource managers in bodies under their control are aware of the Government's commitment to reaching the 3 per cent quota and that every effort is made to reach it as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is represented on the <Col N="647" /> monitoring committee for the employment of people with disabilities, which operates under the aegis of the central review committee which oversees implementation of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> The monitoring committee is responsible for promoting and reviewing progress in the employment of people with disabilities in the public and private sectors.  I understand that it is actively seeking to ensure that the quota is met in the wider public sector.</P>
    <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, which I established in 1993, has appointed a work and training group to examine the employment and training needs of people with disabilities and to draft recommendations, for consideration by the commission, with a view to improving their employment prospects.  Pending receipt of the commission's recommendations in this regard, I feel it would not be appropriate to seek to place the quota on a statutory basis.</P>

Chuige sin ceadaíodh deontas breise lánchostais nach rachaidh thar £150,000 anuraidh (anuas ar chúnamh de £43,600 a íocadh cheana i leith suirbhéanna agus staidéir éagsúla) chun a chumasú do Roinn na Mara suirbhéanna riachtanacha breise, <Col N="648" /> i.e., suirbhé hídreagrafach móide tástáil suímh, a dhéanamh ar an láthair.  Bhí gá leis an obair sin chun a chumasú do Roinn na Mara pleananna agus meastachán costais a ullmhú.  Cheap Roinn na Mara comhairleoir chun dul i mbun na suirbhéanna breise agus tuigtear go bhfuil dréacht-thurascáil an chomhair-leora á plé ag Roinn na Mara faoi láthair.</P>

      <P>My Department estimates that some 5,355 group water schemes have been completed or are under construction since the programme was introduced over 30 years ago.  Ongoing rationalisation and amalgamation of schemes, including the integration of groups into new public water supply systems, will have resulted in some decrease, relative to the above total, in the number of schemes which continue to operate as independent, privately-run schemes.</P>
      <P>There are some 369 active proposals for new schemes at present.  Information on the number of grant-assisted schemes for each county together with the number of proposed schemes is given in the following table.</P>
      <P>My Department arranged with CSO that water supply data collected in the 1991 Census would provide more accurate information on, inter alia, group scheme supplies.  I understand that this information should be available shortly.</P>

      <P>I understand that refurbishment measures proposed at Kilbarrack Dart Station include the construction of a pedestrian bridge over the railway line linking Briarfield Road and Grove Park Crescent.  Dublin Corporation applied to my Department in October 1993 for funding for the project and was informed that, as the bridge was intended to facilitate pedestrian movements between two local roads, it would be a matter for the corporation to finance its construction from its own resources, supplemented by the discretionary block grant from the Department. This continues to be the position. I will notify the corporation of its 1995 block grant allocation shortly.</P>

    <P>As part of a package of measures designed to improve and modernise the counting process at elections, the local government computer services board, at the request of my Department and in consultation with returning officers and <Col N="672" /> the Department, is developing a computer programme to assist returning officers in conducting counts.

      <P>With effect from 1 February 1990, the development of installations for disposal of industrial and domestic waste with an annual intake greater than 25,000 tonnes requires environmental impact assessment (EIA). Depending on the circumstances, EIA may fall to be carried out by the planning authority concerned and/or An Bord Pleanála, or by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
      <P>As far as waste installations proper for EIA by the Minister for the Environment are concerned, I am not aware of any case in which development has taken place in contravention of the above requirements.  In an EIA case now before my Department, the initial development of the landfill concerned took place some years ago; EIA is now being sought in prospect of a proposed expansion of this site which would increase its annual intake above the 25,000 tonnes limit.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 140 together.</P>
      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers does not contain the recommendations of the Child Abuse Prevention Programme (CAPP).  From representations which I have received the report would appear to be sponsored by individual teachers who are seconded to CAPP.  I have no plans to act on the recommendations contained in the report.</P>
      <P>My Department has received separate proposals from the directors of CAPP which are designed to ensure the continued successful implementation of the &ldquo;Stay Safe&rdquo; programme in primary schools.  The directors have also made specific proposals for putting in place a comprehensive maintenance structure for the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware I announced on 23 January last measures to be taken by my Department in support of the directors' proposals.  In particular I am sure the Deputy will be pleased to note that I have extended the secondment of eight teachers to the CAPP until the end of June next.  Thereafter I will be replacing the teachers on <Col N="676" /> full-time release with a wider network of teachers, capable of supporting the programme on a part-time basis.  This approach concurs with that advocated by the CAPP directors and is designed to build on the success of the programme to date.</P>
    <P>The proposals made in the report to which the Deputy refers are more extensive.  The report is not confined to the issues which the CAPP has sought to address and a structure for delivery is proposed which is substantially at odds with the plans which the CAPP directors have for the longer term maintenance of an effective child abuse prevention programme in primary schools.  I favour the more focused approach of the CAPP directors and I am making arrangements for funding and other support measures on that basis.</P>

      <P>In September 1994 I decided not to proceed with the construction of a post-primary school for Knocklyon.  I have no plans to alter that decision.</P>
      <P>My decision was taken in the light of the conclusions and recommendations of the independent Report carried out by Dr. Michael Bannon on the Service Industries Research Centre, UCD.  I have set out my position on the matter in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 27, 30 and 36, of 13 October 1994, to which I refer the Deputy.</P>

The terms of the lease will provide for additional classroom accommodation for the South City School Project if this is required.</P>

      <Quest>if free travel can be extended to a person (details supplied) in Dublin 17 who is in receipt of invalidity pension and in receipt of free travel, to include peak traffic times in view of the fact that he is attending hospital appointments and incurs transport costs for both himself and spouse who must accompany him at all times: and if he will extend the scheme in this case.</Quest>

      <P>The free travel scheme is intended to encourage elderly and incapacitated persons to remain active in the community by giving them access to spare capacity on the various public transport systems to the greatest extent possible.  Time restrictions have applied to the use of free travel passes on city bus routes in Dublin, Cork and Limerick since the introduction of the scheme in 1967.  This is necessary as the bus services concerned are under severe pressure at peak times in the morning and evening from commuters travelling to and from work or school.  The services would be unable to cope with the additional volume of passengers arising if the free travel restrictions did not apply.</P>
      <P>Development of the scheme in recent years has removed travel time restrictions for certain specified groups of disabled people.  These include mentallydisabled people (many of whom received regular day-care) and others attending long term rehabilitation courses or certain work programmes. The person concerned does not come within these categories and is not, therefore, entitled to an unrestricted free travel pass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="691" /> I would hope that the hospital concerned would find it possible, in the circumstances, to schedule appointments in this case so as to facilitate travel outside peak travel times, i.e. after 9.45 a.m. and before 4 30 p.m.</P>

      <P>As you are aware, the Government is committed to payment of the legally determined entitlements of married women to social welfare payments.  The Programme for a Government of Renewal provides for the establishment of a special unit in my Department to identify women entitled to such payments and to calculate the amount of each payment.  It is envisaged in the programme that all payments due will be made within a four year period.</P>

      <Quest>if the cost of commission on currency exchange is taken into account in the calculation of British pensions for means purposes in Ireland, in view of the fact that a standard exchange rate is altered every three months, whereas in conversion of a pension to Irish money, as well as exchange rate a social welfare recipient would be charged commission by a bank; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>A person in receipt of a British pension may also be entitled, if aged 66 or over, to an Irish Old Age (non-contributory) Pension.  The British pension would count as means for this purpose converted to Irish pounds by reference to an average exchange rate used by my Department.</P>
      <P>No bank charges are specifically taken into account in the assessment of means for social welfare entitlement. However, banks generally operate free banks services for people over 60 years of age who bank with them.  These people are not required to pay any bank charges including commission charges.</P>
      <P>For those British pensioners who do not have bank accounts and who are in receipt of an Irish Old Age (non-contributory) Pension, the banding arrangement in the payment structure of this pension (details attached) allows for small adjustments in weekly means. This, in most cases, would take account of commission charges without the requirement of a corresponding change in the rate of the Irish Old Age (non-contributory) Pension.</P>

      <Quest>in view of the PRSI returns for 1994 to date, the estimated cost to the Exchequer in 1994 and 1995 of the reduction in employers' PRSI from 12.3 per cent to 9 per cent in respect of workers earning £173 and less per week which was introduced by him in the 1994 Budget; the estimated benefit to the Exchequer in 1994 and 1995 from the increase in the ceiling on employers' PRSI contributions from £21,300 to £25,800, introduced by him in the 1994 Budget; and if he will make a statement on the employment and taxation effects of the changes in PRSI announced in the 1994 Budget.</Quest>

      <P>The Class A Employers' PRSI contribution structure, introduced in last year's budget, operates on a two tier basis.  A lower contribution rate of 9 per cent applies to employers in cases where their employees' total earnings are less than £173 in any week.  The higher contribution rate of 12.2 per cent applies in all other cases up to an earnings ceiling of £25,800.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of the lower tier concession, estimated at budget time, was £31 million in 1994 and £46 million in a full year. In order to partly offset this, the ceiling on the employers' contribution was raised to £25,800 instead of £22,200.  It was estimated that this would contribute <Col N="696" /> £3 million in 1994 and £26 million in a full year from Class A employers to the cost of the concessions announced.</P>
    <P>PRSI revenue has shown an increase in 1994 over 1993.  However, it is not possible to separate the effects of the budget changes from employment and earnings changes which also affect revenue.</P>
    <P>The net effect of the package of reforms in the PRSI system and the abolition of the health contribution and the employment and training levies for employees whose weekly earnings are less than £173, introduced in last year's budget, was to cut the cost to employers of creating and retaining jobs while improving take home pay of employees. The incentive for employers to create jobs and the incentive for unemployed people to seek and take up jobs has been enhanced.  Further improvements are being considered in the context of the forthcoming budget.</P>

      <P>Under present arrangements for means assessment, a person's means can be up to £6 per week, with an additional £2 per week for each dependent child before the rate of Old Age Non-Contributory Pension is reduced.  Full details of the payment structure are given in the following table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The means assessment takes account of money and property (other than the family home) which is assessed on a national basis, and of income, subject to certain exceptions, which a person or his <Col N="698" /> or her spouse or partner may reasonably expect to receive in the following year.</P>
    <P>In assessing the capital value of property and money, the first £200 (£400 for a couple) is not taken into account, the next £375 (£750 for a couple) is assessed at 5 per cent and the remainder is assessed at 10 per cent.  Where this results in a means assessment of £52 or more per year, the means assessed are increased by £52.  The weekly means are calculated by dividing the yearly means by 52.  More specific details of this means assessment are set out in Section 3.4 of &ldquo;The Law on Social Welfare &mdash; A Guide to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993&rdquo;, published by my Department, which I will make available to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare (CSW) recommended a basic level of social welfare payment referred to as the &ldquo;Main Rate&rdquo;.  While they accepted that there was no universal method of deriving the level of this &ldquo;Main Rate&rdquo;, they estimated that it would be in the range of £50-£60 in 1985 terms.  The lower end of the range is £65 in current terms.</P>
      <P>Table 1 below shows the current personal rates of social welfare payment as a percentage of the CSW Main Rate of £65.00.  The Old Age Contributory and Retirement Pension rate was above the CSW rate in 1985 and has increased further above it since then.  The rates which were originally below the CSW rate are converging towards this rate.</P>

      <P>The Child Benefit Review Committee was set up to put forward proposals for appropriate changes in <Col N="702" /> child benefit which could be considered for the 1995 budget.  I have found their report to be very useful in clarifying an approach to child benefit in the context of that budget.  As regards the structure of child benefit, the committee's approach was to give particular weight to the alleviation of child poverty and a reduction in disincentives to employment. On that basis, it concluded that the existing structure, with a higher rate for the third and subsequent child, should be retained.</P>
      <P>The main recommendation of the committee in relation to 1995 was that child benefit be increased.  The committee recognised that, given the many different roles of child benefit, setting the appropriate rate was, to a certain extent, arbitrary.  They suggested, however that an increase of £5 in 1995 would represent a balance between a reasonable increase and a realistic approach to funding.</P>
      <P>Proposals in the report will be considered by the Government as part of the overall budgetary package and any decisions on them will be announced in the budget.</P>

      <P>A number of proposals to establish a national conference centre have been considered by a special interdepartmental committee under the auspices of the Department of the Taoiseach. None of the proposals brought forward demonstrated that the establishment of a major conference centre catering for 2,000 plus participants is in itself a stand-alone viable economic proposition.</P>
      <P>Whereas there is little doubt about the positive effects of such a development for the economy, the direct benefits to the individual developer may not be sufficient to encourage the development. In this context, a number of private investors have expressed interest in the development of casinos as part of a wider development complex which would include, <i>inter alia,</i> a national conference centre.  A number of prospective investors have been met by way of a listening exercise but no commitments have been made either in connection with funds or location.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>When the £100 million Small Business Expansion Loan Scheme (SBELS) was announced in the 1994 budget, the then Ministers for Tourism and Trade and Enterprise and Employment agreed an allocation of £25 million for tourism projects.  It appeared quite likely, at that stage that this would be insufficient to cover all applications for tourism related projects, and this view was borne out by the fact that the £25 million had been fully committed by 30 September 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was accordingly necessary to focus the scheme on areas where it would be most beneficial in terms of tourism development and job protection and <Col N="705" /> creation.  Specific tourism eligibility criteria were therefore drawn up for the scheme and the views of Bord Fáilte and the industry generally were taken into account in this exercise.</P>
    <P>The importance of a vibrant restaurant sector to the overall Irish tourism product was fully recognised in this context.  It contributes to and benefits from tourism growth, but is nevertheless, less dependent on tourism for its survival than many other sectors.  Given the need to prioritise the areas most likely to benefit from the scheme, it was accordingly decided that restaurants should not be eligible.  The scheme has made a major contribution to tourism development and I have no doubt that the restaurant sector will benefit significantly from this growth.</P>
    <P>In the event of there being a further subsidised loan scheme for small businesses. I would, of course, strongly support the inclusion of the tourism sector. I would not, however, envisage broadening the criteria to include restaurants.</P>

      <P>Whereas I have an open mind about the establishment of a properly regulated casino in Ireland, it has been explained to all potential casino interests that a decision to permit such an operation, in any part of the country, is a matter for the Government and would require the passage of amending legislation, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.  My Department is presently studying the benefits of a casino from a tourism perspective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>As was indicated in response to previous Dáil questions on this issue, the Minister for Justice has, of course, primary responsibility in this area.  As Minister with responsibility for tourism, I am, of course, concerned about the level of crime against tourists.</P>
      <P>While this issue has caused a great deal of legitimate concern, it is important that we maintain a sense of proportion.  The growth in crime against tourists is a worldwide phenomenon. Ireland is still a relatively safe tourist destination and rates very well in any international comparison.  There is, of course, no acceptable level of crime and it is vital that the problem be tackled not least because of the effect it can have on our image as a tourist destination, particularly at a time when we have set ambitious targets for the tourism industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Steps already taken in this regard include: regular liaison between the <Col N="707" /> Garda authorities, Bord Fáilte and tourism interests; deployment of additional Garda patrols in areas of high tourist interest; establishment of a Garda office in O'Connell Street (opened in March 1990) which acts as a centre for advising tourists in safety measures; increased distribution of safety leaflets in four languages and city maps to tourists; increased level of foreign language training for gardaí; special provision in the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, which, <i>inter alia</i>, enables tourist victims to make an immediate statement before a District Judge.  This can eliminate the necessity to attend the subsequent trial.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant steps taken to redress the problem was the setting up in April 1994 of the Dublin Tourist Victim Support Service.  This service provides emotional support and practical help with issuing of travel tickets, advising on money transfers, liaising with embassies, providing emergency accommodation, etc.  The service deals only with cases referred to it by the Garda and while essentially a Dublin service, also assists clients referred from other parts of the country.  This service has had a very positive impact with virtually all clients seen in 1994 electing to continue their holiday in Ireland and many promising to return.</P>
    <P>I have arranged to double the financial support provided by Bord Fáilte for this service in 1995.  I am also anxious to ensure that the liaison between the service, the Garda authorities, Bord Fáilte and the tourism industry will continue, and I will take on board any new proposals to address the problems that fall within my area of responsibility.  I also intend to liaise closely with the Minister for Justice who shares my concern in relation to this issue.</P>

      <P>The primary focus of the Community Employment Programme is persons who are long-term unemployed.  In addition persons referred by the National Rehabilitation Board and persons in receipt of lone parent's allowance for over one year are also eligible. This latter category has recently been extended so that persons with children in receipt of deserted wife's benefit or survivor's contributory pension who opt for and are awarded a means-tested social welfare payment can apply to participate in the programme.  Widows and widowers who satisfy the specified eligibility criteria can participate in the programme.</P>

      <P>Insurers are not required to submit information to my Department in relation to fraudulent insurance claims, which are by their very nature difficult to detect.  Consequently there are no precise statistics available on the frequency of such claims although it is generally accepted that there is a problem in this area.</P>
      <P>The insurance industry and those public authorities which are self-insured have established computerised databases to assist in the detection and elimination of fraudulent or spurious claims. In addition, the Irish Insurance Federation has also established a sub-committee which acts as a conduit for the dissemination of information throughout the industry and as a co-ordinator for liaison with the Garda authorities.</P>

      <P>I am very conscious of the need to provide adequate sources of funding for the development of small industry, and industry generally, so that they can exploit to the full their business and employment potential. I am encouraged by the fact that over the past few years a number of beneficial initiatives have emerged to augment the level of funding for new <Col N="710" /> and developing businesses.  These include the creation of a network of county enterprise boards, the successful development of the enterprise loan scheme which grants bank loans to small business on favourable terms, the ICC loan subsidy scheme and the creation of significant private sector initiatives such as First Step and the Smurfit Job Creation Enterprise Fund.  In addition, the business expansion scheme continues to be a valuable source of funding for developing businesses.  There is provision in the recently announced Operational Programme for Industrial Development for structural fund assistance for seed-early stage investment in growth orientated firms.  I am conscious also of a number of individual schemes introduced by the Associated Banks which show the beginnings of a move on their part to provide long term finance to business on favourable terms.</P>
      <P>I note the Deputy's suggestion for a revolving fund.  My Department will continue to monitor the needs of small industry, including the issue of funding. Where new measures or where amendments to existing measures are required. I will respond appropriately.  No doubt the Deputy will also be aware of the measures outlined in the policy agreement between the Government parties which will enhance the development of small business.</P>

      <P>At the Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting in Brussels on 23 January I raised with my colleagues the situation of the pigmeat industry in Ireland and the need for the <Col N="714" /> EU to take action to alleviate the difficulties which pig producers are suffering.</P>
      <P>The EU Commission decided, at a Pigmeat Management Committee meeting on 30 January to introduce an Aid for private storage scheme for a period of three months for up to 70,000 tonnes of pigmeat, with effect from 6 February. I have also raised with the Commission the need to take action to counteract the feed cost disadvantage suffered by Irish producers.</P>

      <P>Energy production is a matter for the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. However, I have a keen interest in encouraging the use of set-aside land for the production of crops for non-food purposes, such as energy.  This would provide additional opportunities for tillage farmers and others while at the same time keeping the land in a productive state.</P>
      <P>In 1994 over 36,000 hectares of land were set-aside in Ireland.  Under EU regulations only crops not primarily intended for human or animal consumption can be grown on such land.  Of particular interest are crops for the production of biofuels for use in motor engines and biomass for use in power stations.</P>
      <P>Research conducted by Teagasc has shown bio-diesel as an excellent energy source which can be used in the conventional diesel engine.  It recycles most of the carbon dioxide which it generates in combustion, emits much less smoke and no sulphur and it bio-degrades rapidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to biofuel production my Department and other Departments are <Col N="715" /> having discussions with private interests which are examining the feasibility of establishing a biofuel industry here.</P>
    <P>I understand that, under the US/Ireland exchange programme in agriculture and food science and technology, a seminar/workshop on the use of agricultural production for non-food uses (including energy) will take place in Ireland this autumn.  Top scientists from the USA and the EU will make contributions at the workshop.  It is hoped that practical proposals and collaborative research projects will emerge from the workshop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>The precise impact of the GATT Agreement on Irish agriculture will depend on the levels of output and consumption and the various factors which affect both of these, in the European Union and in the rest of the world, all of which developments are not susceptible to accurate forecasting.  However, based on current trends.  Ireland should not face any undue difficulties arising out of the GATT commitments affecting the Irish agriculture and food sectors.</P>
      <P>The beef market in the EU is currently strong and intervention stocks are nearly completely eliminated.  While some difficulties may arise towards the end of the six year period of the agreement, it is expected that any such difficulties will be dealt with adequately under existing market mechanisms.  The outlook for the pigmeat and poultrymeat sectors, where the Union is facing reduced subsidised export possibilities from the outset of the agreement, is more problematic.  It is anticipated, however, that the continuing increase in the consumption of these products, together with the possibility of unsubsidised exports to certain destinations, should help to overcome difficulties in these areas.  Nevertheless, the knock on effect on relative feed grain prices arising from the impact of CAP reform in the cereals sector will, unless adjustments to EU arrangements are made, add to competitive pressure in these sectors. I will be pressing the Commission to propose such adjustments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="717" /> In regard simply to the GATT commitments in the cereals sector, the Commission is confident that further restrictive measures will not be required.  The impact on the sheepmeat sector will not be significant although it will be important to ensure that imports continue along traditional trading lines.  In the milk sector there is no reason to believe that any action beyond that provided under CAP reform will be required to meet GATT commitments.</P>
    <P>Overall, the GATT commitments should not have a major adverse impact on the sectors of main interest to Ireland nor necessitate additional adjustments to the CAP.  Should additional measures be necessary, however, Ireland has secured commitments in the Council that such measures would be shared out fairly, taking account of the circumstances of certain categories of producers and of the most affected regions.  In addition, the Commission has undertaken to monitor the effect of export restrictions and increased access in relevant sectors, and, where appropriate, to make proposals to maintain competitive production capacities and market stability.  The Deputy can be assured that I will monitor the situation in the different markets very closely and that I will, where necessary, call upon the Commission to take corrective action to protect the position of the Irish agriculture and food sectors.</P>

      <P>The Government is committed to the drawing up of a National Land Use Policy Plan to provide guidelines for both national policy decisions and planning authorities in relation to the location of agricultural, industrial, forestry, aquaculture and tourism developments.  Overall responsibility for the drawing up of the plan is a matter for the Minister for the Environment.  Within my Department, land policy is the responsibility of the Minister of State, who will ensure that the interests of the agriculture, food and forestry sectors are taken into account in the development of the plan.</P>
      <P>Powers of acquisition and distribution of land are currently vested in the Irish Land Commission, the dissolution of which was provided for in the Irish Land Commission (Dissolution) Act, 1992.  I have no plans to establish another body with similar powers.</P>

In this context I will have regard to the effects of the measure as it was applied in 1994.

      <P>At the moment the EU pigmeat market is in an over-supply situation, running at about 105 per cent self sufficiency. Breeding herds in the EU overall are showing a decrease.  This should cut back on supplies, and lead to somewhat higher prices to the producer.</P>
      <P>It is my objective to ensure that a strong and efficient pig production sector is maintained and developed in this country and that the processing sector continues to improve efficiency and marketing performance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no delay in progressing the Dublin light rail project.  Detailed work on the project, for which provision has been included in the National Development Plan and the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-1999, is proceeding satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic light rail network recommended by the Dublin Transportation Initiative is for lines to Tallaght, Cabinteely, via the Harcourt Street line, and <Col N="727" /> Ballymun and would cost approximately £300 million to implement.  In the final report of the DTI, which will be published shortly, the cost of implementing the individual lines, is estimated as follows: Tallaght, £79.2 million; Cabinteely, £70.1 million; Ballymun, £55.7 million.  In addition, provision has been made for estimated expenditure of £93.7 million on fixed costs associated with the DTI recommended network.  Possibilities for further extensions to the basic network will also be reported on in the final report of the DTI.</P>
    <P>The basic network cannot be fully constructed within the EU and other resources totalling £200 million set out in the National Development Plan. Moreover, a longer time frame than that of the National Development Plan and the operational programme, which covers the period from 1994 to 1999, will be needed to complete the basic network.</P>
    <P>The objective is to have two priority phases of the light rail network constructed in the period up to 1999 at an estimated cost, exclusive of any financing charges, of £200 million.  In this context my Department in conjunction with a high level project team in CIE have for some time been engaged in detailed planning and preparatory work to advise on the optimum combination of light rail links recommended by the DTI to be constructed by 1999 on the basis of a number of criteria, including financial performance, congestion alleviation, ease of construction and environmental impact.  All of the bodies involved in the planning and provision of transportation in the Dublin area are cooperating in this work which embraces all aspects of the light rail network.  The provisional finding arising from this work is that links to Tallaght and Dundrum should be constructed during the period of the operational programme and this position was noted and approved by the Government in October 1994.</P>
    <P>The decision in relation to the two priority phases to be constructed by 1999 does not imply any abandonment <Col N="728" /> of the remaining phases of the basic network.</P>
    <P>In relation to legislative arrangements for the light rail network, the legal advice is that enactment of new legislation to provide a comprehensive legal framework for the development of the light rail system for Dublin is desirable. It is my intention to submit proposals to the Government in this matter in the near future.  These proposals will deal with a range of issues associated with the development of the network, including environmental impact assessment, land acquisition etc.</P>

The first of these claims, which was made in 1990, involved a total of £5,437 paid in settlement, including a total of £2,037 paid in legal costs.  Another public body was also the subject of the claim, and liability for the payments has not yet been finally agreed.  The second claim, made in 1991, has recently been settled.

      <P>The procedures for dealing with grievances in the Defence Forces are at present being reviewed.  The matter is being considered under the provisions of the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Forces.  A sub-committee of the conciliation council is examining the existing grievance procedures with a view to identifying problems and assessing options for improvements.  In this context a draft scheme for a new complaints procedure has been issued to the Permanent Defence Force representative associations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I do not wish to pre-empt the discussions at the sub-committee of the conciliation council on the reform of the complaints procedure within the Defence Forces, I see merit in the introduction of some independent third party investigation to assist in the review of <Col N="730" /> grievances brought to attention.  Such a proposal has been made to both PDFORRA and RACO.</P>
    <P>Regarding the issue of an Ombudsman for military affairs, it is first necessary to see how the proposed reformed redress of wrongs/grievance procedures work out in practice.  The Ombudsman issue can be pursued if the reformed procedures do not meet requirements.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 208 and 209 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The emergency aid scheme was introduced last April to deal with hardship and losses arising from prolonged bad weather during the previous winter.  To date, a total of £412,000 has been paid to 433 crewmen under the scheme.  A <Col N="732" /> further £78,000 approximately will be paid to another 82 crewmen, when additional information required to finalise claims is provided.  The average payment to crewmen will amount to some £950.</P>
    <P>Payments to 374 vessel owners to date amount to £1,900,000.  An additional £104,000 approximately will be paid to another 26 vessel owners when additional information required to finalise their claims is provided.  This will result in the average payment being just over £5,000.  A further £484,000 has been paid to the owners of 168 vessels in respect of the loss of static gear.  The average payment per vessel will be just over £2,800.</P>
    <P>The detailed administration of this scheme is a matter for An Bord Iascaigh Mhara which has advised that, as payments from the scheme primarily represented hardship and assistance, the publication by it of a list of individual recipients would be an intrusion into fishermen's private affairs.</P>
