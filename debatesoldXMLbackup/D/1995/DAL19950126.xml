      <P>Before proceeding I am sure the House will wish to join me in extending a warm welcome to a visitor from the British House of Commons in the person of Mr. David Mellor, M.P. I wish him well and trust his visit to us will be happy and successful.  On behalf of the House I extend to him a most hearty céad míle fáilte, a hundred thousand welcomes.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 6, 7 and 2.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that No. 1 shall be decided without debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach give top priority to ensuring that the mechanism for dealing with the legislation on the offence of money laundering, which has been on the Statute Book since November, is speeded up?  As I recall it, the financial institutions wished to have time to put in place a code of practice. In view of the Brink's Allied raid I think <Col N="302" /> the Taoiseach will agree that process should be speeded up.  Will the Taoiseach ensure that the Minister for Justice carries out a review of escort measures?  I know this is a difficult area but I would ask the Government to examine whether the known godfathers and their gangs can be brought to justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much point in passing an Act and putting it on the Statute Book if it is not implemented.  I am asking the Taoiseach to ensure that the process of implementing the Act passed in this House some months ago is speeded up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that legislation on this matter, which was passed after considerable delay, should be brought into full effect quickly.  I assure the House that every step that needs to be taken to deal with the problem of money laundering will be taken quickly.</P>

      <P>Under the Programme for Government, the Government undertakes to examine the possibility of bringing in legislation to protect journalists' sources.  Given that a case is beginning today which many will believe is perversion in the course of justice, may I ask the Taoiseach if the Government has carried out an examination of that matter and if it intends to bring forward legislation?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach was in Opposition he was always very keen to ensure that the House was never offended and that, where possible, Ministers would make announcements about proposed legislation in the House.  I was, therefore, very surprised at 16.25 p.m. on 25 January to receive in my office a fax from &ldquo;Minister Avril Doyle&rdquo; in advance of passing the legislation to have her appointed.  It is a gross insult to the Oireachtas that faxes are being sent out from &ldquo;Minister Avril Doyle&rdquo; when the legislation to have her appointed has not yet been passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach rethink some of the Government appointments, particularly at Minister of State level?  It has been brought to my notice that Government Buildings are now sagging with the weight of five Ministers of State &mdash; Deputies Barrett, Fitzgerald, Carey, Mitchell and Doyle &mdash; and their special advisers and programme managers.  This means that senior civil servants have had to be transferred to the basement and to nooks and crannies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter for you, <Col N="307" /> Sir, to rule on the status of the Programme for Government under the Standing Orders.  I welcome parliamentary questions, written or otherwise, posed in respect of all legislative commitments.  If those questions are posed then the answers will be given in the House and further questioning will be in order.  To avoid doubt, that procedure might be followed by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>To save the taxpayer £40, £60 or £80 for each parliamentary question, the Taoiseach could just say &ldquo;yes, all the legislation promised in the Programme for Government will be treated as promised legislation in the House&rdquo;.  That would be a much simpler procedure.  However, I will follow the Taoiseach's suggestion if he wants me to waste taxpayers' money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard the suggestion that parliamentary questions cost money as wrong.  Parliamentary questions are the basic protection of democracy which every Member has in this House.  The Government will not complain about parliamentary questions or attempt, as others have done, to put a price tag on them.  The more questions we are asked the better.</P>

      <P>I welcome the introduction of the Bill.  As a previous Member of the Seanad I also welcome the fact that the Bill was introduced in that House.  I have always believed there should be a greater division of legislation and that we should use both Houses in a more balanced way than we have done in the past.  Perhaps now there will be cause to do so with the greater balance of Members between the Government and Opposition in that House.  The Seanad is an appropriate House to tease out a Bill on which a considerable degree of thought, reflection and knowledge is required.  I am well aware, also, of the number of educationalists and historians who are Members of the Upper House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" /> Putting the conservation, protection, identification and enhancement of our heritage on a statutory basis is long overdue.  A Bill was introduced in draft form in 1982 but, unfortunately, it was never passed.  The Heritage Council was set up in 1988 and now the Minister is proposing to put it on a statutory basis. That is what is required for the protection of our heritage.</P>
    <P>Too many buildings, monuments, archaeological objects and, indeed, entire landscapes, including flora and fauna, have been damaged through neglect and lack of legal protection in the past.  Our heritage is the totality of our historical inheritance.  It is what has given us our uniqueness as a country and a people.  Vandalism of our heritage should be subjected to the most severe penalties.</P>
    <P>We must not simply conserve and preserve; we must develop, educate and promote an awareness and pride in our past.  There are some aspects of our heritage I would not wish us to preserve or promote.  In this context I am glad the Minister is proposing to establish standing committees, one to deal specifically with wildlife and wildlife habitats.  In recent times we have got a very bad press because of the manner in which we deal with some of our harmless wild animals and birds.  Both North and South we have acquired a rather unsavoury reputation for bloodsports of a particularly cruel and undesirable kind.  Fox-hunting, badger baiting, hare coursing, the blooding of greyhounds with live rabbits and cock fighting are particularly gruesome activities and something we should deal with on a national basis.  Regularly there are questions and allegations of abuse.  Only recently in the BBC &ldquo;Spotlight&rdquo; programme in Northern Ireland it was related that fighting cocks and spurs were sold illegally at the traditional monthly horse fair at Smithfield in my constituency.  Some of these activities are illegal and all of them are indefensible and I would like to see the council, <Col N="316" /> through its new standing committee on wildlife, dealing with those as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that the functions of the council shall be to propose policies and priorities for the identification, protection, preservation and enhancement of the national heritage, including monuments, archaeological objects, heritage objects, works of architecture, flora, fauna, wildlife habitats, landscapes, seascapes, wrecks, geology, heritage gardens and parks and inland waterways.  That is a comprehensive list which indicates the plethora of areas that can be brought under the broad definition of heritage.  We do not have a clear definition.  I found it difficult to get anything like a precise definition but, according to the New Shorter Oxford Dictionary, heritage means that which might be inherited in terms of property or succession, that which would form part of a national or cultural heritage and that which was concerned with the conservation and use of the national or cultural heritage.  It is easier to describe than to define.  Heritage covers a wide range of subjects, from artefacts, topography, history, music, stories, archaeology to our history which details wave after wave of people who came to this island, leaving indelible marks in historical and archaeological terms.  These include the pre-Celts, the Celts, the Vikings, the Anglo-Normans, the French and the Spanish, all of whom made a strong impact.  In the Minister's constituency the effects of the Spanish Armada are strong.  Off County Sligo the Armada left a huge number of wrecks and I am glad to see that an Armada museum is being established in that county.  We heard the other day that the Minister is making an order to prevent interference with treasures uncovered on the tragic ship, the <i>Lusitania</i>, and ensure that any further action takes place under strict licence.</P>
    <P>This very morning in my constituency of Dublin Central I received a call from somebody in Sean McDermott Street who told me that a team from the corporation had arrived to demolish a row <Col N="317" /> of houses on one side of the street.  I contacted the dangerous buildings section of the corporation by telephone to ask what was happening.  I was asked to contact the maintenance depot which explained that it had received a call from the dangerous buildings section of Dublin Corporation about some buildings that the corporation considered to be unsafe and had been asked to erect a palisade fence around them.  The maintenance section did not have a crew to do that but had a crew to demolish the buildings and, rather than erecting a palisade fence, they sent out a crew to demolish the row of houses some of which are derelict and some of which are not in bad condition.  No discussion took place as to the merits of retaining the streetscape by preserving those mid19th century buildings which are roughly 150 years old.  I eventually got a reply from the dangerous buildings section before the Dáil resumed this morning to the effect that it is has been agreed to postpone the demolition and erect a palisade fence, although that would take longer to do.  The lazy <i>ad hoc</i> approach is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I consulted the Bill to see if there was anything to protect against this and section 10 provides that the council may consult with a local authority on the maintenance, preservation, restoration, upkeep and improvement of any heritage building owned by the authority.  I would like some clarification on that. The section provides that the building would have to be a listed heritage building.  A problem may arise, therefore, where, although none of a row of buildings is listed, they may be essential to the preservation of that streetscape. Could the interpretation of section 10 be expanded to require the local authority to have consultations and give the Heritage Council a role in dealing with matters of this nature?  I am anxious to see that encompassed in that section. Perhaps we could tease that out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In my city and in towns and cities throughout the country there is a considerable degree of urban renewal <Col N="318" /> driven by tax incentives.  That is desirable and has resulted in the development of offices, apartments, etc. However, much of this development can be willy-nilly, with apartment blocks erected without an overall plan for the landscape.  For example, there has been a variety of architectural styles used in new developments along the line of the Liffey quays yet there is a specific recognised architectural line on those quays.  Similarly this is happening in other inner city developments, a site is acquired and the development which takes place does not necessarily fit in with the surrounding streetscape.  The city or town architect should have responsibility for drawing up an overall plan in advance of urban renewal schemes in designated areas so that we do not have piecemeal development which neglects the overall picture.  The urban renewal scheme has been very successful in eliminating derelict sites but I would not like to see it result in a mishmash with no regard for the overall picture.</P>
    <P>We should take a pro-active approach to our archaeological heritage.  The city archaeologist in Dublin has the resources to act only in the context of a development taking place and it is only when the builder is about to come on site that the archaeologist examines the terrain for archaeological remains.  The development has been granted planning permission when the archaeologist examines the site and very often it is not appropriate to do anything apart from covering the remains.  That is always a pressurised approach and I think there should be far more pre-planning.  We should look at the areas of our city that are likely to have rich archaeological remains; we know where the Viking, Anglo-Norman and Huguenot settlements were in the city and certain areas should be surveyed and excavated long before any development is planned.  We should take a pro-active approach to get the work done years ahead of the proposed development.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of heritage is live heritage, for example, Moore Street, <Col N="319" /> where street traders from time immemorial have sold fruit, vegetables and fish. That should be seen as an integral part of our heritage and promoted as desirable for tourism.  The Smithfield horse fair has been an annual custom for centuries in the Smithfield market.  As I have said one or two ugly practices have developed and there has been some criticism of the cruel treatment of horses but again this is an unusual part of the city, one might describe it as a rural custom located in a city environment. Obviously it is of immense interest to young people to be able to see horses in an urban setting.  I would like to see this regulated and properly licensed but not driven out of the area as it brings a novel character to the heart of the city.</P>
    <P>A great deal of specific work could be done with our built heritage.  Saint Michan's Church in Dublin is celebrating its 1,000th year of existence this year, but it is in poor condition with water seeping through the roof.  It would cost hundreds of thousands of pounds to do a proper job.  This church has a fine tradition and its vaults house the preserved bodies of the crusaders.  It deserves to be taken care of.  The house of Sean O'Casey on the North Circular Road has had very little attention, I believe it is still let out in flats and totally unprotected or preserved.  Saint Mary's Church in Mary Street &mdash; the name of which the good burghers of the city are endeavouring to change to Henry Street to give it a commercial focus to rival Grafton Street although I do not think the city councillors will agree to that &mdash; goes back to the 11th century and the Cistercians and it probably may well be the oldest church originally in the city.  They would benefit from the focus of the new Heritage Council.</P>
    <P>The new measures for the built heritage in private ownership are welcome. We would also need to survey and catalogue our built heritage nationally. Some work has been done through aerial photography but this task needs to be done county by county, town by town <Col N="320" /> so that we have an overall catalogue.  It is very important to have an overall picture as we would then be able to plan and develop policies, which is the specific brief of the National Heritage Council.  We would have the information to respond to the broad canvass as distinct from our <i>ad hoc</i> responses in the past.</P>
    <P>The statutory proposals for the independence of the National Museum and the National Library are welcome.  It is proposed that the National Museum would have Collins Barracks as an exhibition area and it could put on display the rich artefacts now scattered in basements in its own offices in Kildare Street and elsewhere throughout the country.  This will also present the opportunity to exhibit the many other treasures that have not been on public view because of a lack of space.  The decision to open the premises as a museum is a wise one.  It is easily accessible being located near Heuston Station and close to the city centre.</P>
    <P>In the past we neglected the importance of local community involvement in heritage although many community groups have done excellent work.  Perhaps the work best known is that done in the area of genealogy.  However, there is a broader area of heritage work in terms of what is available on a historical, archaeological and industrial basis in a local community.  This area lacks resources and a proper structure for development.  Recently an Inchicore/ Kilmainham group carried out work in their area covering the Camac river, the Liffey area, the Inchicore works, the railway, various Viking artefacts and the buildings.  It did a survey and drew up proposals to enhance some of the buildings, develop a centre and so on.  The problem is how to progress the work beyond that point.</P>
    <P>The council's function is to propose policies and priorities but how do we develop a network where such groups can be brought into the system and use all that rich local lore in the development of a national heritage policy?</P>
    <P>I would like to see the areas of heritage better defined and described than <Col N="321" /> they are at present and a greater degree of information and education provided &mdash; obviously there is a role for the schools to play in this area &mdash; so that we develop our uniqueness as a people.  We have promoted tourism and, as a result, generated employment based on our heritage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the powers in section 10 and would like to see them extended, if required, to protect the streetscape of the city some of which may not have a listed building or national monument.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I am glad the Government is continuing the commitment given in the Fianna Fáil-Labour programme for Government.  In 1988 the Government established a non-statutory National Heritage Council with advisory functions and this Bill is putting the Heritage Council on a statutory footing.  Its ethos is to facilitate preservation and provide further access to our heritage.</P>
      <P>During the debate in the Seanad much was said about the definition of heritage.  It must have the widest possible definition in order to incorporate all of what we are.  The term &ldquo;heritage&rdquo; must refer not only to the physical aspects of our history but must also express our unique psyche as a nation so as to enable us understand and interpret the resonance of our past.</P>
      <P>I share the Minister's distaste of the term &ldquo;cultural tourism&rdquo; and the crass attitude that would seem to imply.  No one would deny the obligation and responsibility of any Government to provide jobs for its people by promoting our history, archaeology, literature and music as long as what is presented is authentic.  In this way our heritage is preserved and transmitted faithfully thereby creating sustainable jobs and presenting a true mirror image of our past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the Minister in setting up a heritage policy unit where technical and trained staff will be available.  From now on the Heritage Council will have policies based on further expert knowledge <Col N="322" /> rather than being seen solely as a funding agency.  While I welcome the authority given to the Heritage Council to exercise a special role in relation to buildings owned by public authorities and its added powers to veto any public authorities' plans to demolish, alter or dispose of a listed building without direct permission from the Minister, I fear the council may be inadequately funded and that the role envisaged for it by the Minister may be diminished.  I understand that £2.5 million is allocated for 1995 and a further £2.5 million is to be allocated in 1996.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear what the Minister has to say regarding the role of the Heritage Council in co-ordinating, advising and working with local amateur groups in small communities.  In furthering their projects, the Heritage Council would be uniquely placed to encourage and promote further knowledge of and commitment to the need for preservation.  This would further educational programmes which would result in the percolation of expert knowledge throughout the community.  It is important that such a council would be seen to be close to the people and work on their behalf protecting their interests.  Close co-operation and consultation with interested groups is essential to foster positive relationships not just with county councils but also with the general public.  Easy accessibility to the Heritage Council is paramount.</P>
    <P>Taking this Bill in conjunction with the national monuments legislation, much has been done to improve and highlight our awareness of the need to preserve and promote our heritage.  We have recognised the need for legal provisions and remedies to ensure the safety of our heritage.  Whereas the proposed legislation will enable the Heritage Council to have authority over listed buildings in the possession of local authorities, the council, if I understand it correctly, cannot acquire land or buildings from the authorities.</P>
    <P>I would also have to question the powers &mdash; if any &mdash; of the Heritage Council wherever listed buildings are in <Col N="323" /> private hands.  As some people asked, would this pose a difficult constitutional problem with regard to property rights? For example, in such circumstances, would the Minister be in a position to persuade the Minister for Finance, to provide grants for listed buildings in private hands?  However, I appreciate the Minister's argument in this respect, that each citizen must act responsibly where his or her heritage is concerned. Nonetheless, perhaps financial encouragement would prevent many listed buildings falling into disrepair or disintegrating.  The Minister might specify what type of censure is available to the State if and whenever a listed building, in private hands, is demolished.  In such circumstances, what legal remedies are available to the State?  There also arises not only the question of the demolition of particular components of our heritage but in many cases some very old, historically valuable buildings in private hands, the owners of which are not in a position to maintain or repair them through lack of finance; there may well be the will but not the necessary financial backing.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that the Heritage Council will be openly accountable through the declaration of its members' interests.  I was pleased to note also the gender balance the Minister has ensured for its membership.</P>
    <P>I might mention another matter which impinges on this debate and on that with regard to national monuments, which is the vexed question of occupiers' liability.  No doubt the Minister will be aware of the tremendous problems faced by many landowners where there has been access to national monuments in private hands.  We have been aware that farmers in rural areas have adopted a very open welcoming approach, when it came to allowing people access to their lands.  However, because of the growing compensation culture within our society, we know there is genuine fear on the part of landowners of being sued in the event of an accident on their lands and, because of <Col N="324" /> the legal limbo, many heritage sites have been closed to the public.  In the northern part of my constituency&mdash; which the Minister knows very well &mdash; many landowners have felt that the only option available to them was to close access to their lands because of occupiers' liability.  I am confident that the Minister, with such knowledge, will be in close communication with the Minister for Equality and Law Reform who has specific responsibility for the introduction of the Occupiers' Liability Bill, 1994, which will be discussed in the House later today.  No doubt both Ministers will co-ordinate their efforts to tackle this serious problem.</P>
    <P>We shall be able to tease out the detailed provisions of the Heritage Council Bill on Committee Stage, when I look forward to further discussion.  I wish the Minister well in his endeavours <i>vis-á-vis</i> the provisions of this Bill which highlight awareness of and our needs with regard to our national heritage.  I should like to see the broadest possible definition of that heritage which, to date, may have been appreciated by some only in our society.  Perhaps we might examine some type of educational programme to be introduced at the earliest possible moment in primary schools so that this heightened awareness may be inculcated at a very early age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on his efforts in establishing this Heritage Council.  Its provisions cover a very wide number of sites of enormous importance to our overall national heritage.  As the Minister said, the functions to be assigned to the Heritage Council will be to formulate policies and priorities, to identify projects, preserve, enhance and increase awareness of Ireland's heritage which covers a very wide field.  I was interested to hear Deputy de Valera refer to its budget being small.  It is fair to point out that it was drawn up by her party in Government and I am sure that budget will be re-examined, if possible, dependent on available resources&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be interesting to see whether this Government can increase that budget.  I have every confidence in the Minister ensuring that that will be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>This Government has been in office a very short time and it is wonderful to observe the dramatically changed attitude of Members now in Opposition.  Indeed, I felt similarly when on that side of the House.  I also hope that additional moneys can be made available to the Minister to increase that budget.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, the first priority is to give the people of Cavan-Monaghan a real opportunity to see their heritage, the first prerequisite to which must be filling the many potholes on our roads, thereby enabling natives and tourists alike to observe the great heritage within those areas.</P>
      <P>I was also very pleased to hear Deputy de Valera refer to the need to have the Occupier's Liability Bill amended and enacted as quickly as possible.  When in Opposition I spoke forcefully on this issue, one which engenders extreme anxiety on the part of property owners, not merely farmers, whose wish is to facilitate access to such sites for the general public, natives and tourists alike.  As the Bill stands, there is an anomaly in that minors would not be covered under its provisions.  I was pleased to note that in the Programme for Government there was agreement that the issue be examined.  No doubt we will be given an opportunity later to make suggestions on how that Bill can be improved, so allowing many more people to enjoy and appreciate our great heritage.  Indeed many of our residents have not seen all our heritage sites, which should be their priority before travelling abroad.  However, we will be unable to see them unless that law is changed so that landowners feel free to allow everybody access to their lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Heritage Council Bill is of great importance, not merely to our heritage but also to our tourism industry and its <Col N="326" /> potential.  We must remember that over many centuries our people have had no choice but to leave this lovely land of ours because of economic and other problems so that in the United States of America, Australia and other countries worldwide the children, great grand-children and other descendants of our people have an enormous desire to return here to investigate their ancestry and rejuvenate their links with this island.  For that reason also it is most important to devise adequate safeguards and measures to protect, preserve and improve our heritage.  Whenever Irish people travel worldwide, they always meet Irish people or those of Irish ancestry, all of whom want to return, to investigate their family roots, old graveyards and other heritage links of enormous importance to them, in which task the Heritage Council will have a major role.</P>
    <P>When appointing members to this council the Minister should take into account the need to appoint people who have practical knowledge of not just our heritage, but of the cost of restoring and maintaining it.  I say from these benches, as I said from the Opposition benches in the past, that the Minister should not appoint people just because of their political background.</P>
    <P>It is important that the public believe that the members of boards and councils are appointed for the best reasons and have the interests of what they are appointed to do at heart.  It is important that members of the council know if proposals put forward at board or council meetings are practical and can be implemented.  There is no point in boards or councils spending hours debating impractical and unworkable proposals.</P>
    <P>In my constituency the Clogher Historical Society has done tremendous work over the years promoting important issues and preserving artefacts.  I am sure that a member of that council would be a suitable candidate for appointment to the new council being set up by the Minister.  I mention <Col N="327" /> that body because I am familiar with it and I appreciate the work it does.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the Bill does not necessarily cover privately owned buildings and that is an important matter.  He said he intended to bring forward other legislation to deal with this issue.  In my area a derelict site order has been placed on some buildings, and a few weeks before or after those buildings were listed as important historical buildings as a result of which the owners cannot alter.  It is all very well to list such buildings but in many cases groups cannot afford to maintain or preserve them.  Unless funding is made available to assist such groups the listing of buildings can represent a negative approach because the old building is allowed deteriorate.  In the previous Fine Gael led coalition grant-aid was available at least for the restructuring of private homes.  It may not have been sufficient to maintain some of the larger buildings.  That grant was abolished in 1988 and the Government must consider providing funding to preserve historical homes and buildings.</P>
    <P>In my local village officials of FÁS, together with a small Church of Ireland group, came together and carried out some of the best work undertaken through the FÁS scheme to preserve the local market house in the centre of the village.  That work has encouraged many local people to improve their buildings. As a result the appearance of the village and the local area has improved dramatically.  Much work can be done to improve the appearance of local areas and help attract tourists.</P>
    <P>The preservation of public buildings is another important matter.  The Minister made it clear that we have a responsibility in this regard.  In view of the problems encountered by local councils regarding the maintenance of roads and so on it is sometimes difficult for them to find the funds to preserve old buildings.  Monaghan has led the way in ensuring that such buildings are made accessible to the handicapped and <Col N="328" /> others and that work involves extra cost for councils and public bodies.</P>
    <P>There are other aspects to our heritage, such as our unique drumlin countryside in Cavan-Monaghan.  The councils in that constituency have decided to protect the appearance of the countryside by ensuring that houses and buildings do not spoil the landscape which is a tourist attraction.</P>
    <P>Other important issues we must consider are finance, grant-aid and preservation.  I spoke to a council official recently about the condition of an important historical monument, Clones high cross, situated in the Diamond in the town.  Due to climatic conditions in the area &mdash; it has one of the highest levels of rainfall in the country &mdash; that cross is deteriorating and it will cost a great deal of money to preserve it.  That is a typical example of a monument of great historical importance which cannot be preserved without financial backing.</P>
    <P>The Brangan mountain is one of the most scenic areas in County Monaghan. I brought some German visitors to see it and they could not believe the beauty and the quietness there.  The mountain is adjacent to a major county town, Monaghan.  Financial assistance is needed to maintain the roads through the mountain otherwise tourists will not be able to travel on them.  Some people who had to leave that region many generations ago find it difficult to understand why funds are not available for such work.</P>
    <P>Thankfully following the peace initiative, about which we are all very happy, many changes are taking place in that area.  I hope the new Heritage Council will assist development by way of grants and through EU funding. Community groups north and south of the Border are meeting to discuss how local areas can be improved and historical buildings preserved.  In the past bogs were used for commercial purposes, but such work spoils an area.</P>
    <P>There is great potential for bringing communities together north and south of the Border.  Dungannon District <Col N="329" /> Council and Monaghan Urban District Council have held a number of joint meetings and the staff of both councils have met.  Such meetings are an example of how links between North and South can be maintained by community groups who can promote and improve our heritage.  People who have lived North and South of the Border have different allegiances, but they can be brought together in community groups to work on commercial and historical ventures.  The new Heritage Council will have a role to play in that regard.</P>
    <P>Monaghan Museum Committee is possibly one of the best groups involved in historical and heritage projects.  It has won many national and international awards.  I understand the Minister will introduce separate legislation to deal with museums.  Museums played a major role in the past by encouraging the preservation of buildings, artefacts and so on.</P>
    <P>There are other sites in Monaghan town that need to be improved, for example, the Church of Ireland owns St. Patrick's Church in the centre of the town but its local community does not have a great deal of money for such projects.  It spent £150,000 recently upgrading and improving the church's interior, but much work remains to be done.  Its railings need to be replaced and the spirals need repointing, water is seeping through and damaging the inside of the church.  I hope the Heritage Council can assist such communities who are in dire need of support.  Their heritage and buildings are extremely important to their local areas and they would appreciate any assistance.</P>
    <P>The council's remit will cover much more than buildings, it will cover wildlife, vegetation and so on.  I welcome that as there is a danger of some species of wildlife disappearing.  The council's work must be done in conjunction with local communities.  The Erne catchment has attained greater importance by the opening of the Ballinamore-Ballycon-nell Canal.  There is now great tourism potential in the area.  However, there is <Col N="330" /> an accumulation of silt at some bridges causing great damage to farmland, roads and private property.  The Heritage Council, local groups and public bodies should work in harmony with people in the commercial field to ensure the two can work together.  While I would not suggest that the Erne catchment should be a source of employment for former employees of the drainage programme set up by the Office of Public Works, it is important that some minor cleaning up works are carried out to maintain the livelihoods of people in that area and to allow councils in Monaghan and elsewhere to maintain their road structures.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker referred to the delays in building road bridges linking North and South, a matter dear to my heart.  The local people have requested that those bridges be rebuilt to their former glory, in other words cut stone bridges, but that would take some time and a great deal of money.  If we are serious about retaining our heritage, we must allow time for such work to be carried out.  If we want a fast fix we can build bridges very quickly, but if we want the work done properly it will take longer.</P>
    <P>By encouraging the restructuring and refurbishment of old buildings the Heritage Council can create employment. This would take time and money, but it would give much needed employment and improve tourism potential.  Many emigrants like to visit historic sites and buildings and they want them preserved.  The maintenace of old graveyards is important and the council can also play a role in that regard.</P>
    <P>Cavan-Monaghan was a flax growing area and many of the old mills and idle water-powered wheels can still be seen in the area.  While it would not be feasible to preserve all of them, some should be preserved so that people can realise, for instance, the employment provided by that industry for hundreds of people in difficult times.  Our agricultural heritage is also very important and must be preserved.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing this important Bill. Since his party and mine formed the previous Government and the area of arts, culture and our heritage was given full ministerial prominence at the Cabinet table, the Minister has given this area a national profile and elevated its importance to the position it warrants. Our party Leader, Deputy Ahern, has given my colleague, Deputy de Valera, Front Bench responsibility for this important area and, on behalf of my party, I wish her well in her task.</P>
      <P>This is an important Bill in that it brings together a diverse range of areas. The Heritage Council's work will embrace areas of great importance and rich merit in its protection and promotion of our heritage.  We had examples this morning from Deputies Costello, de Valera and Crawford of the wide range of areas the Bill will cover. Deputy Costello referred to the Smithfield horse fair and the historic aspects of inner city Dublin, Deputy de Valera referred to the richness of our heritage on the west coast and Deputy Crawford spoke about the mountain region in Monaghan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>The council will have responsibility for a wide range of areas, namely, archaeology, architecture, flora, fauna, landscape, heritage, gardens and inland waterways.  It reaches into the veins of virtually every corner of our county.  In the last decade, and particularly <Col N="332" /> since the Minister took responsibility for this area and raised its profile, the latent interest in the subject within communities has been brought to a focal point of interest.  All communities are interested in ensuring that our heritage is preserved, maintained and upgraded.</P>
      <P>One of the major tasks with which the Heritage Council will be charged is linking the urban and rural historical aspects of our society.  There is the question of the preservation of historic buildings in inner city areas.  There are also the traditional industrial complexes on which some excellent work has been done by the Guinness Company, at the CIE works at Inchicore and at Hillsmill in Lucan.  Some traditional rich industrial history which was so much part of our past needs to be preserved and maintained in order that the younger generation can have an understanding of what life was like in the past.</P>
      <P>A forerunner of the importance of heritage within the European Union was the recognition of the European Convention for the Protection of Historic Buildings which was signed in Granada in 1985.  One has only to look across the borders of Europe, to central or eastern Europe, to see the destruction and the damage caused to historic areas such as Warsaw, Budapest and Prague which are now open to the free world.  These will be the major tourist attractions that will complete with Ireland in the international tourism arena.  I read recently that 80 million people visited Prague last year.  That surpassed the number who visited Paris. There is a tremendous awareness among people anxious to delve into the past and visit places with such historic and rich heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The city of Dublin which celebrated its millennium some years ago was a major talking point throughout the world for those interested in history and heritage.  However, I agree with the Minister that from a community point of view it should not just be a tourist driven agenda that raises our concerns. There is a much broader community <Col N="333" /> interest to preserve what is best and to enhance those facilities for our tourists. This subject means different things to different people.  To some it means art, to others traditional culture &mdash; music and language &mdash; and yet to others, historic monuments, architectural preservation, the waterways and so on.  The subject has a wide range of community appeal and interest.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the question of the waterways and to recognise, as I have done in the past, the excellent pioneering work the Minister has done in regard to the Royal and Grand Canals, the excellent corridor policy of the potential for large urban areas and the excellent work done by FÁS in reinstating many of the gates on the canals.  An issue near and dear to my heart is the Liffey Valley.  Recently we discussed with the Minister how this could be made a living amenity within a large urban area.  I am pleased that in November 1984 I proposed that a special amenity area order be placed on the Liffey Valley.  At that time there was not much knowledge about what that meant.  I asked a colleague of the Minister, then Councillor Michael Gannon, to second the motion for whom I had to clarify my intentions and ideas on the matter.  We both reside in and represent the Lucan area.  The Liffey Valley is an important facility in that community.  I was pleased that some years later the former Minister for the Environment, now Commissioner Flynn, signed that special amenity area order.  To date it is the only such amenity order adopted here.  In co-operation with the Minister I hope that facility will become a living linear park with all the wonderful flora, fauna, rockface, waterfalls and the excellent facilities which Pete St. John described so well in the song, &ldquo;Where the strawberry beds sweep down to the Liffey&rdquo;.  It is a magnificent facility which needs to be protected.</P>
    <P>In the early 1980s when the environment debate was not as high on people's agenda as it is today we took that decision at local authority level.  The excellent work done by the parks and <Col N="334" /> planning departments at that time in carrying out a comprehensive study of the Liffey Valley to justify the then Minister accepting the complex issue of signing a special amenity area order is a forerunner to what can be achieved in local communities where some historical facilities and excellent amenities need protection.  I have no doubt the Heritage Council in co-operation with the Liffey management committee, set up by the local authorities, will see that project as a means of making a 300 acre linear Liffey Valley park available not only to the one million people of Dublin but as a national and tourist facility.  The waterways which will play an important role for the Heritage Council bring rich rewards quickly for a limited outlay. They provide communities with fishing facilities, walkways and so on.  The whole recreational passive amenity potential of the waterways can be worked on diligently.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of the work of the Heritage Council include wildlife. Recently I read that the corncrake is under threat.  Modern farming has a major impact on wildlife.  There is a major interface between the workings of the Heritage Council and the farming community to synchronise the potential for both sectors to live happily together. There are excellent facilities on the west coast and in the Sloblands of Wexford for the protection of wildlife.</P>
    <P>The new Heritage Council, particularly the policy heritage unit to which the Minister referred, will be welcomed. An archaeologist, an architectural historian and an ecologist will be specifically charged with the task of ensuring that all these aspects of our heritage are adequately protected.</P>
    <P>Within our communities there are many voluntary bodies such as community councils, residents' associations and other groups who perhaps could co-operate with post primary schools with a view to submitting an action plan on art, heritage and culture in their communities.  Perhaps a <i>pro forma</i> blueprint document could be provided by the Heritage Council to those communities <Col N="335" /> and they would then return their action plans to that body.  Over a period of years, with the limited funds available, the facilities in the area of art, culture and heritage could be provided.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy de Valera, referred to the allocation of £2.5 million which will be spread over two calendar years.  It appears there is an allocation of £1.5 million for 1994 and I hope that is not a downgrading of the figure.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify that matter.</P>
    <P>The Heritage Council will have a very important and dynamic role in future. This whole area is of tremendous interest to virtually every member of the community.  The Heritage Council will have an intriguing challenge in protecting our heritage and I look forward to its early setting up.  I hope it will be given a realistic budget and a good level of staffing to embark on its important work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a short contribution and I will be direct.  I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on it.  Over the years I have not always congratulated him but I do so unreservedly on this Bill which gives statutory effect to the Heritage Council established in 1988.  As Deputy Lawlor said, this Bill deals not just with one aspect of Irish society, it is a recognition of our historical past down the centuries, and I think it will be accepted and welcomed by almost everybody in the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A matter of concern to me relates to listed buildings.  Much work has been done in recent years in identifying buildings worthy of listing but there is a lack of grant facilities to people who cannot afford to maintain them.  It is all right for local authorities to have the resources to maintain listed buildings but it is unfair to expect people with diminishing incomes to maintain them. Will the Minister, perhaps on Committee Stage, consider the possibility of providing worthwhile grants to enable <Col N="336" /> people in those circumstance to maintain noteworthy buildings, of which there are hundreds in every county?  It is always sad to see castles in a state of decline.  There are many examples of castles that have weathered the storms of centuries and are derelict.  While the Office of Public Works has done good work in this area there is need for greater preservation of these buildings.</P>
    <P>I endorse what Deputy Lawlor said in that I hope meaningful funding will be provided for the Heritage Council.  It should not just be a talking shop but should be provided with the wherewithal to restore old buildings, castles, churches and so on, to a proper state. With the peace process in the North, I hope that in the next ten or 20 years there will be a steady influx of visitors to this country, not only from Europe and America but also from the North &mdash; an astonishing number of the Unionist people have never set foot in this part of the country.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the <i>Lusitania.</i> In the daily papers recently there has been a lot of conjecture about that tragic event. That vessel has been submerged off the Cork coast since 1915, with little or no attempt made by this country to salvage it.  I always tend to support the underdog, I have a sneaking regard for the saying &ldquo;finders keepers, losers weepers&rdquo;, and if private individuals or companies were to engage in a salvage operation they should be given some share of the spoils &mdash; I am sure the Minister will disagree with me on that.</P>
    <P>I wish to be parochial, as we all are from time to time, and refer to my own county.  There is tremendous scope for the development of the Heritage Council.  I come from a Border area, an area that is rich in song and story and the home of Cuchulainn and the Táin Bó Cualnge.  When looking recently at a picture of Queen Meadhbh who came from Connacht, from where the Minister also comes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister should provide funds to clearly define the Táin Bó Cualnge trail in County Louth which meanders over the Cooley Mountains.  Perhaps at some future date he will open that laudable venture.</P>
      <P>The Heritage Council should provide meaningful help for the restoration of Slane Castle, County Meath, which was recently horrendously damaged by fire. The State cannot, while this castle is in private hands, in the hands, possibly, of my successor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish him well.  All the philanthropists are on the Fianna Fáil benches.  I am sure the Minister will agree that that beautiful and historic castle should be preserved for the benefit of the nation and its owner.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister encourage the Heritage Council to look at the historic town of Drogheda which was ransacked by Cromwell?  I commend the Office of Public Works on the work it carried out on the round tower in the Monaster-boice area which is probably unequalled anywhere else.  The Celtic high crosses have also been very well preserved.  All of us could talk at length about the areas of historical interest in our counties and the objective of the council will be to look at every county, which is as it should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very opportune Bill. However, it is illogical to ensure protection for wildlife while allowing the horrible sports of hare coursing and fox hunting to continue.  We should not be so hypocritical as to designate areas for wildlife and at the same time allow people to engage in sports which allow timid animals to be torn asunder by dogs.  We live in a more enlightened age and I hope the Minister will provide some protection for timid creatures <Col N="338" /> which may be torn to pieces under the guise of sport.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this long overdue Bill.  Up to now heritage issues have been subjected to fragmented policies and responsibility for heritage has been divided among many Government Departments.  On many occasions there were very poor lines of communication between the bodies charged with responsibility for the preservation and conservation of our heritage.  The Minister has very good vision and I am sure he will give the council the broadest possible remit.</P>
      <P>I regret that the National Museum does not fall within the remit of the council.  Given our experience of fragmented heritage policy, we should integrate all heritage matters and responsibility for its preservation and conservation in the most comprehensive way possible.  The National Museum is the repository of most of the artefacts which have been found over the centuries.  The Egyptology collection in the museum is amazing, yet it is not on display to the public.  We should ensure that the National Museum is seen as an integral part of the national heritage and that it comes within the remit of the National Heritage Council.</P>
      <P>We should seek to adopt the integrated approach adopted in Scandinavian countries, particularly Sweden.  The disorganisation caused by fragmented policy is well illustrated by a project in Dublin under which apparently Dublin Tourism has been allocated £5.7 million to construct a Viking exhibition in the old church of St. Michael and St. John in Essex Quay.  Very few conservationists, of whom I am one, agree with this and I am glad to note that the Director of the National Museum has dissociated himself from this project. The sum of £5.7 million represents one-third of the total amount made available last year by the Government for the preservation of national monuments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This project will give a theatrical presentation of Viking Dublin.  On 3 January last <i>The Irish Times</i> journalist, <Col N="339" /> Frank McDonald, reported that the work on the church involves stripping all the interior plaster, removing the ornate timber-fronted gallery and columns supporting it as well as the organ loft and the vaults, the three altars and portions of the rare regency gothic ceiling.  This should not be allowed to happen.</P>
    <P>If we want a Viking museum in Dublin it should be located in Collins Barracks situated in Viking Dublin.  This EU funding could not have been obtained without the involvement of a Government Department.  A substantial amount of money has been allocated to Dublin Tourism for this project.  The National Museum is named as a partner but it has dissociated itself from it.  The National Museum is named as a partner but it has dissociated itself from it.  The project appears to have little support and to be a commercial venture which will present Viking Dublin in, as another Deputy described it, a blancmange fashion in a gutted church which was the original site of the Smoke Alley Theatre before it became a whiskey store and during the earlier part of the century was one of the first preEmancipation Gothic-type churches in Dublin.</P>
    <P>This is the type of issue which needs to be addressed by the Heritage Council, but unfortunately it will not be in place to look at this project.  We should not allow this type of development again and I advise the Minister to include all aspects of the spending of EU funding in the remit of the council. During the debate on the National Monuments Act I quoted from a section of the Maastricht Treaty which promises funding for the preservation of areas of European culture in member states. Naturally the Viking heritage of Dublin falls into that category.  It is very regrettable that this funding has been allocated to such a garish and inappropriate project.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the designation of heritage sites, that is boglands, raised bogs, wildlife habitats, etc.  I am delighted that at last we are seeing some of the funds of this policy in operation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> The section of the Office of Public Works responsible for the designation of heritage areas has designated sites in at least 22 counties.  I understand four counties remain, Cork, Kerry, Monaghan and Donegal.</P>
    <P>I live quite close to such an area which was previously designated as an area of international scientific significance.  Under its new title it is now a designated heritage area.  We should be sensitive about our approach to this issue.  Some aspects of it will become controversial in the future and it is timely that we should anticipate disputes and controversies that may arise. Publication of lists of heritage areas has been withdrawn in 12 counties on legal advice until there are amendments to the Wildlife Act, 1976.  The advice is that as there is no proper appeals system it might not be proper to publish the lists as representing legal documents.</P>
    <P>Many landowners might not be pleased to be notified that a portion of their land is being enclosed as a heritage area.  On the appeals system.  I understand that in the case of a person who is unhappy, for economic reasons, about the designation of a portion of land they own or occupy, he or she can only appeal on scientific grounds.  That will have to be expanded to include, in certain circumstances, economic grounds because while many landowners may be using these lands for marginal use, they regard them as part of their essential economic assets.  If these portions of land are declared heritage areas, their current use is prohibited.  In other words, the trespass of conventional agriculture or afforestation will not be allowed.</P>
    <P>As the Minister will know, in recent years afforestation has been identified as the appropriate use for much of what we once described as our wastelands. We did not recognise then that our wastelands were of great heritage and scientific interest.  Nevertheless, it is naturally well rooted in the mind of a landowner or an occupier that all land has some economic potential.  When we <Col N="341" /> finally publish details of an appeals system under which a landowner or an occupier may appeal, they should include a provision for appealing on economic grounds.  The Minister should take note of that because when the necessary legislation is passed by this House, it will be noted by interested parties and be the subject of great controversy.  That is a controversy we should try to avoid.</P>
    <P>The National Heritage Council should play a responsible role in relation to national monuments.  This has been a pet subject of mine for many years because I was spokesperson for my party on the Office of Public Works. I am interested in that area.  There are many monuments, old churches, ruins of old monasteries and so on.  There is not any townland or parish in the country that does not have a monument of historical or archaeological significance.</P>
    <P>It is estimated there are approximately 150,000 sites of archaeological interest throughout the country.  Unfortunately, only about 700 are designated as national monuments.  Those monuments receive the full protection of the law at present.  I understand that at present, the national monuments section of the Office of Public Works is only carrying out conservation and preservation works on approximately 200 of the 700 designated as national monuments.  That is not very satisfactory when one considers the number of such monuments.</P>
    <P>I live within a few metres of a 13th century abbey ruin.  I Iobbied various agencies in an effort to obtain some funding which would allow us to carry out conservation work on it.  I am referring to Cloonshanville Abbey, a 13th century ruin with a central tower in quite good condition.  Much of the original stonework and the original motif remains intact.  The recent storms, however, blew away a portion of the top of that tower and it also destroyed one stone with a motif and certain other dressed stones.  I have not received any response to this from the national <Col N="342" /> monuments branch of the Office of Public Works because there is simply no money to deal with it.  The Office of Public Works seems unable to detach itself from the monuments it is working on to carry out urgent remedial work on a significant monument damaged by the elements.  It is unfortunate that a more flexible approach is not adopted.  I appeal to the Minister, when he is giving the remit to the National Heritage Council, to ensure that such damage by the elements &mdash; I am sure last week's storms damaged other monuments &mdash; is repaired.  I hope the National Heritage Council will have the power to insist on such work being done.</P>
    <P>I realise all of this will require money. I examined the Estimates for the public service in recent years on the amounts of money spent each year under the heading of National Monuments.  In the 1994 Estimates &mdash; I do not yet have the 1995 Estimates &mdash; the amount of money spent was £17,645,000 but in 1993 the figure was £19,499,000.  That represents a 10 per cent decrease in the 1994 figure but there may be a special reason for that; perhaps a particular project cost more money in 1993.  It is obvious that the amount of money provided is not addressing the problem.  I am not convinced that it is all well spent or well focused.  I realise most of it is spent on staff salaries, on the maintenance of certain depots throughout the country, on work on a number of designated monuments and where the national monuments branch undertake certain restoration or conservation projects that may continue for years.</P>
    <P>I wonder if we are getting good value for that money because any results manifest to the public are few and far between.  If one were to ask what major conservation work was done last year with the £17.5 million one would probably see it all in one day and might conclude that we did not get value for it.  I do not wish to criticise Departments, but I presume that the national monuments branch is operating to procedures that have not been changed in 50 years. That needs to be seriously looked at and <Col N="343" /> perhaps the Minister would ask the incoming Heritage Council to examine the cost effectiveness of Government spending on national monuments.  Contrast £17.5 million spent around the country with £5.7 million from EU funding for a single project in Dublin.  Very few people in the business of historical conservation would agree with that.  The Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht or the Department of Finance should have first say over where funding of that kind from the EU should be spent.  If that were done there would be greater accountability.</P>
    <P>Within the heritage areas there are categories described as of international scientific interest, national scientific interest and local scientific interest. When these areas are designated, what plans are in hand to signpost and protect them?  Will there be enough wardens to ensure there is no encroachment on these areas?  There are national monuments throughout the country protected by law but there is no effective protection because there is nobody to protect them.  I live near one of the most significant earthwork monuments in the country, the Cruchann complex, which is set in farmland.  We are lucky that the farmers on whose land they are sited are conscious of the need for conservation and that the intensity of grazing they are subjected to is not damaging.  However, there are many areas where the reverse happens and where there is no protection, where it is an offence under the law to damage them but where the law does nothing to protect them because it does not put in place an inspectorate consisting of wardens etc., to ensure they are properly protected.</P>
    <P>There is no point in designating something like 450,000 hectares comprising 1,300 sites as significant areas from a heritage point of view if we do not provide protection for them.  I appeal to the Minister, as soon as the work of designation and setting up legal ownership in State hands is done, to protect these areas.  We have a very bad record of protecting old monastic sites many of <Col N="344" /> which have had artefacts taken away from them.  How many fieldworks in this country have been ploughed away? Earthworks going back to the Bronze Age, about the earliest we have, have been destroyed by farming, and this has taken place over hundreds of years. However, we are more conscious of these things nowadays.  We must think about the long term and ensure that the Heritage Council has a role in protecting areas designated as heritage areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill which provides for the replacement of the existing National Heritage Council with the statutory body to be called the Heritage Council.  I pay tribute to the Minister's commitment and that of everybody involved in putting together this complex and important legislation which focuses attention on something dear to the hearts of us all.  South Tipperary, which elects me to the House, is a place I am proud of and, although the Minister does not want to hear a list of all the monuments in my constituency, it is important to mention some in this short contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The council will replace the Wildlife Advisory Council and the Historic Monuments Council and establish standing committees on wildlife and archaeology.  The duties of the council are to propose policies and priorities in relation to the physical heritage of which we are so proud.  One aspect of the duties of the council which is particularly important is the promotion of interest in our physical heritage with related responsibility for providing information about noteworthy features of our natural environment.  Many people take these features for granted and there is a need to bring them to their attention.  In that regard I want to pay special tribute to Liam Ó Murchú's television programme, filmed by RTE and entitled &ldquo;Ireland's Rich and Rare Land&rdquo;.  It highlighted the fact that Ireland is rich in treasures and that people are prepared to come here on <Col N="345" /> holidays just for the privilege of standing on soil close to these monuments and of seeing them at first hand.</P>
    <P>We have a wealth of treasure and it is appropriate that a Minister who has a tremendous interest in this field should legislate to heighten awareness and give responsibility to various agencies, including local authorities.  It makes me proud to be a member of a local authorities when it is envisaged that State agencies and particularly local authorities will co-operate in this area.  The county development officers have identified in the county development plans areas of heritage which are to remain untouched by development regardless of its desirability.  I am delighted the Minister has recognised the importance of local authorities in providing the first level of recognition of our heritage.  It is important that the Bill provides also that buildings owned by the local authority or other State agencies can be designated by the Minister on the advice of the Heritage Council as heritage buildings.  Under the Bill there are protective measures for land and other buildings adjoining heritage buildings and this is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>We will deal later with the Occupiers' Liability Bill, 1994.  Deputy de Valera in her contribution spelled out how the owners and occupiers of lands on which there are historic buildings were generally willing to allow people access to photograph monuments at considerable risk from people conscious of their rights in the event of injury and who would make claims, spurious or otherwise.  I am glad that the Occupiers' Liabiility Bill will address this.  Whereas the national monument may be on private property, it belongs to the State and legislation that identifies that but protects the rightful landowner is essential. I have no doubt that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht will have had consultations with his colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.</P>
    <P>My constituency in Tipperary is rich in national monuments.  One has to visit the Rock of Cashel to appreciate the <Col N="346" /> history of the area.  It has been refurbished at colossal expense by the Office of Public Works.  I had the privilege of being married at the Rock of Cashel with the permission of the Office of Public Works and the Catholic Church so it has a personal significance.  To choose to get married on 3 January at the Rock of Cashel indicates a level of courage which can only be attributed to politicians.  Things have worked out well since &mdash; I am still here and the Rock of Cashel is still standing.</P>
    <P>In my constituency we have also the wonderful Cahir Castle and Cahir Abbey &mdash; which still has the evidence of Cromwell's assault with shells embedded in the walls &mdash; the West Gate in Clonmel, Ormond Castle in Carrick-onSuir and the Swiss Cottage which the President visited.  There are enterprene-urs in America prepared to help us rebuild the Swiss Cottage.</P>
    <P>We have discussed what urban renewal has done for many areas and I know that in Clonmel the urban renewal scheme has been dramatically successful and a recent extension of that scheme was very important.  However, there are always difficulties with tax incentives to do something.  In Clonmel, 99.9 per cent of the people managed to carry out their plans within the period of the scheme and the refurbishments have transformed the town of Clonmel.  There is a wonderful old mill in the centre which nobody has yet refurbished.  It is probably not very important historically but it now sticks out like a sore thumb in the middle of the urban renewal area. Somebody has applied for planning permission to convert the old mill and use it as a transport museum to commemorate Clonmel's link with Bianconi, the instigator of public transport.  Planning permission has been received for this proposed development but it is not within the time frame of the urban renewal scheme so I hope the Minister will use his good office to make representations about this to the Department of Finance.  Where old buildings cannot be demolished without creating consternation but can be renewed and in this <Col N="347" /> case used to commemorate someone such as Bianconi it can become a tourist attraction and help to generate activity in an area.  The Minister kindly notified me last night of his intention to visit Clonmel to open the Gaelscoil in March and not alone will I show him the Rock of Cashel but also this mill.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given a commitment to ratify the European Convention for the protection of archaeological heritage signed in Granada in 1985, the Department is losing no opportunity to meet the requirements of the European body.  The Council of Europe has a body specifically interested in archaeological monuments and there is probably assistance by way of grants and funding available to us to ensure that our heritage is not lost through decay.  As Deputy Connor says, it costs money to preserve our monuments, but it is a tremendous investment for the future.</P>
    <P>There is a reference in the Bill to the abolition of the Wildlife Advisory Council and I take this opportunity to commend the work of the National Association of Game Councils who have committed themselves to the preservation of species of birds and wildlife. The PRO of that organisation is quite involved in South Tipperary and is in constant communication with the Minister and me.  Flora and fauna are part of our heritage and we should not allow widespread destruction of certain species of birds because Italians are prepared to pay money to holiday in Ireland and shoot indiscriminately at everything, including the occasional landowners who may be obstructive.</P>
    <P>We have an obligation to consult the expertise available from bodies such as this Association of Game Councils and perhaps the Minister would consider this when making appointments to this new council.  I am delighted to see that there will be gender balance, but that is to be expected from the Minister.  I look forward to expert representation on the Heritage Council and I hope the views I have expressed will assist the Minister <Col N="348" /> in choosing the best people to assist us in this area.  I am delighted that there was such a welcome for the Bill in the Seanad and in the debate so far in this House.  It is an indication of our commitment to this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I welcome the opportunity to contribute and put on record a number of points which I hope the Minister will take into account.  When I looked through my file I saw that my last notes in preparation for speaking were made on 2 November.  It seems a lifetime ago now.</P>
      <P>The Bill aims to set up the Heritage Councils on a statutory basis.  That and as Deputy Ferris said, the fact that the Bill received such widespread support in the Seanad and here indicates how we have come to appreciate our heritage for itself and not just as something to be trotted out between April and October.</P>
      <P>The initial contribution I intended to make referred to the fact that the Heritage Council would not have power to hold land or buildings.  I felt that was a defect and I am glad that in the Government's programme it is stated that on Committee Stage amendments will be made to the Bill:</P>
      <P>stating that the policy functions of the Commissioners of Public Works under legislation relating to the heritage, shall be performed by them subject to the general directions in writing of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht;</P>
      <P>enabling the Minister to set priorities and targets for the Commissioner; and</P>
      <P>requiring the Commissioners to provide relevant information:</P>
      <P>enabling the Heritage Council to own land and buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When introduced that will be a good addition to the Bill.  However, much thought and effort will have to be put into working out the relationship between the Heritage Council, the Office of Public Works and the Department.  The fact that the Heritage Council will be on a statutory basis gives the <Col N="349" /> Department and the Minister freedom to manoeuvre and make changes.  I would not like those interested in history and heritage to be confused, particularly in areas where there are monuments and other, as one of my professors used to say, artefacts, sociofacts or mentafacts associated with our heritage.</P>
    <P>Under the Programme for Government the role and functions of the Office of Public Works will be closely examined and reassigned where necessary.  The Minister is considering setting up an inland waterways authority, an area in which the Office of Public Works has done a lot of work.  The Heritage Council will work in the heritage area and the wildlife functions have already been transferred to the Minister.  I hope that process will not take too long to complete.  At the end of it, there will be a clear structure of responsibility and authority for the various areas of heritage and those interested in heritage will know with whom they should deal.  This is also important in the area of heritage tourism.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, heritage is not just something for tourists, nevertheless heritage tourism is important.  In the report commissioned by Bord Fáilte a number of years ago from Ventures consultancy on the subject, the potential for the development of heritage tourism was clearly outlined and a number of themes suggested &mdash; not to turn the country into a theme park but to offer a range of areas of interest which might correspond to the hobbies and interests of tourists and natives alike.</P>
    <P>In my town, Tullamore, a local established historical and archaeological society is very anxious to develop a heritage centre which would show visitors the industrial heritage of the town which began with the extension of the Grand Canal from Dublin which led to the development of the distillery and associated industries and crafts.  The public are confused about whom to talk to. Under the last programme for Structural Funds, Bord Fáilte had a clear <Col N="350" /> responsibility there.  Now that the profile of the Department has increased, people feel they should talk to the Department.  That is an example of where changes being made should be communicated clearly to the public so that if local groups are interested in participating in the development and exhibition of the heritage in their area they know to whom to turn to for advice and assistance.</P>
    <P>Another area which is important to keep in mind is the quality of service the Heritage Council will offer the public. When the council was on a non-statutory basis the level of service was not always the highest.  I appreciate that it operated under severe constraints, not least among which was its small number of staff.  The Minister will be aware of a particular instance in my county where an application was made to the council for assistance but very little was received in return.  That is the worst of all possible responses.  I would like to think that the statutory council will operate the highest level of service, have an open relationship with the public and offer assistance promptly to groups or individuals who communicate with it.  Where it may suggest that expert opinion be brought in to comment on a development, it must always be realised that the opinion of an expert who may work in a secluded office in Dublin, no matter how valuable it is, must always be considered with the initiative and interest of the local group who are trying to develop something in their area on a shoestring budget.  What is desirable in the ideal sense from the experts' point of view may not always be practical from the point of view of the local group or organisation.</P>
    <P>We should take a practical approach to this.  There could be cases where a building could be allowed fall into disrepair because a group could not restore it to the level recommended by the expert.  We must realise that many of these groups work under very difficult conditions and, if they do not do something to protect and enhance the heritage <Col N="351" /> of their areas, some buildings or heritage sites may be lost.</P>
    <P>I should like some elaboration of section 11 which deals with co-operation, assistance and advice and includes payments of money on such terms and conditions as the council may decide.  Perhaps the Minister would give us some idea of how this might work in practice.  The Heritage Council should not be perceived merely as another grant-giving body.  The provisions under which financial and other assistance may be offered should be clearly specified.</P>
    <P>There have been many references to the built heritage, monuments and buildings.  I should like to think the Heritage Council will take a very broad view of our heritage.  A professor, some years ago when I studied cultural geography, divided culture and its remnants into artefacts, sociofacts and mentafacts, demonstrating that heritage encompasses a very wide area, not merely the buildings and monuments located in our respective local areas.  It comprises records of people's lived experiences which are very important also.  Indeed there has been a great nationwide interest in recent years in historical, archaeological and genealogical research, which elements of our heritage merit in-depth consideration by the Heritage Council.  It has to be acknowledged that many projects have been undertaken with the support of local historical and archaeological societies and organisations, in many cases, supplemented by help from local authorities and bodies such as FÁS.  In my local area I can instance a number of exhibitions, publications and other documents produced by young people who participated in courses run by FÁS supported by the local authority.  These wider elements of our heritage must be supported and given due regard in the activities of the Heritage Council.</P>
    <P>Language and languages is another feature of our culture which the Heritage Council should support but not by becoming another Bord na Gaeilge. <Col N="352" /> Various languages have been important to our national heritage and, should be taken into consideration in the activities of the Heritage Council.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of our heritage of which the Heritage Council should take account is what is now described as the Irish diaspora.  As we prepare for the commemoration of the Famine we are reminded of the interaction and association of our people here with Irish people in other parts of the world, a subject on which the President will address the House next week.  The Heritage Council should forge strong links with Irish people and organisations abroad as well with those at home.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take my points on board and I look forward to development of the heritage area once the council has been established and when the Minister's Department begins to implement the aims and objectives set out for it under both the previous and current programmes for Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá mé that a bheith buíoch do na Teachtaí as an mbealach a d'fháiltigh said roimh an mBille seo agus go h-áirithe as an mbealach cúirtéiseach, cúramach, foirfeach a cuireadh chuige sin.</P>
      <P>It is clear that no matter what reservations Members may express about the provisions of this Bill, there is a general, genuine interest in it.  I have been most impressed by the amount of thought and research that has gone into their contributions.  It is not unfair to say that there is a wide, committed consensus on our heritage on all sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in my introductory remarks, the establishment of the Heritage Council, as a statutory corporation, must be viewed within the context of an overall strategy in the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  Policy formulation within my Department will be assisted by a group of corporate bodies with specialist membership who, in addition to providing advice, will carry out specified executive functions <Col N="353" /> beyond the ambit of existing institutions.  The establishment of these other institutions which will enjoy a degree of responsible autonomy is a very important development.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by Deputy Pat Gallagher in his long and thoughtful speech, that it is very important that the public understands all of these relationships so that people know exactly who is responsible for what and what is the relationship of one part of the system with another.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets up one of the bodies to which I have referred, An Chomhairle Oidhreachta, &ldquo;oidhreachta&rdquo;, being a word I like.  In answering the comments of Members who have contributed to this debate, I might make the point that &ldquo;oidhreachta&rdquo; in the Irish language has a meaning far wider in its resonance than its English equivalent &ldquo;heritage&rdquo;. To be as economical as I can in responding to Members' points, and also to impart the maximum amount of information, which I am anxious to do, I should say there will be the Department and then certain bodies, with statutory dependence, which will have a degree of autonomy, which is very important.</P>
    <P>This Bill is part of a package of legislation being prepared by my Department.  Before the summer recess this House passed a very important Bill to amend the National Monuments Act. My Department is working on other proposals to amend the Wildlife Act and to provide new legislation for the National Museum, National Library and parks.  I invite Members to take this corpus of legislation together as the legislative heritage package which will enable us to be responsible and have an orderly relationship with heritage preservation institutions.  I assure Members that it is also my intention that we will not delay in signing any convention or fulfilling any international obligations in matters of heritage and wildlife and I am making preparations to that end. With the enactment of this corpus of legislation, of which this Bill is one component, we shall have provided a sound, statutory basis to protect our heritage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="354" /> In the course of the debate Deputies Creed and Quill referred to the plethora of heritage centres built around the country and to the potential problems if some of these do not prove to be viable operations.  I share some of their fears in this respect.  Indeed, the existing National Heritage Council has been very conscious of this danger also.  I note that it has not provided funds for such ventures where a viable future has not been reasonably assured.</P>
    <P>At the same time I want to be sympathetic.  Now that I am a member of a second coalition Government I favour even more transparency in Government.  One of the difficulties I have experienced in this ministry of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, with general responsibility for heritage, is the number of dormant areas which has suddenly been stirred into life.  That is certainly true in arts and indeed right across the cultural area.</P>
    <P>While people have often not planned work in the best way I am very sympathetic that at least they have tried.  It is often not their fault that work was not planned properly.  We must try in a planned environment to assist such people to do work in a policy directed way that makes sense for them and us in the long term.  There has been an explosion of interest in this area. Deputies who speak thoughtfully here about heritage are also representing their constituents.  It is wonderful that the present generation of young people are more conscious about this area and that is welcome.  For someone like me that means there will be an explosion in demand, everyone will want everything yesterday.  We are trying at present to put a statutory regime in place that will be adequate, easily understood and efficient in delivery of the available resources.</P>
    <P>Deputy Creed suggested that this Bill should be extended to include the National Museum and the National Library.  The new council will have a broad remit which will cover the general range of subjects concerning those two institutions.  For instance, it will have a <Col N="355" /> role in relation to archaeology, the natural sciences and heritage objects which include books more than 25 years old.  However, it should be remembered that the council's main objective will be to propose policies.  It will not be a management body and it will be no more concerned with the management of the Museum and the Library than it will be with the management of, for instance, parks and inland waterways, I welcome the opportunity to explain that it will be concerned with policy in these areas. That is the distinction between this Bill and the Bill dealing with the Museum and the Library to which I referred.  The latter Bill will deal with the management of those two important national institutions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill mentioned the need to give greater protection to architectural heritage and I fully agree with her.  As I said in my speech, I am examining how this can best be done as this is a complex issue.  The National Monuments Acts and the planning Acts provide considerable safeguards and, in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, I will examine the areas where neither of these legislative codes is proving fully effective.  We must try to fill this void.  Already there have been preliminary discussions between officials of our respective Departments.</P>
    <P>However, we need to do more than just strengthen the statutory measures which is just one dimension; a change in public attitudes is also required.  I said in my opening speech that there has been a considerable shift in opinion towards the need to protect the architectural heritage and, perhaps, the existing Heritage Council has contributed to this.  I again pay tribute to the work of Lord Killanin and the members of that council, but more needs to be done.  For that reason, I have specifically provided in the Bill that the council shall, in particular, promote interest, knowledge and pride in and facilitate the appreciation and enjoyment of the national heritage.  That is included in the Bill to indicate the pro-active development <Col N="356" /> that is possible, not that people would say they were not sure whether they should be doing certain work.  It is explicitly stated that it is the intention of the legislation that the council be asked to promote our national heritage, be active and take the lead in doing that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill also referred in particular to railways.  I am pleased to tell her that the definition of &ldquo;works of architecture&rdquo; in the Bill includes structures which are of significant engineering quality so this will bring railways within the remit of the council.</P>
    <P>I would also like to clarify a matter raised by Deputy Quill in connection with the publication of the annual report.  In the normal course I would expect that the financial report will be included in the published annual report. However, the reality is that sometimes the auditing of accounts takes time for reasons outside the control of the body in question and I would not like to see the publication of the annual report delayed as a result.  The arrangements I have made in the Bill are (a) that the council must submit a report within six months of the ending of each year and that it be published and (b) that the audited accounts must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  I believe these arrangements provide appropriate and adequate safeguards for the public interests.</P>
    <P>I was impressed by Deputy Hugh Byrne's emphasis on the need to change attitudes towards conservation and for people to appreciate the diversity of their heritage.  Indeed, he brought me on a wide and diverse tour of the heritage in his constituency with which he was familiar.  Other Deputies made similar points and I made similar journeys with them.</P>
    <P>Section 6 sets out the functions of the council, states that the councils shall, in particular, promote interest, knowledge and pride in and facilitate the appreciation and enjoyment of our national heritage.  I regard this as one of the most important duties of the council.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne drew my attention to the need to protect our churches and I <Col N="357" /> am pleased to point out to him that under this Bill the council will be able to assist with both advice and finance in the preservation of churches of architectural merit.  Also, the existing council recently organised a seminar in Dublin Castle on the subject of ecclesiastical buildings and there was a very positive response from the church authorities.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Kenny, referred to the problem posed by seals for fishermen off the west coast.  The position is that seals are a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976 and it is an offence to injure them except under licence.  He also referred to the request made in the Seanad to have genealogical records brought within the aegis of this Bill.  As I promised, my officials met with members of the council of the Irish genealogical organisations and, before Committee Stage, I will consider the report of that meeting presented by my officials.  However, the amendments I made will ensure that genealogical records will come under the definition of &ldquo;heritage objects&rdquo; in the Bill and that is one sense in which they are covered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory was concerned that the Wildlife Standing Committee of the council would be weighted in favour of the field sports fraternity and Deputy Ferris was anxious that it would be weighted to take account of that fraternity.  I appreciate bodies of expertise who may wish to forward names for inclusion on the Heritage Council, but ultimately I must take responsibility for putting forward the names of people who have a balanced approach.  As other Deputies said, a mixture of expertise, commitment, and practicality and a sense of being able to transcend any one narrow concern for the general concern are the requirements I will be seeking in nominating members of the council.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gregory criticised the former wildlife advisory council for not publicising its activities.  Under the Bill, the Heritage Council will be required to publish an annual report not later than six months after the end of the relevant <Col N="358" /> year and such a report will, of course, cover all the activities of the council including those of the Wildlife Standing Committee.  In fairness to the outgoing non-statutory Heritage Council that became almost, in another form, the wildlife council, its position was unusual.  The future relationship in which the statutory Heritage Council will publish a report that will include the functions and workings of the committee is an open and transparent process.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Kitt referred to a difficulty which may arise when there is a doubt as to who owns the remains of an old church situated in a graveyard.  The county council may own the graveyard but may be unsure as to who owns the church.  I found that quite a poetic problem; it is a question that is asked in a different way in circles other than about property.  He asked if the Heritage Council could take over the ownership of, say, a monument.  Under an amendment which I will introduce on Committee Stage, the council will be entitled to acquire property but only in accordance with any directions given by me in consultation with the Minister for Finance to the council.  While I do not wish to anticipate those directions, I do not envisage the Heritage Council involving itself in the acquisition of monuments of this nature.  In regard to Deputy Gallagher's question, I will change the property owning functions of the council on Committee Stage by way of amendment and in accordance with the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne queried the procedure in section 10 which provides that in circumstances in which a public authority, contrary to the wishes of the Heritage Council and the Minister, wish to carry our works to a heritage buildings in its ownership, the Government could be asked to decide the issue.  It is useful to understand this mechanism.  Where there is a conflict between the requirements of the public authority and the desire to conserve &mdash; say, where the costs of meetings the Heritage Council's requirements would be enormous &mdash; the <Col N="359" /> authority should be given the opportunity of putting its case before Government for ultimate decision, but I hope this would be a very rare occurence. Deputy Browne also raised the question of fees which are provided for in section 23, but he misunderstands the position. If a person finds an artefact which may be of archaeological importance, he or she should report it to the National Museum who will investigate the matter.  There will be no cost to the person who reported the find, neither will there be a charge by the Heritage Council for advice given by it to persons or organisations.  That is as it should be.  Why should we do anything other than assist and promote responsibility?</P>
    <P>The provision in section 23 allows for an exceptional case where the council, because of the expertise at its disposal, undertakes a detailed project in a consultative capacity.  There may never be a need to avail of this provision, but it is wise to insert it in the legislation. Deputy Brendan Smith hoped the council would give due recognition to the role of local authorities and voluntary community groups.  I share this hope and introduced an amendment in the Seanad making it absolutely clear that the council will be free to support local authorities in their work in caring for our heritage.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a point made by many Deputies but stressed by Deputy de Valera, whom I congratulate on being appointed spokesperson in this area.  I look forward to working with her in advancing an area of mutual concern to us both.  Deputy Deasy referred to the many Departments involved in heritage matters and wondered if the functions would be amalgamated.  The Bill is not concerned with management, it is primarily concerned with policy formation.  While the Heritage Council will have a direct relationship with me as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, it will also provide advice on heritage matters to all Ministers.  In this way the council will play an important co-ordinating role.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="360" /> Deputy Killeen asked a question regarding the provision in section 12 to prohibit the council accepting a gift of land.  This provision was inserted as a consequence of the earlier decision outlining that the council would not be permitted to acquire or hold land.  I will introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to provide the council with the necessary powers to acquire and hold lands subject to any direction given to it by me, in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  I will also introduce a consequential amendment to section 12 to allow the council to accept gifts of lands on similar conditions.</P>
    <P>I join Deputy Killeen and others in acknowledging the debt we owe to landowners in counties Clare, Galway and elsewhere who have shown a genuine concern for the environment and archaeological features and who have ensured that much of our countryside remains relatively unspoiled.  My colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, will shortly introduce legislation on occupiers' liability.  Because of a lack of public consciousness and awareness in the past we lost some of our heritage. However, much of it has been retained because of the responsibility of people, often without assistance, and even when public awareness was not as developed as it is now.  There is now greater public awareness about our heritage but people on whose lands monuments and so on are found must be treated properly.</P>
    <P>There are two sets of rights involved in this regard.  There is a right in regard to possession but, equally, there is a right to one's heritage even if one does not own property or land.  It would be against the nature of this Republic if a person was distracted in gaining access to something which is part of our heritage.  We must respond sensitively but at the same time we must ensure that we do not allow foolish confrontation which would obstruct us in reaching an accommodation in respect of the management of our heritage, access to finds and our law.  This will be difficult to <Col N="361" /> achieve but possible if we approach it positively.  We must co-operate in an effort to solve problems that may arise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Killeen also referred to works at the Cliffs of Moher and said he would be interested to know whether An Comhairle Oidhreachta could adjudicate on such contentious issues.  While An Chomhairle will have an advisory role on many matters the only area where its role will approach that of adjudication will be in relation to heritage buildings owned by a public authority, as provided for in section 10 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes criticised the proposed composition of the council and alleged that it would be totally under the control of the Minister.  He had reservations about me in particular, but they were offered with good humour, and matters change.  I am changing the position whereby the National Heritage Council is a non-statutory body directly under the control of the Minister to that of a statutory body at arm's length from the Minister.  Through this and other legislation people will be aware of the philosophy I am following in the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, namely, that the Arts Council and others should operate with autonomy at arm's length from me and without interference in their daily work. My responsibility relates to the policy and provisions.  When Deputy Dukes comes to mature consideration on this he will agree that the proposed change is a good one and serves the principle of autonomy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of the work of An Chomhairle will be carried out by the four standing committees.  I will appoint only three members to each committee who will almost certainly make up a minority of those committees.  I neither sought nor would want any more influence on such specialist committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to section 10 and the question of Longford Courthouse, the Bill will provide a framework in which such <Col N="362" /> issues can be dealt with in the future but how is the problem to be resolved as it involves Departments, heritage issues and local authorities?  The procedure is that the local authority would be bound to consult the heritage council who would then present an objective assessment of the value of the property in question and enable the issue to be resolved.  That is the way such an issue will be dealt with when the legislation is enacted.</P>
    <P>I agree with the view of the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, about the need to present our history in an objective manner.  He made the point that presentation of heritage could either be tendentious or objective.  The essential purpose of interpretation is to open minds to new ideas, to provoke thought and to empower people to make their own discoveries.  I can think of no time when this was more important.  If we are to make progress we must accept there are not only different versions of different stories. The image we should have is of a tapestry with many colours.  We must realise that using portions of history to offer single tendentious versions is not constructive towards the best interests of our heritage being enjoyed or our future on this island.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sargent also referred to the role of the Heritage Council in planning and I have covered most of the points he raised.  I agree with him that the council should take note of the wider implications of developments and not consider buildings and sites in a narrow context.  I would expect the Council to see the importance of getting involved in this way and influencing the preparation of development plans.</P>
    <P>As I listened to Deputy Costello's contribution today I thought again of the urgent need for local authorities to take account of the spirit of the legislation.  They know this legislation is not being delayed.  They know what most of its procedures will entail if it is enacted. Why should they not take that as the model for action in the interim?  It is unhelpful if, as has been described in <Col N="363" /> the House today, sections are operating almost autonomously.  Accidents or even serious errors of judgement could occur in relation to our heritage in the interim.  I urge people to prepare for the legislation.  Legislation is one thing but in the different organisations there will have to be better internal consultation to ensure we lose nothing even in the interim.</P>
    <P>Deputy Sargent also referred, as did a number of Deputies today, to the national heritage areas.  The Office of Public Works has published lists and maps of areas to be accorded this status and statutory protection for such areas will be provided in an amendment to the Wildlife Bill which I hope to introduce in 1995.  I take the point made by Deputies today in relation to closely examining such consultation procedures, as have been announced.  Work is also proceeding in my Department on arrangements to transpose the habitats directive into Irish law.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, I intend to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to enable the Heritage Council to acquire and hold land and buildings subjects to any directions given to it by me in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  Many Deputies raised this matter and I am glad to say we are at one on this.  This amendment will improve the Bill.</P>
    <P>I will also introduce an amendment which will require the Commissioners of Public Works to carry out their functions under a number of statutes relatting to heritage, under my supervision and direction and they will be required to supply me with the relevant information.  In this regard Deputy Gallagher referred to the precise commitment in the Government programme.  I will use the committee system to bring forward amendments to advance its achievement.  People will know exactly where policy administration functions, annual work programmes and responsibilities lie.  We will then be able to proceed in an orderly manner.</P>
    <P>Since February 1993, as Deputies will <Col N="364" /> be aware, policy formulation of heritage matters has been my responsibility.  It is very desirable that this principle be embodied in legislation and the amendments which I will introduce are in accordance with the policy agreement A Government of Renewal.  In view of the enlarged scope of the Bill with such amendments, I propose to alter its title to the &ldquo;Heritage Bill, 1995&rdquo;.  Deputies will have an opportunity to discuss these and other amendments on Committee and Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello referred to the question of cruelty to animals and spoke of fox hunting, badger baiting and cock fighting.  While legislation on these issues is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, enforcement of the law is a matter for the Garda.  However, it would be open to the Heritage Council to address any such issue and to make recommendations which I would be happy to pass on to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  I share Deputy Costello's revulsion for the practices he described. I am grateful to him also for drawing my attention to the position in relation to Sean McDermott Street.  Discussions are taking place between my Department and the Department of the Environment to decide what can best be done in relation to the Planning Acts, the National Monuments Acts and the area in between.  The wrong way to go about it is to deal with the consequences where a problem was dealt with under one item of legislation only to find that other legislation might have indicated another direction.  We have to find an anticipatory mechanism for this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello referred also to the archaeology of Dublin.  I share his views. He referred to an urban archaeology report for Dublin which was prepared a few years ago.  Further work needs to be done here to refine the information and to pinpoint areas of particular significance.  The report indicated the possibilities once the procedures are in place. He referred also to Office of Public Works carrying out architectural inventories.  I will examine most of these <Col N="365" /> points and see whether they can be advanced.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the issue of the dangerous buildings section and whether it is quicker to demolish a buildings rather than to put up batons to protect it.  The points made are not lost.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera, whom I have congratulated on her appointment, asked about the role of local groups.  I will have no difficulty in dealing with these on Committee Stage.  I have said that in fact &ldquo;they shall co-operate&rdquo;.  It is urged in the legislation.  She mentioned the question of landowners a matter to which I have referred already, which is affected by other legislation.  She also referred to the functions of the council. I can assure her that funding for 1995 will be at a greater level than that provided in 1994.  We are moving in the right direction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crawford spoke eloquently of the wish of local groups to become involved.  That is a very good idea.  What came across in the debate was the desire of local groups to work with educational groups.  Deputy Lawlor stressed the importance of our waterways and referred to a corridor study, on the urban stretch of the Grand Canal which I have already published.  The first meeting of the working group was held yesterday.  It is only when the canal is integrated as part of the life of the local community that its possibilities can be realised.  That is one of the reasons the study has been given these terms of reference.  The task force recommended in the study to which Deputy Lawlor referred has been appointed by me and its first meeting was held yesterday.  I hope to commission a corridor study for a similar stretch of the Royal Canal in the next month or so.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also spoke about the proposed Liffey Valley Park.  Meetings were requested on this matter by Deputies Lawlor and Burton and other Deputies and it was suggested that I consider possibilities in that area.  As I said in answer to a parliamentary question, I asked the Office of Public Works to finalise the acquisition of a large tract <Col N="366" /> of land in the area which is at present for sale.  I have told it to see if it can complete the acquisition, which I suggested was appropriate having met representatives of the local people.  I am very sympathetic to considering other possibilities in this area because it is under considerable residential pressure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connor sought an integrated approach to heritage and said that the National Museum should be brought within the remit of the Heritage Council.  I have already answered that point. It is not excluded from policy on this matter.  I am dealing with the management of the museum in separate legislation &mdash; we will all become familiar with these legislative instruments.  In this Bill I am bringing all heritage matters together in terms of general policy. The Heritage Council will integrate heritage policy.  However, it is necessary to decentralise management, and this is what I am doing in the proposed museums and libraries Bill.  While policy will be integrated I am designating management which will be operated over a period of years, with the appointment of people such as a director of policy to implement the measures.  Those structures will bring the council into the next century.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also wants the council to be in total control of spending European money.  Funds from Europe under the Operational Programme for Tourism are a matter for the Department of Tourism and Trade in the first instance. It would be unreasonable that the Heritage Council should have a determining position in terms of all such funds. Questions are put to me occasionally about this matter.  When the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht was brought into existence it was my personal wish that it would have a separate operational programme.  However, as matters were advanced at Government and European level, that was not possible.  Funding of many of these areas comes under the Gaeltacht programme &mdash; for example, on the employment side &mdash; and others come under tourism.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="367" /> People frequently ask me about the balance between the tourism and the culture and heritage side.  The tourism side is much richer than the culture and heritage side.  The projects I assist relate to heritage and indigenous relationships such as the relationship of the institution to heritage at home.  The tourism side &mdash; I would direct people's attention to this &mdash; is visitor oriented.  It deals with spending money on projects in which the visitor component is the predominant feature.  That is the essential distinction between the two sides.  It is important that these matters are cleared up and it is my intention to do so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connor asked that, in the event of changes being made, there should be a possibility of appeal on economic as well as scientific grounds.  I invite the Deputy to wait until the Bill is published, but I warn that the suggestion is fraught with danger.  To put an economic or social condition on a scientific aspect in a Bill would be a complex matter.  However, I think it is reasonable to return to this matter when the Bill is published.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asked that I consider the question of monuments damaged by the elements.  He spoke about part of a tower that had been damaged in recent times.  The legal position is that the Office of Public Works can spend money only on monuments in State ownership or guardianship.  In the case mentioned by Deputy Connor the Office of Public Works could either acquire the monument or assume guardianship of it to carry out the work required.  One problem would be that the State would be responsible for the monument in perpetuity and this issue would have to be considered by way of amending legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher requested that I clarify the relationship between my Department, the Office of Public Works and the Heritage Council and I hope I have done that.  However, if further clarification is necessary it will be forthcoming.  He also asked that the public be made aware of who they are dealing <Col N="368" /> with in terms of each function.  He said that amendments will be introduced on Committee Stage, to which he is looking forward.  He welcomed the new relationship between the Office of Public Works and my Department which will clarify where responsibility lies in terms of certain issues.  Responsibility will lie with me but the Office of Public Works will, for the time being at least, continue to be an implementing agency for policy.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government provides that the Office of Public Works will be restructured on a phased basis.  It will take a little time to complete this part of the programme but I will ensure that it is done as quickly as possible to remove any confusion in the minds of the public.  There will also be discussions with the staff and their representatives so that the Government's intentions are achieved as quickly and easily as possible.  The main role of the Heritage Council will be to advise me on policy matters.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahon &mdash; and other Deputies &mdash; referred to the <i>Lusitania.</i> As I explained to the Dáil last evening, these issues are complex.  I have made an order which is the first step to ensure there will be no unauthorised dives and no tempering with the wreck.  The question of ownership is complex and relates to the vessel and the property on it, which raises issues of succession.  I may take further measures, in the short term if necessary, to secure the safety of the objects.  There is the further issue of property which would be of benefit to the Irish public, for example, the Hugh Lane paintings and so on.  These matters have been progressed with the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána. It is my intention to seek to recover all items that have been improperly removed.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy McGahon that it is a case of finders keepers.  I abolished treasure trove under previous legislation, but if I find that any item which would benefit the Irish people has been improperly taken I will introduce <Col N="369" /> measures to ensure they are speedily returned.  I have no intention of mitigating any of the considerable sanctions for breaches of the order I have made but will seek to implement them.</P>
    <P>I am aware that shortly there will be an address to the Houses of the Oireachtas on the diaspora.  We are preparing to recall the famine &mdash; it is very difficult to define this &mdash; and it is appropriate to remember that the heritage we are seeking to protect, develop and encourage an interest in is the property not only of people living on this island but also of our diaspora.  If we can secure funding to make that a component of the way in which we remember the famine then it will have possibilities for the future.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that this legislation includes a provision on gender equality. As in the case of the Broadcasting Authority, half the members of the council will be men.  This is in anticipation of the overwhelming rush towards gender equality in the future.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a gabhháil leis na Teachtaí uilig a labhair as ucht an méid oibre a chuir said isteach agus, go h-áirithe, chomh h-údarásach is a labhair siad ar an mBille seo.

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My main aim in introducing this Bill is to increase the protection for occupiers of land against claims by trespassers and recreational users.  In doing so, I want to ensure that recreational use of land is facilitated to the widest extent possible.  This means creating a climate where occupiers will not be deterred from making their land available for such use because they are fearful of being sued for personal injuries.  I also take the view it is time that the principles governing occupiers' liability were put on a firm statutory basis.</P>
      <P>The Occupiers' Liability Bill, 1994, is a measure which has been in preparation for a comparatively short time. The Law Reform Commission's consultation paper on occupiers' liability, which helped to shape the debate on this matter, was published just over a year and a half ago.  The commission's final report was only published in May of last year.  I hope that, notwithstanding the detailed examination to which I am sure it will be subject, it will now have a speedy passage.  I am particularly pleased that its publication last year meant that I was able to adhere to the commitment in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> to produce this reforming legislation during 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission report on occupiers' liability contained a comprehensive programme for reform in <Col N="371" /> this area.  The majority recommendations in that report suggested that the appropriate legislation should include the following key features: entrants should be divided into two classes &mdash; visitors and trespassers: two members of the commission throught that a third class should be provided by dividing visitors into invites and permitted entrants, a common duty of care should exist towards all visitors, and the circumstances relevant in determining whether that duty had been discharged should be specified; there should be a duty not to injure trespassers or recreational users intentionally, or to act with gross negligence towards them; there should be no special exception for child entrants who are recreational users or trespassers: two members thought this would be unconstitutional and recommended an exception for child trespassers under 12 on the lines of the relevant legislation in force in Alberta, and, occupiers should be able to extend or restrict their liability by agreement or notice.</P>
    <P>From this brief resume of the final recommendations, it is clear that the issues raised by the occupiers liability question are legally difficult and potentially controversial.  As I go through the Bill, I propose to return again to these recommendations, both to indicate where they have been adhered to and to explain why, in some areas, a different emphasis has been placed on them.</P>
    <P>More so than in most Bills, section 1, the interpretation section, is of crucial significance.  It provides the keynote definitions which inform the basic principles which are central to the Bill.  Traditionally, the duties of an occupier have been concerned with the static conditions of premises rather than with the activities conducted on them.  The Bill maintains this distinction by providing that the duty which an occupier owes to an entrant under its provisions will relate exclusively to dangers on the premises &mdash;&ldquo;danger&rdquo; being defined as that which is due to the state of the premises only.  For example, this Bill would be relevant where an individual <Col N="372" /> was injured as a result of falling into a deep trench, but would not be relevant where the accident occurred as a result of the careless driving of heavy machinery.  In the latter case, general principles drawn from the body of case law in relation to negligence would apply.</P>
    <P>The concept of &ldquo;occupier&rdquo; is also one which needs to be considered in some detail.  Essentially, an occupier for the purposes of the Bill is an individual who is in actual occupation of the premises for the time being and, as such, has immediate supervision and control over those premises and the power to admit or refuse entry to other persons.  In some cases, it is possible for there to be more than one occupier as, for example, where the owners of premises grant a licence which allows part of the premises to be used by another individual while, at the same time, retaining certain rights in relation to those premises. In such an instance, it is also possible that each of the occupiers will owe different duties to the entrant who may be a trespasser <i>vis-á-vis</i> one but a visitor <i>vis-á-vis</i> the other.</P>
    <P>As defined in the Bill, &ldquo;premises&rdquo; is a very comprehensive term.  It includes land, buildings and water.  It also encompasses objects on land such as scaffolding and electricity pylons. Finally, it extends to vessels, vehicles, trains and aircraft.  It therefore, covers a range of premises including dwelling-houses, farmland, forest parks, playgrounds, supermarkets and so on.  In other words, the scope of the Bill is much broader than just agricultural land.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for three classes of entrant &mdash; a visitor, a trespasser and a recreational user.  These new classes replace the old system of classification whereby an entrant was assigned to a particular class, depending in part on the nature of the benefit which that entrant conferred upon the occupier.  A visitor is essentially a person whose presence on premises is lawful.  As such, the term covers those invited on to premises by an occupier, as well as those permitted by that occupier to be there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="373" /> It also includes entrants as of right, such as those authorised under statute to enter premises for some official purpose.</P>
    <P>A trespasser, by contrast, is a person whose presence on premises is unlawful.</P>
    <P>The third class deals with recreational users and adds greatly to the clarity of the situation to have a precise definition of such users.  They are defined in section 1 as those who, without payment of any charge, enter on to premises to engage in a recreational activity which is conducted in the open air.  It may be an activity capable of being carried on by individuals or groups such as hill walking, hunting or swimming, or it may include a team sport such as football. The recreational user category will also apply to those who visit sites and buildings of historical, national or scientific importance.  The fact that an occupier gives permission for such an activity to be engaged in will not result in the entrant being elevated to visitor status.</P>
    <P>It is also important, for the sake of clarity, to make it plain, as section 2 does, that the provisions in this Bill will replace the common law rules which now govern occupiers' liability.  This is particularly important in the case of the provisions relating to trespassers where the existing law is being changed quite radically.</P>
    <P>Section 3 sets out the duty which an occupier of premises owes to a visitor. That duty is the &ldquo;common duty of care&rdquo;, which means a duty to take reasonable care that the visitor does not suffer personal injury or damage to his or her property by virtue of any danger existing on the premises.  This provision follows closely the Law Reform Commission's recommendations and the effect of the provision is essentially to apply general negligence principles to this area of the law.  From this it follows that, before any liability can be imposed, there must be a breach of the duty which the occupier owes to a visitor, and the damage or injury suffered by the visitor must be caused by that breach.</P>
    <P>The duty owed to recreational users <Col N="374" /> and trespassers is set out in section 4.  In this instance, negligence principles will not apply, although the Law Reform Commission recommended that gross negligence should be the appropriate standard.  Instead, the duty of the occupier is being pitched at a lower level. That duty is not to injure such users intentionally or to act with reckless disregard for them.  The duty also extends to damage to their property.  The basic premises is that trespassers and recreational users should largely be able to take care of themselves, and that occupiers should not be liable except where they behave with reckless disregard for the presence of such entrants.</P>
    <P>Many landowners are willing to make their lands available for a wide variety of recreational pursuits which are an intrinsic part of many individuals' leisure time.  Not surprisingly, they are not willing to accept anything other than a very limited liability in law for any accidents which may befall those users.  The recreational users themselves are, for the most part, in agreement with landowners on this issue.  In general, they are more than happy to take responsibility for themselves.  Clearly, there is a consensus between landowner and recreational user here and I do not believe that the law should frustrate this consensus.</P>
    <P>Landowners with national monuments on their property which, of their nature, attract visitors are also reluctant to accept responsibility for any injuries which such visitors might sustain, especially where no charge is imposed for the visit.  The fact that the monuments may not be in the best structural condition adds to the worry of such landowners.  I believe the Bill will remedy this situation.  These monuments are part of our national heritage, and it is in all our interests that access to them should not be constrained by unnecessary fears about potential liabilities.</P>
    <P>Returning again to the text of the Bill, in determining whether an occupier has acted with reckless disregard for a recreational user or trespasser, there is a <Col N="375" /> range of factors which have to be considered.  Their application and effect will vary, depending on the circumstances.</P>
    <P>For example, in so far as there may be a danger on the premises, that danger must be one against which an occupier might reasonably be expected to provide protection.  An ordinary fence from which someone falls while climbing over it would not be such a danger.  Also, the burden on the occupier of eliminating the danger or of protection from the danger, bearing in mind its degree, must be weighed against the difficulty, expense or impracticability of doing so.  For example, an occupier with a lake on his or her premises would not be expected to put a wall around it to ensure that a recreational user or trespasser did not fall in.  Another factor which must be taken into account is the character of the premises and the desirability of maintaining open access where those premises are likely to be used for recreational activities.  Clearly, the same burden of protection will not be expected of an occupier of a working farm or wilderness park as would be expected in the case of the interior of a building which was specifically designed to attract visitors.  Finally, any warnings which may have been given by the occupier or by another person will also be relevant.</P>
    <P>So far, the provisions which I have outlined in relation to recreational users and trespassers are broadly in line with the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  I now wish to deal with the position of such entrants who also happen to be minors.  Here, there is some small divergence from the letter, although not, I think, the spirit, of the recommendations made by the three members of the commission who put forward the majority view.  It is this issue, more than any other, which has given rise to critical comment, some of which, appears to be based on a misunderstanding of the Bill's provisions.</P>
    <P>It has been said that it turns farmers into child minders or guardian angels. <Col N="376" /> Let me say straightaway that that is simply not so.  On the contrary, the Bill reduces substantially the liability to child and other trespassers which all occupiers have under the present law.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what the language of the Bill says in relation to minors who are recreational users or trespassers.  It merely says that regard is to be had to their age and to their ability to appreciate the danger.  These are just two factors which are additional to those I have already outlined.  The Bill does not say that an occupier owes such minors the common duty of care.  Nor does it say that the occupier is strictly liable for whatever accident may befall such an entrant.  Even the majority view of the commission acknowledges that a court could never be prevented from taking the capacity of the child plaintiff into account in its findings.  I have introduced an additional criterion which makes it plain that, where a minor is on premises in the company of another person, the extent of the supervision and control which that person might reasonably be expected to exercise over the minor's activities will also be relevant in determining whether an occupier has acted with reckless disregard.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, I appreciate that this issue is one which has given rise to some concern on the part of those who feel their position is prejudiced by the proposed provision in relation to minors.  I am at present reviewing the provision relating to minors in accordance with the commitment in the Government's programme.  I will listen closely to the views of Deputies as expressed in the forthcoming debate and the provision will be considered carefully by me in the light of those views, and of others, in advance of Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The ability to appreciate danger is also relevant in the case of people with mental handicap as is the situation where a person with such a handicap may be accompanied by a carer.  The Bill provides that regard will be had to these factors in determining whether an occupier has acted with reckless disregard towards such a person.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="377" /> Before leaving section 4, I should like to make two general points.  First, self-employed persons such as farmers are already required under the Safety, Health and Welfare Act of 1989 to conduct their undertakings in such a way as to ensure, as far as reasonably practicable, that persons other than employees are not exposed to risks to their safety or health.  Second, in Northern Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales the duty owned by an occupier to a trespasser &mdash; essentially a duty of care &mdash; is a good deal higher than what is being provided in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention that, where structures are provided primarily for recreational use, there will be an onus on the occupier to take reasonable care to maintain them, in a safe condition.  I should stress that such structures do not include gates and stiles which would be used in the ordinary course of farming, for example.  Rather, they would include such structures as benches in parks on which people may sit, secured viewing points in scenic areas and equipment provided for use in playgrounds.</P>
    <P>Section 5 is another very important section in the Bill, which substantially implements the main recommendations of the Law Reform Commission.  This section allows occupiers to extend the duties which they owe to all entrants. While this may be unlikely to occur in practice, it is appropriate that the Bill should not rule out this possibility where a particular occupier chooses to act with this degree of generosity.</P>
    <P>It also entitles occupiers to modify the duty they owe to visitors under the Bill and, in effect, to decide that it should only be that which is owed to trespassers.  This modification may be done by agreement or by notice, also warnings, which if heeded by the visitor would have enabled that visitor to avoid injury, may absolve an occupier from liability altogether.  Given the reduced duty which will be owed to trespassers and recreational users.  I have taken the view that it would be inappropriate for occupiers to be able to reduce their duty to <Col N="378" /> entrants below this basic level.  In a civilised society it goes without saying that occupiers should not injure entrants intentionally or act with reckless disregard for them.</P>
    <P>Section 6 enshrines a basic principle which is common to most statutes on occupiers' liability, namely, that strangers to a contract should not have their status as entrants adversely affected by contracts to which they themselves are not parties.  Similarly, section 7 contains another general principle whereby occupiers will not be liable for the negligence of an independent contractor if they have taken reasonable steps to ensure that the contractor is competent and to satisfy themselves that the work has been properly done.</P>
    <P>I was concerned to ensure that there should be no doubt in anyone's mind that, confronted by a trespasser with criminal intent, an occupier would be able to act in legitimate self-defence. For that reason, section 8 expressly preserves the legal principles relating to self-defence, the defence of others and the defence of property.  In certain circumstances it may happen that, in addition to the duties which occupiers have, they also have other quite particular duties which they owe in a different capacity.  For example, employers owe a specific duty to their employees to provide them with safe premises, independently of any duty which they may owe to them as occupiers.  Section 8 also makes it clear that the statutory prescription of occupiers' liability does not affect this type of duty.</P>
    <P>Central to section 9 is the idea that entrants have a duty to take reasonable care for their own safety.  The principles of contributory negligence will apply so that any damages awarded in a successful action may be abated where entrants are shown to have contributed to their own injury.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is the final section in the Bill and it provides that its provisions will come into operation one month after the date of its passing.  The reason for this one month period is that the law in this area is being changed greatly and <Col N="379" /> I believe that it would be helpful for entrants and occupiers alike to have this breathing space to accustom themselves to the new regime.</P>
    <P>There are a variety of paths which might be followed when it comes to reforming the law on occupiers' liability. I believe we now have a product which is geared towards our specific requirements and which has benefited from the legislative experience which has been gained in other jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>I appreciate there is a perception that there has been a long wait for reform in this area of the law and that there has been some impatience with what were seen as unnecessary delays.  At this stage, I am happy that there is a Bill before the House which deals fully and comprehensively with the occupiers' liability issue, taking into account the valuable work of the Law Reform Commission.  In this context, I emphasise the importance of bearing in mind that the law of occupiers' liability is concerned with the duty owed by all occupiers of premises or land towards entrants, whether invited or uninvited, who suffer personal injury or property damage during their visit.  Its purpose is to strike a balance between a wide range of competing interests and it should be seen in the context of the reasonable expectations of both occupier and entrant in a variety of domestic, social and commercial settings.</P>
    <P>This is an important, and in some respects complex, Bill and I have no doubt but that it will benefit from a detailed study in Committee in due course.  I and my Department have been in close touch with the main farming organisations both before and since publication of the Bill and I am considering their various suggestions.  I assure the House that I will give the fullest consideration also to any comments or suggestions Deputies may make in this debate and to any amendments they may table on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a most important <Col N="380" /> and far reaching Bill.  Its implications are crucial, not only for landowners but for the community as a whole.  It is vital that we tackle the issues involved if we are to contain soaring insurance costs and, at the same time, ensure that our great tradition for sports, leisure and recreation is not only preserved but enhanced.  Farmers and landowners generally have been co-operative and welcoming in allowing access through their lands to forests, rivers, mountains and heritage monuments.  Now, because of litigation and rising insurance costs, they must seek to protect themselves.  This legislation is, therefore, timely and highly relevant.</P>
      <P>The issues that concern us are far wider than might at first appear.  They include access to the community hall, the school premises, the swimming pool, the children's playground etc.  The city, the local park or playground and amenities proposed by the local community development group are also seriously affected by issues relating to occupiers' liability.  One of the greatest anomalies in civil law relates to the liability of the humble householder for injuries to trespassers, especially when the trespasser is about an illegal purpose.  All these matters should be considered in the context of this Bill.</P>
      <P>This is a good Bill which is worthy of support.  It improves the position for occupiers and landowners, especially in relation to trespassers and recreational users.  Issues relating to the duty of care which must be provided for minors and liability for the maintenance of structures on sites provided for the convenience of recreational users will need to be fully addressed on Committee Stage.  If the Bill fails to allay the fears of occupiers, the cost will be closing off much of the countryside to the people generally and to their children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill was at an advanced stage of preparation before the seating arrangements in this House were changed.  The object of the Bill was to clarify an unclear area of law to meet, in part, the demands of farmers and landowners and, in so doing, to reduce the insurance <Col N="381" /> costs they have to bear.  The lack of precision in the law arises because the current position is the sum of many different judgments in court cases over the years, some more and some less sympathetic to the interests of the occupier. There is no clear formula.  The judge in each case has to consider factual issues, and the extent of the duty of care which the occupier owes.  The test of reason-ableness, whatever that means, is applied and each cases is decided on its merits.</P>
    <P>The Minister is essentially now trying to codify the position, to spell out the criteria and the factors that will determine the liability of the landowner.  I am not entirely convinced that the new code is any simpler or clearer than the existing law and I do not think the enactment of this Bill will reduce the volume of litigation or the insurance costs that landowners must bear.  That is something we can discuss at greater length on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The <i>Government of Renewal</i> Programme contains an undertaking to expand the Eccles Street breast cancer programme on a phased basis to cover those women in the high risk group nationwide.  The Deputy will be aware that my Department is supporting this major mammographic screening programme underway at the Mater Foundation.  This programme is one of a network of pilot schemes on breast <Col N="382" /> cancer being carried out in the European Union.</P>
      <P>The programme's second round of screening has recently been completed and a report on the findings of the programme has been submitted to my Department in recent days.  This report is currently being assessed and evaluated in my Department and I hope to be in a position to announce a decision on the expansion of the programme in the near future.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As the Deputy is aware the Eccles Street screening programme is part of a European Union initiative.  We will draw on the experience of our partners in the European Union who have similar screening programmes and that would, of course, include the experience of the British authorities and those in Northern Ireland.  We will not be negotiating particular Protocols with them but we will draw on their experience.  As the Deputy will be aware there are meetings between the Minister for Health and the Minister with responsibility for health in <Col N="383" /> Stormont on a biannual basis and that will continue during my term in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Since it is widely accepted that breast cancer is one of the more common cancers and, I am told, one of the more easily detectable will the Minister say to what extent we will have educational and awareness programmes particularly for women's groups throughout the country so that the use of the very expensive technology required could be minimised by a greater awareness among women of what they can do themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> An education and awareness programme for all groups and individuals who would be likely to be affected by cancer would be part of any national programme on cancer.</P>
      <P>To put the situation in context, about 8,000 people here died last year from cancer.  Modern evaluation systems now indicate that a person has a one in four chance of contracting cancer sometime in one's life and in that context about 650 women died of breast cancer and approximately 70 died of cervical cancer in Ireland last year.  I accept what the Deputy is suggesting but any initiatives I take will be set in the context of a wider programme for cancer screening because it is at the top of all tables on premature mortality and it needs a national policy rather than the pursuance of issues of major concern which are not the totality of the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 3, 31, 36 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Blood Transfusion Service Board (BTSB) that the number of persons screened for hepatitis C under the national blood screening programme is 56,273 as at 17 January 1995.  The number tested positive for hepatitis C antibodies as at 17 January 1995 is 1,037; 455 of these women are positive for the hepatitis C virus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board has also informed me that as at 17 January 1995, 1,265 children and 363 partners have been screened for hepatitis C. Up to that date, ten children have tested positive for hepatitis C antibodies and two of these children have tested positive for the virus.  Three partners have <Col N="385" /> tested positive for hepatitis C antibodies.  Further investigations are underway in these cases.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive counselling programme involving medical consultants at the Blood Transfusion Service Board and general practitioners throughout the country was put in place by the Blood Transfusion Service Board for persons who received the anti-D product.  There is one-to-one medical staff to client-patient consultations.  Persons who tested positive for hepatitis C under the national blood screening programme were also invited to Blood Transfusion Services Board consultations which took place in Dublin, Waterford, Wexford, Kilkenny, Clonmel, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  To support the Blood Transfusion Service Board counselling services, a counselling programme was also structured by the Blood Transfusion Service Board with the Well Women Centre in Dublin. Large group information meetings on hepatitis C were also held in Dublin, Waterford, Cork, Tralee, Limerick, Galway, Castlebar, Sligo, Monaghan, Mul-lingar and Donegal.  Counselling in small groups &mdash; up to 20 &mdash; is also being undertaken by the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  Individual psychological support is also available where this is considered necessary and appropriate.</P>
    <P>Medical consultants employed by the Blood Transfusion Service Board have collected considerable information from experts in other countries on hepatitis C.  Relevant information gathered from experts in other countries has been made available to health professionals and the general public through conferences, leaflets and during counselling.</P>
    <P>Treatment for those who test positive for hepatitis C under the national blood screening programme is being provided at the following six designated hospitals: St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin; Beaumont Hospital, Dublin; Mater Hospital, Dublin; St. James's Hospital, Dublin; Cork University Hospital and University College Hospital, Galway.</P>
    <P>The treatment initially involves an out-patient visit which may be followed <Col N="386" /> by a short admission for clinical investigation and follow-up treatment, if required.  The treatment, including prescribed medication, is being provided by the public hospital service free of charge.</P>
    <P>The counselling programme and support services which were put in place to meet the needs of those who have tested positive for hepatitis C under the national blood screening programme will be available for as long as they are required.</P>
    <P>The provision of medical cards for those who contracted hepatitis C from anti-D immunoglobulin will be considered by my Department.</P>
    <P>I indicated in the policy agreement. <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> I wish to confirm that the Government is committed to providing fair compensation for women infected by the hepatitis C virus from anti-D immunoglobulin.  I will be considering the matter of compensation further following the submission to me in the near future of the report of the expert group.  Arrangements will be made in due course for the publications of the expert group report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  Is he satisfied that the condition can be reversed by the treatment and therapy used where the virus is active?  Is there sufficient careful monitoring of the side effects? Has consideration been given to the possibility that women who were immunised here may have emigrated and may not be aware of these discoveries?  What effort has been made to track down such women?  The anti-D drug is extremely useful and has helped save thousands of lives since its use in the 1970s.  Could the Minister allay the fears of women who are rhesus negative?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The anti-D drug has been of immense benefit in saving innumerable mothers and babies from death or serious illness. Arrangements have been made for the anti-D product to be imported from <Col N="387" /> Canada.  It is being used in hospitals and is very successful and totally safe.</P>
      <P>The report of the expert group will be available to me shortly.  That will raise a series of issues in accordance with its terms of reference.  I do not wish to go into great detail on issues which might pre-empt the advice of the report.  The Deputy is aware that there is treatment for hepatitis C but it is difficult to say how effective the treatment can be in individuals cases, while it is clearly effective in some cases.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that around 60,000 women would be in the target group and more than 57,000 have been screened.  The figure of 60,000 is not an accurate one based on records but is a statistical estimate.  Publicity was used to carry the message to the widest possible group but there is always the possibility that some women will not hear about it. What is more likely is that some women will decide not to come forward for screening for their own personal and private reasons.</P>

      <P>The Minister referred to the Government's commitment to give fair compensation to women, children and spouses affected by this disaster.  Does he imagine fair compensation can be determined other than having recourse to the courts?  Does he agree that to drag such women through the courts would impose an additional trauma on them?  Will he commit himself to negotiating this fair compensation without the need to go to the courts?  Does he accept this may be a lifetime health issue for some of the women and any compensation would have to be renewable and reviewable because there is a medical difficulty in quantifying how people will fare as time goes by?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows in her capacity as a lawyer, there are precedents for compensation being agreed without recourse to the courts.  We will look at how haemophiliacs were compensated.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Under the child abuse guidelines issued by my Department in 1987, responsibility for the identification, investigation and management of suspected cases of child abuse rests with the health boards.  This approach is now reflected in the Child Care Act, 1991, which imposes a statutory duty on health boards to identify and promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.</P>
      <P>The guidelines also provided for the notification of cases of alleged abuse to the Garda Síochána.  My Department, in consultation with the Department of Justice, the health boards and the Garda Síochána, is developing new procedures for the notification of suspected cases of child abuse between health boards and the Garda.  These procedures, which revolve around a standardised form for the notification of suspected cases of abuse, are aimed at ensuring closer co-ordination between key personnel from both agencies to facilitate the twin objectives of protecting the child and the full investigation of any crime.  I expect these procedures to be finalised within the next few weeks.  There will then be a series of training sessions for members of the Garda and relevant health board personnel in relation to the new procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is not directly involved in the investigation of any <Col N="390" /> alleged cases of child abuse whether in the child's home or in residential care. Therefore I am not in a position to comment on the details of the handling of alleged cases of abuse in residential care centres other than to assure the House that all such allegations are treated very seriously and are investigated thoroughly by the health board in conjunction with the Garda.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the House that concerted action has been and will continue to be taken to try to secure the safety and protection of children at risk and particularly those in residential care. Over the past two years over £20 million extra has been provided to develop and improve our child care services in preparation for the full implementation of the Child Care Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>Among the developments approved were:&mdash; the creation of over 370 new posts for the child care services around the country, including child psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and child care workers; the provision of additional hostel places for homeless children; the establishment of new family resource centres and community support projects to assist disadvantaged children; the expansion of the homemaker and home help services to help families in difficulty and the establishment of community mothers programmes in a number of boards; increased financial support to pre-school services of social deprivation and the provision of additional places and, the development of foster care and other alternative family placement services.</P>
    <P>In the area of residential care a number of specific initiatives have been taken.  Early last year each health board was asked to put in place interim arrangements for the review of children in residential care on the following basis:&mdash; (a) review all cases of children currently in residential care to ensure that they are receiving appropriate and adequate care and to make arrangements for six monthly reviews thereafter; (b) establish the appropriateness of the placement of children currently in <Col N="391" /> residential care and to put procedures in place for their transfer to other appropriate placements if this is necessary i.e., foster care, home, relative, etc.</P>
    <P>This will be an ongoing process pending the introduction of regulations under the Child Care Act.</P>
    <P>In preparation for the introduction of these regulations a working group was established to advise on standards for children's residential centres.  The working group includes representatives of the Department of Health, health boards, Residential Managers' Association, the Conference of Religious of Ireland, who represent the proprietors of most of the homes, and the Irish Association of Care Workers.  The group has prepared a draft guide to standards for residential child care centres which is being circulated today to all interested parties for their views.</P>
    <P>The group also reviewed the guidelines on recruitment of child care workers which were first issued by the Department of Health in 1979.  As a result of this review, my Department has issued new directives to all children's residential centres in respect of the recruitment and selection of staff for employment in such centres.  As part of this process agreement has been reached with the Department of Justice and the Garda Síochána to introduce a formal system of Garda clearance for applicants for posts in the children's residential centres.  While this system is an important addition to the selection procedures, it cannot, of itself, be a guarantee that unsuitable persons are prevented from working in residential child care.  I urge all concerned with the recruitment of staff to be constantly vigilant in all aspects of the selection procedures to ensure the safety and protection of children in residential care centres.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Government is committed to all practical measures to ensure the safety and protection of children in care.</P>
    <P>I should like to apologise to the House because, in normal circumstances <Col N="392" /> the Minister of State with responsibility for Child Care, Deputy Currie, would reply to this question but he is abroad on Government business.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comprehensive reply from which it is quite clear that a number of very progressive steps have been taken in recent years.  I do not doubt his commitment to their continuance.  Nonetheless, it is also clear that there is greater child abuse, repugnant to most of us, more widespread than any of us had anticipated or believed.  Is it possible to devise some kind of register &mdash; I know the Minister spoke about Garda support in terms of residential care staff recruitment &mdash; but it is clear that, wherever there is a problem, offenders sometimes have been able to obtain similar posts in other places without the knowledge of the relevant recruiting officers.  I should like to be assured that that scrutiny will be continued as comprehensively and rigorously as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 34, and 49 together.</P>
      <P>In the dental health action plan which is now being implemented by my Department it is estimated that a total of nine consultant orthodontists, supported by appropriately trained dental staff, are required by the health board dental service to meet orthodontic treatment needs at secondary care level.</P>
      <P>The position in each health board area regarding the recruitment of consultant orthodontists under the action place is as follows:</P>
      <P>Mid-Western &mdash; A consultant is in post since 1985.</P>
      <P>Southern &mdash; A consultant took up duty in January 1992.</P>
      <P>North-Western &mdash; A consultant took up duty in February 1992.</P>
      <P>South-Eastern &mdash; A consultant took up duty in September 1992.</P>
      <P>Western &mdash; A consultant took up duty in October 1992.</P>
      <P>North-Eastern &mdash; The board was again unsuccessful in recent attempts to fill the vacant post through the Local Appointments Commission.  The board has made arrangements with private specialists to provide services.</P>
      <P>Midland &mdash; The board was again unsuccessful in recent attempts to fill the vacant post through the Local Appointments Commission.  The board has made arrangements with private specialists to provide services.</P>
      <P>Eastern &mdash; A joint appointment of a professor-consultant between the Dublin Dental Hospital and the board to replace a recent resignation is expected very shortly.  The board is also awaiting a response to advertisements for a further two consultant appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="394" /> In addition to their own direct clinical involvement the health board consultants organise and carry out a programme of education and training in orthodontic procedures for health board dental staff.  These dental staff will provide a high service level of secondary care orthodontic services under the overall direction and supervision of consultants.</P>
    <P>My Department and the health boards will continue to develop the orthodontic services over the course of the Dental Health Action Plan so that the level of service provision will be brought to the level of actual treatment need.  I expect, however, that, in common with many countries where an orthodontic service is provided free of charge, the demand for treatment will continue to exceed the treatment need.</P>
    <P>As the waiting lists for orthodontic treatment are maintained by the health boards I have asked the chief executive officer of each health board to furnish this information to Deputy Coughlan as a matter of urgency, as I think she sought this information.</P>
    <P>These patients who have been assessed for treatment by the consultant orthodontist and placed in the category of greatest severity &mdash; Category A &mdash; should begin treatment straightaway. The optimum time for orthodontic treatment to commence for children outside category A depends on the dental development of each particular child. In most cases this occurs when all the permanent teeth have erupted.  Children should commence their treatment as soon as possible after this occurrence. However, treatment can commence at any time afterwards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I am deputising for Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, who is unavoidably absent, there is no reason for any tempestuous storms or anything of the kind between myself and the newly appointed Minister for Health. Nonetheless, his reply to these questions seems to indicate a certain satisfaction <Col N="395" /> with the standard of orthodontic treatment services nationwide which I consider appalling; there is a gross inadequacy in this area; many people with poor dental structures are worried about the lack of receipt of such treatment, not only for aesthetic reasons but about serious dental problems that will ultimately arise.  Will the Minister agree there is dire need for additional appointments?  Will he also agree that there may well be an even greater need for a new regime for training ordinary dentists, so that greater numbers of these patents could be catered for in another way because the problems are frightening?  The problems I encounter in my constituency are such that they require greater urgency of solution than that which appears to have been displayed by the Minister in his reply.</P>

Nonetheless it might be appropriate to remark that Fianna Fáil has been in power continuously for seven years during which there were three successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Health.  Deputy Michael Smith was a Minister for Health.  Therefore, I when my colleague, Deputy Howlin, was Minister for Health.  Therefore, I would have to take his concern with a certain degree of salt.  I was appointed on 15 December last.  Therefore, if I show any lack of urgency, how does that reflect on Deputy Michael Smith and his party who have been in Cabinet looking after these affairs in recent years?</P>

      <P>I do not want to get into the politics of this but I want new appointments to be treated with greater urgency and consideration given to other ways to address this problem.  I am not trying to score political points but we must consider how we should address this problem as it cannot be addressed on the basis of current policy.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Open heart surgery operations for adults, including coronary artery by-pass grafts &mdash; CABGs &mdash; are currently performed for public patients at the National Cardiac Surgery Unit in the Mater Hospital, Dublin and at Cork Regional Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department undertook an assessment of the medium term requirements for additional cardiac surgery facilities in 1992-93.  Submissions were received from the Mater and St. James's Hospitals.  It was decided in 1993 that open heart surgery facilities should be <Col N="397" /> expanded at the National Cardiac Surgery Unit, at the Mater Hospital.</P>
    <P>In 1993, a sum of £1 million from the waiting list fund was allocated to enable the necessary facilities to be put in place at the National Cardiac Surgery Unit, Mater Hospital to increase the annual through put of open heart surgery at the hospital from 750 to 1,000 &mdash; an increase of 33 per cent.  In addition, in 1993 and 1994, capital funding of £2.8 million was provided to facilitate the doubling of cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital from 200 to 400 patients each year.</P>
    <P>Over 1993 and 1994, in excess of £2 million revenue and £3.5 million in capital was allocated to the Mater Hospital for cardiac surgery and related developments.  The building works which were associated with this development, were completed in mid-1994, include additional cardiac maintenance beds, intensive care facilities and high dependency facilities which are required to support the cardiac surgery programme. These new facilities at the hospital have now become operational and the additional cardiac surgery activity has commenced.</P>
    <P>The developments at the Mater Hospital, together with the developments for cardiac surgery at Cork Regional Hospital which were opened in November 1994 will have the effect of increasing the number of cardiac surgery operations performed on an annual basis in the public hospital sector by 47 per cent from 950 to 1,400.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that when all these additional facilities are operating at full capacity they will have a positive impact on the waiting list.  The question of the provision of further additional facilities for cardiac surgery will be considered as sympathetically as possible in the context of the many competing demands for resources throughout the health services.</P>

Unfortunately, he has not gone into any great detail to support the case I made for the development of the service in St. James's Hospital.  Will the Minister not agree that in this day and age it is ridiculous that patients should be processed through a modern hospital with a large capacity like St. James's Hospital and transferred in huge numbers by ambulance to the Mater Hospital?  Will he agree also that with 1,657 people waiting for cardiac surgery, it is now time to bring on stream other hospitals particularly St. James's Hospital to perform that surgery?  Does it not disturb the Minister that the two private hospitals which do this procedure do 700 procedures per annuam and that it is sad that the two public hospitals in Cork and Dublin are only carrying out approximately the same number?  Will he give the House a guarantee that he will reverse this incredibly serious imbalance in the service?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Cardiac surgery is an area of increasing concern and it has received a certain amount of publicity during the past 12 months or so.  In 1992-93 the Department undertook an assessment of the medium term requirement for additional cardiac surgery facilities and an option appraisal was carried out by the Department on proposals submitted by the Mater Hospital and St. James's Hospital. Those two hospitals were the only contenders as they were the only hospitals in Dublin with cardiac surgeons.  The St. James's Hospital proposal was for a start-up facility of 250 cases.  At present the cardiac surgeons in St. James's Hospital carry out their operations in the Mater Hospital.  Without going into too many statistics, it was seen, on the assessment that there would be a better throughput of cases by expanding facilities at the Mater Hospital rather than setting up new facilities at St. James's Hospital.  That was the basis for that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy said, there is a waiting list of 1,700 adults.  When services are <Col N="399" /> fully in place in 1995, the open heart surgery capacity of the public hospitals will be 1,000 in the Mater Hospital and 400 in Cork Regional, an increase of 450 on what was available before the assessment was carried out.  I am aware that St. James's Hospital is continuing to press its case and wishes to become a second centre for cardiac surgery in Dublin.  Its case will have to be taken into account in any further expansion of the service.  It is also worth pointing out that the Western Health Board is seeking cardiac surgery facilities which will be headed by two cardiac surgeons in Galway and the Mid-Western Health Board has also plans in this area.  So there are a number of competing demands for resources now, but the priority is to continue the throughput of cardiac operations in the public hospitals and to continue what is happening in the private hospitals where approximately 700 operations are performed per annum at the Blackrock Clinic and the Mater Private Hospital. If, as the Deputy suggests, there is a discrepancy in the throughput between the public and private hospitals, I will have it examined, but I have no information on file to suggest that is the case.</P>

      <P>As a Government backbencher I do not wish to add to the Minister's headaches, but I am sure he and his officials understand the horrendous difficulties he would face if, having put all one's eggs in one basket in terms of providing cardiac surgery in the Mater Hospital in Dublin, a doomsday scenario arose which resulted in that hospital having to close its wards as a result of an infection.  There is no alternative public hospital in the Dublin area equipped to carry out that surgery.  Will the Minister seriously investigate the strong case that Dublin needs a second cardiac surgery facility in addition to that provided in the Mater on the grounds that if the Mater had to close there would be mayhem in this life and death area?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 20, 40, 47 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>I have set up an advisory group under the chairmanship of the chief medical officer of my Department to make recommendations regarding the prevention of the transmission of infectious diseases in health care settings.  The screening of health care personnel for such diseases and the issues raised in the parliamentary questions of 20 October 1994 will be considered by the group.  I have asked the group to consult relevant organisations including the Medical Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The membership of the group will include, <i>inter alia,</i> doctors from the health boards, the acute hospitals and the Department of Health.  Following <Col N="403" /> the replies to the parliamentary questions of 20 October 1994, it was decided to broaden consideration of the issues to the transmission of infectious diseases in health care settings.</P>
    <P>In view of recent concerns about the possible transmission of infectious diseases in health care settings, I have asked the group to report to me as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that any guidelines or proposed code of practice would have to be standardised on a national basis rather than varying from health board to health board?  Otherwise, it would be easy to evade detection.  Also, does the Minister agree that there would be an equality of risk between patients and doctors?  Does he not agree that in cases of major invasive surgery patients and doctors would have to be tested. However, it might be impractical to test all health care workers who have no direct contact with patients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As the Deputy suggested, a number of issues arise in this regard and that is why I need an advisory committee.  It would not be helpful if individual health boards or agencies introduced individual guidelines.  I requested my Department to write to health boards informing them that procedures introduced before the Department decides policy, arising from the advice of the advisory committee, can be introduced only on a voluntary basis and cannot be mandatory, statutory or compulsory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an equality of risk in the context of certain health care facilities.  To put it bluntly, there is probably as big a risk of a doctor being infected by a patient as there is of a patient being infected by a doctor.  Because normally doctors are healthy and patients are ill, the risk of infection of a doctor by a patient is much greater than the other way round. That is dealt with in the code of ethics of the medical profession.  I understand <Col N="404" /> a doctor may object to treating a patient, but the profession outlined that a colleague will carry out the necessary treatment.  I am not responsible for answering questions on medical ethics, but I hope what I said is a fair summary of the position of the Medical profession.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The number of girls under 15 years giving birth in the State is relatively low.  In 1987 there were 50, in 1990 there were 66 and 57 in 1993, the year for which I have the latest figures.</P>
      <P>My Department is not aware of any specific recent study regarding the risk of prematurity to mothers in this age group.  However, it is generally accepted that prematurity is more likely if various risk factors are involved.  These include factors such as a first birth, the mother being part of the lower socio-economic group, poor levels of nutrition, smoking and poor attendance at ante-natal facilities.</P>
      <P>While the pregnant under-15s are not by virtue of the age of mother more prone to premature births, one or more of the above factors may be more prevalent in the group, which would explain the high incidence of prematurity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A range of family planning services is available in each health board area through general practitioners, maternity hospitals and units, non-governmental agencies and pharmacists.  There are <Col N="405" /> concerns, however, that the service does not fully meet the needs of all groups within the population.  I am currently addressing these concerns under the health strategy to determine to what extent improvements are required.</P>
    <P>An integral element of a comprehensive family planning service, of course, is the provision of education and counselling on all legal methods of contraception.  In this context, the recent initiative launched by my colleague, the Minister for Education, in primary and post-primary schools is most welcome.</P>

I am worried that this matter would become a problem, not only for mothers but for their immediate families, as it appears the whole strategy in relation to sex education will become a moral issue. I would much prefer it to be seen as an education or health issue.  I ask the Minister for Health to take it on board to ensure that the dangers inherent in early sexual activity, which are well documented, and the problems associated with very young girls giving birth, both psychologically and physically, are considered a health issue.  The Department of Health will have to become involved to teach young girls and boys the various health aspects of the problem.  The Minister, in conjunction with the Department of Education should ensure that the Department of Health is involved in the schools programme, not only on this issue but on all issues concerning the health of young people.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Deputy Lynch raised a number of interesting issues.  For the information of the House the statistics from 1984-93 of births to 15 years olds are: 49, 41, 34, 50, 57, 52, 66, 55, 45 and 57.  The statistics go up and down but the average is the same all the way through.  I have no information of any recent study to suggest the pattern is changing.  I agree that this is a health issue but it is also an education issue.  It is a moral issue even though morality does not fall within my remit.  It is also a legal issue and it is worth pointing out that sexual intercourse with a woman under 16 years of age is a criminal offence.  In so far as it falls within my area of responsibility, guidelines for a comprehensive family planning service are being drawn up in my Department.  There will be no delay in their ratification or in communicating them to the health boards and I hope that can be done.  As with any comprehensive guidelines on family planning they will involve the needs of all persons who are sexually active.  The primary objective of a comprehensive family planning service is to give individuals and couples the greatest possible freedom to decide the number and spacing of their children.  I have yet to be convinced that girls under 15 years of age, who become pregnant, make that decision freely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister's attempt to prepare Ireland for the 21st century <i>vis-á-vis</i> family planning and human relationships.  Will he use his influence to change the statistical dataabase for the provision of live birth figures outside marriage?  The figure provided is usually associated with young single parents.  Live births outside marriage is an outdated mode of calculating, either promiscuity or sexual activity. There are many people in second <Col N="407" /> relationships whose children are categorised as live births outside marriage. To have the figures based on facts, will the Minister agree to have them broken down for young single parents as against mature established bonded relationships, the children of which are included in statistics as having been conceived outside marriage when in fact they were conceived in a second relationship?</P>

This is a matter for the Department of the Taoiseach.  The Central Statistics Office is accountable to the Department of the Taoiseach and the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Barrett, takes questions on statistics.

      <P>The Minister mentioned a figure of 57 live births to teenagers in 1993-94.  Will the Minister accept the tragic likelihood that even more teenagers had to travel to the United Kingdom to terminate pregnancies? Any measures which the Ministers for Health or Education introduce would have a welcome impact on such high abortion rates in Ireland, about which we like to forget.  Is he aware that the Irish Family Planning Association, who did a survey of young attenders to their clinics, found that many of them had been sexually active for 1.8 years before eventually seeking contraceptive advice?  For this reason, education should be targeted at a young age group as we must accept that young teenagers are sexually active.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Various claims are made but I do not think anybody knows the factual position.  Certainly a number of Irish women, whose pregnancies were terminated in the United Kingdom last year, gave <Col N="408" /> addresses in the Republic.  It is safe to speculate that quite a number also used addresses of convenience in the United Kingdom.  It is possible to guess the total number of Irish women who went to the United Kingdom but it is not possible from the statistics I have seen to break them down on the basis of age.  As I understand the UK law, abortion to persons under 16 years of age is not automatic, or for any other group.  As the Deputy suggests, I think it is true that young teenagers are sexually active. Parents should be aware of the fact that our sons and daughters are becoming sexually active at a far earlier age.  I compliment the Minister for Education on her ititiative last week.  This matter is more appropriate to the Department of Education if young persons' behavioural patterns are to be targeted by way of educational programmes through the schools.</P>

I appreciate the Minister has been in office a short time but will he agree that, while the Minister for Education has introduced a sex programme, there should be a greater emphasis on an integrated approach between the Departments of Health and Education?

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is of course a tragedy that anyone dies from a disease which could be prevented and it is a particular tragedy that approximately 75 women each year die from cervical cancer.  However, as in the discussion on the incidence of breast cancer, this must be put in context.  It is an enormous tragedy that 8,000 people die of cancer in Ireland each year and that 75 of these die of cervical cancer.  I intend to take initiatives in this area when I have studied the report, but I will not take an isolated initiative.  Cancer is the main killer in this country.  It is a national issue which needs a national response.  In that context I will deal with the recommendations in the report on cervical cancer &mdash; I am already committed to the Eccles Programme at the Mater Hospital.  These are very important issues, but they are set in the context of a wider issue which is equally important and which has not received very much attention.</P>

      <P>The project team for this centre was reconvened in 1994 to revise the original brief to take account of developments in the intervening period.  The facility will serve as the headquarters for the community care area and provide a wide range of services to the people of Waterford.  The present position is that the documents relating to stage 2 of the planning process are due to be formally submitted to my Department this month.  It is expected that building will commence later in the year and will take about 15 months to complete.</P>

      <P>I thank my constituency colleague for the reply which comes as no great surprise to me.  I put down this question on 9 January 1995 and about a week later I read about it <Col N="412" /> in one of the local newspapers.  I always thought the practice was that once a question had been put down it would not be dealt with until it arose in the House.  I wonder will the Government adhere to that convention.  The Minister stated that building will commence later this year.  That could be December 1995, and it could be 1997 before the headquarters is opened.  Will the Minister clarify the date?</P>

Those are the target dates but obviously the planning process must be gone through and as that is an open public process difficulties may arise, although I do not anticipate that.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am aware that certain difficulties exist in relation to the provision of appropriate accommodation for certain adolescents whose behaviour is such that they cannot be cared for within the existing range of child care facilities.  These difficulties relate both to the availability of suitable facilities and the lack of statutory powers to deal with such children.</P>
      <P>With regard to the availability of facilities, action is being taken to provide more residential places and other appropriate services.  For example, during 1994 approval was given to develop the following initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="414" /> In the Eastern Health Board a &ldquo;Carers for Young People Scheme&rdquo;, involving the selection of 50 families who will be trained to care for and manage difficult adolescents has been initiated and an eight place special therapeutic unit which will cater for children with behavioural problems who require intensive care will be developed.</P>
    <P>The Midland Health Board has been given approval to develop a new sixeight place short term residential unit for children in Moate in association with the Sisters of Mercy.  This unit will cater for children who are in need of crisis intervention, assessment or rehabilitation respite care.  An outreach programme to support children and their families will also be operated from the new facility.</P>
    <P>In the Mid-Western Health Board approval was given to an extension to the Good Shepherd Sisters' Hostel for Homeless Girls.  The North-Eastern Health Board is developing short term flexible living accommodation for children who are out-of-home.  In addition, the board is developing an &ldquo;on-the-street&rdquo; outreach service aimed at children at-risk.  The North-Western Health Board is increasing the level of funding to a hostel for young homeless at John Street, Sligo.  The South-Eastern Health Board is working with a local group on the development of a new hostel for homeless boys and girls in Waterford.</P>
    <P>The Southern Health Board has been given approval to develop a short-stay eight bed assessment unit as well as a new residential unit for six-seven girls in Killarney by arrangement with the Mercy Child Care Services.  The board will also provide four additional emergency beds for homeless boys in Cork and a hostel for homeless boys in Tralee.</P>
    <P>Finally, in the Western Health Board, work is proceeding on the development of a new eight bed unit for boys and girls at St. Joseph's in Lower Salthill replacing the existing old and inappropriate building.  Work on this project will be completed in 1995.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> The full year cost of the developments I have outlined is of the order of £2 million and, taken with the expansion of our community care and family support services, will go a long way towards filling the gaps in our current level of provision.</P>
    <P>On the legislative front, the Child Care Act was never designed to confer powers of custody or other forms of compulsory intervention on the health boards.  This was accepted recently by the High Court in judicial review proceedings brought against the Eastern Health Board regarding the provision of services to certain homeless youngsters.</P>
    <P>There is clearly a need for changes in the law to enable the State to cope with such children.  As the House will be aware, the Government has given my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, special responsibility for co-ordinating the activities of the Departments of Health, Education and Justice in the child care area.  It is intended that the provision of services to this group of children will be addressed in the context of these new co-ordination arrangements.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been significant expansion in child and adolescent psychiatric services in each health board with additional recruitment of child psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, etc.  Services for adolescents, whose primary need is for psychiatric and therapeutic care, are generally provided by child and adolescent psychiatric services.  A family-centered approach is adopted and the vast majority of cases are dealt with on a non-residential basis, with support being provided to families with whom the patient continues to reside.  In a small number of cases, adolescents with psychiatric problems may require in-patient treatment in a hospital or residential setting.</P>
    <P>My Department is in discussion with the health boards concerning their priorities for the further development of child and adolescent psychiatry.  Some health boards have indicated that residential accommodation for children and <Col N="416" /> adolescents with psychiatric disorders is among their priorities and my Department will be pursuing the matter with the boards in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree there has been a pathetic response by previous Governments to this issue in that to date the capital city, through the Eastern Health Board, has only eight beds &mdash; for males and females &mdash; for such children aged between 12-16 years?  Will he also agree that instead of seeking 50 foster families to look after these hardened, difficult, disruptive and often violent children we should be looking for 50 saints to fill a gap which the Department of Health has failed to fill to date?  Will he give a commitment that the policy of placing these 12-16 year old children in cells in local Garda stations or, worse, in wards in the Crumlin Children's Hospital &mdash; these are known as welfare placements &mdash; will cease immediately?  Is he aware of this practice, that recently a child was placed in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children and that the hospital authorities had to engage two psychiatric nurses on 24 hours prison guard service to look after this child who was drugged?</P>
      <P>This gives an indication of the number of these children who, because of a lack of services, end up in prisons and hospitals.  Instead of finding their way to the therapeutic and psychiatric services provided by the health boards they are going to jail.  This has been caused by the complete failure of the policy of successive Governments for dealing with those adolescents.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As Deputy Byrne said, this is a serious problem.  I think it is fair to say that the efforts being made to alleviate the problem and provide appropriate accommodation have been more successful in other health board areas than in that of the Eastern Health Board.  It is also true that the problems are very difficult to remediate under current statute.  One of the reasons the Minister of State, <Col N="417" /> Deputy Currie, was assigned responsibility at the Departments of Health, Education and Justice is that it is recognised that an interdepartmental and multi-disciplinary approach must be adopted to this problem and that someone must formulate the policy across the various Departments.  The Minister of State must have responsibility in these Departments if he is to give effect to what the Deputy suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>Apropos his last comment, if the Minister checks the files in the Department of Health I think he will find that I was the first Minister of State operating out of the Department of Health assigned responsibility to co-ordinate child care services between the Departments of Health, Education and Justice.  In fact, I was responsible for the eight bed facility at Glen House.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the progress made in the provisions of child care in conjunction with the implementation of the Child Care Act, will the Minister agree it is important to draw a clear distinction between the provision of facilities for young children who find themselves without a home for a variety of social reasons and the provision of facilities for children with behavioural and other problems?  Is the Minister aware that a number of young people &mdash; sadly this number seems to be growing &mdash; cannot be accommodated in the ordinary school system and that they come under the auspices of the health board?  As part of the substantial resources made available by the previous Government for the implementation of the Child Care Act, will the Minister endeavour in so far as possible to provide special therapeutic accommodation for young people with serious behavioural problems in each health board area?  This will give young people who are disturbed for a variety of reasons the sort of services to which they are entitled and which may prevent them becoming involved in confrontations with the law, their families etc.  The resources are there and committed by his predecessor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I accept the points made by the Deputy but we should try to pinpoint the problem &mdash; the focus is too wide.  There is a small but growing number of youngsters who are so unmanageable that they cannot be catered for within the existing range of residential centres.  In some cases children as young as ten and 12 years of age are sleeping rough and have been expelled from a series of children's homes because their behaviour cannot be controlled, they pose a threat to the other residents and staff.  The behaviour of these children might appear to be bizare to many people but, under medical examination, the majority of them are found not to be psychiatrically disturbed and they are certainly not disturbed so as to allow the authorities detain them under the mental treatment Acts.</P>
      <P>It is true also that because they have committed no offences, they cannot be detained under the auspices of the Department of Education and responsibility for putting a roof over their heads falls back on the health boards under sections 3 and 5 of the Child Care Act. This is not an easy problem to solve and attempts have been made to do so, for example, by putting individual children into houses and providing staff to look after them.  It would frighten the Deputy to know what the maintenance of a child in those circumstances has cost health boards on an annual basis.</P>
      <P>I will continue to pursue the initiatives taken by my predecessor and I hope a wider range of facilities can be put in place but there is no ready-made solution.  Deputy Byrne is wrong to throw cold water on the idea that foster families could be encouraged to take some disruptive youngsters because one should not discount the impact of tender loving care, even on the most wayward child, and that will be found more readily, in my view, within a family than within an institution.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that a recent Eastern Health Board report on homelessness in the Dublin area indicated that more than one-third of the children presenting as homeless to hostels and bed and breakfast premises had previously been in the care of the State?  We must examine the quality of the residential care centres we offer. We have nobody else to blame if the children who are presenting as homeless at 17 were, at the age of 15, in the care of the State.  There is a failure somewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Galway company in question has suffered continuing substantial financial losses due to difficult trading conditions. Cost-saving measures were implemented last year, in agreement with the workforce, with a view to putting the company on a viable basis and safeguarding employment.  Unfortunately, financial losses have escalated leading to the closure decision following discussions between management and unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is no longer a share-holder in Greencore and, as a result, has no direct role in how the company conducts its business.  I am sure Members will share my concern at the loss of employment involved.  However, I can assure the Deputy and the House that <Col N="420" /> the industrial development agencies are working closely with the parent company with a view to attracting an alternative industry to the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that for 60 years Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, subsequently Irish Sugar plc and now Greencore plc, operated in Tuam until in 1986 the Minister's Government decided to close the Tuam sugar factory?  During that period it employed 900 people directly and 300 people indirectly.  As a result of this decision by Greencore plc, those 1,200 people who have been employed in the greater Tuam area for almost 65 years are facing unemployment with only ten permanent jobs remaining.  What does the Minister propose to do about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty with this company has been one of accumulating losses.  I know the Labour Relations Commission was actively involved in negotiations to try to secure the future of that company last year and there was a restructuring package.  Unfortunately, despite that restructuring package, losses continued to escalate.  I know also that Forbairt was involved with the company some years ago in putting together a package of investment to try to improve its performance but again, unfortunately, that did not succeed.  The problem now is that the losses have accumulated to a point where the company, which is a private company and not State owned, can no longer sustain that.  The issue now for the Government is to use our industrial agencies to seek alternative employment in Tuam.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that for the year ended 30 September 1994 Greencore plc had a gross profit of £39.7 million on a turnover of £393.7 million, leaving them with a net profit of £33.7 million?  Is he not prepared to intervene with the company, which has made lucrative profits as a result of its trading over the past number of years and has made much gain from activities in Tuam over many years, and direct it <Col N="421" /> to make a major investment in this operation so that it can continue to provide proper employment there?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy misunderstands the Government's relationship with Greencore.  Greencore is now a wholly private company.  The Government is not in a position to issue directives of any sort to such a company. The only remaining link the Government has with the company is in respect of the control we would have should it suggest disposing of its beet quota.  It is not open to me as Minister to direct a private company to do anything of the nature suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is misinterpreting me.  I am not misinterpreting the situation <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Minister's responsibilities toward the Greencore operation.  This contrasts palely when one compares Tuam Engineering Limited with Packard Electric which received much attention from the Minister and his fellow Ministers.  The parent company in this case is a palpable, indigenous one and the Minister must be aware that, for some years, both the IDA and Forbairt have designated Tuam as a chronic unemployment blackspot.  In view of that, I am not asking the Minister to direct Greencore, I am asking him to intervene personally and, failing that, to give a commitment to this House as to what he proposes to do to alleviate chronic unemployment in the Tuam area.</P>

The problem is that this company has accumulated losses that have escalated in recent years despite efforts both by Forbairt and by the workers and management involved to restructure its operations and to achieve profitability.  Those efforts, unfortunately, have not met with success and it is not an issue for us to seek alternative employment in Tuam and the industrial agencies will be making every effort to do that.</P>

      <P>In support of Deputy Treacy, I too am disappointed that the Minister does not intend to intervene in Tuam as he has in other areas, even though only a short time in office.  If, as it appears, nothing will be done by the Government, has the Minister any proposals to at least ease the pain for the workers by improving the severance package which is not a good one for them?  Has the Minister any information about the funding made available by the Irish Sugar Company?  I am referring to the £2 million to build a second advance factory in the town of Tuam.</P>

      <P>I do not have information about a second advance factory. However, if the Deputy wishes to put down a question, I will endeavour to get the information for him.  Greencore is a private company and the issue of severance payments falls to be negotiated between that company, the workers and their representatives.  It is not an area where I have a role.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support both requests made by Deputy Kitt.  The <Col N="423" /> Minister has a statutory responsibility pertaining to redundancy.  As a result of negotiations over years to bring this company to viability the workers agreed to forfeit Greencore's contribution as an employer to the pension fund.  Now, as they are faced with redundancy, they are being denied the single year's contribution which the company did not contribute.  Will the Minister intervene with Greencore to ensure that this is made available to the unfortunate workers?</P>

      <P>When the debate adjourned before Question Time I was saying that this was a far-reaching Bill, the implications of which are crucial not only for landowners but for the community as a whole, and that it is vital to tackle the issues in order to contain soaring insurance costs and at the same time preserve and enhance our tradition of sport, recreation and leisure.</P>
      <P>People have seen this Bill in a limited light, as affecting principally farmers and the farming community for whom it has major implications.  Consequently, it is not surprising that landowners have taken a great interest and will have much to say on Committee Stage. People involved in recreational pursuits within the city areas will also be concerned about the implications of this Bill because it will cover access to community halls, school premises, swimming pools and children's playgrounds and will affect occupiers other than the landowner.</P>
      <P>This is an era of community development and many local communities, with assistance from the State in many cases, are developing local facilities and amenities and extending their support to children and people in general in the community, and this legislation has implications for them also.  That is why it is important on Committee Stage to consider the implications of the legislation for the local communities and development groups and provide support for them so that these measures will not prevent them from engaging in and extending these worthwhile community-based activities.</P>
      <P>This legislation also has implications for the householder.  There are many anomalies in the law relating to injuries sustained on the householder's property.  There are large and small landowners around the country but there are many tiny landowners in cities and we must take care of their interests and ensure that the Bill meets their needs in this age.  All of these matters fall to be considered on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has been under consideration for quite some time and I congratulate the Minister on bringing it to the House.  Although I may differ with <Col N="512" /> the Minister as to the detail of it, its purpose and intention is good.  However, the lack of precision in the law is the result of many court judgments over the years, some more and some less sympathetic to the interests of the occupier. The law is not clear.  Each judge has to decide on the extent of the duty of care which the occupier owes.  The test of reasonableness is applied and each case is decided on its merits.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now essentially trying to codify the position and spell out the criteria and the factors which will determine the liability of the landowner.  I am not convinced that the new code is any simpler or clearer than the existing law and I do not think the enactment of this Bill in its present form will reduce the volume of litigation or the insurance cost that landowners must bear.  If anything, I think the proposed code is more complex than the case law it replaces and introduces into each case not fewer but more issues to be left to the judge to decide.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us the net effect he wishes to achieve in this Bill?  He should have set out either in his speech or in the explanatory memorandum a comparison of the proposed and existing measures and, perhaps, some clear examples of cases which under the old system would give rise to liability for the occupier but for which under the new system the occupier would not be liable. Some of these examples would be very helpful to Members in understanding in a very clear way the implications of this Bill.  They would also be helpful to the Minister and his staff in clarifying the impact of the measures we are considering.  I find it very hard to beat a clearcut example when you compare what happens in present circumstances with what would happen under changed circumstances.  It is when you get down to looking at it in that detail&mdash;perhaps the Minister may give us some examples of that kind on Committee Stage&mdash;that you begin to see the real implications and whether we are making any real progress or not or whether in effect it will be beneficial to the occupier or the householder as the case may be.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="513" /> I am, of course, prepared to co-operate with the Minister on Committee Stage if the end result he has in mind is similar to what I have in mind.  I was interested to note that the explanatory memorandum tells us: &ldquo;(3) The proposals in the Bill, will not involve any charge on the Exchequer&rdquo;, yet the Bill imposes a level of liability on the Office of Public Works in respect of national monuments which may be more onerous than at present.  It is a pity that in attempting to codify the case law the Minister has chosen to introduce new terminology such as &ldquo;visitor&rdquo; and &ldquo;recreational user&rdquo;.  The old labels were well established and could quite easily have been adopted and adopted as needs be. Instead we are to have a somewhat farcical result of a plaintiff seeking damages from an occupier in respect of an overcrowded dance hall having to prove at one and the same time that he was a &ldquo;visitor&rdquo; in respect of the state of the floor or the stairs, for example, and &ldquo;an invitee&rdquo; in common law in respect of the overcrowding.</P>
    <P>What is an &ldquo;entrant&rdquo; and when is his or her presence unlawful?  Why not call a spade a spade, if the Minister means a trespasser why not say so?  May I make this helpful suggestion?  Why not take the draft Bill over to the Insurance Federation and ask it for its views and the percentage it might reduce public liability premium by for farmers and landowners?  The Minister may be surprised at the answer he will receive.  The insurers will be particularly concerned about the impact of the Bill's provisions on occupiers other than farmers.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister did not consider the village hall, the school, the swimming pool, the railway station, the Garda station, the courtroom, the pub, the apartment block or the house in flats.  All of these are issues which we must consider in greater detail for Committee Stage.  We are all aware of increasing litigation in these circumstances which is leading to exorbitant costs and to almost insurmountable difficulties for people who wish to carry on business.  We regularly get such complaints from people in the community <Col N="514" /> who are trying to carry on a business. We need to explore and develop these issues on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>How are we to reconcile the farmer's legitimate annoyance about insurance costs with the freedoms we have all enjoyed such as strolling, hill climbing or sightseeing in the countryside?  We must examine in particular the impact of the Bill's proposals on two groups, namely tourists and children.  The last thing anyone wants to see is gates closing or warning notices indicating hostility to all strangers.  Farmers have been very open and hospitable during the years and we should do our utmost to continue in that way.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Bill should encourage farmers to erect warning notices as it clearly does in section 5 (5).  Even if they only apply in the case of visitors the notices will no doubt go up and we will all be the losers.  In section 5 (2) (a) another notice is suggested purporting to restrict the landowner's liability. Neither notice will be effective on a case by case basis and if they are of no real benefit to the landowner why encourage this form of visual pollution?</P>
    <P>I am somewhat puzzled by the reference to the Bill in the new programme for Government which, states that the Bill would be &ldquo;reviewed in the context of further careful examination of the legal and constitutional position as it relates to minors&rdquo;.  Perhaps the Minister might enlighten us in due course.  The Minister said &ldquo;nonetheless I do appreciate that this issue is one which has given rise to some concern on the part of those who feel that their position is somewhat prejudiced by the proposed provision in relation to minors.  I am at present reviewing the provision relating to minors in accordance with the commitment in the Government's programme.&rdquo;  He then said, &ldquo;I will listen closely to the views of Deputies as expressed in the forthcoming debate and the provision will be considered carefully by me in the light of those views and of others in advance of the Committee Stage&rdquo;.  I would have thought that the Minister would have brought his views here today.</P>

      <P>No.  This is an issue that has arisen since the Bill was published. It has arisen in a very genuine and real way because people were concerned about these issues and they expressed their views.  We all know that the IFA, ICMSA and various groups have expressed reservations and concerns. That is the normal procedure and the reason a Bill is published in the first instance is that the public can consider it and put their views on it.</P>
      <P>This Government is not working in the way we used to work.  The Government has told us it is reviewing the matter and one would expect that it would now tell us its thinking on it.  Perhaps the Minister will give us that information in his reply.  We will then know the Minister's thinking and how to approach Committee Stage.  We can do the homework for the Minister if that is necessary but he has expert public servants available to him who will watch and note the changes and nuances in the media.  They will bring proposals and suggestions for dealing with the issues which will arise to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Who wrote the piece for the Government programme?  The Minister has repeated that he is reviewing it in the light of what happened.  The Minister should tell us what he has in mind.  We would be delighted to hear it.</P>
      <P>The provisions relating to children are contained in section 4 (3).  I do not know the significance of listing the age of the child when his or her ability to appreciate the danger is separately listed.  These are matters to which the court is to have regard when determining whether the occupier acted with reckless disregard.  Does &ldquo;acting&rdquo; include omitting to act?  These are examples of the Bill passing the buck to the court.</P>
      <P>The bottom line is that it will be some years before we know whether these provisions are any less onerous or expensive for landowners.  The Bill poses questions which will not be answered until new cases produce judgements on which insurers may rely.  A fundamental question which must be addressed is whether the level of insurance premia for farmers bears any relationship to the level of claims.  A more imaginative approach may be required and interested parties should be consulted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are addressing here is <Col N="517" /> whether persons injured on another's property should be compensated and to what extent.  Why not consider a system of no fault liability for serious personal injury with a fund provided by the insurers funded through the imposition of a flat levy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>For less serious injuries, complete exemption from liability in the case of the trespasser or recreational user.  Such a system might stem from the flow of cases and reassure landowners. We can discuss these matters in detail on Committee Stage.  We support the Minister's general purpose and intentions but the Bill needs a great deal of discussion and amendment on Committee Stage.  It has the potential to greatly improve the position for occupiers, enhance our traditional openness to leisure and recreation and strengthen urban rural relations to everyone's advantage.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he would like the Bill to have a speedy passage.  We will co-operate with the Minister but within the terms of getting the Bill right.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill. As the Minister is aware, I have raised this matter at every conceivable opportunity and as late as this morning during the debate on the Heritage Council Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is long awaited legislation and as Deputy Woods said it is not a question of rushing it through but one of getting the legislation right.  I appreciate the great legal difficulties involved.  It is not just a matter of waving a magic wand. I am sure the Minister appreciates that landowners are genuinely worried.  In my constituency landowners were happy to allow people onto their land <Col N="518" /> but now they are afraid to do so because they are aware of the legal difficulties they could encounter.</P>
    <P>I was a little disheartened by the Minister's contribution.  He said that some sectors&mdash;perhaps he was referring to the farming sector because I know a similar reference was made by them&mdash;were not prepared to act as guardian angels.  I do not believe this remark was made in a flippant way. They are genuinely concerned, particularly where minors are concerned.  The Minister stated that the Bill does not say an occupier owes such minors the common duty of care nor does it say that the occupier is strictly liable for whatever accident may befall such an entrant. That may be the case but the problem is that the general approach taken by the court where minors are concerned has always been in favour of the minor in these types of cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister may recognise this because later he referred to the case where a minor might be in the company of another person and the extent of the supervision and control which that person might reasonably be expected to exercise over the minors' activities will be relevant in determining whether an occupier has acted with reckless disregard.  That highlights the difficulties involved where minors are concerned but it does not address the main problem of where there would be a lone child trespasser on the land and the onus of responsibility that would fall upon the landowner under the law.</P>
    <P>On access to national monuments, which is of particular concern, some farmers have erected notices saying they do not wish people to enter their lands to view national monuments.  To gain access to national monuments interested parties must cross private lands causing legal difficulties when an accident occurs.  I worry about this aspect, bearing in mind the growth of what is now known as &ldquo;cultural tourism&rdquo;.  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht mentioned it in the House this morning when he said it was necessary to adopt a balanced approach contending that, while landowners have their rights there is a right for all who <Col N="519" /> wish to see part of our national heritage and visit such national monuments.  In order to ensure the best possible co-operation landowners must be protected against any legal difficulties or costs that may arise through accidents on their lands.</P>
    <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Woods, for allowing me to make this short contribution.  No doubt we will have greater opportunity on Committee Stage to discuss the Bill in more detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been waiting so long today for other Members to finish I am tempted to remain seated.  I too welcome this Bill which has had a long gestation.  As other Members have said, many of its provisions require improvement.</P>
      <P>As we are all aware, probably there is no other country in Europe as litigious as ours.  The last 15 years saw the growth of a claims culture that has become an open wound in our society.  As those involved in local government will know, we have now reached the stage at which the amounts spent by many local authorities on compensation claims far exceed amounts spent repairing roads and foothpaths.  Members of the public, egged on by a small number of greedy unscrupulous lawyers, are encouraged to view a minor fall, scratch, graze or pulled muscle as an alternative to winning the national lottery.  Indeed I understand that a hole in a road in Cork city has yielded no less than £2.5 million in claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the insurance implications for the ordinary citizens, for normal human activities, work and leisure, its other effects are devastating.  No area of human activity has been spared the paralysis that has accompanied this rising tide of claims.  For instance, in our schools, teachers can no longer send their students around the corner to the local library; on farms farmers can no longer dig a silage pit without worrying that somebody will fall into it.  Public houses, clubs, and hotels are sued by <Col N="520" /> drunks who fall off bar stools; supermarkets are being sued for trivial injuries by people who fall on their premises.  This &ldquo;compo culture&rdquo; as it is often termed, means that we are all prevented from engaging in the types of activity we enjoy.</P>
    <P>In one housing development near my constituency in Stillorgan, a playground was built for the children of families moving in, which is not very usual.  That developer is worthy of praise for having had the imagination and consideration to set a portion of land aside for that facility.  The children were beginning to take great delight in playing on the swings, slides and in climbing the frames with great enthusiasm when disaster struck.  The insurance company refused to insure the playground.  The property management company regarded itself as having no option but to close the playground.  It called in the bulldozers.  I believe it was a pitiful sight to see those poor children watch their playground being razed to the ground.</P>
    <P>While we in Ireland may be bad, the &ldquo;compo culture&rdquo; is becoming almost as prevalent and highly developed in England.  For example, a pop concert scheduled to take place on the Isle of Wight in June next was cancelled because council officials were afraid those attending might fall of the cliffs. One can well imagine the claims that would result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to talk to some senior counsel about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The culture of dependency in which we live has reached the stage at which people are no longer willing to accept responsibility for their actions.  I suppose that is no wonder since our tax and social welfare laws tend to force people into dependence on the State, to such an extent that their autonomy and dignity, as human beings, is eroded.  When accidents happen, as they always will, many people will now embark immediately on a hunt for a scapegoat.  They never ask themselves what they could have done to avoid the <Col N="521" /> accident in the first place; hardly ever will they hold themselves responsible. When I was a child and tripped on the pavement or anything else usually I was asked by my parents: &ldquo;Why were you not looking where you were going?&rdquo; I am afraid today's children are much more frequently asked by their concerned parents whether there were any witnesses.</P>
      <P>As other Members have rightly said, the occupiers of land probably have been hit hardest by this &ldquo;compo culture&rdquo;.  It is important to stress, as did Deputy Woods, that all categories of property owners are affected &mdash; landowners, small farmers and urban householders, no matter how small are the properties are affected by high insurance premia which have led to the growth of what is termed &ldquo;defensive ownership&rdquo;.  Many farm owners have been forced to exclude the public from their lands, not because they wish to but because they have no choice.  In turn, this has severely restricted the innocent activities of such people as hill climbers, ramblers, fishermen, scouting organisations and others.  Of course, its effect on the tourist industry is unquantifiable.</P>
      <P>This Bill constitutes a small step along the road to improving the lot of occupiers, in particular farmers, when people may be injured on their lands, but it does not go far enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law to date is complex and confused.  The common law recognised four categories of entrants to land &mdash; contractual entrants, invitees, licensees and trespassers &mdash; a different duty being owed to each category of entrant.  In section 2 it is proposed to make a clean sweep of all the duties, liabilities and rights attached under common law to occupiers of premises and to replace those four categories of entrants with three &mdash; visitors, recreational users and trespassers.  In the case of visitors, under the provisions of section 3, an occupier of premises owes a duty to take such care as is reasonable in all the circumstances to ensure that such a visitor does not suffer injury or damage by reason of any danger existing on the premises. <Col N="522" /> This is termed &ldquo;the common duty of care&rdquo;.  In the case of recreational users and trespassers, the duty owned by the occupier, as provided for in section 4 (1) (a) and (b) is:</P>
    <P>(a)  not to injure the person or damage the property of the person intentionally, and</P>
    <P>(b)  not to act with reckless disregard for the person or the property of the person,...</P>
    <P>This aspect of the Bill is clearly a crucial one, since it is in sections 3 and 4 that the main provisions with regard to liability are specified.  If these provisions do not achieve what they set out to achieve, the Bill will be valueless.</P>
    <P>Section 3 imposes a duty on occupiers to take reasonable care that visitors do not suffer injury, &ldquo;visitors&rdquo; include persons entering the land, as of right, persons who have been invited to enter and persons entering the premises on foot of a contract.  It will be seen, therefore, that the category of &ldquo;visitors&rdquo; includes patrons of shops, hotels, pubs, restaurants and the like.</P>
    <P>My difficulty with this aspect is that the duty on the occupier to take reasonable care is vague and ill-defined.  It remains to be seen whether this will afford any protection whatsoever to, say, the owners of supermarkets, pubs and the like who have been plagued by a rash of trivial claims, so called &ldquo;slip and fall&rdquo; claims, many of which it is fair to say are not brought by plaintiffs out of a burning desire for justice but rather out of greed and a desire to cash in on a minor incident.  It remains to be seen whether this provision will make any difference whatsoever to the law.</P>
    <P>I note that section 5 allows an occupier, by agreement, to restrict his or her duty to visitors or other categories of entrants.  While that in principle is welcome it will be effective only if the restriction is reasonable and displayed on a sign or notice that the occupier has taken reasonable steps to bring to the attention of the visitor.  In that respect I agree with Deputy Woods' comments <Col N="523" /> about having signs all over the lands.  It remains to be proved whether section 5 will be of any assistance to occupiers of commercial premises.  The presence of the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; will give the courts ample scope to find in favour of plaintiffs in hard cases.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 4, I welcome that the Government made special provisions for recreational users.  Clearly, it is in everyone's interest that there should be maximum freedom to engage in outdoor activities, such as walking, rambling or visiting historic sites and national monuments.  If farmers and landowners are not to close their gates to persons engaging in such activities, it is crucial that the Bill should provide for the lowest possible level of liability. However the Bill failed to do that.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides that the duty in relation to recreational users is not to injure them intentionally or to act with reckless disregard for their safety.  So far so good.  However, subsection (2) includes a host of restrictions and modifications on this basic principle.  It provides that, in determining whether the occupier has acted with reckless disregard, regard must be had to all the circumstances of the case, including whether the occupier knew or had reasonable grounds for believing that a danger existed on the premises; whether the occupier knew or had reasonable grounds for believing that the person was, or was likely to be, on the premises and whether the occupier knew, or had reasonable grounds for believing, that the person was in, or was likely to be in, the vicinity of the place where the danger existed, the list continues.  The danger with this section is that it has the capacity fatally to undermine the restricted duty of care to trespassers and recreational users which section 4 (1) attempts to introduce.</P>
    <P>We all know judges are human, we also know that hard cases make bad law. There is no area of law where this principle has been so well illustrated as the field of occupiers' liability.  Lawyers in the House will know that the cases of <Col N="524" /> Purtill <i>v.</i> Athlone UDC and McNamara <i>v.</i> ESB involving child trespassers, illustrate this very clearly.  The danger inherent in this part of the Bill is that a hard case will come before the courts, probably involving a child, where a trespasser or a recreational user will decide to sue a landowner alleging that the landowner had acted with reckless disregard.  In such a case judges are practically being invited to redefine the whole concept of &ldquo;acting with reckless disregard&rdquo; to include a particular hard luck case.</P>
    <P>The particular danger lies in the presence of the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;.  A simple example illustrates that point.  Under section 4 (2) (a) one of the factors to be taken into account by the court in deciding whether the occupier acted with reckless disregard is whether the occupier knew or had reasonable grounds for believing that there was a danger on his or her land.  In other words, the occupier need not have actual knowledge of the danger.  An occupier may also be found liable if the court forms the view that he or she ought to have known of the danger.  In other words, the occupier will be judged, not in accordance with subjective standards or what he or she knew, but in accordance with objective standards of what a court decided he or she ought to have known.  If Members read the remainder of that subsection which sets out the other matters required to be taken into account by the court, they will see that this objective standard of liability is imported into almost every one of them.</P>
    <P>There is another difficulty in that in law, the concept of recklessness is regarded as denoting behaviour which is worse, more inadvertent and more blameworthy than negligence.  The test of negligence has always been a failure to take reasonable care.  What the Minister has done here is to mix the two concepts of recklessness and negligence.  An occupier is liable when he acts with &ldquo;reckless disregard&rdquo; but when we check how &ldquo;reckless disregard&rdquo; is defined we see it is by reference to the concept of <Col N="525" />&ldquo;reasonableness&rdquo;.  In other words, &ldquo;recklessness&rdquo; is redefined as &ldquo;negligence&rdquo;.  The Minister is issuing an open invitation to the courts to judge occupiers when they are sued by a trespasser in accordance with the standard of negligence.  That is not an improvement in the position that prevails at common law, it is a substantial disimprovement.</P>

I wish him well in his new ministerial post and I am sure by now he realises he is responsible for a complex Department.  I look forward to future debates here and in committee and I am sure we will have edge and endeavour in our enterprises together.</P>
      <P>I raise the matter of the Borland International firm in my national role as Opposition spokesperson on Enterprise and Employment and on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Ray Burke.  On 18 January the firm announced a reconstruction of its organisation which by 31 March will amount to a closure of the Dublin facility and the loss of approximately 80 jobs.  The firm and its employees have enjoyed an excellent working relationship under the present management of Borland International and in the early 1980s under the management of the Ashton Tate Corporation as it was known previously.  The announcement of the anticipated potential closure was made in the light of company restructuring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we are nearing the end of January and before more time elapses, will the Minister make direct contact through his office with that firm to see if the decision can be either reversed or mitigated.  The potential closure of that firm would be a distinct loss, particularly to an area like Swords, which has serious <Col N="526" /> unemployment problems, as have most areas in Ireland.  I emphasise the strong work ethic of the workforce.  There has been an excellent working relationship between the previous and present management and workers.  The firm is recognised worldwide as having a very good product and it seems that the US decision to restructure its organisation is the dreadful effect that part of it will be the closure of the Swords plant.  I was very interested in how the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, dealt with the industrial dispute in Packard Electric.  Before Christmas I said that the Ministers should intervene in the dispute and take all the measures, which if implemented with rapidity and skill, could be effective.  While that proved to be the case it was nearly unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister has the enviable back-up of very skilled civil servants in his Department.  I pay tribute to their dedication in serving Ministers of the day.  Be that as it may, there is a tradition in Kildare Street of non-inter-ventionist action, perhaps one should say &ldquo;inaction&rdquo;.  As I said, there are good skills in the section of the Department that was formerly the Department of Labour.  I believe the Department, having regard to the global market, the changing economic climate, demands for market and industrial relationships, realises that there must be intervention.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say recently that a special unit will be set up &mdash; I expect it will be additional to the competitiveness and employment protection unit which is operating satisfactorily in a modest way &mdash; to anticipate potential industrial difficulties and head them off before they arise.  The potential closure of this firm does not arise as a result of an industrial difficulty because there is a good working relationship in the firm.  In a little over two months a nice tidy compact company in Swords, County Dublin, making a good product, with efficient workers, will close.  Even at this stage it should be possible for the Minister to adopt the type of tactics about which I have often <Col N="527" /> spoken.  Will he ensure that Borland International is given the necessary encouragement to remain <i>in situ</i> and keep its viable operation open?</P>

      <P>On 17 January 1995, Borland International announced it was restructuring its organisation with a reduction in staff numbers worldwide by 650, from 1,700 to 1,050.  The reduction involves the closure of its Swords plant &mdash; where 83 people are employed &mdash; by 31 March 1995.</P>
      <P>Borland International, with its headquarters in Scotts Valley, California is a database software company founded in 1983.  The company grew rapidly to sales of $430 million and employed 1,700 people in 1994.  It became involved in Ireland in 1991 when it acquired a competitor, Ashton Tate Corporation who already had a software operation in Swords since 1988.  It was originally scheduled to grow to 90 people and, indeed, employment peaked at 110 in 1992 but has now dropped back to 83.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Borland International achieved rapid growth in a short period.  It attempted to win market share by undercutting prices of much larger and more powerful competitors including Microsoft, Lotus and Novell.  This happened at a time of intense competition which is continuing in both personal computer hardware and software markets.  While the strategy succeeded in increasing Borland's sales, it had a devastating effect on profits.  In the quarter to 31 <Col N="528" /> December 1994, analysts expect Borland to lose $17 million with a further $15 million loss forecasted for the following quarter.</P>
    <P>In an attempt to reduce costs, Borland has decided to outsource manufacturing functions to third parties.  In recent years this has become a strong trend among software companies. Software manufacturing functions lend themselves to economies of scale.  Outside third parties can carry out these functions for many software companies much more efficiently and at a lower cost.  This trend is expected to increase even further in the future as software companies concentrate on their core competence of development and marketing, leaving routine production and certain other functions to third parties. Borland's decision to outsource manufacturing will involve the loss of the 83 jobs in the Swords plant which is engaged in manufacturing.  The company is currently engaged in discussions with a number of other companies to outsource its manufacturing on a world-wide basis.  Two of these companies have operations in Ireland.  I do not propose to name these companies as this could have an adverse effect on negotiations at this stage.</P>
    <P>In general, the software industry in Ireland has been making excellent progress over the past number of years. From a base of 8,000 employed in 1992. it is intended to grow the sector to 20,000 jobs by the end of the decade. In 1993 employment had risen to almost 9,000 and the trend is still on an upward curve.  Employment is divided almost equally between indigenous and overseas companies.</P>
    <P>Significant emphasis is now being put on the development of indigenous industry in Ireland and the indigenous software sector is no exception.  We have a national software directorate in place and I hope to be in a position very shortly to announce the launch of a development capital fund for software. Lack of venture capital funds has been identified as a major issue facing indigenous software companies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="529" /> While the information technology area has been going through some turbulent times.  Ireland has been doing particularly well overall.  For example, there have been two major developments in the electronics area in north County Dublin and one in Swords in particular.</P>
    <P>Last year, Motorola, who already employ 800 people in Swords, announced proposals which will create an additional 2,650 jobs in the town by 1998.  Work on fitting out buildings is underway and I expect the company to begin recruiting full time staff in the near future.  Motorola is the world leader in the telecommunications industry with a track record of over 65 years. The products to be made in Swords &mdash; battery chargers, pagers and two-way radios among others &mdash; are at the core of the corporation's business.</P>
    <P>In nearby Clonshaugh Industrial Estate in Coolock, Gateway 2000 has established a European telemarketing, technical support and production centre for personal computers.  The company will employ up to 618 in three substantial telemarketing groups to address primarily the United Kingdom, French and German markets and, in addition, will employ 403 people in the manufacture and test of personal computers.  These jobs are all due to be in place by 1998. Projected employment in 1994 was originally put at 196, but by the end of the year employment was actually 500.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that steps have already been taken to meet the company.  A meeting was held today between the IDA and Borland management.  A further meeting has been arranged for 13 February next.  Discussions are centering on how the work that is being outsourced can be secured in Ireland.  The IDA is also assessing the future for the premises and the possibility of locating alternative activity there.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Allen on his appointment as Minister of <Col N="530" /> State at the Department of Education and Deputies Richard Bruton, Noonan and Deenihan on their appointments.</P>
      <P>Due to traffic congestion in the Summerhill area of Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim, the local residents protested in the week following the opening of the new comprehensive school.  This led to major problems for students attending the school, and those travelling by bus had to be dropped off approximately a half a mile from the school.  In the present inclement weather conditions this caused grave concern to parents, teachers and pupils.</P>
      <P>I intervened in the case two weeks ago and secured agreement from Bus Éireann, the residents, the local authority, the parents' association and school management that a site adjacent to the comprehensive school &mdash; which is used as a parking area for the sports complex and the school &mdash; could be used as a parking area for school buses. As this area is adjacent to the school it would alleviate the dangers that arise when children are dropped off a half a mile from the school.  The local residents agreed the position could continue for two weeks pending an application by the school management to the Department for insurance cover to indemnify the trustees of the sports complex if any person was injured while alighting from a bus in the area.  We are awaiting a reply from the Department.</P>
      <P>Unofficially the Department has informed me and the school that it is not in a position to extend insurance cover to the area in question, but I do not accept that because the area is used by the pupils on a daily basis when using the sports complex which is part of the site on which the new school is located. The Minister of State has taken a personal interest in the matter in the past 24 hours and I hope that interest will yield the result everybody seeks.  My colleague, Senator Reynolds, who is a member of the Minister's party, Senator Mooney and other Members of the Oireachtas have also raised the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important this concession is <Col N="531" /> given.  The route used by the buses is also used by ambulances based in St. Patrick's Hospital.  This could cause problems in the case of an emergency as there could be major delays in the event of a traffic jam on Summerhill.  The residents of Summerhill feel that the increased traffic which would result from the buses being routed through Summerhill exceeds what the area can take.  In this day and age pupils should not be asked to walk a half mile to the school carrying heavy bags in inclement weather.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State can accede to my request to have the insurance cover extended to this area only for the use of students attending the school.  Nobody else can expect to have insurance cover by the Department of Education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ellis for raising this matter and also Senator Reynolds who discussed the matter with me privately.</P>
      <P>I understand that this matter has arisen from a group of residents, living in the Summerhill area adjacent to the newly opened Carrick-on-Shannon Community School, objecting to six school buses ferrying pupils to and from the school using the Summerhill road.</P>
      <P>The residents have stated that the buses will cause traffic congestion in their area and they have requested that the buses use an alternative route.  The alternative routes are the Circular Road which I understand is narrow and in poor condition and would require upgrading at considerable cost and a secondary route linking the N4 Dublin &mdash;Sligo road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A meeting was held on 13 January 1995 between representatives of Leitrim County Council, representatives of Bus Éireann, the Summerhill Residents' Association, the Parents' Association of the school and the local transport liaison officer.  A temporary arrangement was reached for a two week period which allows three buses use the Summerhill <Col N="532" /> road and three buses use the Circular Road.</P>
    <P>In planning the building of the new community school in Carrick-on-Shannon, the Department envisaged that the Summerhill road would be used as the school bus route leading to the school. To facilitate the safe alighting and embarking by the students, the Department provided extensive footpaths and a set down point for school buses along the north perimeter of the school site bordering the public road linking with the Summerhill road.  The cost of these works was £10,000.  There were no objections from local residents while this arrangement was being put in place.</P>
    <P>It would not be possible for buses using either of the alternative routes to use the designated set down point to the north of the school site.  Therefore, it has been suggested that the car park belonging to the sports complex situated to the south of the school site would be a suitable bus park venue.  This proposal would entail a walk of up to 200 metres for the students.</P>
    <P>The sports complex in question is privately owned and is vested in trustees, whose permission would be required to allow for its use as a bus park and it is not known at this point if this would be forthcoming.  The car park may also require re-surfacing and other remedial works at considerable further expense.</P>
    <P>In addressing the question of insurance in respect of the car park for use as a set down and pick up point for the students who travel to school by school bus the question of extending the school insurance cover to the car park would have to be considered so as to indemnify the trustees from any insurance claims arising from any accidents or damage.  With regard to community schools, the State provides a general indemnity to the authorities of these schools in lieu of their taking out insurance cover against liabilities which may arise.  The State indemnity, however, does not extend beyond the perimeter of the school premises except in circumstances where pupils are required to use premises outside the <Col N="533" /> school grounds as part of the school curriculum.  For example, in this particular case the pupils of Carrick-on-Shannon community school use the sports complex for physical education purposes and this is covered by the State indemnity.  In such circumstances the school must arrange for adequate supervision of the students.</P>
    <P>In view of the significant exposure which would be involved in extending the State indemnity to the car park and having regard to the expense which this Department has already gone to in providing footpaths and set down points to secure the safety of pupils arriving at and departing from this school and the unsuitability of the Circular Road, the Department would not be prepared to involve the Exchequer in any additional expenditure in this matter by extending the State indemnity.</P>
    <P>In view of the concerns expressed this afternoon by Deputy Ellis, and earlier today by Senator Reynolds.  I am asking my Department to examine the options available.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise the important question of the conditions at present operating in St. Luke's Hospital, Rathgar.  This hospital plays a critical role in our nation's services to patients who have cancer.  In fact, the hospital provides radiotherapy to two-thirds of our nation's cancer patients.  I understand that the three radiotherapy machines in the hospital's national centre for radiotherapy were shut down, due to technical problems, last week, leaving 120 patients without treatment. On frequent occasions since then, the machines have had to be used until midnight or very late at night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that the Minister, since taking office, has highlighted the need for a uniformly high standard of care and treatment for cancer patients to be provided throughout the country.  This is important and will be reassuring news for many families.  I ask the Minister to <Col N="534" /> outline what plans he has to ensure that patients are not subject to the unsatisfactory conditions, to which they have been subjected in relation to treatment, in St. Luke's Hospital, through no fault of the staff who have been working very hard and who deserve great credit for their ongoing commitment and hard work for their patients?</P>
    <P>This crisis has been ongoing for some time and results in serious delays for patients in need of treatment.  The shortage of equipment also means that machines are operating late at night with subsequent implications for patients who have to either travel home late at night or make arrangements for overnight accommodation.  Clearly, this affects patients, their families and the morale of hospital staff.  In the past it has been necessary to fly people to Cork to reduce the backlog of patients awaiting treatment.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to outline his plans for the development and extension of the treatment facilities in St. Luke's Hospital, his plans to ensure appropriate treatment is available to patients who need it and his plans for improving facilities for cancer patients?  What improvements in services can be made in order that cancer patients, who currently have to travel long distances, can have access to radiotherapy and chemotherapy in their own areas?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I thank Deputy Fitzgerald for raising this issue and giving me an opportunity to explain to patients and their families who are concerned about the breakdown in machinery at St. Luke's Hospital what is happening and the plans being put in place for the next 12 months.  Deputy Fitzgerald has also raised issues about the wider policy area of the treatment of cancer.  I will be returning to that in due course but this evening I would like to confine my remarks to the situation at St. Luke's Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to a package of major developments in the provision of cancer treatment at St. <Col N="535" /> Luke's Hospital.  In November 1993 the board of St. Luke's and St. Anne's Hospital decided to consolidate services on one site.  At the same time a joint project team comprising representatives of the hospital and officers of the Department of Health was appointed to plan for and oversee the transfer of cancer services at present provided on the St. Anne's Hospital site to the St. Luke's Hospital campus.  The project team was also charged with the task of developing the St. Luke's site into a national centre of excellence in the treatment of cancer.</P>
    <P>The project team worked quickly and completed a comprehensive development plan for St. Luke's which was approved by my Department on 5 September 1994.  The development of the hospital will involve a complete upgrading of accommodation and equipment at a cost in excess of £9 million.  This is a major capital investment and will greatly enhance the level of service for cancer patients.</P>
    <P>One of the key areas examined by the project team was the medical equipment needs of the new hospital.  In fact this area was treated as the first priority area requiring immediate action in the overall upgrading of facilities at St. Lukes's. Specifically in relation to radiotherapy equipment, approval issued in December last from my Department to St. Luke's to purchase a package of new radiotherapy equipment including two new linear accelerators and a simulator. The tendering process for the procurement of this new equipment is virtually complete and final discussions are taking place with the intended supplier to complete the purchasing arrangements. The overall cost of the new equipment is in the region of £3 million and it will become operational at the earliest possible date this year.  It is not just a question of installing the new equipment, it has to be calibrated as well, but there will be no undue delay.</P>
    <P>Pending the commissioning of the <Col N="536" /> new radiotherapy equipment a comprehensive maintenance service will be provided on the existing equipment by its supplier.  This will include the full-time presence at St. Luke's of a specialist engineer.  Lest there be any ambiguity, the maintenance service is not being provided by the contractor who supplied the equipment in the first instance; it is being supplied by the contractor who will supply the new equipment.  It is a measure of how advanced the discussions are in the tendering process when an international company who will, I hope, supply the equipment is willing to put a specialist engineer on site to service the existing equipment so that no avoidable breakdown will occur before all the new equipment is installed.</P>
    <P>In addition, St. Luke's is availing of a consultancy service in physics and recruiting a chief physicist for the hospital.  This post has been advertised nationally and internationally.  Physics is a highly mobile qualification.  The physicist employed at St. Luke's was attracted to a private hospital and there is a vacancy there.  While that vacancy is being filled in accordance with due process we have retained the services of international consultants who will provide the services which a physicist on site would normally provide.  That arrangement is now in place.</P>
    <P>I am aware that a particular difficulty arose on the evening of Wednesday, 18 January when, due to technical problems, three of the hospital's linear accelerators were temporarily out of commission.  Immediate arrangements were made with an outside consultancy service in physics for an inspection of the equipment.  As a consequence, two of the machines were returned to clinical use on Friday, 20 January and the third on Monday, 23 January.  I should stress that emergency treatment continued to be provided for patients on alternative equipment at the hospital.</P>
    <P>My Department has been advised by St. Luke's Hospital it is satisfied that the maintenance arrangements in place will ensure that the existing equipment <Col N="537" /> operates to full clinical efficiency, pending the commissioning of the new equipment, and that there will be no avoidable delay in the treatment of patients. I understand also that an independent professional assessment last week of the existing treatment equipment at St. Luke's by a UK based specialist indicated that the equipment is fit for use and is clinically efficient.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister for coming in to reply.  I congratulate him on his promotion and wish him well in his endeavours.</P>
      <P>The matter I raise is a national problem.  It is one which contributes to the acceleration of rural depopulation and must be addressed.  I am concerned about a proposal in the Mount Mellary area of West Waterford, a mountainous area where the land is mostly poor and the farmers mostly small farmers.  The average holding in the area is in the region of 90 acres.  The adjusted acreage of any farm is probably in the region of only 35-40 acres.  I know of one small area where previously ten to 12 farmers were involved in dairying and now all but two of them have transferred to dry stock or sheep or, more likely, let the land.  Of the two remaining farmers involved in dairying, their quotas are very small, fewer than 20,000 gallons. Everybody knows the difficulties in surviving on a farm with such a small quota.  The reason the other farmers went out of dairying was that the quotas were too low.</P>
      <P>On one farm there was a quota of 12,000 gallons and that has been sold to a local estate which has a quota in the region of 200,000 gallons.  That is an example of what is happening.  We seem to be going back to the days of landlordism.  Surely some mechanism could be found where other farmers in the area could avail of that quota to make their holding more viable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="538" /> The present proposal concerns a joint venture with Coillte for planting approximately 70 acres of good land. There are about 2,000 acres planted already, mostly in the mountainous region, but now people are starting to plant the more fertile lands.  At present people are entitled to plant up to 500 acres without planning permission, and the obvious thing to do is to plant 499 acres at a time.  That matter must be considered, otherwise we will be totally overrun by afforestation.</P>
    <P>The local people cannot compete with the package Coillte has put forward. Some consideration must be given to setting up a land authority to help smaller farmers to compete.  Since there are subsidies to plant trees, why are they not given to help farmers in other areas to compete?  Young farmers in particular should be given assistance and I know it is the Minister's desire as much as mine that young farmers stay in rural Ireland.  We must help them to make their holdings more viable and provide a future for themselves and their families.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kenneally for raising this very important matter.  I would like to open my remarks by dealing with the development of forestry in Ireland, particularly as it relates to farmers.  Within the past two years we have seen a marked increase in afforestation in Ireland.  The availability to farmers and others of grants and premium support, made possible by EU, CAP and Structural Fund Programme, has generated greatly increased levels of planting, particularly on private lands.  It is worth mentioning that private planting now accounts for more than 50 per cent of all planting in the country.  Furthermore, farmers account for over 75 per cent of all planting by private landowners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current afforestation and forestry premium schemes were introduced as accompanying measures to the reform of the agricultural policy.  Forestry now represents a particularly attractive asset <Col N="539" /> and income option for farmers.  Grants for planting range between £1,300 and £3,000 per hectare.  The annual premiums payable to farmers in recognition of loss of income from lands which are planted range between £130 and £300 per hectare per annum and are payable in the case of farmers for up to 20 years. This contrasts with the non-farmer premium which is confined to a range of between £80 and £120 per hectare per annum and is payable for a maximum of 15 years.  At the highest end of the range, it is, therefore, possible for a farmer to obtain premium payments totalling £6,000 per hectare over a 20 year period, whereas a non-farmer can earn a maximum of £1,800 per hectare over a period of 15 years.  This deliberate weighting of the premium scheme in favour of farmers has played a large part in making the forestry option an increasingly attractive one for farmers, as borne out by the figures.  The increasing importance of forestry to farmers is also borne out by the increased level of attention being paid to it by farming organisations, which is very welcome.</P>
    <P>Within the next few months the Government will publish a national strategic plan for forestry which will be the first of its kind.  This will provide a framework within which forestry and its derivative and related activities can be developed to maximum national advantage of decades to come.</P>
    <P>The environment is an extremely important integral part of forestry planning and practice.  We will be ensuring, by various means, that forestry development takes careful account of our environment.  A review of controls on large scale forestry and, in particular, the effectiveness of planning controls in this area which is being undertaken by my Department in conjunction with the <Col N="540" /> Department of the Environment is nearing completion and will be an important contribution in this regard.</P>
    <P>The tax regime governing forestry is not the cause of any difficulty or distortions in so far as farm forestry is concerned.  Profits arising from the occupation on woodlands managed on a commercial basis are exempt from income tax, as are grants and premiums payable to qualifying farmers and nonfarmers.  Provisions in the area of capital gains tax and acquisition tax are also conducive to promoting forestry development.  It is most important to bear in mind that we are undertaking the promotion of forestry not alone as an alternative use for agricultural land but in terms of putting in place a resource base for forest-based industries in future.  We have already seen evidence that these can make a significant contribution to the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>As regards the Mount Melleary area of County Waterford.  I am not aware of any general difficulties affecting farmers in so far as forestry is concerned.  I am aware of one case in which there is concern about the impact of a planting proposal.  My Department has indicated that if a grant application is received in respect of this project, an inspection of the site will be carried out prior to planting and grant approval.  This will check whether any environmental concerns arise and determine whether the project complies with the Department's standard environmental guidelines which, <i>inter alia</i>, require all planting to be kept a minimum stated distance from dwellings and farm buildings.  I understand Deputy Kenneally's concern about this growing nationwide problem and undertake to look at it.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 31 January 1995.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap &mdash; Needs and Abilities &mdash; estimated the quantity and cost of the additional services needed to meet existing and emerging needs.  The additional costs as <Col N="424" /> estimated in the report were £27.5 million revenue and £22.5 million capital over the period 1990 to 1994.  The estimated service needs during this period was for 800 residential places and 2,000 day places.</P>
      <P>In the period since 1990 and including the additional funding of £10 million provided for the development of additional services in 1994, a total of £28.08 million has been invested in new services.  This funding has provided over 780 additional residential places and 1,657 day places.</P>
      <P>It can be seen therefore that considerable progress has been made in recent years in implementing the &ldquo;Needs and Abilities&rdquo; report.  The total additional services provided between 1990 and the end of 1994 are almost equal to the level of provision recommended.</P>
      <P>I would also like to point out to the Deputy that the additional residential places provided include some respite and emergency places in addition to full time residential places.  The development funding has also been used to provide home support services.</P>
      <P>In addition to the £28.08 million expended on the provision of new services, a further £4.5 million has also been made available by my Department to improve existing services.  This funding has been used primarily to provide additional staff to cater for the increased dependency of more elderly clients and clients with disturbed behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the Government's intention to continue to build on the progress which has been made, particularly over the last two years.  I would like to assure the Deputy that the provision of additional services for persons with a mental handicap has a very high priority within my Department.  In line with the commitment contained in the policy agreement &ldquo;A Government of Renewal&rdquo;, the Government is committed to eliminating waiting lists and to maximising the quality of life and right of participation of every citizen with a mental handicap. I will announce the details of my proposals for mental handicap services <Col N="425" /> when the Estimate for my Department has been finalised.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 46 and 48 together.  The present system of nurse education and training is a three year apprenticeship type programme involving 40 weeks of classroom-based theoretical instruction together with rostered clinical placements during which students contribute significantly to ward staffing in the training hospitals.  Funding for student salaries, tutor salaries and other associated costs is included in the annual allocation to health boards and public voluntary hospitals which operate schools <Col N="428" /> of nursing.  The whole area of nurse education and training has been under consideration for some time culminating in the publication by An Bord Altranais of its review document last summer and the commencement of a pilot programme involving the Western Health Board and University College Galway in October 1994 which largely addresses the recommendations made by An Bord Altranais in regard to pre-registration education and training.</P>
      <P>The pilot programme in general nurse training in Galway differs from the traditional nurse training model in a number of important respects.  It is based on full students status on a supernumerary basis except for a short period of rostered service in the third year of the programme. It provides for academic accreditation at diploma level at the point of registration and involves a formal link with UCG. An annual grant of £2,500 is being paid by the Western Health Board to participants in the pilot programme.</P>
      <P>A steering group has been established to monitor the progress of the pilot programme and any modifications deemed necessary will be made.  It is envisaged that this model of training will provide the basis for future developments in pre-registration education and training and the pace of progress will depend on the availability of funding for this purpose as determined in the context of the annual Health Estimate.  Decisions in relation to the extension of the model to other sites and disciplines will be taken in consultation with the Department of Education and the Higher Education Authority among others.  The precise arrangements which will apply in future years to the payment of a grant in respect of the diploma programme will also be the subject of consultation with the relevant interests but I am not aware of any reason to change the arrangements currently being piloted in Galway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of the extension of the Galway model to other sites, all curricula developed by schools of nursing and third level educational institutes will be required to meet the Syllabus and Rules <Col N="429" /> of An Bord Altranais for nurse education and training and relevant EU Directives.  Any formalisation of arrangements in this context, for example through the establishment of a National Curriculum Development Unit, would be a matter for An Bord Altranais to consider in the first instance.</P>
    <P>It is my understanding that An Bord Altranais is to establish a committee, under the chairmanship of its president, to develop a national framework for post registration education and training. I am committed to the overall development of continuing education for nurses and expect to make an investment in this area this year.  In this regard, I welcome the proposal by An Bord Altranais to establish this committee and look forward to a productive outcome to its work.  The deliberations of this committee, as well as the review of the Nurses Act, 1985, which is at an advanced stage in my Department, may impact on the overall structures required to govern nurse training.</P>

However, when account is taken of the additional services put in place during 1993 and 1994, it is estimated that approximately 6,950 persons are in receipt of residential services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is in the process of putting in place a national database on the needs of persons with a mental <Col N="430" /> handicap.  The database will provide information, on an ongoing basis, on the number of people with a mental handicap in each region, the number in receipt of services and those awaiting services, their current and future needs and the level of support which is required to meet those needs.  Up-to-date information on numbers awaiting residential care will be available from the data base later this year.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that the provision of additional services for persons with a mental handicap has a very high priority within my Department.  In line with the commitment contained in the policy agreement &ldquo;A Government of Renewal&rdquo;, the Government is committed to eliminating waiting lists and to maximising the quality of life and right of participation of every citizen with a mental handicap.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Department of the Environment has published guidelines which give information to householders and building designers about measures they can take to reduce high radon levels in buildings.  Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas.  Long-term exposure to very high levels of radon in an enclosed area can be a contributory factor in increasing the risk of contracting lung cancer, particularly where other factors such as cigarette smoking are involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland is the statutory body with responsibility for monitoring radiation in the State.  The institute initiated a national geographically based radon survey in 1992 which is scheduled for completion in 1997.  It involves radon <Col N="431" /> measurements being taken in at least ten houses in each ten kilometre grid square across the country.  A total of about 6,000 houses will be surveyed. The survey is being carried out to assist in identifying areas at greatest risk of high indoor radon levels.</P>

The proposed legislation will be designed to enhance the board's ability to compete effectively in the Single Market by amending certain of the provisions in the current legislation governing the board and its operations.  In preparing the Bill I shall have regard to the recommendations of the VHI Review Group which undertook a comprehensive review of VHI's structure and operations.  Taken with the recent appointment of a new chief executive by the board, the VHI should then be equipped to meet the challenges which will undoubtedly be posed by its new operating environment.  I hope to introduce the necessary legislation in the coming months.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am aware of the comments made by a member of the Oireachtas concerning the transfer of certain patients from St. Conal's Hospital, Letterkenny, County Donegal.</P>
      <P>The North Western Health Board, which is responsible for the delivery of health services in Donegal, has informed me that the patients in question &mdash; just over 20 in number &mdash; are long-stay elderly patients who are no longer under the care of a psychiatrist. Most of them are from mid and north-west Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a cornerstone of health policy for dependent elderly, as set out in &ldquo;The Years Ahead&rdquo; report, that they should be supported at home and, where this is not possible, to provide their care in a residential home as close as possible to the person's home and family.  The <Col N="434" /> North Western Health Board has consistently worked towards achieving this objective.  The transfer of patients from St. Conal's to residential care in their communities is consistent with this objective.  Before any transfers took place, there were discussions with the families of the residents and where concerns were expressed these were fully taken into account.  All arrangements were in place since the end of October 1994 and no patient was moved either against his/her own wishes or those of his/her family.  The transfers have meant that patients are now residing closer to their families.  A small number of transfers were made on a trial basis and, where this proved unsatisfactory, the patients were returned to receive continuing care in St. Conal's.</P>
    <P>The transfer of these elderly patients from St. Conal's coincides with a major £1 million development at the hospital which will result in additional health facilities and refurbished accommodation for the remaining patients in St. Conal's.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose taking Questions Nos. 28 and 35 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation in the context of the 1992 GMS Review it was agreed that, in common with other developed countries, medicines are not always prescribed in <Col N="435" /> the most effective manner in this country and that, accordingly, there was significant potential for an improvement in prescribing practice leading to better patient care and better use of the resources in the development of general practitioner services.</P>
    <P>Each doctor was, accordingly, encouraged to examine his/her existing prescribing practices with a view to availing of any opportunities to make prescribing more effective and less costly for all his/her patients.  To assist in this process doctors were provided with indicative drug targets which has been constructed on the basis of average prescribing costs weighted on the basis of age and sex.</P>
    <P>The duty and obligation of individual doctors to provide the most appropriate management for each patient who presented and, in so doing, to utilise resources available for the optimum care of patients, individually and collectively was emphasised by all parties to the scheme.  In this context the right of the doctor to prescribe as he/she considers necessary remains absolutely in place and there is no limitation on the range of items from which he/she can choose to prescribe.</P>
    <P>As an incentive to doctors to embark on this review process the scheme provided that half the savings made will be made available to the individual doctors concerned for practice development projects which receive the prior approval of the health board.  This resource is being allocated towards improving facilities within general practice for the purpose of providing a more comprehensive and better quality service for patients.</P>
    <P>Prescriptions for the month of November 1994 are currently being processed for payment with prescriptions for the month of December due to be processed in the coming weeks.  Accordingly, the end of year position for 1994 has not yet been established, and I am not yet in a position to give the information requested.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="436" /> The funds for investment arising from the savings made on this scheme will be available as soon as the end of year position is known and will be paid to individual practitioners once their proposals for investment in practice development have been agreed with their local health board.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> A programme of anonymous unlinked surveillance of surplus blood taken at ante-natal clinics commenced in October, 1992, as was recommended by the Surveillance Sub-Committee of the National AIDS Strategy Committee.  The sub-committee, in recommending that such surveillance programme should be undertaken, was also of the view that it should be in operation for at least three years before any valid conclusions could be drawn from the statistics produced.  This 3-year period will expire in October 1995, and it would be premature, therefore, at this stage, to comment in details on the statistics available from the programme. I understand, however, that preliminary results indicate that the incidence of HIV positive cases is in line with that of other countries such as the United Kingdom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Surveillance Sub-Committee also recommended the extension of anonymous unlinked surveillance to STD clinics and certain out-patients departments of general hospitals.  The surveillance programme has already commenced at some STD clinics with effect from 1 October 1994 and will be extended to <Col N="437" /> the remaining clinics shortly.  The position in relation to surveillance at out-patient departments is that the Surveillance Sub-Committee recommended, in principle, that such a programme should be implemented.  The sub-committee has under consideration the precise details of this programme, including the type of clinics to be involved.  The sub-committee will be making recommendations to me on this matter in the coming months and it is intended to introduce the programme during 1995.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am not aware of any evidence that 30 per cent of the elderly are undernourished.  Indeed, a report published by the National Council for the Elderly, on measures to promote health and autonomy for older people, indicates that most elderly persons in Ireland are fit, independent, live in good housing and are reasonably well-off. The council is currently engaged in a major study of the health and well being of a national sample of over 900 older people.  While not yet finalised, I understand that the study re-inforces the findings of earlier research, namely, that most elderly people are living independently and, despite an expected degree of serious illness, more than half report themselves to be in good health.  I look forward to receiving the results of this study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Health Promotion Unit of my Department has published many leaflets and booklets on promoting a healthy diet among adults in general.  Two publications particular to the elderly are <Col N="438" />&ldquo;Healthy Eating for the Elderly&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Healthy Eating for the Diabetic Elderly'.  Those leaflets are presently under review.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Traditionally the waste arising in the health services has been disposed of in hospital incinerators.  In recent years it has been recognised that these incinerators were not capable of meeting modern environmental standards.  Many hospital incinerators have ceased to operate and the total quantity of healthcare waste being incinerated has been greatly reduced by the application of better management practices, with subsequent reduction of emissions into the atmosphere.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently issued to the health agencies a policy document on the management of waste in the health services.  The primary aims of this policy are to minimise the impact of waste on the environment and to bring about better conditions for those handling waste.</P>
      <P>The Department has also written to the health boards and major voluntary hospitals, proposing a strategic plan which is currently the subject of discussions with the health agencies.  The plan envisages four waste treatment centres and it suggests employing new technologies involving non-incineration methods.  The implementation of this plan would lead to the phasing out of the remaining hospital incinerators.</P>

      <P>Bacterial meningitis tends to occur sporadically in this country and information available from the hospital authorities and public health officials involved in the investigation of the four deaths from the disease earlier this month indicates that there is no link between them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 43, 52 and 82 together.</P>
      <P>There is no accurate figure available for the number of drug misusers in this country.  The latest report from the Health Research Board indicates that the estimated number of persons treated for drug misuse in the Greater Dublin Area in 1993 was 2,573 although it is accepted that the number of misusers is considerably in excess of this figure.</P>
      <P>The Provision of services for drug misusers in Dublin, including those at the City Clinic, Amiens Street, is a matter for the Eastern Health Board in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the board that, in April, 1994, 90 patients were on methadone maintenance at the City Clinic and that 200 patients were on the waiting list.  This figure of 200 was the total number of patients recorded as having sought methadone maintenance at the City Clinic.  A number of such patients would also have been on waiting lists at other treatment centres and some others would not have been available to go on a methadone maintenance programme if such became available.  Having reviewed the waiting list the Eastern Health Board has indicated that the number of persons actively seeking methadone maintenance is now 95 while the number on maintenance programmes is 127.  The satellite clinics operated by the Eastern Health Board at Baggot Street, Ballyfermot and Amiens Street, together with the Drug Treatment Centre in Pearse Street have <Col N="442" /> been very successful in providing comprehensive services for drug misusers and the board proposes to provide additional clinics during 1995.  In addition, the services available at some of the existing clinics are to be extended to cater for more patients.  In the case of the City Clinic it is intended to provide methadone maintenance in the afternoons, beginning in early February, so that up to 50 additional patients can be accommodated.  This should make a substantial impact on the current waiting list.</P>
    <P>Funding is being made available to the Eastern Health Board to allow for the provision of three additional satellite clinics in 1995.  In addition, the board will be considering the other options available to it in order to provide a service for those who are currently on waiting lists and who are not in receipt of any service.  This will include the greater involvement of general practitioners in the provision of methadone maintenance for drug misusers.  The report of the Expert Group on a Protocol for Prescribing Methadone will be of considerable help in this regard since it provides the necessary framework of support services which will allow general practitioners to prescribe methadone.  Since the intention is that general practitioners will take on the responsibility for drug misusers who have been stabilised at a satellite clinic places should be freed up at the clinics with a consequent reduction in waiting lists.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier in my reply, the problem of drug abuse arises to the greatest extent in the Dublin area.  Outside of Dublin abuse of drugs is on a much lesser scale and there is no evidence to suggest that intravenous drug misuse constitutes a serious problem.</P>
    <P>Each health board, however, closely monitors the situation in order to be in a position to deal quickly with problems as they arise.  For example, the Southern Health Board recently submitted to my Department a five year strategy to deal with alcohol and drug abuses in its <Col N="443" /> area.  This is under consideration and will be discussed with the board shortly.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure Deputies that I will be keeping the situation about drug abuse under review to ensure that the services available, both preventive and treatment, provide an effective response to the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Under the terms of the job-sharing scheme for the health service which was introduced in 1985, there are no posts designated to job-sharing. The terms of the scheme, which does not apply to private medical practitioners participating in the general medical services scheme, provide that the operation and maintenance of job-sharing arrangements are a matter for the management of each health agency and must necessarily depend on the demands of the service.</P>
      <P>The most recent annual health services personnel census carried out by my Department shows that there were a total of 4,293 employees throughout the health service in a job-sharing capacity at 31 December, 1993.</P>
      <P>The increasing success of the scheme in providing both an attractive alternative to full-time working arrangements and greater employment opportunities can be gauged from the fact that this represents an increase of 1,672 since 1990.  While nurses represent the largest category of job sharers in the health service, equally the scheme is equally open to staff in other categories who satisfy the criteria set down.  Obviously, demand for job-sharing is a necessary pre-condition also.</P>
      <P>I am committed to encouraging health agencies to allow the scheme to be used to the fullest extent possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="444" /> Within the context of overall personnel policy for the health service for 1995, details of which will be circulated to health agencies shortly, it is my intention to emphasise the positive aspects of the job-sharing scheme and to ask each health agency to make every effort to ensure that the opportunities for greater participation in the scheme that exist are fully exploited.</P>
    <P>Part-time and job-sharing arrangements in the context of flexible working for consultant and non-consultant hospital doctors were considered and reported on in the discussion document prepared by the collaborative study group on medical manpower in acute hospitals.  The implications of the discussion document in this regard are at present being considered by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am fully aware of the need to fund the development of long stay accommodation for dependent elderly people where that need has been independently and professionally assessed as the best option for the person concerned.  It is a primary objective of health policy for the dependent elderly that as far as possible they and their carers be supported at home.  In the recently published health strategy, one of the priorities in relation to the elderly is to strengthen the role of the general practitioner, the public health nurse, the home help and other primary care professionals in supporting older people <Col N="447" /> and their carers who live at home.  The target will be to ensure that not less than 90 per cent of those over 75 years of age continue to live at home in dignity and independence.</P>
      <P>When a dependent elderly person can no longer be supported at home, a number of options are available for his or her care.  The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 provides subventions for those dependent persons assessed by health boards as in need of nursing care and without the means to pay for it.  By the end of 1994, a total of almost £12 million annually was made available to implement the Act.</P>
      <P>In addition, health boards provide about 9,000 long-stay beds in hospitals and homes for persons assessed by professional staff as requiring long-stay care.</P>
      <P>A further priority of the health strategy in relation to older people over the next four years will be the provision of additional places for convalescent care for elderly people who do not need acute medical care and the building of eight small scale nursing units in the community to replace unsuitable accommodation and to meet the needs of the expanding population of older people.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The identification of consultant staffing needs in the Cork area is a matter for the Southern Health Board in the first instance.  Proposals for the filling of new replacement permanent consultant posts are reviewed on a regular basis by my Department.  This review is undertaken having regard to <Col N="448" /> service and personnel criteria in the context of the priority afforded to each post by the agency concerned and with particular regard to the availability of financial resources.  The Southern Health Board has submitted outline proposals to my Department in relation to the further development of orthopaedic services in Cork, including the establishment of a sixth post of consultant orthopaedic surgeon.  The Southern Health Board has not, however, submitted a formal request for approval of this post to my Department.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that in 1993 my Department approved the filling of a fifth consultant orthopaedic surgeon post at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital/Cork University Hospital.  I understand from the Southern Health Board that the appointee will be in place by the middle of this year.  In addition, a locum consultant orthopaedic surgeon, who took up duty at the hospitals during the summer of 1994, will remain in place throughout 1995.  I am confident that these developments, together with the new clean air theatres which came into operation at St. Mary's Orthopaedic Hospital in 1994, will greatly improve the service for orthopaedic patients in Cork.</P>

I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the Western Health Board has exceeded its target in the speciality of ophthalmology, and the performance of this additional workload should help to reduce the waiting list and time for hospital ophthalmic patients.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Final figures for NCHD overtime for 1994 are not yet available. Preliminary figures indicate that the total will be approximately £24.9 million.  The &ldquo;basic&rdquo; working week for non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHDs) is 39 hours.  However, they are liable to be rostered for up to 65 hours per week.</P>
      <P>In accordance with Labour Court Recommendation No. 11840 of 4 May, 1988, hours worked in excess of 39 are paid for as follows:</P>
      <P>Half of all hours worked over 39 are paid at time and a quarter subject to a maximum of 10 hours.  All other hours in excess of 39 and up to a maximum of 65 are paid at half time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This system allows hospitals to deploy the maximum number of doctors required at peak times while providing a lower number at other times.  Much of the latter cover is provided by doctors who are &ldquo;on call&rdquo; i.e. physically present in the hospital but not necessarily at <Col N="456" /> work on the wards etc.  Time spent &ldquo;on call&rdquo; is counted as working time and is paid for.  Some NCHDs may provide &ldquo;on-call&rdquo; cover from home.</P>
    <P>At present my Department, health board and voluntary hospital managements are engaged in discussions with the Irish Medical Organisation on developing a mechanism to keep NCHD working hours within agreed limits.</P>

      <Quest>the amount of money that was given to each of the country's hospitals and health boards under the 1994 waiting list initiative programme; if funding was taken back from any hospital or health board for failing to meet agreed targets under the waiting list initiative; if so, the hospitals or health boards that were involved; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> A total of £10 million was allocated to health agencies under the 1994 waiting list initiative.  A breakdown of the allocation to individual agencies is set out in the following tabular statement.</P>
      <P>The tabular statement reflects a reallocation of £100,000 which was deducted from the allocation to the Southern Health Board which was unable to meet the level of activity agreed under the initiative.  This funding was subsequently allocated to the Western Health Board in respect of additional activity performed by them under the initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main principles underlying the waiting list initiative is the concept that maximum value for money is achieved in respect of the public funds invested in the initiative.  It is essential to the success of the initiative that agreed targets are met.  I am committed to this approach and will ensure that a focus on performance will continue to be a central condition attaching to any <Col N="457" /> further funding provided for the reduction of waiting lists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The development of general practitioner services is an <Col N="458" /> important element of the national health strategy.  The strategy identifies the fragmentation of general practice as a major weakness which, as a result, makes it both difficult and costly to improve services and to integrate general practice with other health services. In order to address such deficiencies, the strategy contains a plan for improving the organisation of general practitioner services through the development of group practices, amalgamated practices or co-operative type arrangements between general practitioners.  As part of the implementation of the strategy, my Department has requested health boards to give priority to the reorganisation of general practitioner services to meet the twin objectives of improving patient care and enhancing the quality of general practice.</P>
      <P>The implementation of such developments in the Eastern region is a matter for the Eastern Health Board.  The board, in consultation with general practitioners locally, intends to bring about improvements in general practitioner services, including organisational improvements, which are in line with the strategy.  In that regard, the board has invited proposals from general practitioners who are interested in organising and developing their practices in accordance with the objectives outlined above.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Eastern Health Board has, to date, approved six projects for funding.  Discussions are being held with a further three groups of doctors on the development of additional projects.  While the precise level of funding for approved projects has not been finalised, the board has approved in principle the allocation of grants totalling £0.58 million in respect of the following projects: West Tallaght: Two projects, £150,000 and £100,000 respectively; North Clondalkin: £100,000; South Inner City: £150,000; Bray: £40,000; Dún Laoghaire: £40,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bray and Dún Laoghaire projects relate to the provision of an enhanced range of patient services, information <Col N="459" /> technology, research and epidemiology and are under way.</P>
    <P>A final decision in relation to investment in the other projects will be taken on conclusion of satisfactory arrangements between the board and the general practitioners concerned.  Such arrangements will relate to the overall funding of the individual projects and agreement on identifiable improvements in both patient care and the development of general practice.  The board has indicated that it is not possible at this stage to estimate a timescale for the completion of these projects. Where projects involve capital investment by the board, an appropriate equity stake in such capital projects will be retained by the board.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for the Medical Council to satisfy itself as to the suitability for the practice of medicine of non-national doctors seeking registration.  The council does not at present operate a language test as part of this procedure.  I understand that the Medical Council is now giving serious consideration to the need for a language test in certain cases.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The claim submitted by IMPACT, on behalf of environmental health officers, for a salary revision was processed through the standard industrial relations procedures and was the subject of two hearings by a board under the scheme for a National Joint Council and Arbitration Board for Local Government and Health Services.</P>
      <P>The claim was given detailed consideration by the Arbitration Board which rejected the basis on which the claim had been made.  Both the management and staff interests had opted to refer the matter to arbitration.  By convention, the decisions of the Arbitration Board are accepted by both sides. Accordingly, there is no role for me, as Minister for Health, to intervene in the process.  I am aware that environmental health officers are in the process of consulting their union branches on the issue of industrial action.  Depending on the outcome of these discussions and the form of industrial action planned, if any, the implications for public health and food safety will be considered at that time.</P>

      <P>This matter has been considered by my predecessors on a number of occasions in recent years and it has been found that statutory regulation, including the setting and maintenance of standards of private security firms, would raise issues of considerable difficulty.  Regulations which aim to provide for minimum standards of commercial practice by those involved in the security business would give rise to serious questions as to the criteria to be applied in the determination of such standards.</P>
      <P>However, concerns have been expressed for some time over the lack of such regulations, and I share these concerns.  I can assure the Deputy that it is an area which I will have examined again in my Department and any proposals I have by way of legislation would be brought before the Government for approval in the usual way, and announced in the normal manner.</P>
      <P>I should add, of course, that private security firms like everybody else are bound by the law.  If the Deputy is aware of any particular matters involving private security firms which, in his view, require investigation, I will be glad to hear from him in this regard.</P>

      <P>The schemes of free electricity allowance, free television licence and free telephone rental allowance are available only to people who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who satisfy the living alone conditions attached to those schemes. Depending on their income, a person in receipt of an occupational pension may be entitled to receive an old age (non-contributory) pension from my Department.  In that event and where the living alone condition can be satisfied, they will qualify for the free schemes referred to above.</P>
      <P>The current annual cost of the free schemes, excluding the free travel scheme, is about £59.4 million.  Any extension of those schemes to additional groups not currently covered would have financial implications that would have to be considered in the light of available resources.</P>
      <P>The free travel scheme is available to every resident in the State who is 66 years of age or over including retired public servants.</P>

      <P>I regret that under current supplementary welfare allowance legislation no payment can be made in this person's current circumstances. Legislation governing the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which provides for payment of rent allowance, excludes people in full-time employment from receipt of the allowance.  I <Col N="480" /> am aware that this can act as a disincentive to work for those on low pay especially where they have significant housing costs.  Family income supplement is a useful support for couples with children; however, single people on low pay, who must provide their own private rented accommodation, may be especially affected.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Government promises to accelerate the process of tax reform by measures which include the targeting of lower paid workers and young new job entrants, through a combination of measures aimed at taking them out of the tax net and the development of a reformed system of PRSI contributions and other measures.</P>
      <P>This is a complex area involving the interaction of the social welfare and tax systems, as well as with the effects of low pay employment.  An expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems is currently studying the problems arising from the interaction of the two systems under the auspices of my Department.  The Programme for Government promises publication of their study in 1995 and I look forward to examining their report with a view to tackling problems such as that brought to my attention by the Deputy.</P>

Her claim was disallowed by a deciding officer and on 18 January 1995 she lodged an appeal against this decision.  Her appeal has <Col N="481" /> now been forwarded to the Social Welfare Appeals Office and will be considered by an appeals officer as soon as possible.  As the Appeals Office is independent in the discharge of its function in relation to deciding appeals it would not be appropriate for the Minister to intervene in this case.</P>

      <P>The final report of the National Pensions Board &mdash;&ldquo;Developing the National Pension System&rdquo; is a complex and comprehensive document containing 86 conclusions and recommendations.  The report is a wide ranging one and includes, <i>inter alia</i>, consideration of the demographic factors including population projections for the future and the impact and implications of these demographic changes on pensions.</P>
      <P>The following recommendations contained in the report have already been implemented</P>
      <P>&mdash;pensions for widowers on the same basis as for widows</P>
      <P>&mdash;a homemakers scheme to enable them to acquire pensions in their own right</P>
      <P>&mdash;full PRSI to be payable by all new entrants to public sector employments</P>
      <P>&mdash;increasing the earnings disregard in respect of lone parents allowance</P>

    <P>In addition, a major survey of occupational pension schemes is to be carried out, as recommended in the report, <Col N="482" /> to be financed mainly by my Department.</P>
    <P>I intend to bring forward proposals on the remaining issues addressed in the report as soon as possible.  Many of the proposals will, of course, take account of demographic changes and their impact on pensions.</P>

      <P>Price control generally was abolished in 1986 with the disbanding of the National Prices Commission.  Currently there are no statutory price controls in operation.  The emphasis of successive Governments since 1986 has been to promote competition and encourage greater consumer awareness of prices.  In this regard the Competition Act, 1991 sets down the legal framework necessary to protect the market and to promote the principles of free and fair competition.  Consumers have an important role to play and should be sensitive to the range of prices on offer and make their purchases accordingly.  This applies not only in the grocery sector but throughout the economy generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987 includes provisions which prohibit below cost selling of many grocery products.  The Order is enforced by the Director of Consumer Affairs.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume that the Deputy's question relates to the provision of special incentives for the attraction of industrial development to the area referred to.</P>
      <P>In so far as the Deputy has in mind that industrial projects locating there qualify for a higher rate of grant, I am afraid I have no plans to propose designation of the area for such purposes under the Industrial Development Acts. The approval of the European Commission would in any event be required for any such proposal.</P>
      <P>Under the designation system, industrial projects in designated areas are eligible for a maximum fixed asset grant rate of 60 per cent.  This contrasts with projects in non-designated areas where the maximum grant rate available is 45 per cent.  In addition, industries in designated areas may get a two thirds remission of rates of ten years at the discretion of the local authority. However, the fact of designation does not automatically guarantee support at the maximum rate, nor does it guarantee rates remission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importance and impact of designation in industrial policy has lessened in recent years and maximum rates of fixed asset grants are seldom given.  The grant level proposed for any project increasingly depends upon the economic benefits in individual projects. There is also a major shift away from fixed asset grants to supporting other areas of perceived business weakness e.g. marketing, R &amp; D, and management development.  Support and grants <Col N="485" /> in these areas are not differentiated on the basis of designation.</P>
    <P>I believe that the primary role of our industrial policy which is to secure as many sustainable jobs as possible within the economy can be achieved through the optimum use of the existing range of industrial supports, rather than seeking to extend this range to particular areas.  I am assured by the Industrial Development agencies, Forbairt and IDA Ireland, that they will continue to use the very wide range of supports at their disposal to promote the area referred to by the Deputy for further industrial development.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also have in mind that the area or part of it be designated under the urban renewal scheme for which my colleagues the Ministers for Environment and Finance have primary responsibility.  I understand that new areas of Dundalk are included in the new scheme which was announced in July 1994.  I am informed that the new scheme provides for special tax break and rates remission incentives aimed at encouraging the location of industrial units in the areas designated.  These incentives would be additional to the supports available from the industrial development agencies for eligible projects.</P>
    <P>Finally, the area can be expected to benefit in general economic terms from the various initiatives which the Deputy will be aware are currently under consideration as part of the general response to the Peace Process.</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to my predecessor's answer to Parliamentary Question No. 49 of 19 October 1993 providing a full list of the members of the city and county enterprise boards.</P>
      <P>There have been a small number of changes since then through resignation or replacement of personnel by the relevant nominating bodies.  I will arrange to have details of these changes communicated to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>With the exception of the Galway Board, which was established in October 1992, 34 County Enterprise Boards were established on 27 September 1993.</P>
      <P>A tabular statement, which I propose to circulate in the Official Report, sets out for each board (a) the number of projects approved, (b) the grant value and (c) the full and part time job approvals.  I do not have data on the number of projects submitted to each board.</P>

      <P>Each board has the services of an evaluation committee which includes persons with banking <Col N="490" /> and accounting expertise and experience in assessing the quality, local relevance and cost-effectiveness of project proposals.  The evaluation committee makes recommendations on the most appropriate level and form of assistance for all eligible enterprise projects having regard among other things to:</P>
      <P>(a)  the objectives of the county enterprise plan and any sectoral objectives therein;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  national and EC policies in regard to sensitive sectors; <Col N="491" /> (c)  the quality, local relevance and cost-effectiveness of the project; and</P>
    <P>(d)  the prospects of attracting funding-assistance for the project from sources other than the board.</P>
    <P>Project promoters should be able to demonstrate among other things that:</P>
    <P>(i)  there is a market for the proposed product or service to be produced;</P>
    <P>(ii)  adequate overall finance will be available to fund the project;</P>
    <P>(iii)  they possess the management and technical capacity to implement the proposed project.</P>
    <P>In the current interim phase, grants approved by boards are confirmed by me and all grant payments are made through my Department.</P>
    <P>Grant aid is not provided retrospectively.  Payment of grant is made, in full or in part, on the basis of invoiced expenditure vouched as paid where appropriate.</P>
    <P>I do not have information about the average time span between receipt of projects and approval and payment. However, every effort is made to make the process as speedy and efficient as possible.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that in the near future the boards will operate as independent companies limited by guarantee under an Operating Agreement with my Department.  Under the operational programme for local urban and rural development, which is part of the Community Support Framework, 1994-99, my Department will continue to be responsible for allocating funds to the boards and will work with them, providing technical assistance, and advice and guidance on good practice in the implementation of their enterprise plans.</P>

      <P>The 35 city and county enterprise boards (CEBs), which have operated since September 1993, were established on an informal basis so as to get the county enterprise initiative operational as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Arrangements for the establishment of the county enterprise boards as independent, locally-controlled enterprise development companies, limited by guarantee, are at an advanced stage.  I intend to press these arrangements to completion by the earliest possible date.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person on a community employment scheme has to pay tax in view of the fact that it is a part-time job according to the tax office whereas according to the Social Welfare office of entitlements it is a scheme and people are not entitled to any extra benefits such as family income supplement on a low wage; and the plans, if any he has to reconcile this matter.</Quest>

      <P>Community Employment (CE) is a FÁS programme which provides part-time work experience as well as training and development modules for participants.  Participants are insurable under Class J of the PRSI system which provides cover for occupational injuries.  The participant payment structure associated with CE is similar to the payment structure applicable to unemployment compensation payments i.e. a basic payment is provided for the participant with additional allowances in respect of adult and child dependants.  In addition, participants retain those secondary and other social welfare benefits such as butter vouchers, fuel allowance, mortgage relief, medical card, etc. to which they were entitled immediately prior to participating on Community Employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the taxation of CE payments, it is Government policy that <Col N="493" /> all income from whatever source should be assessed for taxation purposes.  I should mention, however, that in practice a tax liability only arises in respect of a minority of CE participants, particularly those who have another source of income.</P>
    <P>Eligibility for the Family Income Supplement is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

      <Quest>the average billing increases from Telecom Éireann to the householder and small business over the past three years; and the comparisons between charges to these categories and similar categories in Northern Ireland, United Kingdom and the EU average.</Quest>

      <P>The size of bills issued to any customer or group of customers is a day-to-day matter for Telecom Éireann and under section 33 (3) of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, I have no function in day-to-day matters.  I would, however, refer the Deputy to the reports made to me by the Telephone <Col N="498" /> Users' Advisory Group, copies of which have been laid before the House.  These reports show the effects of the changes in telephone charges in Ireland.  There have been major changes in tariff rates in September 1993, and April 1994.  I urge caution in any attempt to relate this information to customers' bills over a three year period, however, as bills would be affected by changes in the number of calls, calling patterns and the duration of calls.</P>
      <P>Similarly I have no responsibility for charges applying in other countries.  The question of making comparisons between charges for telecommunications services in various countries is a difficult issue to address satisfactorily as there are many factors which affect the accuracy of any reply which might be possible.  The variation in the size of local call areas, the issue of whether charges for residential customers and business customers are the same, variations between rental and connection charges for urban and rural customers, the availability of discounts, low usage schemes, variations in the rate of VAT, variations between the charges applied by competing companies in the same member states, etc. all make the assessment of charges or any basket of charges extremely difficult to interpret meaningfully.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out as follows:</P>
      <P>Prices are taken from UNIPEDE comparisons, (UNIPEDE is an international world-wide body of producers and distributors of electrical energy).</P>
      <P>A domestic customer with annual consumption of 3,500k WH is included, as this is the nearest value in the price comparison to the average domestic usage in Ireland.</P>
      <P>In the case of non-domestic customers, prices are shown for the two smallest customers included in the UNIPEDE comparison.  UNIPEDE do not include a comparison for a &ldquo;small business&rdquo; as such.</P>
      <P>The change in value of the punt v sterling from 1992 to 1993 had the effect of reducing prices for NI and the UK by nearly 15 per cent when expressed in Irish pence, followed by an increase of 11 per cent in these prices between 1993 and 1994.</P>
      <P>Prices are inclusive of VAT in the case of domestic but exclusive of VAT for industry.  The reason for this is that while domestic customers have to pay the tax inclusive price, industry is generally able to claim back VAT.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the recommendations of the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces the current procedures for dealing with grievances are being reviewed.  With regard to the Permanent <Col N="504" /> Defence Force, this matter is being considered under the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  A sub-committee of the Conciliation Council has been established to consider the grievance procedure and to produce a report which will identify current problems, consider the question of time limits and submit recommendations.  The work of the sub-committee is at an advanced stage.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme agreed with the PDF representative associations in relation to confidentiality, it is not appropriate to give details of discussions which are taking place under the scheme.  However, I understand that a comprehensive airing of views has already taken place, including the exchange of draft documents, and these are now being considered by both sides of the sub-committee.  When discussions have been finalised a council report recording agreement will be drawn up by the Conciliation Council.</P>
      <P>The procedures governing the submission and transmission of complaints as outlined in Defence Force Regulations A.7&mdash;which apply to the Permanent Defence Force&mdash;also apply to members of the FCA and An Slua Muirí.  Accordingly, the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association will be fully consulted on the revision of redress of wrongs-grievance procedures at an appropriate stage.</P>
      <P>With regard to the information requested on the number of cases submitted for redress, the following table details cases submitted by both officers and enlisted personnel of the FCA and An Slua Muirí in each of the years in question.</P>

      <P>I am also aware that environmental and safety concerns have been expressed about the proposed mast.  In response to such concerns, my predecessors decided that the Commissioners of Irish Lights should seek planning permission for the erection of the mast, even though at the time such permission was not required.</P>
      <P>Planning permission for the mast was granted following an appeal to An Bord Pleanála against Clare County Council's decision to refuse permission.  The appeal included an oral hearing which took place over nine days in Ennis where the issues were examined in detail.</P>
      <P>Some local residents, who object to the construction of the mast, have applied to the High Court for leave to seek judicial review of An Bord Pleanála's decision.  The matter will come before the Court on 30 January 1995.</P>

      <P>During early 1994 a working group consisting of representatives of the Departments of the Marine and the Environment and the Office of Public Works was formed to examine initially how the policies of these three bodies impinge on the management of the coastal zone and what frameworks exist or might be required for integration and alignment of those policies.</P>
      <P>In September 1994, preliminary submissions were invited from bodies interested in undertaking a major study into coastal zone management (CZM) in Ireland.  Interested bodies were advised that they would be expected to examine a wide range of areas including:</P>
      <P>&mdash;relevant developments in CZM at international and EU levels;</P>
      <P>&mdash;reviewing and assessing the present situation in Ireland and the extent to which CZM will influence national and local planning, infrastructural developments;</P>
      <P>&mdash;identifying and quantifying issues affecting the Irish Coastal zone; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;making recommendations for a CZM policy for Ireland, including appropriate structures and procedures for its implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A large number of submissions was received and these have now been examined and assessed by the working group.  Arising from this examination a short list of candidates for the study has been identified.  It is hoped to seek a more detailed submission from these <Col N="510" /> candidates in the near future.  It is envisaged that the study, when awarded, will take approximately six months.</P>
