      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy Raphael P. Burke.  I now call on Deputy Burke to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I request leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest: the abject failure of the Government to represent the deeply held view of the Irish people concerning the nuclear issue when at the recent meeting of the United Nations in New York the Government slavishly followed the nuclear lobby and agreed to the unlimited unconditional renewal of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty rather than insisting on a five year renewal period, with specific targets leading to the elimination of the nuclear threat.  The failure of the Government's policy is clearly demonstrated by the recent nuclear test of the Chinese Government and the proposal by the French Government to resume nuclear testing in the Pacific, both decisions which we strongly condemn.</P>

      <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 14:</P>
      <P>In page 15, line 49, to delete &ldquo;£1,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£1,500&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion we dealt with this matter I referred to the Minister's proposal to increase the sum <Col N="763" /> of £1,000 to £1,500.  We proposed a substantial increase on that amount lest anybody makes a dubious claim against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas.  In the event of a general election or local election &mdash; many Members are also a member of corporations or county councils &mdash; this measure could have far-reaching consequences &mdash; for example, where a person or a cartel wrongfully makes accusations against a Member of the House.</P>
      <P>The perception today of Members is not as good as it was previously, and nobody will deny that.  As a woman said to me many years ago, there is no smoke without fire.  In a constituency where the percentage of the vote may be marginal this measure would have serious consequences for the person involved.  If the person is defeated at an election the case against him falls.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister stated on the last occasion &mdash; I am open to correction on this &mdash; that legal advice is that it would be unconstitutional to increase the sum to such an extent.  In all my time in the House I have seen Attorneys General put different interpretations on issues, as we witnessed recently.  Legal advice has been given in the past to the effect that part of a Bill could not be amended and at a later stage another Attorney General decided that it could.  To be more precise, on the Road Traffic Bill we were told that the level of penalties to be introduced would be unconstitutional. That measure was amended by a subsequent short Bill which was passed in the House only a few weeks ago.  It is very difficult to explain to the ordinary people that one Attorney General may say something is unconstitutional while another may take a different view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received very eminent legal advice on this matter to the effect that the amendment in the name of Deputy McCreevy and myself is not unconstitutional. The only reason we have tabled amendment No. 15 is to prevent a person making a spurious claim <Col N="764" /> against a Member of the House.  Such a claim could possibly be made against the Minister of State or myself.  The amendment seeks to protect Members of both Houses against such a claim.</P>

Deputy Barry also had a great deal to say on the matter.  Have we gone too far?  As, following the enactment of the Bill, people will have to give a full account of everything they own, will persons of good calibre stand in elections?

      <P>I move amendment No. 23:</P>
      <P>In page 17, to delete line 32.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment relates to my earlier remarks.  I do not have a difficulty with <Col N="769" /> the inclusion of Members' spouses in the Bill, but their children should not be included.  Children have minds of their own and their parents may oppose a transaction they are contemplating.  If children of office holders believe their parents may object, they may not inform them of their intentions.  The Bill states that this shall apply to an interest of which the office holder has actual knowledge, but I do not know how the public will react to that because of the way the media treat certain matters.  For example, a son or daughter of a Member could purchase land which neither I nor the Member concerned would be aware of and some time later the land could be recommended for rezoning by the local authority.  We are all aware of the controversy in recent years about the rezoning of land, particularly in County Dublin.  This problem could arise whenever the Department of the Environment, with Government approval designates a site or sites, subsequent to which the son or daughter of a Minister or a member &mdash; whose parent could also be a county councillor in the relevant area &mdash; declares an interest in the relevant site or sites.  In such circumstances what would be the public reaction? It would be to the effect that of course the Member knew, we are not fools.  If it were one of my sons I know nothing would clear me.  The public would not swallow my coming into the House, saying that to the best of my knowledge I was unaware of that interest.  That is why this phrase is inappropriate, indeed it is unfair and wrong.</P>
    <P>I read the other day that the company of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Coveney, in which he has been a shareholder over many years, has been told by the Government it cannot tender for any work with the Office of Public Works.  That is a disgrace, especially for its employees.  I cannot understand why his company cannot tender for works, or at least be allowed do so with many others.  I do not make that case solely with regard to that Minister of State but <Col N="770" /> in the case of any Minister.  It is totally unfair, wrong and, above all, unjust that its employees should be treated in that manner.</P>
    <P>The implications for the child of any Member are far-reaching because nothing would clear such a Member or his or her spouse, they would be accused of knowing of such interest.  That is why I advocate the deletion of the phrase &ldquo;to the best of one's knowledge&rdquo;.  What does &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; mean?  Do I have to say I knew nothing about it?  That places Members in a very difficult position.  The same problem would arise whenever rezoning of land takes place or is designated for a particular purpose under the provisions of the urban renewal scheme. In some cases, its value could appreciate ten fold so that land bought for, say, £100,000 would be worth £1 million overnight. Although a Member of the House can say that he or she was unaware of the son or daughter having been involved; nobody would believe it.</P>
    <P>When this Bill was being debated by the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs there was a discussion on this issue over four hours when unanimous sentiments was expressed across the political divide.  For example, when attending a local authority meeting at which a planning permission or application for rezoning is being considered a member with an interest there in whether assisting in the planning, acting as an estate agent, draughtsman or architect must leave that meeting having stated their interest or that of their spouse.  However, this provision includes the interest of any child of a member.  We must remember that any child over 18 years can decide his or her future, consult the various financial institutions and arrange requisite finance to engage in the type of business to which I have just referred.</P>
    <P>I am extremely perturbed that the use of the phrase &ldquo;to the best of one's knowledge&rdquo; could be very damaging to a Member if the contingency to which I referred occurred, leading to the contention that the Member had full knowledge but was covering up.  Therefore, I <Col N="771" /> strongly oppose a child being included in this part of the Bill for the reasons I have spelled out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle of this Bill is about maintaining the public duties and private business interests of Members and officeholders separately. The public has a right to expect there will be no inside track for the children of officeholders.  The reason for the inclusion of these provisions is to establish a framework which will guarantee the separation of public and private interest, not only in the case of officeholders but of their close family members.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this section apply to officeholders but not to Members.  What are involved are confidential declarations in respect of those interests of a spouse or child of which the officeholders has &ldquo;actual knowledge&rdquo; which has been defined in amendment No. 1 already dealt with.  It does not, therefore, cover all interests of children.  For example, if a child has business interests in Australia, they would not be caught under this section.  It is prudent for any office holder to be alert to any interests held by their spouse or child which could have a bearing on their brief. Officer holders should make those inquiries and register them on a confidential register.  That will ensure what the public have a right to expect, namely, that the public duties of the office holder and the private business interests of themselves and their family will not intersect.  That is the intention of this section and it is important that we retain these provisions as drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister has said but her interpretation of this amendment might result in Members of this House being reluctant to take posts in Government because of the position in which they would be placed.  We are talking about a child who is over 18 years of age.  He or she is not obliged to tell their father or mother what they have done or what they <Col N="772" /> intend to do in the future, with respect to their business interests.</P>
      <P>Young people are very articulate. They know what they want and where they are going.  Many of them do not reveal to their parents the interests they might have in, say, property and they are not under any obligation to do so. A son or daughter of a Minister may tell him or her that their interests are none of their business.  They might tell their parents not to ask any questions.  It is a possibility.</P>
      <P>Government Ministers may not be aware that their sons or daughters have purchased property because they might have strong objections in that regard.  I hope I am proved wrong but I believe difficulties will arise in the future under this section.  If such difficulties do arise, there may be a perception in the media that Government Ministers knew about their children's business interests and that they tried to cover them up.  In such a case, will Ministers be in a position to clear themselves?</P>
      <P>If a son told his father that he intended buying some land but did not tell his mother, a Government Minister, that might have far reaching consequences for her.  I am not a betting man but if this section is enacted, major difficulties will arise in the future.  Those could involve, for example, a son or daughter of a Minister buying land that was marked for rezoning.  If that were to occur, how could an office holder, from whatever party, prove they had no knowledge of such a business interest? If such an interest was revealed, many questions would be put to that Minister in this House and an inquiry would be held into the matter.  The office holder would be compromised and would have little option but to resign.  His or her future political career would be very much in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difficulties to which I have referred will almost certainly arise in the future.  What will happen if it is discovered that the purchaser of land under the last urban renewal scheme in say, Dublin or Kildare is the son or <Col N="773" /> daughter of the member of the Government who approved that scheme?  A marathon debate would be held in this House to discuss such matter.  The office holder's son or daughter's business dealings in this matter are exposed even though he may not have been the Minister who signed the designation order. The office holder is left with no option but to resign because the defence, &ldquo;to the best of his knowledge&rdquo; will not stand up.  The same argument applies also to amendment No. 24.</P>
    <P>I have had my day and I shall not be in Cabinet again.  I am not working to a Government agenda and that is why I can put forward these amendments.  My concern is for future Members and the position in which they will find themselves when they take office.  I warn future office holders that they do not know what will happen to them should a conflict arise.  Even in the event that the office holder concerned had nothing to do with designated areas for example, the perception will be that he knew and that will leave him with no option but to resign.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister is trying to cover all angles and my party has no problem with that.  The committee may wish to call the son or daughter of an officer holder before it, but I have a legal opinion that is not constitutional and we cannot do it.  I have spelled out clearly the reasons we are opposed to this.  I have no objections to calling upon the officer holder and his or her spouse but I strongly oppose involving any child or children.  When privileged information is bandied about in this House what was perhaps a good investment by a son or daughter is tarnished and becomes impossible to dispose of.  This section has far reaching consequences and I wonder how it would stand up in court.  Have previous Attorneys General advised on this?  What is the present Attorney General's advice on it?  It seems that Attorneys General differ.</P>
    <P>This section has far reaching consequences for the children of office holders who would want to be very careful when buying property following the <Col N="774" /> enactment of this Bill.  Even when the son or daughter does not tell the office holder and his or her spouse about their business transactions, in case they are opposed to it, this is no excuse should the office holder be accused as people will not believe the office holder did not know.  That is why I am asking for line 32 to be deleted.</P>

      <P>(b) a person who in relation to that other officer is a connected person,</P>

    <P>Section 14 as it stands was added by way of Committee Stage amendment but it requires some fine-tuning.  An unintended consequence of section 14 as currently drafted is that any Minister, irrespective of whether he or she has brought the matter at issue before Government, who learns at a Cabinet meeting that another Minister has a material interest must make a statement to the Taoiseach and the commission. Conceivably, there could be 15 Ministers around the Cabinet table making statements about the same matter.  The amendments we are proposing involve the proposing Minister, any Minister with a material interest and the Taoiseach making a declaration on behalf of everybody else.  This is to tidy up the procedure for making such declarations.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(a) A person may have contravened Part IV.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Bill stands an Oireachtas Member has no formal right to complain to the commission about a possible contravention of the Act by a director or public servant.  In practice, however, it would be open to the Member to bring the matter to the attention of the commission which would then, on its own initiative, be able to commence the <Col N="780" /> investigative process.  Alternatively, the Member would be able to raise the matter with the Minister who could then ask the commission to investigate.  On reflection, we have decided that Members should have a formal right to complain to the commission and this is what the amendment provides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment. It is only correct that a Member should have the right to complain to the commission.  I agree with much of what my colleague, Deputy Connolly, said. We are treading on thin ice in regard to many aspects of this Bill.  The rights of Members have been watered down so much in recent years, and they should have the right to deal formally with such matters.</P>

      <P>In page 31, to delete lines 21 and 22 and substitute &ldquo;of the Government and the report includes determinations that there has been a contravention of Part IV and that the contravention was a serious matter, he or she shall cause a copy of the report to be laid before each House.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Bill stands, a Minister receiving a report about an investigation into an alleged contravention of the Act by a director or public servant has discretion as to whether or not that report should be laid before the Houses. Clearly where the contravention was a minor or an inadvertent one, laying the matter before the Houses might not be appropriate.  However, where the Commission has found a serious contravention, laying would be appropriate. Concerns were expressed on Committee Stage that a Minister could use his or her discretion to block the laying of such reports because of fear of potential political embarrassment.  In response to those concerns, we are bringing forward <Col N="781" /> this amendment which will make it obligatory to lay reports of serious contraventions before the Houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem here is that the definition of a serious contravention is purely subjective.  What one Member regards as serious may not be so regarded by another.  The definition could very well depend upon the circumstances, not least of which could be the political circumstances surrounding a particular action.  Is there anywhere a precise definition of a serious contravention?</P>

It is the judgment of the members of the committee in relation to Members which is not covered under this amendment, but I am clarifying it for the Deputy.  The commission includes the Ceann Comhairle, the Clerks of both Houses, the Ombudsman and the Comptroller and Auditor General, and we can trust these very senior public servants to distinguish between serious and minor matters.</P>

Some Members do not have income from other sources and are solely dependent on their salary as a Deputy. A dubious claim could be made against a Member.  The Member could be brought before an inquiry and his or her salary and allowances withdrawn.  It was stated that they could sign on at the local unemployment office.

      <P>I move amendment No. 46:</P>
      <P>In page 34, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) Where a person becomes a member or an office holder after a registration date, he may, at any time before the next registration date, furnish to the Clerk, a statement in writing of his or her registrable interests and, (in the case of an office holder) his or her additional interests.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As the Bill stands, a person who becomes a Member or office holder for the first time, for example, following a by-election or Cabinet reshuffle, does not make the required annual statement until the next annual registration date. The statements must be backdated to the date on which they took office.  It was suggested that provision might be made to require newly elected Members or office holders to disclose their interests on appointment.  I undertook to examine that and address it on Report Stage.  As the first statements must cover all relevant interests held in the period since election or appointment to office there will not be any loss of disclosure.  I am providing for the voluntary disclosure of interests by those newly elected or appointed and for the publication of same.  This amendment will achieve that objective.  If they make a voluntary declaration they will be in the same annual cycle as other Members and the same registration date will apply.</P>

We anticipate that the Taoiseach will seek a voluntary declaration from members on taking office but in any event a declaration of interest will be backdated to the annual date for all office holders.  The Taoiseach sought a declaration similar to the declarations provided for in the Bill on appointing us to office and we envisage that this system will be continued.  We are providing for a voluntary declaration and an annual declaration backdated to the date of appointment.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;29.&mdash;Where a person to whom section 5, 13, 16*, 16, 17 or 18 applies has an interest that is not specified in the Second Schedule or a person to whom section 13, 16*, 16, 17 or 18 applies has actual knowledge that his or her spouse or a child of the person or of his or her spouse has such an interest, the person may at any time prepare a statement under that section of the interest and furnish it to the person or persons to whom such a statement is required by the section to be furnished and, where such a <Col N="787" /> statement is so furnished, this Act shall apply and have effect as if the interest was an interest specified in that Schedule.&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;(2) Notwithstanding anything in this Act a statement prepared and furnished by a person pursuant to section 5, 13, 16*, 16, 17, 18 or 28 of an interest specified in paragraph 1 (5) (b) of the Second Schedule and <Col N="793" /> relating to legal services or medical services (including psychiatric or psychological services) shall specify only that legal services or medical services, as the case may be, were supplied to the person or to another person (who shall not be identified in the statement) as respects whom the first-mentioned person is required by the section to furnish a statement; and the form of the statement determined under this Act shall be such as to facilitate compliance with the foregoing provision.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On the advice of the Attorney General and in the interests of protecting the privacy of people in respect of free or discounted legal or medical services provided to them I am amending the Bill here.  The result would be that while disclosure would be required that such services have been received, the person providing the services will not be named, nor will the person receiving the services unless he or she happens to be the person making the statement.  This is to protect the privacy of a person who may get free medical services, that the practitioner offering the services is not named in a way that would label the speciality being sought.</P>

If I received as a gift some major corrective surgery what possible interest is there on the part of the public in knowing I had received it? I am deeply dubious about going that far.

      <P>The Second Schedule provides that gifts, in cash or in kind, worth over £500 should be disclosed.  It would be imprudent, for example, for people in public life to accept gifts which might place them in a compromising position.  In these amendments we are proposing to relax the provisions in respect of gifts of free or subsidised medical, psychiatric, psychological or legal services so that, for example, I would not have to release whether I am undergoing facial reconstruction which some people feel I might need or receiving gynaecological services free of charge from a friend.  It is a relaxation of the general rule but as a general principle people in public life should be careful in accepting significant gifts.  The acceptance of them could be misconstrued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I genuinely believe that this represents excessive particularity.  Whereas I agree that one should not be obliged to say whether medical services were psychiatric, gynaecological or plastic surgery, I fail to see why the public would want to know whether any Deputy, Minister or officeholder received free medical or legal services.  Apart from Hollywood film stars, no one receives unnecessary medical services.  If, for instance, a Minister has to undergo extensive medical treatment or dentistry it would be an outrage if they had to reveal this fact to the public.  I do not believe that doctors or lawyers have ever provided services free to a Minister or Member of this House with a view to gaining any advantage. In fairness, there has never been a suggestion that a lawyer or doctor got a job or gained an advantage by virtue of providing free services to a Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of producing an amendment such as this which is unduly particular and invasive of the privacy of Deputies and officeholders the Minister of State should table an amendment in the Seanad to exclude this entire area from public gaze.  While there is no potential for corruption there is obvious potential <Col N="796" /> for invasion of privacy.  If over the past year services were rendered to me as a favour by a doctor or psychiatrist, I should not have to reveal this in public. It would be offensive to politicians and to public officeholders if they were required to reveal such information in public as it would achieve nothing.  I would much prefer the Minister of State to indicate that she will consider in the Seanad the possibility of exempting this area from public gaze as no one else in this country has to reveal, as a condition, whether they received medical services.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose that a Member of this House has a psychiatric breakdown, that a psychiatrist renders them a service over a full year during which time they are in and out of institutions and that the personnel who treat them feel they do not want to make a charge.  It would be outrageous if the Member concerned had to reveal this in public. While I accept they would not have to reveal that they received psychiatric treatment, newspapers would wonder what was done for Deputy Connolly or Deputy McDowell which was worth £10,000.</P>
    <P>It is almost impossible to evaluate a medical service.  If a psychiatrist provides counselling sessions over a six-month period, this could be worth virtually anything or nothing depending on the view taken.  The Government is going too far down the purist road in saying that the public in any circumstances has an interest in whether a Member of this House receives free legal or medical advice or services.  It would be far better to exclude this area from public gaze.  Instead of particularising it and trying to reduce its more offensive aspects I would be much more impressed if the Minister of State indicated that she would be amenable to accepting an amendment in the Seanad to exclude this area from public gaze.  I cannot imagine any circumstances where the fact that someone has received psychiatric services would be of legitimate public interest or could seriously affect that person's capacity to <Col N="797" /> discharge their functions.  Unless there is a clear case for intrusion on the privacy of officeholders and Oireachtas Members I suggest that the Minister of State should exclude it completely.</P>
    <P>Were it not for this amendment it would never have occurred to me that the commission or anyone else might require me to say if a psychiatrist waived his fees in respect of psychiatric treatment.  While I see the logical behind it, what worries me is that the exemption is so particular that it tends to drag in inferences as to the degree of privacy one has to rip apart in order to comply with the provisions of the Bill.  If we were to ask every Member of the House whether they want the fact that they have received psychiatric counselling over a period of a year to be disclosed they would all say: &ldquo;Take this out.  For Heaven's sake, let us be sensible about this, nobody wants to know whether politicians or office holders received free medical or legal services.&rdquo; It is not even a possible means of corruption. We do not live in an Imelda Marcus world where face-lifts are provided free to Ministers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was never mentioned and would not be mentioned.  Members who receive hospital treatment pay for the service in the same way as everyone else.  Most of us are in the VHI and our health insurance is deducted from our salaries as is the case in many companies. To state whether we receive psychiatric treatment or other related services is going very far and involves the private affairs of Members.  In legal cases the standard charge laid down by the Incorporated Law Society applies to Members and the same is the case with medical services.  I know of no Member who received free hospital treatment. During my time in this House nobody has ever asked for free treatment and I could not see it happening.  This measure should be considered with a view to its deletion.</P>

      <P>On many occasions lawyers act on a no foal, no fee basis.  For instance, in tribunals law-years have acted for Members of this House on the basis that costs may or may not be awarded at a later stage.  Is a Member of the House obliged to record that fact at the end of the year and say he is indebted to his lawyers for a national sum of money?  That would be unacceptable.  I do not see what positive purpose it could achieve.  I still have not heard an explanation from the Minister on how and in what circumstances a person's medical treatment which is rendered free or at a reduced rate could influence them in the way they behave in public office or as a Member of the House.</P>

      <P>Doctors may attend members of the public free of charge depending on the circumstances of the case &mdash; for example, where they are in need or in financial difficulties.  The medical profession performs its duties <Col N="799" /> excellently and the same applies to the legal profession.  Where a person on the dole is involved in a court action the legal company involved may be contacted to seek an adjournment of the case so that one can find out whether the person can get free legal aid, but that does not apply to Members of the House.  Members who take a court action or against whom action is taken pay their legal fees and in some cases they have to request their families to help them.  If Members go to hospital for an operation for appendicitis, hernia or whatever, the public does not want to know about that; it is irrelevant.</P>

      <P>It is out of concern for the kind of issues raised by Deputies that this extra provision, which relates to protecting individuals privacy is proposed. A prudent Member or officeholder should not accept gifts in cash or kind on a scale that would put them under a compliment to anybody.</P>

      <P>I have been a Member of this House for a long time and I have never been under a compliment to anyone. I never sought any service free gratis and would not accept it.  The Minister referred to gifts worth £500.  When I was in Government I never received gifts to that value &mdash; I may have received a token worth perhaps £80 &mdash; and I am sure the position has not changed since. Lest the message go out that politicians receive free medical services or that we make arrangements, for example, to send other people to the doctor in return for a free service, that is not the case.</P>
      <P>The medical and legal professions carry out their duties exceptionally well and the perception should not be created that they provide a service to politicians free of charge.  That has never happened during my career and it is not part of my brief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to prolong the debate unnecessarily on this amendment.  Having regard to what <Col N="800" /> Deputy Connolly said, a Member of the House, who is not in my party, received extensive surgery during my time there. I understand that Members' friends, doctors and others paid the cost of his expensive surgery performed outside the country.  That Member's surgery bill probably amounted to £250,000 or £500,000.  Why should that Member have to reveal publicly the cost of such surgery and whether he paid for it?  We all know the Member to whom I refer. Why should his medical affairs be publicly revealed and he be asked to state if he paid part of his surgery bill or if the value of the services rendered to him amounted to £500,000 or $500,000? It is wholly wrong that he should be asked to reveal such information.</P>
      <P>When this Bill is enacted, if that Member is required to undergo further treatment will he be required to fill out a form and make a declaration that during the past year he underwent massive surgery and could only afford to pay a small amount towards its cost and that his friends, supporters, colleagues in the House and others raised a good deal of money to cover its cost?  Why should that be a matter of public interest?  Why should that person be dragged through the indignity of stating the value of the services rendered if such circumstances were repeated following the passage of the Bill?  The Minister of State and Deputy Connolly are aware of the person to whom I refer.  It is wrong that such a Member should have to complete a return stating the value of the money collected on his or her behalf towards the cost of major surgery.  Such a request is offensive to privacy and to reason.</P>
      <P>I would much prefer to hear the Minister say that when the Bill goes to the Seanad she will exclude medical and legal advice of this type.  If such circumstances were repeated next year when this Bill is enacted, it is offensive that a Member would be forced to complete a form stating the value of the service he received.</P>

      <P>The more the matter is elucidated, the more I consider the amendment has far-reaching consequences. During the years Members have assisted a colleague, sometimes from across the political divide, in a private matter and that is only to be expected.  Will it is be necessary to disclose details of such assistance when the Bill is enacted?  Deputy McDowell raised an important point that when the Bill is enacted Members may be reluctant to assist another Member because of fear is being dragged into the public arena.  It is petty to request a Member to divulge the financial assistance received towards the cost of his or her medical expenses.  It is regrettable that mortality figures reveal that political life is high risk and that has been proven over the years.  The information requested in this amendment is a new departure.  I have never been asked to reveal information on medical or legal services.  I do not understand the necessity for the inclusion of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage I raised whether professionals or those in reasonably well paid employment will be willing to stand for election to either House when this Bill is enacted.  If Members are requested to reveal such information, potential candidates will note that, if elected, they will be required to supply medical reports.  Many companies require a person, when selected for appointment, to undergo a medical examination but I am not aware of any <Col N="802" /> company that requires established members of staff to supply a medical report.  Job applicants are not asked details of their legal advisers.  Such information will only be requested if a claim for compensation is made and that is standard practice.  Will the message go from this debate that newly elected members of the House be required to disclose details of their medical records in a case where they are in receipt of free medical treatment?</P>
    <P>As Deputy McDowell and I said, we are not aware of any Member availing or having availed of free medical treatment. A party colleague may assist another who may be suffering from a minor ailment such as flu, but in medical matters involving general practitioners and hospital care I want the message to go from here that Members pay their way for such treatment.  Why is the disclosure of such information relevant? Are the media going to report that in future newly elected Members will be required to submit a medical report, a psychiatric report and details of legal cases and legal representation?  I do not consider it necessary or understand why Deputies should have to supply such information.</P>

      <P>If I were unfortunate enough to require a liver transplant and had to travel abroad for the operation and various people clubbed together to pay the cost, I would object, in principle, to being requested to register that gift of necessary treatment on a register of interests in the House.  This is not a fanciful objection on my part, we know of circumstances in which this might have happened.  I object in principle to the idea that a person who receives a life saving gift should be required to declare it, however vague the amendment requires the declaration to be.  This is unacceptable as members of the public would not be interested in who paid for such operation or in whether Members were likely to be influenced by the fact that a person gave them a gift to help defray the cost of <Col N="803" /> saving their lives.  The Bill is going much too far and we, as legislators, would be much better served by a Government that stated it is a Member's business if he or she receives free legal or medical advice or services.  The public do not have a legitimate interest in such matters. I do not accept the proposition enunciated by the Minister of State that people should be cautious before accepting anything of substantial value. If, say, I had to have a liver transplant in America I should not have to be cautious about from whom I accept money to help to pay the cost.  That is rubbish.</P>

      <P>It is offensive to our privacy to be told that something as intimate as a life saving operation paid for by colleagues or friends should be the subject of a return in public.  The same applies to psychiatric services.  I cannot imagine a psychiatrist or a psychiatric hospital not charging a Member of the Oireachtas a large fee for their services. However, if that happens it should not be of concern to anyone else.  I plead with the Minister to consider this an unwarranted intrusion into the privacy of ordinary people and that has nothing to do with corruption.  If the Minister of State can instance a case in Western democracies where a politician received free medical services and was influenced as a result, I would agree with her but, if not, she should withdraw this proposal and allow us some shred of privacy and dignity under the Bill.</P>

      <P>This amendment was tabled by the Tánaiste, but I do not understand the Labour Party's thinking behind it.  I cannot imagine Members of the Fine Gael Party agreeing to this nonsensical proposal.  Members of the public are not interested in such information. On 15 June I will have been a Member of this House for 26 years during which time no member of the public <Col N="804" /> has asked me for such information.  If a Member has a serious operation and receives financial assistance towards the cost, under a previous amendment he or she must disclose that information within the calendar month, even though the assistance may have been provided by a family member.  I do not know of any other employment in which such information is requested from employees.  Before long it will be perceived necessary for newly elected Members to present a medical certificate as well as a legal report stating whether they were assisted in paying for their defence or defended free of charge in legal cases.  The legal people who operate on a &ldquo;no foal no fee basis&rdquo;, to which Deputy McDowell referred, are very scarce in the midlands.  I accept that some legal people operate on such a basis in District Court cases dealing with, say, an unemployed person or other hardship case for which a nominal fee would apply.  However, I do not know of any politician who received free legal aid.</P>
      <P>Why should it matter to anybody, if, say, my relatives assist me in paying £12,000 for a hip operation?  If a Member takes out an overdraft or a long term loan to cover medical costs, will he or she have to declare it?  I hope not.</P>

If she conducts soundings within her party &mdash; forgetting about the Opposition parties for the moment &mdash; I think she will be satisfied that the vast majority of Members would agree that circumstances, such as a Member of this House needing a liver transplant, receiving significant gifts within that context to enable him or her save his or her life, should not be a provision of the Bill.  I appeal to the Minister of State to accept such amendments tabled in the Seanad.

    <P>I thank my colleagues for their constructive debate on this Bill over the past 18 months.  When enacted it would be my hope that its provisions will not lead to any controversy in the case of office holders or Members, since the standard of membership has been excellent. We can hold our heads high, particularly when one looks at other parliaments in Europe.  I also thank the <Col N="807" /> Minister of State, and her officials, for the courtesy throughout the long debate, engaged in without rancour but honestly and fairly.  We highlighted the strongly held views on this issue, voiced in the interest of Members and future Members of both Houses in addition to future office holders.</P>
    <P>General elections held since 1973 have led to successive changes of Government.

      <P>&ldquo;(2)  For the purposes of this section, an investment business firm shall not be regarded as operating within the State, where it is a firm which has no branch within the State and where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) its head or registered office is in a state other than a Member State, or</P>
      <P>(b) its head or registered office is in a Member State outside the State, and it is a firm which does not provide any investment business services in respect of which it is required to be authorised in its home Member State for the purposes of Council Directive 93/22/EEC of 10 May 1993, or</P>
      <P>(c) It is a firm which is authorised in a Member State outside the State, under Council Directive 93/22/EEC of 10 May 1993, but which provides investment business services of a kind for which authorisation under that Directive is not available, when it is providing such services,</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to provide for the many financial institutions, investment business firms and other companies in Ireland who currently have business relationships with a wide range of foreign banks and investment businesses.  Where these foreign investment businesses are resident in the EU, they are generally required to be authorised in their home state under the Investment Services Directive or other relevant directives so that there is <Col N="810" /> no doubt that they are entitled to do business with their Irish counterparts under their home state authorisations.</P>
    <P>In the case of non-EU firms and certain EU firms doing business which is not covered by the Investment Services Directive, it is desirable that such firms will be able to continue to provide certain services to Irish firms.  This is so as not to interfere with the normal range of business services in each direction in which Irish companies are engaged with companies in other countries.  It is not desirable, however, that such firms should operate branches in the State or provide services to less sophisticated and potentially vulnerable individuals in the State without an authorisation from an Irish supervisory authority.  For that reason, non-EU firms which have branches here or which provide services in any manner to non-professional individuals will not be exempted from being regarded as providing services within the State.  In short, Irish firms and institutions will be able to continue to get investment services from abroad where they wish to do so.</P>

      <P>I welcome this amendment but I would like some clarification on it from the Minister.  If a company outside the member states of the EU is engaged in services here but does not have a branch located here, is it subject to the terms of this Bill because the EU directive applies only to those within the member states?  I am confused about how it applies in the context of matters arising to which the Minister has already alluded.  How will we deal with a company outside the EU which does not come under the terms of the investment directive?</P>

If a bank or professional investment-type service is accustomed to dealing with, say, a Japanese bank for advice, that relationship will be allowed to continue.

      <NameTxt>Acting Chairman (Mr. Browne,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Amendment No. 4 is in the name of the Minister.  This amendment is consequential on amendment No. 5 and the proposal is that Nos. 4 and 5 be taken together.  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 19, subsection (5) (a), line 48, and in page 20, line 1, to delete &ldquo;in a country which is not a Member State&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;outside the State&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The EU Investment Services Directive requires that firms operating in the EU must be supervised by their home state. For that reason, section 10 (5) (i) requires that to be authorised in Ireland an EU firm must have its head office in Ireland.  However, some of the investment business services regulated under this Bill are not directly covered by the Investment Services Directive.  An example is the provision of investment advice where the firm does not act on behalf of the client in any transaction. As the Bill stands the EU firm providing services here which are not covered by the Bill would have to set up its head office and registered offices here in order to get authorisation.  It was felt this would be going too far.  Amendment No. 4, therefore, ensures that the directive is complied with but does not rule out the possibility that a branch of, for example, a French firm could provide services here not covered by the directive but covered by the Bill under the authorisation from the supervisory authority.  Such a firm would have to satisfy the supervisory authority concerned that it was an appropriate firm to do business in this State and the supervisory authority need not authorise it otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 5 is a consequential amendment to allow for the possibility <Col N="813" /> that a company incorporated in a member state of the EU might have an authorisation from a supervisory authority here where this is not precluded by the investment services directive.</P>

      <P>I seem to remember a similar situation with the Stock Exchange Bill and perhaps the Minister will correct me if I am wrong in this regard.  Is his amendment not superfluous in the sense that if a company's head office is located in an EU member state it is subject to that state's regulatory authority which also has a relationship with our regulatory authority?  Is it not true that we have recourse to that state's regulatory authority in dealing with any matters that might arise?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>We have recourse to that regulatory authority in regard to a company operating from its headquarters in another member state.  That relationship still stands and if we are unable to deal with the problem here, is it not within our remit to report it to the regulatory authority in the other state?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if it is in relation to a matter that comes within the ambit of the regulatory authority.  However, if the company is operating outside the non-EU directive terms, there is then a loophole which this amendment will close.</P>

We had agreed also at that stage that the green book on Government procedures would be updated.  That was certainly under way before I left office. Perhaps the Taoiseach will tell the House if this has been finished.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree we should not rehearse here the arguments that are being put in other business today.  I agree with the view that the law in every area and the ethical code that politicians should follow or the civil and criminal codes, should be clear and certain.  I do not believe it is good practice to establish legal norms which are subject to interpretation with the benefit of hindsight. The rules should be clear on the basis of foresight, not hindsight.  The House should be wary of that at all times.  The easiest thing in drafting legislation is to say this is wrong but the courts may work out exactly what is wrong and what is right within the terms of what we are saying.  The law should be clear and leave as little as possible for subsequent interpretation by the courts.  We should in the first instance make the law clear.  This is a requirement in regard to jurisprudence that applies not only in regard to the laws governing politicians, with which we as practitioners would be most familiar, but in respect of laws applying to people in all walks of life.</P>

      <P>Sir, I accept your ruling not to raise issues that are before the House.  Based on the changes before the House, at what stage of rewriting is the green book on Government procedures? If the Taoiseach is not in a position to answer that question will he consider putting in place a similar book, based on recent changes, of procedure instructions for Deputies?  I agree with what the Taoiseach said but in fairness, Members, like other professionals, should have written guidelines.  There are guidelines for Ministers but not for Members.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point in the latter part of the Deputy's question is good and this will be done.  The House is aware that the Ethics in Public Office Bill will be followed by more detailed guidelines for Members and Ministers. What the Deputy is seeking will happen and is a good idea.</P>
      <P>On the question of revising Cabinet instructions, my understanding is that the revision is being looked at but that revision would be premature in advance of the enactment of the Ethics in Public Office Bill because it will affect in no small degree the content of Government procedure instructions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bertie Ahern referred to Deputy Coveney's comments in an interview on 28 May in <i>The Sunday Tribune.</i>  The Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, said that the present requirements are too severe in relation to declarations of interest and other matters and that was deterring business people from getting involved in politics. Does the Taoiseach agree with those comments?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Ethics in Public Office Bill, when passed, will materially deter business people from taking part in politics.  One cannot make a generalisation, there are business people who are legitimate and respectful of the law, honest in all their dealings who nonetheless, for other reasons, want to guard their privacy. They have no motive other than simply wishing to retain their privacy and obviously any declaration of interests in a public way will deter such people from taking part in politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an inevitable trade off between accountability and openness in regard to one's private holdings so that people can be judged in respect of any potential conflict of interests and the problem of attracting into politics people for whom privacy is an important concern.  As with all choices in life, if one goes in one direction one loses something in another.  That is life, <Col N="817" /> unfortunately, and we cannot have it every way.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>I attended an informal dinner for Heads of State and Government in Paris on Friday 9 June 1995.  The dinner was hosted by President Chirac, the current President of the European Council, and replaced the normal bilateral pre-European Council contacts between the President of the Council and individual Heads of State and Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussion at the dinner was primarily devoted to an overview of the agenda for the forthcoming European Council in Cannes.  Specific items discussed included the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference, the jobs situation in Europe, Economic and Monetary Union and the currency situation generally, financial assistance to the countries of the Third World, of Central and Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean region, and the grave situation in Bosnia. I raised the importance which Ireland attached to co-ordinated action at European level to deal with the drugs situation, and the need to take concrete action on the jobs issue.  I asked that reports on employment from the relevant ministerial councils be expedited in a co-ordinated way.  I reiterated <Col N="820" /> Ireland's commitment to the Maastricht criteria on economic and monetary union.  Following upon my intervention on the drugs issue, there was a discussion on the obstacles that need to be cleared to allow for the early establishment of Europol.</P>
    <P>We also had a short discussion on the EU position for the forthcoming EU/US and G7 Summits.</P>
    <P>I had a short meeting with the British Prime Minister on the margins of the informal dinner.  I stressed the importance of movement in the whole area of prisoner releases.  Peace, in my view, is sufficiently consolidated now to allow the British Government to consider increasing the rate of remission of sentences and re-examining life sentence review arrangements.</P>
    <P>I also raised with the Prime Minister the Private Lee Clegg case.  I stressed the importance of ensuring that the due process of the law, and executive decision which might subsequently be taken, should be seen to be applied on an impartial basis.  Any perception that the treatment of offences might vary according to the identity of the offender would be damaging for the credibility of the processes themselves and, consequently, for the political climate in general. Time did not permit a substantive discussion or exchange of views on these topics, but I will be returning to them at future meetings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Taoiseach make publicly known his raising of the Private Lee Clegg issue?  Would he accept that this has probably damaged Anglo-Irish relations and seen a return to megaphone diplomacy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter publicly and privately because it is a matter of public concern and has been the subject of public speculation in the media for quite some time.  I do not believe good relations between Britain and Ireland are served by pretending that there are not differences between us from time to time.  No purpose, in personal relations or otherwise, is <Col N="821" /> served by failing to draw differences to the attention of one's interlocutors in a respectful and honest way.  I did that in this context.  I believe my doing so will prove to be useful in every respect and it does not in any way diminish my respect and admiration for the courage shown by the British Prime Minister across the whole range of issues in the peace process.  Equally, I have a job to do, and if that involves occasionally disagreeing with my British colleague, I will be more than willing to do that as the situation requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Taoiseach says, but I would have thought it would be more beneficial, in the context of what the Taoiseach wants to achieve, if the matter were raised privately and differences kept private for the moment. Has the Irish Government sought a change in the remission policy from 33 per cent to 50 per cent in regard to prisoners serving long sentences to reverse the change made after Ballygawley?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No purpose would be served by failing to raise matters of public concern in public and on time.  If people were to ask questions afterwards about whether I had raised particular issues, and all I could say was I had raised it privately, there would be questions from the Deputy and others seeking to verify that I had done so.  Now people know I did so and such questions cannot, therefore, arise.</P>
      <P>As to the remission policy, I have said in the House on several occasions that I have raised that issue.  I raised it in Moscow with the British Prime Minister.  I also raised it in my discussions in Westminster with opposition and government politicians on my return from Moscow.  My concern about ensuring that prisoners and their families are seen to benefit from the peace process is well known.</P>

      <P>This was the first EU summit meeting where there was no proper bilateral meeting with the Taoiseach. Is the Taoiseach concerned about <Col N="822" /> this?  I am aware of the Taoiseach's difficulties, which I understand, in getting the British Prime Minister to give times and dates.  President Clinton is also experiencing difficulty in arranging dates.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

We do not need to be involved in big production meetings with photocalls and so on in order to maintain good and fruitful dialogue or have occasional disagreements which is part of the relationship between any two <Col N="823" /> people, States or entities enjoying good relations.</P>

      <P>I will not become involved in an attribution of that type of evaluation to the different participants in the peace process.  I have long expressed the view and intend to adhere to it unless there is evidence to the contrary, that all the participants, including Sinn Féin and the British Government, are acting expeditiously and in good faith.  Obviously we have disagreements and it is the job of all those involved in the peace process to do everything we can to overcome them.  The Government is determined to overcome, in a pro-active way, the disagreements between some of the parties involved in the process.  The thinking that led to the decision to cease violence, in August 1994, dates back to 1986.  One should recognise that a change in the psychology engendered by violence will not occur overnight.  There is a healing and trust building process that requires patient and dedicated work.  That is being undertaken in a purposeful way. <Col N="825" /> All the signs, even today, are of a gradual approximation of the positions of the different parties towards each other. Although movement is slow it is in the right direction.  We will do everything we can to promote a closer co-operation and ultimately a settlement.</P>

The question of co-ordinated European naval involvement in protecting the coastline against drug trafficking has treaty implications.  I should like to see this area examined at the inter-governmental conference.  Whether there will be a conclusion remains to be seen. There is much that the EU could do by way of information exchange and co-operation, for example, information on the passage of large sums of money, which may be associated with the drugs trade, from one jurisdiction to another; what could be done to reduce the demand for drugs in our societies and the provision of alternative cultures for those engaged in agriculture in countries which are heavily engaged in the production of drugs or drug related products.</P>

I assure the House that the Government is fully committed to enabling the Forum to continue, for as long as is necessary, its very worth-while contribution to peace and reconciliation on the island.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have a firm view on that.  It is for the forum to discuss that matter.  The Deputy is a member of the forum as are other Deputies and the matter should be discussed there.  One argument is that once all-party talks are under way the forum has served its purpose while the argument put by the Deputy is that we should wait until there is an outcome.  If there is an intensive series of all-party discussions in Northern Ireland this will give rise to a practical problem in terms of the availability of people to attend meetings in Dublin.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware of the very real concern expressed at recent forum meetings about the delay in reaching conclusions on certain matters?  The forum has completed consideration of the issues under the three Strands and consensus is emerging in this respect.  Will the Taoiseach agree it is important to set a timeframe if the process, which is linked to the talks process and the intergovernmental talks, is not to run into the ground?  It is 18 months since the Downing Street Declaration was signed and ten months since the announcement of the IRA <Col N="827" /> ceasefire and while I appreciate the points made by the Taoiseach there is a danger that the process will run out of steam unless positive action is taken in intergovernmental and inter-party talks level and at the forum in the near future.</P>

      <P>This discussion should take place at the forum, not in this House.  It does not serve much purpose to discuss the matter here.  Other participants in the forum might have views on the points made by Deputy Lenihan and they should be able to discuss these rather than have the matter discussed between the parties in the Dáil. However, there is not much point in setting artificial deadlines and saying we will have a report by 1 January.  What will happen on 31 December if there is still disagreement on certain issues? Will there be a stand off or a majority vote?  Will some people be voted down and will we have a majority or minority report?  There is not much point in setting a deadline; we should be aiming at an inclusive process.  I do not agree with the Deputy's implicit suggestion that there should be a deadline.  I wish to remind him that his party was in Government when the terms of reference of the forum were drawn up and no deadline was included at that stage. I have no recollection &mdash; I am sure Deputy Harney will confirm this &mdash; of a suggestion being made by anybody that a deadline should be placed on the forum.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach has broadened the scope of the question.  It is appropriate to discuss this issue here given that the Taoiseach's predecessor set up the forum.  As the Taoiseach correctly stated, the forum was open-ended. Will he agree that the forum serves a useful function in the absence of political talks?  The point made by Deputy Lenihan was also raised by John Hume and discussed at two of the last three meetings of the forum.  The forum should come to conclusions on some of the issues we have discussed.  Last week we concluded discussions on Strand III and it is important that we tidy up some of the work which has been completed &mdash; or almost completed &mdash; and reach conclusions in the not too distant future on our discussions to date on Strands I, II and III.  This is how the 1984 forum operated.  If we do not do this we will be working in a vacuum.  The forum must sit until the round table talks establish another body or assembly.  The SDLP and other parties are also of the view that the work completed within the past eight months should be brought to finality.</P>

      <P>With regard to the word &ldquo;vacuum&rdquo;, over the past few months a framework document on the basis for a future settlement in Northern Ireland, and agreed between the two Governments, has been published, ministerial talks have been opened with parties such as Sinn Féin &mdash; these have moved to Secretary of State level &mdash; and invitations have been issued by me and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to all the parties in Northern Ireland to engage in discussions.

The forum is not a negotiating body and there are fundamental differences between parties on certain key issues.

      <P>Clear statements in regard to the consent principle are very important from the point of view of confidence building in Northern Ireland which is a matter of considerable value and importance.  I also commend to Members the remarks in regard to the decommissioning of arms which were made by the Nobel Peace prize winner, Dr. Oscar Arias in a Belfast edition of the <i>Sunday World</i> newspaper recently in which he said:</P>
      <P>Those of you who have weapons face now the future that must come, when you will give up those weapons that no longer defend you or advance your goals.  Be prepared to be called &ldquo;traitor&rdquo; by some.  Be prepared to not easily be pardoned by others.</P>
      <P>Be prepared to feel vulnerable when you step into public life again without a loaded pistol in your pocket.  And then be prepared, one day, to tell your children how you gave them a future by putting down your gun and reaching out your hands to build life rather than to take it.</P>
      <P>No people, anywhere, has progressed with an ingrained habit of violence and sectarianism.  Violence is not the pursuit of politics by other means.  It is the failure of politics.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of the Taoiseach prepared a preliminary Statement of Strategy in 1994 in line with the decision taken by our predecessors in Government.</P>
      <P>In common with those for all Departments, this Strategy Statement was presented to the SMI co-ordinating group of secretaries for evaluation.  The statement is now being reviewed to take into account the observations made by the co-ordinating group, the Government's decision that statements be reviewed and updated in light of A <i>Government of Renewal</i> and the discussions taking place at present within the Department in relation to its key goals and objectives.</P>
      <P>In particular, as with all departmental strategy statements, it is being revised to translate departmental and divisional objectives into specific action oriented strategies with accompanying measures of performance.  This process will be completed by the Department of the Taoiseach for end July.</P>
      <P>The Government has decided that strategy statements will be published and I expect that the statement for the Department of the Taoiseach will be published in September.</P>
      <P>Structural changes within the Department to facilitate a strategic management approach will be considered in the light of the finalised strategy statement and any changes made will be designed to ensure the Department can carry out its mission and meet its objectives as set out in the strategy statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of the Taoiseach, in common with all Departments, will be part of the wider public service renewal process.  In this context, the Government decision of 2 March, arising from the first report of the SMI co-ordianting <Col N="833" /> group of secretaries, mandated the co-ordinating group to: review existing systems for making decisions, allocating responsibility and ensuring accountability in the Civil Service; and bring forward for Government consideration, by end June, 1995, proposals for an integrated programme to modernise the systems and practices in question and for the consequent modernisation of existing personnel and financial management in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The second report of the co-ordinating group, which will make recommendations on these matters, will be finalised within a month for consideration and decision by Government.</P>

      <P>Every time a question arises about the strategic management plan it is answered in such a way that I am more confused after the answer.  It happened on the previous occasion also and I am not blaming the Minister. Obviously, the Government, the Minister or the Taoiseach in this case set out the policy in this case.  Will public servants be given specific targets and objectives in the implementation of that policy?  The Minister referred to the need for accountability among civil servants.  How does she envisage that will happen?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is any consolation to the Deputy, she is not alone in finding the language in many of the concepts involved difficult.  It is new in many cases.  I hope to have the opportunity fairly shortly to speak with all my colleagues in the House, not just Government colleagues, to bring them up to date on this process launched by Deputy Albert Reynolds, the then Taoiseach, in February or March 1994.  There are many matters to be dealt with.  In terms of accountability and changes of responsibility, both for Ministers and civil servants, this will require amendments to the Ministers and Secretaries Act and to the Civil Service Regulations. Those matters and those referred to by the Deputy in her question are being dealt with separately at a <Col N="834" /> central level &mdash; not Department by Department &mdash; by the SMI co-ordinating group of secretaries who have yet to submit a second report.  We hope to have that report by the end of June. Any changes in functions or responsibilites of civil servants are not specific to the Department of the Taoiseach.  The Deputy is aware of the story about accountability and there are many changes in legislation particularly in the freedom of information legislation and the Ethics in Public Office Bill, which is going through the House.  There are many areas in which we will open up the whole issue of accountability.  The Deputy must know by now exactly where this Government stands on accountability and, indeed, the Taoiseach's commitment to it.  That must be clearly understood by now.</P>

      <P>In the context of the strategic management initiative, is the Minister aware that many civil servants who are professionally qualified and are members of professional bodies are disbarred from competing for promotion within their various Departments?  In many cases, they are making decisions and writing the reports for people who <Col N="835" /> are senior to them but not as well qualified. This issue arises in the case of members of the Institute of Chartered Accountants.  Is the Minister aware of this and, if so, does he intend to deal with it as it pertains to how civil servants operate, achieve promotion and how the best people can fill the top positions?</P>

      <P>That is a separate question but I am pleased to give a short answer to it.  That, along with many other matters in relation to Civil Service recruitment and promotion opportunities, is being dealt with in the overall public sector reform consultations which are also being taken on board by the SMI co-ordinating group of secretaries who will report to Government. It encompasses all Departments and is not specific to the Department of the Taoiseach, as the original question was. I am aware of the problems and they are being considered.</P>

      <P>The overseas tourism and travel statistics published by the Central Statistics Office are based primarily on two large year round sample surveys of passengers, both inward and outward, at all major air and sea ports.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;Country of Residence Survey&rdquo;, which covered 142,000 inward and 150,000 outward passengers in 1994, provides an estimated distribution of passengers by country of residence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;Passenger Card Inquiry&rdquo;, which <Col N="836" /> covered 114,000 inward and 162,000 outward passengers in 1994, provides information on the reason for the journey, area of residence, length of stay, expenditure and fare costs.</P>
    <P>The results of these two surveys are used in conjunction with total passenger movement figures supplied by the transport companies to provide estimates of all visits and related expenditure by overseas visitors to Ireland, excluding Irish residents returning from visits abroad, and visits abroad by Irish residents. These estimates are published on a quarterly and annual basis.</P>
    <P>Internationally, a tourist is defined as a person travelling to and staying in a country other than that in which he-she has his-her usual residence for a period not exceeding 12 months for leisure, business and other purposes.  Business travellers are, therefore, correctly included; this ensures that Ireland's international tourism and travel balance of payments transactions are comprehensively covered.</P>
    <P>Business travellers are, however, separately identified in the &ldquo;reason for journey&rdquo; classification which distinguishes (1) business, (2) tourist, (3) visit to relatives and (4) other.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is generally recognised that the setting up of the Dublin Tourist Victim Support Service in April of last year has played a valuable role in counteracting the problem of crime against tourists.  The service provides emotional and practical support to tourist victims.  Following my recent meeting with the board of management of the <Col N="837" /> service, and in the light of its positive contribution to tourism, I doubled my Department's support for it from £5,000 in 1994 to £10,000 in 1995.  I am sure the Deputy will join with me in applauding the service, and those associated with it, on the magnificent job they have done to date.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the extensive media coverage given to the recent deplorable attack on an Australian tourist, there is no evidence to suggest that there has been an increase in crime against tourists this year compared to 1994.  This is to be welcomed, especially when put in the context of the continually high growth in tourism visitor numbers coming to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Minister in applauding the Dublin Tourist Victim Support Service on the work it has done but would not get carried away with the increase in subvention to this excellent organisation from £5,000 to £10,000. Like the Minister, I deplore the attack on the Australian tourist in Galway city in recent days and welcome his assurance that he will attend to the touristic requirements of the individual concerned on her return to Ireland but I would not like the message to go from this House that Galway is not a safe city. I know it well and have come to appreciate its ambience as a city of culture with an important heritage.  It is one of the finest cities in Europe.  While this attack was unfortunate is it not indicative that a young woman could not walk home alone at night in safety? Does the Minister propose to take any additional measures to prevent such attacks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with the Deputy that Galway city and vast parts of the country are safe both for visitors and natives alike.  The overall response should be that while Ireland is a safe and friendly destination people should take reasonable precautions as they would in any other country in the world and, in relation to Dublin, they <Col N="838" /> should take the precautions they would take in any other city of similar size.</P>
      <P>I commend the Australian tourist involved in this incident, Catriona McCormack, for putting the matter in context in a fair, balanced and courageous way.  She said that she had travelled in many countries and that this incident could have happened anywhere. It was unfortunate and most unusual and something we all deplore. It was one incident too many.</P>
      <P>The Deputy asked if I propose to take any additional measures.  In response to a similar question on a previous occasion I referred to the attempts being made by the tourist information services, the Garda Síochána, tour operators and tourism promoters abroad. We cannot give too much publicity to the minority of incidents which occur when we are in competition with other countries where the number of incidents involving tourists is much higher.  For instance, in Amsterdam, 10 per cent of tourists are involved in incidents.  This is an extremely high crime rate.  I agree with the Deputy therefore that vast parts of the country are safe and that it provides a wonderful welcome to our visitors.  We should ensure in so far as we can that they take reasonable precautions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the relocation of 20 members of the Garda Síochána from the Border in recent days.  Will the Minister try to ensure, as part of the peace process bonus, that more gardai are withdrawn and relocated not only in Dublin but other locations?  While I agree that we can talk ourselves into a crisis we have a function, duty and responsibility to ensure the safety of visitors to this country and natives who visit tourist attractions on this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand, unfortunately, that some 300 to 400 visitors have either been injured or interfered with since the beginning of the year.  Those figures must be reduced.  Will the Minister give us an assurance that this will happen? One way of doing this is to ensure more <Col N="839" /> Garda foot patrols and by relocating more gardaí from the Border in places where they are required in the national interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I have spoken to the Minister for Justice about Garda foot patrols.  I welcome the decision to move 20 gardaí from the Border.  I am sure the Minister for Justice is in consultation with the Garda Commissioner who has responsibility for this matter.  Perhaps he will consider the question of the redeployment of staff.</P>
      <P>According to recent media reports 800 crimes against tourists were committed in the first five months of this year.  According to the Department of Justice, the number of reported crimes or incidents was 912 as compared to 906 in the first five months of 1994. However, when we compare this figure against the increasing numbers of visitors the decrease is more significant than it appears.  About 10 per cent would have been seen by the Dublin Tourist Victim Support Service and very few of these would have been involved in serious incidents.  As I indicated previously, 0.005 per cent, or one in every 150,000 visitors, is involved in an incident where violence is used.  That is the reason I again deplore the incident that occurred in Galway last week.  Those are the official figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister met, separately or together, representatives of Bord Fáilte and the regional tourism organisations as well as the Minister for Justice and, if so, how many times?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I have discussed this question, among other matters, with the chairmen and chief executives of the regional tourism organisations.  I have also met the Minister for Justice on a number of occasions not only to discuss this but a range of other matters.  I am in constant contact with Bord Fáilte.  I may consider, with the Minister for Justice, relaunching the Dublin Tourist Victim Support Service in an effort to <Col N="840" /> further promote it and to make everyone aware that we are serious about this matter.</P>
      <P>The bottom line is that visitors to this country should take reasonable precautions as they would in any other country.  As the Deputy has rightly pointed out, this is a wonderful country and we value its perception abroad as a friendly environment in which to take a holiday.  We hope to keep it that way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The maintenance of environmental standards, while primarily a matter for the Minister for the Environment, is something that concerns us all.  Ireland's greatest natural tourism strength is our clean and green environment.  We have the lowest population density in Europe with large open spaces, uncrowded roads and areas of great scenic beauty.  This is a legacy of history and nature that I am determined to preserve in so far as my area of responsibility is concerned.</P>
      <P>To this end the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999, acknowledges that a balance must be struck between development and conservation. All developments under the programme are required to comply with the best environmental standards.  One of the main instruments used to ensure the maintenance of environment standards is the planning process.  The planning process is also used to ensure the application of EU environment impact assessment directives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="841" /> We are not, nor do we wish to be, a mass tourism destination.  All our future plans for the further development of tourism, involving the development of new markets and products to improve the seasonal and geographic spread of tourism in Ireland, will demonstrate full sensitivity to the need for compatibility with our environmental strengths.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree there must be a balance between development and the environment.  However, in terms of a current issue, the Masonite factory to be situated at Drumsna in the lovely county of Leitrim, does the Minister agree with the efforts to scupper that project by his colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, and apparently for everything else &mdash; a man for whom I have the greatest personal respect but who seems to have a capacity to intrude on every portfolio?

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a separate question. The Government supports this project.  I understand the Minister's objections are on visual grounds.  It is feasible to maintain a balance between the creation of industrial jobs and the preservation of the lovely scenery in the Shannon basin, which is of great interest to us all and has great potential in terms of tourism.  I will not comment on the remarks about the Minister, Deputy Higgins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks are not personal to Deputy Higgins.  I have had many dealings with him over the years and found him to be a good and decent man, and that will always be my view. However, if An Bord Pleanála turns down this application it is unlikely the <Col N="842" /> industry will set up operations anywhere else in Ireland.  I take the Minister's point that the question is not directly relevant, but this is an example of what can happen in the event of failure to recognise the need to balance development and the environment.  Such a failure in this instance will be to the disadvantage of the county, the country and particularly the people who would be employed on the project.  The intervention of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht is most unfortunate and inappropriate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 27, 45, 51, 148, 152 and 157 together.</P>
      <P>The greatest achievement of the Washington conference was a raising of the profile of Ireland and of Irish tourism and trade.  It also highlighted the business opportunities which exist for US investors in both Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  The conference was not an end in itself, but rather a beginning.  Business decisions are not made instantly and it is too soon to quantify the economic benefits. However, the spotlight has now been firmly turned on the region and it remains for all of us to build on the opportunities presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The potential for investment in Ireland received the fullest possible endorsement from President Clinton <Col N="844" /> and US Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown.  Ireland was promoted as the ideal European base for US companies to do business.  As a result I understand that An Bord Tráchtála is receiving additional inquiries from US firms about trade opportunities and partnerships. As a follow-up to the conference ABT is working closely with the US Department of Commerce on US trade missions to Ireland.  Throughout the conference, ABT and the Industrial Development Board of Northern Ireland co-operated closely.  There was much networking between firms on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>With regard to tourism, I expect that this will be a record year for visitors from the US and we hope to receive more than 500,000 visitors.  I am convinced that the conference was particularly helpful in reinforcing the message of peace.  The planned visit of President Clinton to Ireland this year will greatly add to this.</P>
    <P>I understand from Bord Fáilte that it is currently discussing US capital investments of over £55 million in the Republic in respect of a number of specific projects.  Other potential investment opportunities are also being followed up.</P>
    <P>I was delighted to sign a joint communiqué with the US Secretary of Commerce, Ron Brown, and my counterpart in Belfast, Baroness Denton, which reinforced our joint determination to promote tourism throughout Ireland, develop initiatives to increase private sector investment and improve training for the sector.  This communiqué was proof positive of the support which the Clinton administration is giving to Irish tourism, and it is another example of effective cross-Border co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>We are very pleased with the role of President Clinton at the Washington conference.  I was interested in the figure on upcoming projects.  Is the Minister linking that to the conference or is it part of an ongoing programme?  Where does the Minister expect the benefits to accrue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="845" /> Will they be in the area of tourism? Does the Minister expect a greater benefit in trade or industrial development? What is his view on the partnerships that might evolve between Irish and US companies?  Is that an area that can be developed as a result of the Washington conference or will it be simply a case of trade missions coming here?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>More than 1,000 delegates attended the conference and there was a great deal of interaction between businesses here and in the US. At any one time about 100 prime ministers wish to see the President of the United States, yet he, the Vice-President, the Secretary of State, Secretary of Commerce and special economic adviser devoted two days to investment and trade in Ireland, with specific reference to Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  In terms of trade there were some very good break-out sessions and much contact was made between businesses north and south of the Border and their American counterparts. It is much too early to say what the results will be.  It could be 12, 15 or 18 months before any definite results are evident.  Many of the people involved in this process may see results much sooner and I hope that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From a tourism point of view the fact that the communiqué was signed and agreed on behalf of the three Governments endorses that view.  I understand a well attended tourism breakout session has led to a great deal of contact between would-be investors in terms of leisure and other facilities and I am sure it will pay dividends.  It is early to ascertain the level of benefits that will flow from that conference, but the fundamental message given by the US President is that Ireland is a good place in which to invest, that it makes good commercial sense to invest here, that American corporate companies can make a profit here.  It is a gateway to Europe, we speak the same language and have a great deal of flexibility and a high degree of training.  I found it <Col N="846" /> somewhat ironic that 150 years after the misery of emigration to the United States after the Famine, representatives of Irish business and tourism were in a position to attend a conference in Washington and request representatives of American companies to invest in Ireland.  It was a good conference which generated a great deal of enthusiasm.  I expect it will give rise to a great deal of business and we are hoping for a good result from it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">

      <P>I accept that the Minister is in a feel good mood following the conference and to an extent he is basking in the reflected glory.  Have a number of companies given a commitment to invest or are they investigating specific areas?  Having spent many years in business, I am aware we may feel good about matters, but it is important to follow them up.  We do not want reassurances, we want orders and to secure the business.  Can the Minister point to the Washington conference having given rise to specific projects?  Is he confident that particular firms are interested in establishing plants here?</P>

      <P>The £55 million to which I referred relates to facilities and proposals which predate the conference, but they would probably have been initiated in the light of the conference taking place.  Regarding following up potential investors, Bord Tráchtála together with the IDA undertakes such work on a continuing basis.  I do not want to refer to specific companies as the Deputy is aware from experience what may happen if an announcement or reference is made in that context.  I can report to the Deputy that there is a great deal of activity taking place between American businesses and the IDA on possible investments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 12 June officials of my Department met officials of the Department of Economic Development.  The US Department of Commerce is involved in these meetings.  The next one will take place in July to follow up potential <Col N="847" /> American investors and correlate activities in light of President Clinton's forthcoming visit to Ireland.  We are planning for progress in this area and we are determined not only to use the feel good factor following the conference but to build on it to secure tangible results.</P>

      <P>Given tourism's growing status internally as a major form of internationally-traded service, it can reasonably be said that the rights and obligations of tourists as a collective body of users are still evolving.  I am not aware that there is any widespread development or use of tourist charters <Col N="848" /> or, specifically, any particular demand for one here.  That said, I am not opposed to the idea in principle, but I would require a lot more substance both as to the need for and value of a charter before I could consider introducing one here.</P>
      <P>Tourists generally benefit from advances made under consumer legislation in recent years and this situation will be further clarified and strengthened with the implementation later this month by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, of the EC Directive on Package Travel.  This will offer the tourist greater protection against non-performance of contract for package holidays, incorporating transport, accommodation, etc.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte, through its offices and the regional tourist organisations, monitors complaints from tourists.  The number of complaints made, bearing in mind the number of tourists who visit Ireland, is very small.  Less than 2,000 complaints from our 3.6 million overseas and domestic tourists were made in 1994. Accordingly, I do not believe there is a demonstrated need at this point to consider establishing a charter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give the matter a preliminary examination? Having regard to what he said about existing legislation, the main reason I tabled the question is to introduce quality, confidence and uniformity of treatment for tourists.  I categorise visitors from outside our shores as tourists, but there are tourists within the country who would like a charter of rights across a broad spectrum.  I imagine such a charter could be contained in a small pamphlet and in those circumstances it would not be too difficult for the Minister's Department and the tourism organisations to produce it as a matter of urgency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not opposed, in principle, to the issue of a charter for tourists within and outside our country. If such a charter were introduced it would have to be effective, not a public <Col N="849" /> relations exercise.  Given the disparate nature and extent of our tourism industry, such a charter would be difficult and costly to organise.  The number of complaints lodged by visitors during the period 1990 to 1994 across a range of areas, including hotels, guesthouses, holiday camps, caravan parks, car hire, cruises, etc. has consistently fallen, with few exceptions.  Our visitors deserve quality in all aspects of the tourism industry from services and facilities to providing a reasonable level of comfort.  That message is getting across and those involved in this rapidly growing industry understand that they should provide high quality and standards.  I am not opposed to it in principle, but there are many more pressing matters that the Deputy and I should deal with prior to the establishment of such a charter.  If we demonstrate quality there will not be any need for a charter.</P>

      <P>The Central Statistics Office recently released the final figures for overseas visitors and revenue for 1994.  Overseas visitors increased by 10.5 per cent on 1993 to 3.681 million with revenue increasing by 9.5 per cent to £1,497 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish tourism performed extremely well in 1994 with growth rates in visitor numbers from our main markets ranging from 4.9 per cent in Europe and 10.6 per cent in Britain to more than 19 per cent in the US.  This performance is all the more impressive given that it took place against a background of low growth in international travel in 1994. The World Tourism Organisation has estimated that total European arrivals increased by only 2 per cent in 1994 while international tourism receipts increased by some 5 per cent.  I am confident that the Irish tourism industry <Col N="850" /> will continue to enjoy above average growth in 1995.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware of the major disparity in the preliminary figures between regions in terms of growth.  When I tabled the question I did not have access to the final figures.  Will he comment on the variation between regions, particularly the disparity between increasing numbers and increasing revenue in some regions?  In the south east there has been a 16 per cent increase in numbers and a 35 per cent increase in revenue and in the south west there has been a 1 per cent increase in numbers and a 2 per cent decrease in revenue.  As such a pattern is a cause of major concern, what action does the Minister propose to redress it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>While recent media reports have revealed a decrease in tourist numbers and revenue in various places, the figures for January to March indicate an estimated 615,000 overseas visitors to the country compared with 527,000 in the same period of 1994, an increase of approximately 17 per cent. Perhaps some areas are making greater marketing efforts to attract visitors.  If the Deputy tables a separate question about specific regions I will supply him with as much information as possible.  I intend to establish the significance of the patterns.  If overall visitors and revenue are increasing, it should be possible to establish the locations to which visitors travel.  There has been a major increase in the number of Northern Ireland and English registered cars on our roads, but I am not sure of the areas visited by their owners.  If the Deputy puts down a separate question on the matter I will supply him with the information he requires.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are being discussed together.  The Investment Services Directive requires that firms operating in the European Union must be supervised by their home member state.  For that reason section 10 (5) (i) requires <Col N="990" /> that to be authorised in Ireland a European Union firm must have its head office here.  However, some of the investment business services regulated under the Bill are not directly covered by the European Union Investment Services Directive, for example, the provision of investment advice where the firm does not act on behalf of the client in a transaction.</P>
      <P>As the Bill stands a European Union firm providing such services here would have to set up its head office and registered offices here in order to get authorisation and we believe this goes too far. Amendment No. 4 will ensure that the directive is complied with, but does not rule out the possibility that a branch of, for example, a French firm could provide services here not covered by the European Union directive but covered by this Bill under an authorisation from the supervisory authority.  If an investment firm from an EU member state wished to carry out non-EU directive business here it would require authorisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister and his Department that, not only in respect of this Bill but others which come about as a result of European Union directives &mdash; recognising the amount of work in drafting legislation on foot of such directives &mdash; perhaps the original directive could be attached to the explanatory memorandum with Bills.  I understand this Bill arose from two such directives of the European Commission.  If that could be done in the case of all Bills, irrespective of their sponsoring Department, everybody would more easily understand the purpose of the relevant directives.</P>
      <P>Within my term of office in Government, before such European directives came into being, an enormous amount of background work was involved on the part of civil servants working for various Governments throughout the European Union, but, when it came to the stage at which politicians had an input it was often unwelcome.  My colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, spoke about this some time ago.  In the last Department in which I served, Tourism and Trade, which had enormous supervisory responsibilities in overseeing European Union directives.  I became acutely aware of the tremendous amount of work undertaken even halfway through drawing up such a directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nonetheless, when a final directive is produced, forming the basis of any Bill to be introduced, it would be a good idea to attach the original directive to the explanatory memorandum.  Perhaps <Col N="993" /> the Minister would be the first to introduce that idea in his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good idea. Indeed we may have an opportunity to implement it sooner rather than later, since there is a directive in preparation dealing with investor compensation which would be of direct relevance to this Bill.  I cannot think of any good reason we should not do so.  In fact if it had been done in this case, it would have rendered it easier for me to accept what the Deputy is advocating.  I take his point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals with existing investment business firms. Perhaps the Minister will outline the procedures that will have to be adopted by existing business firms to comply with these regulations.  Since the enactment of this Bill will lead to the establishment of elaborate machinery, I do not know how many civil servants will be required to oversee these regulations. I make this suggestion not merely in the case of this Bill but with regard to various supervisory activities of other Government Departments, which do not come into play until something happens.  For instance, if somebody defrauds an investor, the relevant investor will have lost the money before the supervisory functions resulting from the enactment of this Bill come into play but, as I have already pointed out, will be of little use.</P>
      <P>What procedures will have to be adopted by an existing investment intermediary, say, an accountancy firm or whoever, to comply with the regulations specified in this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>First, this section deals with transitional arrangements in the case of persons providing investment <Col N="994" /> business services prior to this section coming into effect.  They must apply for authorisation within three months of this part of the Bill coming into operation and will stand authorised under the Bill, subject to the supervisory authority's conditions and requirements, pending the decision of the supervisory authority; in other words, they can carry on provided they apply within three months and will be deemed to be acceptable until deemed otherwise.</P>
      <P>There is also provision for the treatment of firms based in other European Union member states during this transitional period.  Section 13 (1) provides that a person providing investment business services on the day before this section comes into effect may stand authorised, as an authorised investment business firm, from the date the section comes into operation.  However, the relevant person must apply for authorisation within three months of its coming into being.</P>
      <P>Section 13 (2) provides that, pending the supervisory authority's decision to authorise an investment business firm, it may impose conditions, requirements or directions on that investment business firm or on any associated or related undertaking.</P>
      <P>Section 13 (3) provides that an investment business firm may appeal to the High Court against any condition or requirement imposed on it under this subsection.  Section 13 (4) provides that the court may confirm, vary or rescind any condition or requirement which the supervisory authority has imposed under this section.  Section 13 (5) provides that, pending implementation of the Investment Services Directive in each member state, a firm based in another member state may be authorised to conduct business in Ireland where it is adequately supervised in that member state.  This is necessary only as a transitional provision until all member states have implemented the directive. When all the member states have implemented the directive in full there will be no need for, say, a French firm to have a separate Irish authorisation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a particularly complicated Bill which has received broad welcome throughout the industry, apart from one observation I will make later, various sections affording rights of appeal to the courts, for example, sections 45, 66, 74, 75 and the one about which we are now speaking.  Will this elaborate procedure have any effect on protecting the investor who loses money?  I heard the Minister for Enterprise and Employment say recently &mdash; and I am sure the advice given to him is correct &mdash; that one of the reasons he was not considering using the courts procedure <i>vis-à-vis</i> the problems with the <i>Irish Press</i> was that it would take two years and the problems there need to be solved quickly.</P>
      <P>Various sections of the Bill provide for the right to go to the courts to resolve disputes in this area.  However, the rogue intermediary will be long gone by the time such a case is heard in the courts.  What is the value in having these particular sections?  Not only will the horse have bolted by the time cases can be heard in the courts but the stable will probably have gone also.  Perhaps the Minister would give us his own views on this particular area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The procedures that allow for appeals to be made to the High Court will apply in extreme and rare circumstances but, in natural justice, they must be provided. If we did not provide them in the Bill they would probably be provided under the Constitution. There must be some appeals mechanism in place.  If a firm is authorised under certain terms and conditions and for whatever reason it feels some of those conditions are too onerous, there must be an independent authority to which they can appeal and the High Court is seen as the place where natural justice is protected.  That does not have a great deal of implication for the person whose money is at risk.  The regulations will stand and if somebody proffering services does not like the regulations and appeals to the court, those regulations will apply until the <Col N="996" /> appeal is determined.  Therefore, the person investing their money is protected in the meantime.  It is not valid to draw the conclusion that because the High Court appeals procedure is lengthy it would put a person's money at risk.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little point in setting up these supervisory and regulatory mechanisms unless the Department whose responsibility they will be or the supervisory authorities embark on a publicity campaign to make people aware of what they should look for before they go to an investment intermediary.</P>
      <P>There has been a plethora of legislation in many areas over a long number of years.  One of the difficulties is that we have legislation covering many areas.  Speaking as someone who has had to make his living at the fringes of legislation through my work as an accountant, it strikes me that the more legislation that is enacted, the more loopholes are created.  With due deference to my colleague, Deputy Michael McDowell, certain members of his profession would not be as wealthy if all that legislation was not in place.  With EU law going in that direction, there will be increasing opportunities for people in the legal profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise we have all become very conscious of the environment in the past few years but if we implemented many of the laws on our Statute Book there would not be any need for additional laws.  We are talking about setting up supervisory authorities which will come into play when an unfortunate investor has lost money.  Instead of giving 50 civil servants in a Department the responsibility for dealing with the effects of this and other Bills, including the Stock Exchange Bill, it would be preferable to make people aware, through publicity campaigns run by the supervisory authorities or the relevant Department, of the pitfalls in going to an investment intermediary.  That would be far more beneficial to the people we want to protect and the purpose of the original EU <Col N="997" /> directives.  Many of our laws come into effect when it is too late.  I realise the supervisory authorities will have ongoing responsibilities in regard to auditing, etc., but I ask the Minister to take account of my views in regard to their more important role.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of what the Deputy suggests will be carried out. There will be additional requirements for investment houses and so on to let it be known to potential investors that they are working within a regulatory system.  For example, intermediaries must have written authority to act in that capacity and if they accept money on behalf of an institution and do not give that money to it the institution is responsible.  In addition to what is contained in the Bill it would be worth while for the regulatory authorities, in other words, the Central Bank and the Department of Enterprise and Employment to consider publishing information to make investors aware of the position.  That is a good suggestion by the Deputy and I take it on board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 16 sets out the cases in which the supervisory authority can revoke the authorisation of an authorised investment business firm and those in which I can apply to the High Court for such revocation.  It sets out also the obligations of an investment business firm whose authorisation has been revoked both where the firm is being wound up and where it is not and the powers of the supervisory authority in each case.  Subsection (1) enables the supervisory authority to revoke the authorisation of an authorised investment business firm where the firm so requests; where it has failed to operate within 12 months of receiving authorisation; has failed to operate for more than six months or where it is being wound up.  The supervisory authority is empowered to revoke authorisation in <Col N="999" /> these cases because the need for revocation is objective and clearcut.  This basically mirrors the provision in the Stock Exchange Bill.  Where it is absolutely clearcut that it should be revoked, including where there is a request from the firm and so on, it is an automatic procedure but where an opinion is involved it is more complicated and the firm would have certain rights of appeal to the High Court.</P>

In addition it must, as soon as possible, notify the supervisory authority, and such other persons as the supervisory authority indicates are to be notified, of the measures being taken to discharge its liabilities and obligations.  If it fails to notify the supervisory authority or others as soon as possible, or if the measures it proposes are inadequate, then the supervisory authority may prohibit it from creating liabilities, disposing of assets, engaging in transactions or making payments without the supervisory authority's prior sanction.  The supervisory authority may also require it to submit for approval within two months of such prohibition a scheme for the orderly discharge of its liabilities, duties and obligations.</P>

      <P>The definition &ldquo;inactive&rdquo; is misleading.  A firm may be inactive but it is still the firm through which the investment was made and to whom the person who made the investment will return to redeem his investment. It is hard to justify taking a firm out of the system because it is inactive, although I am aware that there has been much mischief in this area and we must implement the EU directive.  However, I would not like to see a firm which is genuinely inactive for one reason or another taken out of the system.</P>

      <P>This refers to the keeping of a register by the supervisory authority which will also be available for public inspection.  Perhaps the supervisory and regulatory bodies could publicise, for the benefit of the public, what they, the public, should look for in an investment intermediary.  You cannot set up shop as a solicitor unless you are a member of the Incorporated Law Society, although I know of one case in my constituency some time ago where somebody who was not a solicitor practised as one.  You cannot set up as a medical doctor unless you are a qualified medical doctor, but I know of a celebrated case in Dublin where a person did just that and made a lot of money practising as an orthopaedic expert for many years although he was not qualified &mdash; he was a very personable individual whom I knew in other contexts. You cannot set up as a chartered quantity surveyor unless you are a member of the institute.  However, you can set up as an accountant without being a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants or the other recognised institutions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>You can also call yourself an engineer, and people who are members of the professional bodies and have spent many years studying are aggrieved by this.  That is not to say that many of those people calling themselves engineers, accountants, architects, surveyors, etc., are not as good as many of <Col N="1003" /> the people who are members of the professional bodies.  However, many of my colleagues in the accountancy profession are quite aggrieved at some firms.  My point is that the supervisory authority is to keep a register and, in the publicity surrounding this Bill, the supervisory authority might, as a means of making the public more aware of their rights, require an investment intermediary to display his annual certificate confirming that he is a recognised investment intermediary.  Perhaps this could also be extended to solicitors.  As someone who has, on occasions, had the onerous job of auditing solicitors' accounts, which no chartered accountant relishes because it is such an onerous task carrying such heavy responsibilities, I suggest we begin here by requiring a company to have a certificate that it is a recognised investment intermediary and covering the relevant year.  That requirement should be extended to other areas also so that the public will know with whom they are dealing.</P>
      <P>The people are becoming far more aware of their rights in many areas and are very attuned to any type of investment opportunity.  I have learned more about better investment opportunities from fellows sitting on bar stools in pubs than I learned in all my years in college or from talking to my professional colleagues. Perhaps more people read the financial pages of newspapers than before.  However, there is always a percentage of the population that is easy prey to the wide boys and no law can guard against that.  It would be worth including in the legislation a requirement that investment intermediaries display a certificate.  Legislation is of no use when things go wrong.  Would it not be better to make people more aware of their rights since the purpose of the directive and of the Bill is to protect the public?</P>

      <P>This Bill improves the situation radically and that should be <Col N="1004" /> recognised.  However, we would be willing to listen to anything that further improves it.  The appointment of an investment intermediary will be a formal decision made by the investment company.  There will be fewer informal arrangements since the person appointed will act in the name of the company and take responsibility when things go wrong.  I am concerned about people who wish to invest redundancy money for example.  Such people may be tempted to invest in what they hear in the public house are good investments. We must try to protect against that by educating the public.  I take the Deputy's point but an amendment need not be put down on the matter.</P>

      <P>In section 17 (2) it is stated that the registers of investment business firms &ldquo;shall be open for inspection in a single location&rdquo;.  I take it that the location will be in Dublin.  I do not object to the payment of a fee but the amount of the fee has not been stated. Most registers are held in Dublin.  The registers could be held in the different regions as it is difficult for rural people to come to Dublin.  We are talking about small investors.  There has been much rogue activity in this area and we all know of cases where people were duped.  One does not always receive incorrect information in a pub and I would not frequent the same pubs as Deputy McCreevy.  The registers should be held in several locations rather than a single location.  I do not mean there should be one at every crossroads but they should be more freely available.</P>

      <P>This important <Col N="1007" /> section deals with restrictions on advertising. Advertising is the means by which people usually make their first contact with an investment intermediary. Under this section it will be an offence for a company to hold itself up as an investment intermediary unless it is a proper investment intermediary. Over the past ten years so-called investment intermediaries have made extraordinary and exaggerated claims on the returns which could be received on an investment of £5,000 or £10,000.  I am not saying companies should not be allowed to advertise but I am glad that under this section it will be an offence for a company which is not a proper investment intermediary to hold itself up as an investment intermediary.</P>
      <P>I qualified as an accountant at a time when chartered accountants and solicitors could not advertise.  When I placed advertisements in local magazines etc. before I became a Deputy I always used my own name.  I did not use the name of the company as I was afraid that the Institute of Chartered Accountants would come down on me like a ton of bricks.  Most chartered accountants operated on the same principle.  Over the years the institute changed its rules on advertising.  The rules governing advertising by solicitors have also been changed.  I am not sure whether all these changes have been for the better.</P>

      <P>On the south side of the city there is a hoarding on a wall advising people with claims to contact a certain company.  I have also heard advertisements on radio where solicitors advise people who have been involved in accidents etc. to get in touch with their firms.  I do not blame these firms for doing this as the industry has become very competitive.  However, this practice has not led to a better order in society.  As someone who believes in the concept of free trade and the free availability of services, I am not sure that the changes in these areas have ensured the <Col N="1008" /> delivery of better and more professional services by accountants, solicitors and investment intermediaries.</P>
      <P>I welcome the provisions which will regulate advertising.  The strict laws governing solicitors and chartered accountants were relaxed by the industries to allow competition.  However, some of these changes have not been for the better.  We have gone too far in changing the rules governing some professions and I am not sure how we can reverse this process.  Those rules might have been too strict but they were better than those in place now.  I do not know if this is the case in the Minister's previous profession but the changes in my profession and the legal profession have not been for the better.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed by the speed with which this Bill is going through.  We know from experience that some legislation which has been rushed through has later proved very contentious. The people who are usually caught by rogue investors are small investors or people who have availed of redundancy or severance packages.  The regulation of advertising is welcome as it will ensure that advertisements are genuine.  Some of the advertisements I have seen have referred to returns on investments beyond anyone's wildest dreams and people have suffered much pain and anguish when they have received a lesser return.  I agree with the points made by Deputy McCreevy and I have no doubt that the Minister in his wisdom holds the same views.  This is probably the most important section in the Bill.</P>

We have all been diminished to some extent by this advertising. It is not always the person who provides <Col N="1009" /> the best service who is successful, sometimes it is the person who can package and sell himself the best.  This diminishes professional services to some extent.  I agree that it will be hard to reverse this practice which has not served the public very well.</P>

There are many financial instruments: units of shares, units in a unit trust or other collective scheme etc. or taking and passing on orders for shares in a company or bonds which are listed on a stock exchange or prize bonds or acting as a tied agent for a credit institution and taking deposits on its behalf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>A short while ago as I was returning from Wicklow-East Kildare, I was requested by people in the industry to make representations in regard to section 28 (4).  An industry working group was established to advise on the regulation of intermediaries. They are in favour of the Bill but late yesterday they discovered what they consider to be an error in subsection (4) of this section.  Rather than me giving the details they relayed to me perhaps the Minister will comment on the subsection. This group considered that section 28 (4), as drafted, would not fulfil the intention of creating a level playing pitch which was the purpose of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (4) specifies that where a payment is made through an intermediary it is treated as having been made to the product producer concerned at the time it is made to the <Col N="1013" /> intermediary, thus protecting the client in the event of default by the intermediary. What happened yesterday was completely astonishing from the point of view of my Department.  The people who raised it and who are in extremely good standing and were extremely co-operative seem to be unaware of something which was so fundamental to this Bill and was stated to be the case from the beginning.  We were perplexed that this should come, literally at the eleventh hour.</P>
      <P>This issue is one on which industry bodies have been widely consulted.  A document in regard to the Investment Intermediaries Bill which was circulated to the relevant industry bodies, including the group who have raised it now, on 20 January stated:</P>
      <P>Every intermediary in these circumstances, that is where there is a written appointment, is acting as an agent for another institution and the institution must, therefore, take responsibility for actions of the intermediary on its behalf.  In the event of a failure, if a client can show by means of a receipt, for example, that funds were intended for a particular institution, the institution concerned will have to honour any liabilities created in that regard by the intermediary.  It will be an offence for an intermediary not to give a receipt.</P>
      <P>Similarly, at the time of the publication of the Bill the Minister for Finance issued a press release which stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once an institution has given an intermediary a written appointment the institution becomes responsible for payments received by the intermediary on its behalf.  Therefore, clients are protected if an intermediary absconds or misappropriates a payment provided there is evidence that the transaction took place.  For that reason it will be an offence for an intermediary not to give a receipt detailing a payment and its purpose. The Government's clear intention is <Col N="1014" /> and has been that the written appointments regime should provide a substantial measure of protection for the clients of investment intermediaries and that, having given a written appointment, the institution concerned should be required to stand behind the intermediary concerned.</P>
    <P>This is an important protection for clients and there was no indication of any opposition to it from any area of the investment industry until up to the last 24 hours.  I would not be happy to see this protection removed.  It is fundamental to the Bill.  The opposition to it is surprising as the people in question, for whom we have the highest regard, could not but have known about it considering the documents I saw this morning. Because protection of the investor forms an important element we are not prepared to change the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister of State says makes sense to me.  It may be summarised by the following example: if an insurance company or financial institution appoints Deputy Ned O'Keeffe's company as an investment intermediary to sell its products and Deputy McDowell asks Deputy O'Keeffe's company to invest £10,000 with Irish Life and Deputy O'Keeffe absconds, Irish Life, having appointed his company as an intermediary, will have to repay the money.  That is the purpose of this section of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Provided he is appointed in writing.  Legally, he will also have to give a receipt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not trying to promote or knock Irish Life but I cite it as an example as it has been a State company for a long time.  If that is the purpose of section 28 I welcome it.  The important point is that Irish Life, should it be the company concerned, should not appoint a company or individual as an investment intermediary unless it was satisfied as to its meeting the necessary criteria.  The financial institution <Col N="1015" /> should be the one to take the brunt.  I agree with the Minister of State that this principle should not be disturbed.</P>
      <P>The working group which, as the Minister of State rightly said, was very helpful in the preparation of this Bill makes the point, in regard to section 28 (4), that both life and non-life companies market single premium products. While intermediaries selling life company investment products are regulated under the Insurance Act, 1989 intermediaries selling non-life company investment products will be regulated under this Bill.  In most, if not all cases the same intermediary will sell life and non-life investment products.</P>
      <P>While the working party accepts that the Bill will provide a level playing field it states that, under section 28 (4), a non-life company will be fully liable for non-negotiable cheques or cash paid to an intermediary to whom the company has given a letter of appointment.  The net result will be that if such an intermediary defrauds an investor in respect of moneys destined for a non-life company the company will have to repay the investor in full.  However, if the same intermediary defrauds an investor in respect of moneys destined for a life company no such liability applies, but for two minor exceptions.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, the working group is making the case that intermediaries selling life company investment products are regulated under the Insurance Act, 1989 while intermediaries selling non-life company investment products, the once off investment to which Deputy O'Keeffe so eloquently referred, will be regulated under this Bill.  In the latter case the intermediary is approached by the person who, say, has been made redundant after 20 or 30 years service and wishes to invest the £10,000 he has received in redundancy payments.  There is no life insurance element.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although one does not pay much attention to many of the representations one receives &mdash; I am sure the Department feels the same way &mdash; I take the <Col N="1016" /> point being made by the working group seriously as it knows what it is talking about.  The two people I met are experts in the field and I am aware of their reputation &mdash; I had met one of them previously when Minister in another Department.  It makes the case that there will be different sets of rules; as I understand it, non-life companies will have to repay in full.</P>
    <P>It may be the case that the working group and the Department &mdash; I am sure the officials advising the Minister of State are also experts in this area &mdash; are at cross purposes.  It strikes me that the Minister of State has made a fundamental point in regard to section 28 which I support but I understand from the people to whom I have spoken that the two types of company will be treated differently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has articulated their case fairly.  Section 28, which the Deputy supports, is fundamental to the Bill.  The Deputy stated that it does not match the provisions in an earlier Act dealing with insurance.  This, however, is not a logical argument for changing our position; it may be a logical argument for introducing an amendment to the Insurance Act to ensure there is a level playing field.  As this section is fundamental to the Bill, it has been the subject of consultations over a long period.  It is therefore surprising that the eminent group to which the Deputy referred only begun to realise that it was of such fundamental importance 24 hours before it was due to be enacted.  I referred to it at length last week during the course of the Second Stage debate.  There would be no justification for considering an amendment.</P>
      <P>This legislation will be implemented over time.  There will be time for consultations on how the provisions relating to the appointment of intermediaries should be implemented.  We will be as co-operative as possible in introducing the regulations.  We are not disposed to accepting an amendment.</P>

      <P>As I understand it, if a person asks an investment intermediary appointed by a non-life company, such as a bank, to invest £10,000 and something goes wrong the bank will have to repay the money.  If the investment intermediary represents a life assurance company such as Irish Life &mdash; the relevant Act in that case is the Insurance Act, 1989 &mdash; Irish Life would not be legally obliged to refund the money in the event that the investment intermediary does not pay it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not familiar with the details of the Insurance Act but I think the investor under this legislation will be better protected in that there is a certainty that if he invests his money with an investment intermediary who has been officially appointed in writing by an institution and who furnishes a receipt, the company will stand over that investment.  I think the protection is not as strong in the Insurance Act.  To that extent the position is different.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of investment products provided by a company that also supplies insurance, the investment product is covered under this Bill while the insurance product is not. There is protection under the 1989 Act but it is not as comprehensive as the protection under this Bill.  Perhaps an amendment to the 1989 Act should be considered to bring it into line with this legislation rather than the reverse, which would not be acceptable.</P>

      <P>It should be levelled upwards.  Since protection under the Insurance Act, 1989, is not as strong as that under this Bill we should not minimise the requirements of this legislation. I see no reason for proceeding in that direction, rather we should amend the Insurance Act, 1989.  Perhaps the Minister or his officials will meet in the next few days with the industry working group who did much background work in preparation for this Bill.  Perhaps regulations could be made or some commitment given to ensure a level playing pitch because the people involved have very strong views in this regard.  I do not have the time or the expertise to go into the matter further but I welcome the fact that the Minister is giving the institution responsibility for the investor. Perhaps the Insurance Act could be amended in that regard.</P>

      <P>Investment intermediaries are broadly based investment people who take small investments, including life insurance.  From the position I hold, I have an interest in the Bill and I believed that aspect would be covered.  If I pay £1,000 to an investment intermediary for a life policy or product and the money goes astray, that is not covered in the Bill.  Is there a law that will protect me in those circumstances? In the past most insurance companies have protected their policyholders, but that matter is not covered here.  I am not blaming the Minister but that is a weakness in the Bill and some such protection should be put in place. As the Minister knows, in the county and city of Cork there are many genuine small operators who provide a fine service in the investment area, whether as insurance brokers or retailers, but on occasion a person may for one reason <Col N="1019" /> or other take the wrong road, thereby messing up the investors.  There is no protection under the the Bill to cover those circumstances.</P>

      <P>The insurance area is substantially regulated under the Insurance Act, 1989.  This Bill which arose as a result of EU directives is designed to fill a gap that existed in other investment areas.  The Deputy's criticism of the Bill is not valid because the Bill was not designed to deal with the subject matter of the 1989 Act.  If an amendment to that Act is warranted &mdash; I cannot give a guarantee in that regard because it is not my responsibility &mdash; that will be noted.  On Deputy McCreevy's request that we meet the groups who raised this issue, my officials meet regularly with these groups.

      <P>This section gives greater responsibility to auditors to notify supervisory and regulatory authorities and we have no complaints about that.  It deals with auditors for investment business firms which are not incorporated bodies and duties of auditors.  I referred earlier to the sole operator, the non-incorporated entity or partnership. In that regard, the duties of the auditor are clearly set out.  As the Minister is aware, audits are not carried out simply by individuals submitting their tax returns.  Many people consider they have completed an audit when they have submitted their tax returns, but such a submission is not the same as a <Col N="1020" /> statutory company audit &mdash; unless individuals want to pay their accountants a fortune to ensure everything is in order. Are there special rules and regulations set out in this section to cover the unincorporated entity?</P>

      <P>I assume this section dealing with auditors is regularising matters in line with the Companies Act. Many people involved in intermediate investment are small operators working on commission who have small turnovers. If they are required to have a statutory audit carried out by a reputable company &mdash; and all companies are required to be reputable now &mdash; it will impose a substantial expense.  I note there is a provision for re-audit which does not apply to other limited liability companies and that has far-reaching implications, but I assume it is in line with the Companies Act.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on the cost involved in the carrying out of a statutory audit.</P>

      <P>Section 33 obliges investment business firms, which are partnerships or sole traders, to appoint an auditor who will act in a manner analogous to the auditor of a company. The section also imposes obligations on auditors to report to the supervisory authority if certain circumstances exist in the investment business firm they are auditing, for example, if it may be unable to meet its obligations or if there are material defects in its accounting system.  The supervisory authority may require an auditor to make a report to it about an investment business firm's compliance with certain supervisory authority requirements.  An auditor is obliged to report to the supervisory authority if matters come to his or her attention which he or she believes are significant for deciding on, say, the competence or probity of a director of an investment business firm.  The section also gives the supervisory authority power to lay down requirements in respect of the audit of authorised investment business firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1021" /> I accept Deputy O'Keeffe's point that sole traders in small towns may act as intermediaries but I do not know how we can protect investors by excluding that category.  While 99 per cent of those that fall into that category are the salt of the earth, there is often the odd rogue.  We would be culpable if we excluded small sole traders from this type of requirement.  Small auditing firms are perfectly competent to carry out such audits and they are not charging the level of fees charged by the big five.  The position may not be as bad as indicated by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Is there an obligation to inform a supervisory authority of shareholdings?  As the Minister is aware, some grandiose schemes have been designed to cover up the shareholdings of a company.  All types of ingenious devices have been used in the past and, I am sure, will continue to be used.  How is it intended to ascertain information on the shareholdings of a company?  I am sure the purpose of the Bill is to ensure that certain individuals who would normally be disqualified as investment intermediaries are not involved as investment intermediaries. How will this Bill be able to deal with shareholding companies when it has not been possible to deal with them under sections of the Companies Act?  I hope this section will be able to deal with them, but I do not believe it will be more successful than sections in other Acts.</P>

We want to be careful that we do not make the Central Bank or a Department of State accountable for the fraudulent acts of people selling investments in the open market.  We do not want that obligation to fall automatically on the taxpayer.  If a person is let down, we want them to take an action against the person who owes them the money, not against the State.  While the regulatory authorities must act in good faith, the State should not open itself up to a raft of claims from disappointed investors.  It would not be fair to put that obligation on the taxpayer.</P>

      <P>Section 2 provides that in carrying out its duty to supervise approved professional bodies, the supervisory authority is not providing a warranty as to their solvency or performance.

      <P>It does not arise in the case of the Incorporated Law Society who operate a compensation fund and a strong regulatory regime.  The accountancy profession does not operate a compensation fund.  The Bill exempts only State regulatory bodies, it does not refer <Col N="1024" /> to professional bodies in that regard.  If a person believes a professional body is negligent in its role, this section would not prohibit an investor from taking action.</P>

      <P>The setting up of supervisory bodies and regulatory authorities means that officials will monitor organisations.  I am sure the position of the PMPA, which collapsed when my party was in Government, had exercised the minds of various civil servants and Ministers for many years before it crumbled.  As some cases regarding that company may not yet be disposed of, I am restrained in what I can say, but I am sure many officials in the former Department of Industry and Commerce were aware for some time of the position at the company.  Many people had deposited money with the PMPS but the Government at that time was firmly against reimbursing them and I recall the then Minister.  Deputy O'Malley, stating his decision was justified.  Perhaps if this Bill had been enacted then, he might have adopted a different position.</P>
      <P>Eminent civil servants in the Department of Industry and Commerce &mdash; the regulatory authority for the insurance industry at that time &mdash; who monitored the position in the PMPA for some time were somewhat slipshod in their actions. I am not blaming the former Minister, Deputy O'Malley, because if I had been Minister at that time.  I would probably have been advised to take a similar decision to protect the State against the payment of a large number of claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Bill civil servants or officials of public bodies who have monitored the transactions of a company for some time may inform the Minister or the Governor of the Central Bank that the company is in trouble but then walk away without having to provide for compensation.  Is this fair?  The PMPS depositors are a good example of the inequity involved.  However, I am sure Governments since the foundation <Col N="1025" /> of the State would have adopted a similar position.  It is unfair that the regulatory bodies, having monitored the position of a company for some time, do not have to take responsibility for compensation. It is an easy way out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the Deputy's difficulty would be a compensation scheme.  This Bill provides for bonding and the legislation that will be introduced following the implementation of an EU directive will provide for compensation.  It would not be acceptable to blame the regulatory body and make the taxpayer pay, particularly as bonding and compensation schemes will be provided for shortly.</P>

      <P>This section ensures that a certified person, for example, an accountant, doing business in an incidental manner, may be deemed to have an authorisation to engage in investment business services equivalent to an authorisation granted by a supervisory authority.  However, this implicit authorisation would not allow such a firm to conduct business in another European <Col N="1026" /> Union member state or to conduct investment business which was not incidental to its professional practice.  This is to guard against an excessive regulation of firms not primarily involved in this type of activity but who engage in a small amount.</P>

      <P>This is a technical amendment, pertaining to the powers of a committee to be appointed under this section.  In certain circumstances the committee may make a determination that there has been a breach by an investment business firm or an approved professional body of a conditional requirement imposed by the supervisory authority under the Act.  It is appropriate that there be a right of appeal to the court against a determination of the committee.  The present text inadvertently gives such right of appeal to an investment business firm only.  The amendment makes it clear that this right of appeal will apply also to an approved professional body.</P>

      <P>This section sets out the mechanisms for determining whether there has been a breach of a supervisory authority condition or requirement.  The supervisory authority may apply to the <Col N="1027" /> High Court for a determination that there has been such a breach.  Alternatively, the supervisory authority may, if requested to do so by the investment business firm or professional body concerned, appoint a committee to determine the matter.  The court or committee may dismiss the supervisory authority's application.  Alternatively, it may determine that there has been a breach and may reprimand the investment business firm concerned and direct it to pay a sum not exceeding £500,000 to the supervisory authority.  The committee mechanism is aimed at providing an efficient, cost-effective way of dealing with possible breaches of supervisory authority conditions and requirements. The alternative is a High Court action which would almost certainly be both more expensive and protracted.  Of course, the investment business firm concerned, can decide to have the matter dealt with by the High Court if it chooses.</P>

I am sure the £1 million fine would be fairly realistic, even today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason a fine of £1 million was stipulated rather than an unlimited one is that the Constitution provides for the High Court and other courts of local and limited jurisdiction. Therefore, when providing for a penalty on indictment, it is necessary to fix an upper limit here if any court other than the High Court is empowered to impose it.</P>
      <P>What occurs to me in that context &mdash; a point made recently at a European conference in Dublin on the subject of fraud &mdash; is that very complex cases, where a £1 million fine might be imposed, are dealt with exclusively in the Circuit Court with burglaries and other cases.  As the law stands, the High Court is entitled only to deal with matters such as treason, rape, certain serious sexual offences, murder, piracy, genocide and a few others.</P>
      <P>If we are envisaging that the Circuit Court will deal with this kind of prosecution, complex cases of fraud where a fine of up to £1 million could be imposed, the time has come to reconsider our courts structure.  Within the context of the forthcoming Court and Court Officers Bill I suggest that the Minister of State draws the attention of the Minister for Justice to the remarks made recently at that conference to which I referred by a member of the High Court to the effect that it is anomalous that a Circuit Court &mdash; which deals with burglaries, assaults and the like &mdash; is the only court here that can deal with complex financial fraud when it does not have the requisite resources or time to deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the time has come to revisit the question of where complex financial cases should be dealt with, there is a good case for moving them to the High Court.  In England the Crown Court, <Col N="1029" /> comprised of both High Court and Circuit Court judges and High Court judges sitting in complex cases sent to the Old Bailey are centralised.  It is impractical to imagine, for instance, that if a company was carrying on business, say, in Bray, that the Eastern Circuit Court, sitting in Wicklow town, should deal with a £1 million complex financial case.  The time has come for us to re-examine that issue because those courts are not equipped in terms of time, space and personnel to deal with such complex issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Michael McDowell for that intervention. I would not have been as aware of the problem he has just described.  I understand that the Circuit Courts would not have the requisite general resources to deal with cases of such complexity at the upper level of these fines.  I will certainly pass on his suggestion, though I can do no more than that.</P>

      <P>I thank Members for their contributions on the Bill.  Its enactment will mark a further stage in the regulation of the financial sector following on the various Acts affecting that sector in recent years, including the recently passed Stock Exchange Bill on which this Bill is to some extent based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1030" /> This Bill will establish a modern system of regulation for investment intermediaries in line with modern international practice and the requirements of EU law.  The Bill is part of a wider process under which firms providing certain financial services will be allowed to trade freely throughout the European Union.  This will obviously bring challenges as well as opportunities but I feel sure that the Irish financial sector is strong enough to meet those challenges and to avail of the opportunities provided.</P>
    <P>I thank the Central Bank, the Department of Enterprise and Employment and the industry bodies who were consulted during the preparation of the Bill for their constructive contributions.  I also thank Deputies opposite.  This was a daunting task for me so it must be much more daunting without the excellent assistance of the officials in the Department of Finance.  Since taking on this seemingly lighter burden in recent weeks, I have had to deal with a plethora of complex Acts covering the Stock Exchange, investment intermediaries, the Office of Public Works, arterial drainage, etc.  Without the advice of excellent public servants and the friendly co-operation of my colleagues across the House I could not have attempted this task and, for both, I am very grateful</P>

It is unfortunate we did not have more time to deal with this Bill because the public servants who spent a lot of time drafting it might feel hard done by that it did not receive sufficient attention in the House.  I am aware of the expertise and the many long hours that have gone into the preparation of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, in one form or another, has been in Government circles for some time and I am glad to see it before the House.  I realise there is a time limit in regard to getting it through the House <Col N="1031" /> but I thank the Minister for the co-operative way he has approached this legislation. I know what it feels like to have to deal with a very technical Bill.  In my first week as a Minister I was required to pilot the Social Welfare Bill through the House and my knowledge of the technicalities of social welfare was not great.</P>

He gives an example of a committee of experts who have two tasks, one of which is to decide whether to build a new nuclear reactor and the other to decide whether to build an employees' bicycle shed.  He says effectively that the less important issue is the one everyone can understand and, therefore, many hours are spent discussing that.  The more complex issue gets shooed through on the basis that nobody is willing to show how ignorant they are.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy raised the issue of section 28 (4) and I hope the Minister will take on board the views expressed <Col N="1032" /> by the working group on the regulation of intermediaries in relation to their misgivings about what they see as inequality in the treatment of certain investment activities.  If the Minister sees some merit in the points raised by Deputy McCreevy, the matter could be re-examined in the Seanad and any necessary amendments could be taken at that stage.  Having said that, I wish the Minister well with the Bill in the Seanad.</P>

      <P>I too compliment the Minister on the Bill.  I have known him for a long time and I am glad to say it was not people on this side of the House who removed him from his post as Minister for Defence and Minister for the Marine.  Cork has been left much poorer without the benefit of a Cabinet Minister.  The people of Cork are lonely without the Minister and there is an obligation on the Taoiseach to ensure that Cork is again honoured with a full Cabinet Minister.</P>
      <P>I have known the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, longer than most people in this House.  We worked together in commercial business.  At that time we joined hands from the business and the farming sectors in an effort to improve relations between the two.  I am sure neither of us ever thought we would see the day when we would be standing in this House and perhaps we should have stayed in the commercial world.  We might be much happier and wealthier and we would not be worrying about investment intermediaries.  In fact, we might be seeking the advice of investment intermediaries.</P>
      <P>This is excellent, well thought out legislation and I compliment the Minister for the way he brought it before the House.  It is vital that we protect small investors, many of whom have been adversely affected by bogus investment and skulduggery.  I am familiar with many cases of investment where no growth was achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Investment intermediaries are involved a great deal with insurance-type products.  That is not included in the Bill and it is an area that should be <Col N="1033" /> examined.  Perhaps it was not thought worth while to include this area or there may have been some argument in regard to whether the Central Bank or the Department of Enterprise and Employment would have responsibility for this.  That is the only weakness I see in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill will provide protection for small investors.  They are entitled to that protection and I compliment the Minister on the Bill.  He was given full co-operation from this side of the House and he was more than helpful in answering questions raised by Deputies.  I wish the Minister well.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill as part of the legislative and other changes the Minister is implementing to make our country more attractive and more competitive in the tourism trade.  The Bill enables Bord Fáilte to shed direct responsibility for some of its functions, mainly by delegating to contractors certain aspects of its tourist accommodation inspection and associated functions and powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only right, when legislation for this change is going through the Dáil, to pay due tribute to Bord Fáilte for the development and progress that has taken place in tourist accommodation. The comparison between what is on offer now in all aspects of tourist accommodation and facilities and what was on offer 20 or 30 years ago is the greatest testimony to Bord Fáilte's endeavours. I have no doubt that under the contract <Col N="1034" /> system we will continue to further raise the standards.</P>
    <P>The most important impact of this Bill will be to enable Bord Fáilte to focus its attention better, to concentrate its resources on the marketing element, to which the Minister attaches such importance.</P>
    <P>We have the tourism product &mdash; to use the jargon of the trade &mdash; we have the magnificent basics that nature gave us in unrivalled scenery and waterways. Gradually we are enhancing these attractions in a variety of ways.  In this respect the recent initiative of the Minister in introducing a renewal status, with its associated financial incentives, for many of the traditional seaside resorts will be a major influence.  I am delighted that the seaside resort of Enniscrone is now among the designated areas and this will result in a transformation of the facilities there over the coming three years.  I had the pleasure of launching the scheme on behalf of the Minister in Enniscrone last week and, in spite of the fact that the way chosen was a working breakfast &mdash; something new to most parts of the west &mdash; there was a turnout of 150 interested people.  That is a very good omen.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of what is on offer in the present committed, competitive atmosphere in the tourism trade one must have vigorous marketing.  An example of what good internal marketing can do is well illustrated in the Céide Fields, in the Minister's county.  Over a couple of years this has become a major destination for tourists visiting the west.  Of course this has occurred because of its archaeological importance but also in my opinion because it was extremely well marketed.</P>
    <P>By contrast, I do not think County Sligo has fared well in that respect.  The tourism attractions in Sligo compare with any in the country.  That is also the virtually unanimous opinion of all the visitors, foreign and national who come to the county.  They often ask how it is that they had not heard more about Sligo in the past.  The reason, I believe, is a failure to market Sligo.  There is no <Col N="1035" /> point at this stage in seeking to apportion the blame.  My theory is that the gateway status that Sligo enjoyed, with thousands of visitors passing through from the North to the west coast, was partly responsible and rendered marketing somewhat superfluous in the past.  All this changed with the troubles in the North and, as the Minister is aware, Sligo has come through a number of difficult years in the tourism trade.  Thankfully, with the ceasefire, we are looking forward to a major influx of visitors which I believe will materialise.</P>
    <P>What Sligo needs is a major attraction to make it a destination for tourists and not a gateway.  To enhance Sligo's natural attractions we need to provide other major attractions and facilities to ensure that when tourists travel to the west, a reasonable proportion of them will want to stay in Sligo for a few days or, preferably, for a few weeks.  These attractions should be based on the heritage and the archaeology of the area.  In the most recent surveys, County Sligo was shown to be the richest of all counties in monuments and sites &mdash; a staggering 4,500 in the county were listed in these surveys.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that the tourism potential of this heritage has been neglected &mdash; a primary example of that neglect is Knocknashee Hillfort in south County Sligo.  This is the third largest hillfort in the country, one of the great European hillforts with 30 hut dwellings dating back to 1,000 B.C. and one megalithic passage tomb dating back to 3,000 B.C.  The hillfort has been described as a prehistoric prota town, possibly a major socio-economic, political and tribal centre of its day for the entire province of Connacht.  One can see most of the province of Connacht from the top of Knocknashee, giving credence to what I said yet there are no signposts indicating the location of Knocknashee or plaque indicating what is there.  There is not even an access route.  Neither has it got the protection of being designated a national monument.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Office of Public <Col N="1036" /> Works has been extremely good and I commend its officials for their work but they have failed to a certain extent in this regard.  There have been some excellent recent studies of Knocknashee, one in particular by the archaeologist Michael Gibbons and there is a very hard working local development committee but this is something that the country should be adopting for preservation but also for exploiting its tourism potential.</P>
    <P>Presumably nobody here has heard of Knocknashee Hillfort.  That is our failure and the failure of the Office of Public Works.  Without exaggeration, I believe it has the potential to become one of the major tourism attractions in the north-west region based on its rich archaeological and mythological background together with its outstanding beauty.  What a name for the marketing people of Bord Fáilte &mdash; Knocknashee, the hill of the fairies.</P>
    <P>The issue I now raise is not the direct responsibility of the Minister for Tourism and Trade but as a person who wants to see the speedy enhancement of our potential tourism attractions I ask him what is happening to the Armada wrecks found of Stredagh Strand in the early 1980s.  These are located a very short distance out to sea under the strand and are visible from the surface at times.  They are the most important Armada artefacts to be found anywhere along the coast of Britain and Ireland. There are legal problems involved.  I was very pleased with the efforts of many Ministers in the past and when I was Minister I was involved to ensure that the artefacts remained the property of the State.  However, a long time has passed since the discovery of the wrecks in the 1980s and it should be possible to reach an agreement whereby work can start on recovering the 59 cannons known to be in the three ships underneath the strand, making them the basis of an Armada museum in the Sligo area together with a regional folk museum. We should remember that we are talking about Yeats' country, a short distance down the strand from Lisadell <Col N="1037" /> House, beside Drumcliffe graveyard and in the shadow of Benbulbin.  A museum located in that area would be a major attraction for tourists.</P>
    <P>Sligo is a significant tourism area helped by its association with Yeats.  As I outlined it has the highest number of monuments in the country, 4,500 sites being listed in the recent survey.  One farmer I know in south Sligo cannot get the foundation for a new house without coming across archaeological remains and is having major problems with the planning authorities.  Some archaeological remains, for example, Carrowmore, are internationally famous, dating, as proved by the recent work of Swedish archaeologists, as far back as the time Newgrange, which Prince Charles visited during his recent stay, was constructed.  The facilities mentioned could transform the attractiveness of the north-west region and make it a major tourism destination, linking up with the tourist trail in Northern Ireland where major developments are taking place.  Money is being spent on facilities and archaeological sites in the North.  A similar investment here would attract tourists to the north west and encourage them to stay and visit other monuments and sites.  As well as enjoying the glorious scenery and studying the literary heritage of the area they can play golf, go horseriding or fishing and generally enjoy themselves among a friendly people.</P>
    <P>The north-west has not developed its tourism potential as other areas have in the south-west, across the west coast and the east.  The access idea is very important and I cannot fully understand why the tourism authorities have not developed charter flights to such areas. One of the reasons for the great success of the resorts in Spain, Portugal, Cyprus, Turkey etc., is the availability of cheap charter flights which reduce the price of a holiday.  One of our difficulties is the cost of access.  In his new marketing drive the Minister should concentrate in a major way on organising incoming charters and this could be <Col N="1038" /> of great benefits to our tourism industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for this opportunity to speak and Deputy Nealon for sharing his time.  A number of provisions in this Bill give me cause for concern but also an appreciation of what the Minister needs to do.  I met constituents of mine in Kerry who stayed in a bed and breakfast and were charged £12 per person.  An American couple stayed the same night but they were charged £15 per person.  Is it not time that people running bed and breakfast establishments should be required to display their prices?  It is inherently wrong that foreigners should be charged more than our own people for the same product.</P>
      <P>Another area that concerns me is the fact that the Japanese can play a round of golf here for practically nothing compared with what they pay at home, and this creates a great marketing opportunity for us.</P>
      <P>According to the document that the Minister circulated, Bord Fáilte has certain work to do, but outside agencies are being brought in to intensively market our tourism industry in America, Japan and other countries.  Here is an opportunity to develop our tourism industry to a far greater degree than has been possible up to now.  In the marketing of Ireland as a tourist destination, a substantial amount of money is taken up in administration costs by Bord Fáilte.  I would, therefore, welcome the subcontracting of much of the work being done by Bord Fáilte to other agencies.</P>
      <P>Hotels, guesthouses, holiday homes, youth hostels, holiday camps, caravan and camping sites and holiday cottage and apartment group schemes are controlled to some extent.  However, in the case of bed and breakfasts there seems to be no control.  The Minister should examine this because they are responsible to nobody, that is not right because people can easily be ripped off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grading of hotels is not mandatory. Recipients of trade from the public should have to indicate that they are <Col N="1039" /> registered with Bord Fáilte or some other group and guarantee certain standards. Unless that is done the cowboys will continue to operate as they now do. If we could change that tourists could be confident that a common standard would apply to all bed and breakfasts and we would have an opportunity of reflecting back on those people who do not provide a proper service.</P>
    <P>Under the new arrangements the board will continue to retain ownership of registration and grading standards.  If we do not continue to improve the standards of bed and breakfasts, hotels, etc., we will have failed miserably.  External contractors will determine grades and standards of bed and breakfasts, country houses, hotels, restaurants and so on. That is long overdue.  However, we must be careful that someone with a vested interest does not determine the standards of restaurant, hotel or bed and breakfast.  I will be very pleased if the Minister can confirm that that will be the case.  Recently I saw a report by Egon Ronay about a restaurant and a pub and his report conflicted with my view of those places.  Any awards should be independent and seen to be so. Otherwise we will fail as a tourism agency.</P>
    <P>The view is now expressed by many tourists that the sun is not the only element necessary for an ideal holiday. That is why this country can come into its own.  The Minister has provided substantial amounts of money for marketing this country abroad and it can now be marketed as one unit, North and South, in the wake of the peace process. This makes a substantial difference because people in America, Japan, etc., believed that all Ireland was at war.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It will be good for the tourism industry and I hope it will be accepted by the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important Bill.  I congratulate the Minister on his appointment as Minister for Tourism and Trade.  As he indicated, the purpose <Col N="1040" /> of the Bill is to enable Bord Fáilte to delegate to a contractor certain of its tourist accommodation inspections and associated functions and powers under the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1939-87 and the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988.  The functions and powers in question relate to the registration and grading of tourist accommodation and the licensing of restaurants. Will the Minister consider referring matters relevant to car hire as it plays a pivotal role in tourism?</P>
      <P>Fears for the long term future of tourism along the west coast have been voiced by top hoteliers and tourism operators.  This was covered in the media recently.  There is ever increasing business in Dublin and the east coast.  I understand the Minister and the Director of Bord Fáilte, Mr. Matt McNulty, received letters concerning difficulties experienced by the industry on the western seaboard.  The Minister should consider giving details of these letters to the House.</P>
      <P>The reported rise of 17 per cent to 20 per cent in the number of tourists visiting this country has not been experienced in Cork or Kerry or along the west coast.  One of the reasons for this is the removal of the compulsory stop over at Shannon.  Aer Rianta must help ensure that low cost carriers are attracted to the region.  There must be discounts on landing fees and airport charges at Shannon.  An effort should be made to boost British business out of Shannon as low cost carriers have been instrumental in increasing the traffic from Dublin to Britain.</P>
      <P>While the number of coach tour operators is increasing in Dublin the number of people who hire a car and visit the west and south west is decreasing. One of the reasons for this it the high cost of car hire in peak periods. Weekly car hire can cost as much as £350 or £400.  This area needs to be examined as in some years supply did not meet demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A review of Bord Fáilte had been spoken of for years but Deputy McCreevy, as Minister for Tourism and Trade, took the initiative in 1994 and <Col N="1041" /> appointed the British consultants, Arthur D. Little, to undertake such a review.  The Minister acknowledged this.  The consultants' report forcibly indicates that Bord Fáilte played an important role in tourism especially in overseas marketing and promotion. During those years it was involved in the provision of a wide range of tourist services and accommodation at home, including making decisions on EU grant applications, running the very successful tidy towns competition and publishing a wide range of excellent brochures.  As a result it was not in a position to give 100 per cent support to overseas marketing which was its original function.</P>
    <P>In Kerry great progress has been made since the 1960s especially in the accommodation sector.  There are now many upmarket hotels, top class guesthouses, farmhouses, town and country homes and supplementary accommodation. As a result of tremendous local and national initiative many jobs were created and worthwhile projects developed especially in the last ten years.  As a result of the initiative taken by Tralee Urban District Council there is an excellent aquadome water world, all weather facilities, steam train, windmill and the international Geraldine experience.  Last year in excess of 150,000 tourists visited these developments.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the present County Manager, Mr. Paddy D'Arcy, commissioned McNulty international consultants to draw up a development plan which highlighted the many positive developments in the county and the future trend of tourism.  Local authorities should be encouraged to make a greater input to tourism and become the catalyst for tourism development in each county.</P>
    <P>Kerry County Council played a major role in the development of Kerry International Airport.  While it was criticised at the time by a small minority it is now accepted that the airport will play a pivotal role in the development of tourism within the county.  As far as tourism is concerned, north Kerry comes under <Col N="1042" /> the remit of SFADCo while south Kerry is aligned to Cork.  It is not possible to market Kerry as one unit.  A submission was made some years ago to the then Minister, Deputy Brennan, with a view to amalgamating north and south Kerry for marketing purposes.  To date nothing has happened.  That is most disappointing. The county council intends to reactivate that application.  I have a special notice of motion to this effect for the next meeting of Kerry County Council on Monday which I have no doubt will receive the unanimous support of my colleagues.  At present both bodies are involved in promoting tourism in the county but each excludes the other part of the county.  There is duplication of advertising and overseas marketing.</P>
    <P>Kerry is unique in that it has a population of approximately 120,000 but during the summer season it must cater for 300,000 people.  The county council faced up to this challenge and provided the necessary facilities.  It has a vested interest in seeing the tourism season extended over as long a period as possible as is the case in Killarney, Tralee, Dingle, Kenmare and Ballybunion.  I appeal to the Minister to give the matter sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>The Kerry county road structure of 2,600 miles is one of the worst in the county due to insufficient funding.  Millions of pounds have been poured into tourism development over the years but no worth-while funding has been made available for county roads.  The county engineer recently informed Kerry County Council that he can no longer guarantee the future of the county road structure.  For the last ten years he has taken fire brigade action.  With the importance of Kerry to tourism and the amount of money it generates for the national economy during the summer season, one would imagine it would qualify for special road funding.  Sufficient funding must be provided from central government as Kerry County Council has shown tremendous initiative in developing tourism.</P>
    <P>The rate support grant is a bone of <Col N="1043" /> contention.  Kerry is the fifth largest county and the seventh largest in terms of population but it ranks fourteenth or seventeenth each year as far as the rate support grant is concerned.  In 1993 it received £3.717 million while Mayo received £6.724 million.  This has been the pattern for the last ten years and amounts to a net loss of £30 million which, had it been available, would have boosted funding for county roads.  It is worth reflecting on the value of tourism to the economy.  More than any previous administration, the Government under the then Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, recognised the potential of the industry and set targets for it.  The industry has been asked to make a specific contribution to economic development and the creation of jobs.  The achievement of these targets is vital to the economy and every effort must be made to support the industry in achieving them.  At the same time nothing should be allowed to deflect the industry from its task.  A new strategy, backed up by a framework plan, has been evolved for the development of the industry.  This strategy identifies the development priorities which must be met in order to attract increasing numbers of tourists which is essential to sustain new product developments, generate more revenue and provide more jobs for our young people.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil can be proud of the inspired leadership it has given to the tourism industry.  In Government, it created a climate in which the industry could flourish and reduced the cost of travel to Ireland &mdash; the dramatic reductions in inflation helped to reduce the costs on the ground to tourists.  In spite of this, there is still room for improvement in this area and I am confident that the Minister can achieve this. He represents County Mayo which has made tremendous strides in the development of its tourism industry. Some years ago it commissioned McNulty consultants to draw up a plan which will be the blueprint for the development of the industry there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1044" /> EU Structural Funds, together with private investment, can create a climate for further investment in tourism especially in high quality developments. Bord Fáilte deserves much credit for the enthusiasm it has generated within the industry.  Not only has it been a leader in developing strategies and programmes but it has increased the volume of promotional activities and the quality of promotion campaigns in Britain, Europe and North America. Anyone who has studied Bord Fáilte's activities at first hand will testify to this fact.  It is readily acknowledged by the foreign travel trade that we have one of the most professional tourism bodies in the world.</P>
    <P>Some years ago regional tourism was streamlined to encourage the development of tourism at local level.  There have been great changes in the tourism industry and, as in other parts of the economy, the private sector responded when asked to shoulder a greater responsibility for developing quality products which would attract new business and investment.  I am glad we are moving away from the grant-seeking mentality where nothing is done unless it is funded by the taxpayer through some form of Government grant.  The tourism industry is now much more professional and commercial.  It is a profitable industry and good operators are prepared to reinvest some of their profits in new developments and jobs.</P>
    <P>The peace initiative has been of major benefit to the tourism industry.  There has been an increase in the number of Northern tourists visiting the South and <i>vice versa.</i>  This sector can be expanded and both tourism boards must take advantage of this tremendous progress. Several leading continental newspapers have carried a colour supplement on holidays in Ireland which has been paid for by the International Fund for Ireland and the tourist boards have shared a desk in the British travel centre in Regent Street in London in the promotion of Ireland as a holiday destination. Long may this continue.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the new Bord <Col N="1045" /> Fáilte would be launched during the summer and that there would be an exciting rebirth of the organisation, a new era in marketing Ireland overseas as a first-class holiday destination.  I welcome this but I am somewhat concerned about the redesignation of the registration and grading system.  While Bord Fáilte will retain overall responsibility for these issues in future they will be carried out by contractors.  What expertise will these contractors be required to have?  The standard of grading in Ireland is higher than that in England and credit for this must go to Bord Fáilte.  I hope that this very high standard will be maintained in the future. I agree with the previous speaker that contractors should not have a vested interest in the industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that this Department has completed a consultation process with the key groups of accommodation providers affected by the proposed changes to ensure they understand what is being done.  He further pointed out that a number of the key associations in, for example, the bed and breakfast sector have taken up the challenge of accepting a greater level of responsibility for enforcing their own standards.  In fairness to these groups, this has been the position for many years.  It is of benefit to everyone involved in the business to ensure that standards are maintained and, where possible, improved.</P>
    <P>I am glad that under the new arrangements Bord Fáilte will retain ownership of the registration and grading system. This means they will continue to set down the criteria for registration and grading and prescribe the various fees, with the consent of the Minister for Tourism and Trade.  It will also retain responsibility for the operation of the final stages of the appeals mechanism provided for in the Bill and play a key role in monitoring the performance of the contractor and in the selection process.</P>
    <P>The Minister has allocated £4 million for the Overseas Tourism Marketing <Col N="1046" /> Initiative for 1995.  When the complementary finance from the tourism industry North and South is included, the total budget for this year's campaign is £6.3 million.  This type of marketing is the key to the future progress of the tourism industry.  Last year's campaign proved very successful and the CSO has indicated an overall increase of 17 per cent in North American visitors compared to an average increase of 8 per cent by our European competitors.</P>
    <P>To date 50 of the 250 applications received under the product development sub-programme have been approved.  These cover a wide range of tourism products including visitor information, visitor centres, leisure and conference centres, tourism, angling, cruising, walking and adventure sports.  One of the major flagship projects under the sub-programme is the establishment of a national conference centre.  The Minister said he proposes to bring a report on this project before the Government shortly and hopes to obtain support to proceed with the centre at an early date. He should give serious consideration to locating this centre in Killarney which has an international airport on its doorstep and is synonymous with tourism not only in Ireland but throughout the world.  In addition, County Kerry has more registered beds &mdash; in excess of 13,000 &mdash; than any other county.</P>
    <P>Recent findings show that a number of holidaymakers decided to visit Ireland because of the availability and quality of tourism facilities, which have been targeted for investment under the operational programme.  The number of golfing visitors has trebled while the number who avail specifically of the walking and angling products has more than doubled.  For every tourist who visits Ireland to pursue their special interest another four visitors use these facilities as part of a more broadly based holiday.</P>
    <P>In privatising tourism one must have regard not only to the potential for further market growth but also to the contribution this growth can make to regional development.  Many of our <Col N="1047" /> major tourist attractions and most of the scenic tourist routes are located in remote areas of great natural beauty with little prospect for industrial or farming development which can benefit from an expanding tourism industry. For this reason I welcome the proposed major expansion in marketing and promotion activities in overseas markets. The tourist industry will have a key role in this area in conjunction with Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">

      <P>Fáiltím roimh an Bille um Thrácht Cuartaíochta.  Tá áthas orm i leith na bhforálacha atá i gceist ag an Aire le cur i bhfeidhm faoin reachtaíocht seo, ach tá díomá orm nach bhfuil sé i bhfad níos leithne ná mar atá sé.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which will implement the proposals of the Arthur D. Little report which has been adopted by the Government.  The Minister has not addressed many areas of tourism in the Bill and I hope he will deal with these in another Bill in the not too distant future.  Deputy Andrews referred to the need for consultations with the industry.  I have spoken with people involved in the industry and there is a general welcome for the Bill.  However, the implementation of the provisions in the Bill could create difficulties.  The Minister would be wise to put in place a consultation forum along the lines outlined by Deputy Andrews which would involve Bord Fáilte, the contractor and members of the industry in occasional meetings to sort out whatever organisational difficulties may arise.  It is would able that difficulties will arise.  I would like to see an obligation placed on the contractor on an ongoing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that the Bill creates a new agency or a new body with which the tourism people will have to deal. They have complained that they are already dealing with a substantial number of bodies who administer different grants.  These include Leader, county enterprise boards, Bord Fáilte or Shannon Development, the regional tourist organisation and countless other bodies <Col N="1048" /> which impinge on their activities to some extent.  Some offer grant support and some have other roles.  There is a difficulty in terms of administration for individual operators, most of whom do not have unlimited resources in terms of personnel and finance.  I am worried that one of the effects of the Bill is that they will be dealing with one or more new agency when dealing with the contractors.</P>
    <P>Another complaint which comes through very strongly &mdash; it does not reflect on this Minister &mdash; is that little provision is made for support of the private sector in the capital funds which have been allocated under the EU programme. It would appear in theory that they are entitled to apply but in practice what tends to happen is that the State authority has its own projects which gobble up all the funding and, in effect, little support is available for the private sector.</P>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum mentions that Bord Fáilte will retain responsibility for the operation of the final stages of the appeals mechanism provided under the Tourist Traffic Acts for applications for registration and renewal of registration where they are refused and in the case of cancellation of registration.  I do not think that is contained in the Bill.  It is contained in the explanatory memorandum and reference is made to it in the Minister's speech but it does not appear to be specifically provided for in the Bill.  It would be better if it was provided for in the Bill.  The Minister also said there were no direct financial implications and that it will not involve any additional charge on the Exchequer.  I am sure that is the case but there may well be financial implications for those in the industry.  No matter what the Minister does it would be virtually impossible for him to ensure that there were not some financial implications in terms of the cost of providing this service.</P>
    <P>In regard to section 5, which refers to the registration officer, I wish to raise two questions which the Minister might <Col N="1049" /> address.  One relates to the qualifications required for the registration officer.  I am not sure that it would be appropriate to include that in the legislation. I have no doubt it would be his intention and everybody's wish that the qualifications would be of a suitable standard.  Subsection (5) states:</P>
    <P>The Board may, where it considers a registration officer who is an employee of a contractor is not performing the functions of a registration officer in a satisfactory manner, revoke the appointment.</P>
    <P>It is not clear whether that means the appointment of the contractor or the appointment of the employee.  It would be important for the board to have a specific direct influence, not only on the qualification of the contractor <i>per se</i> but on the individual qualification of those people who might be deemed to be registration officers under the terms of the Bill and who would be employed by the contractor.</P>
    <P>Section 6 (2) is interesting but convoluted. It appears to provide that an entry in the register will be sufficient evidence, in any legal proceedings, and &ldquo;it shall not be necessary to prove the signature of such officer&rdquo;.  I am not sure exactly what that means and why it is included in the Bill.  It seems to suggest that even a forged entry on the register would be deemed to be correct and beyond querying in court.  I would be concerned if that were the case.  I am sure it is not the intention.  It is a convoluted subsection which could prove difficult in the future.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the manner in which section 8 is set out.  As I understand it, it proposes to amend sections 27 and 30 of the Principal Act and section 32 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952.  The Minister would be well advised to take section 8 and sections 27 and 30 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939, and section 32 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, and try to put them in to a single entity that would cover what is required, under section 8, in a clearer and more complete manner, I think that <Col N="1050" /> is possible and I ask the Minister to consider it.</P>
    <P>In general terms the whole tourism area is hugely important to the economy. The Minister is aware of that and says so every time he has an opportunity. He travels around the country and tries to do everything in his power to promote tourism, but his understanding of the importance of tourism is not shared by a number of his Cabinet colleagues. There is an onus on the Minister to deliver at Cabinet level.  I am not saying it is an easy job but I encourage the Minister to exert his authority in that role.  He is presiding over one of the relatively few areas in the economy which has the potential to deliver a substantial number of extra jobs; it already accounts for 90,000 jobs.  Soon it will be responsible for £1 billion in direct and indirect tax revenue per annum. Already it accounts for almost 7 per cent of gross national product and it is responsible for a balance of payments credit of £400 million to £500 million per year.</P>
    <P>There is a fashion which seeks to do down tourism and to establish that tourism is in some way an unworthy and less important industry.  That is damaging to the economy and damaging to tourism <i>per se</i> and it will ultimately fall to the Minister to address it.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Andrews, raised the question of restaurant registration. That is an issue I would like to have teased out further and on which I would welcome the Minister's views.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the redundancy package will cost £2.2 million.  It is possible that some of the people who will avail of this redundancy package, presumably qualifying for a pension, will return to Bord Fáilte in one of these new roles, on an even greater salary, albeit in the guise of contractor.  There is a whole area of costs that needs to be teased out and clarified.</P>
    <P>The Bill will have a direct effect on morale and skill levels within Bord <Col N="1051" /> Fáilte in that four or five highly experienced senior executives will leave the organisation.</P>

This is illustrated by the fact that while Fianna Fáil proposed to increase public spending by only 4.5 per cent, it provided in its Estimates for the building of a prison at Castlerea, County Roscommon and a new women's prison in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government came to office with the first budget surplus in 27 years, <Col N="1054" /> because of the work and commitment of the present leader of Fianna Fáil.  It was, therefore, easy for the Minister for Justice to make public promises about tackling spiralling crime levels.</P>
    <P>She promised the people a referendum on bail and solemnly promised in this House, as late as last Thursday, that there would be 210 additional prison places.  Clearly, the Minister for Justice did not take into account that neither she nor Fine Gael have any real say in this Government.</P>
    <P>Warning bells for Fine Gael members must have sounded when the Taoiseach, in a desperate grasp for a political lifeline, agreed to hand over the Finance Ministry to Labour with the Department of the Environment.  The spending began then as if there was no tomorrow. Repeated warnings by the leader of Fianna Fáil that this would end in tears were met with jibes and contemptuous dismissal.</P>
    <P>The decision not to proceed with the building of prisons at Castlerea and Mountjoy was taken in the absence of the Minister for Justice.  The Minister for Finance cracked the whip and, as usual, the Taoiseach danced.  It is an appalling situation in any Government that a decision as crucial and as vital as the building of these prisons should have been taken in the absence of the Minister for Justice.  The propriety of this decision must be questioned.  It is extremely significant that in public interviews the Minister for Justice has failed to deny that she told the Taoiseach she would have to consider her position.  It is abundantly clear she should have done the honourable thing and resigned.  Her plans for a referendum on bail are in tatters and her much heralded law and order package is in ruins.  Fine Gael was once known as the law and order party.  This reputation is now on the scrap-heap as well.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand how any Minister could continue in office having been publicly humiliated by the Minister for Finance and the leader of her own party.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for <Col N="1055" /> Finance contemptuously dismissed all the best laid plans of the Minister for Justice.  That is bad enough but what is worse is that they also contemptuously dismissed with one wave of the hand every proposal to tackle serious crime.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister, the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance pleading that fewer prison places will be required because of the peace process. The most hardened cynic must have gasped when he heard the Taoiseach say that prison places would also be created by releasing those in prison for failure to pay fines and debts.  Aside from the fact that there are very few people in prison for either of these reasons, the Taoiseach was also giving a slap in the face to the judicial process and creditors who are entitled to be paid what is due to them.</P>
    <P>Promises of a reform of the prison system will ring hollow in the ears of the general public against the backdrop of cynicism and obfuscation being created by this Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Neither is there any point in the Minister for Justice saying that Fianna Fáil cannot have it both ways.  Fianna Fáil favours containing public expenditure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and this has been abundantly clear since 1987 up until December 1994.  The Minister for Justice was extremely economical with the truth when she said it was Fianna Fáil which increased the national debt between 1977 and 1981.  The unvarnished truth is that the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition &mdash; doubled the national debt and borrowed in excess of £12 billion between 1982 and 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has got its priorities wrong.  Fianna Fáil was able to provide for the building of the prisons at Castlerea and Mountjoy in severely curtailed Estimates.  This Government, which increased public spending by 11 per cent in six months, could not build <Col N="1056" /> the prisons.  It is high time the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Justice realised they are no longer in Opposition.  It is their bounden duty to prioritise projects.  Obviously, crime does not figure high up on that list of priorities.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has illustrated its commitment to tackling crime not just in agreeing to build the prisons, but in introducing legislation on an almost weekly basis.  It has introduced the Proceeds of Crime Bill, 1995; the Criminal Law (Bail) Bill, 1995; the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill, 1995; the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill, 1995; the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1995 and the Criminal Procedure Bill, 1995.</P>
    <P>In a mean-spirited response to the Criminal Law (Bail) Bill, 1995, the Minister for Justice said we were only tinkering around with the problem and that it was probably unconstitutional.  I will leave aside the fact that we were neither tinkering around with the problem nor was the Bill unconstitutional. The Minister said what was required was a referendum.  We responded to that challenge with our Bill, the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1995.  In that Bill we have set out in plain language what is required. The Constitution would be amended to provide the following: &ldquo;any person charged with an indictable offence may be remanded in custody pending trial if on the hearing of an application for bail, the judge is satisfied that there is a probability that the person will commit a criminal offence which is also an indictable offence if admitted to bail; any person remanded in custody pending trial by reason of a judge being satisfied that there is a probability that the person will commit a criminal offence which is also an indictable offence if admitted to bail shall not be remanded in custody for that reason alone for any single period greater than 90 days.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice said we must await the Law Reform Commission report.  That report has been coming for a long time and is just another empty <Col N="1057" /> promise from the Minister.  We have had enough obfuscation, prevarication, indecision and procrastination from this Minister.  All her promises are just a bottle of smoke and everybody knows that now.  This Government has no intention of tackling the crime problem and the very best intentions of the Minister for Justice are being obliterated by her colleagues at the Cabinet table, including the leader of her own party.</P>
    <P>I call upon the members of the Fine Gael parliamentary party to show a little pride and to tell the Minister for Finance he cannot continue cutting Fine Gael Ministers' Departments, even without their consent.  The pride of the Fine Gael Party has been subjugated to the Taoiseach's greed for power at any price.</P>
    <P>Since this Government cannot lead in the fight against crime it should at least follow.  We would support any worth-while legislation or measures to tackle the crime problem, but, sadly, there has been none.  Fianna Fáil is leading the fight against crime from the Opposition benches.  Where legislation has been introduced we have been responsible for it.  Where inactivity has been the order of the day we have produced the goods.  If 210 prison places were needed on Thursday of last week, they are needed on Wednesday of this week and no amount of excuses or downright nonsense can hide that salient fact.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. Foxe Mr. Foxe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Donoghue for agreeing to share his time with me.  Over the weekend the people of County Roscommon were dumbfounded when the bombshell was dropped that building work on the prison at Castlerea was to be halted.  We later discovered it was to be cancelled. When I first heard this news, I found it hard to understand that the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, would have made this decision.  I have always had the greatest of regard for her as a down to earth and intelligent person with common sense.  We were later informed it was not the Minister for Justice who made this ridiculous decision but <Col N="1058" /> another Minister.  This made more sense.  This is one of the greatest examples of Pale politics.</P>
      <P>It was decided two years ago that the best way to combat crime was to increase the number of gardaí and prison places.  It was also decided that the psychiatric hospital in Castlerea would be an ideal location for a prison and work commenced 12 months ago.  Since then, £1.3 million has been spent in erecting a wall one mile long which is 20 feet above ground and nine feet below.</P>
      <P>We now have a building in Castlerea which is no longer considered acceptable for use as a psychiatric hospital, and no prison.  We have also lost a hotel to the Western Health Board which acquired it to house psychiatric patients. In addition, the board invested in other buildings and surrounds which would be used as workshops and so on for patients.  It is a ridiculous and scandalous waste of money and shows an utter disregard by the Minister for taxpayers' funds.  One Minister &mdash; not the Minister for Justice &mdash; said the reason for abandoning the prisons in Castlerea and Wheatfield is that because of peace in Northern Ireland there will be no need for extra spaces as there will be fewer political prisoners.  That is a diabolical statement.  Does that Minister think we have no common sense?  There are about 2,300 prison spaces in the country and a mere handful are occupied by political prisoners.  If the decision to abandon the prison in Castlerea is not reversed the wall built there will be a monument to the Government's stupidity and disregard for taxpayers' money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other end of Roscommon county which borders Leitrim another bombshell was dropped.  Leitrim has a population of 25,000 people.  It has been ravished by emigration over the years, mainly because of the lack of policies of previous Governments, but I will not dwell on that now.  The Masonite Corporation of Chicago was to locate in the south Leitrim-Roscommon area where 350 jobs would be provided.  However, when work was almost ready to begin another Minister objected, mainly <Col N="1059" /> because he is concerned about the possible negative impact on the area's distinctive landscape.  Anybody who drove through Leitrim in recent times or who worked in it, as I did for years, will be aware of the distinctive landscape &mdash; distinctive as it is bereft of human habitation because of emigration over the years.</P>

    <P>This is a debate about the soundness or otherwise of this Government's management of the public finances and of the economy.  It is critical that this House and the public are aware of the facts in considering these issues. Accordingly, I propose to address the main points of the Opposition motion. Views about the soundness or otherwise of Government management of the economy and the budget should not be formed on mistaken impressions, which <Col N="1060" /> is sadly the case.  I propose to set the record straight on some basics.</P>
    <P>The Opposition motion does not describe the Irish economy and budget of 1995.  Opposition speakers have not talked about today's economy and public finances for which I have responsibility. They seem to be transfixed by nightmares of past horrors which they and their predecessors perpetrated on our society and the economy.</P>
    <P>Once again, the EU Commission has said that we are one of only three member states out of 15 who are abiding by the Maastricht Treaty budgetary conditions.</P>
    <P>The economy is expected to grow by between 5 and 7 per cent this year.  Ours is the best performing economy in the European Union.  Nearly 40,000 extra jobs will be created this year.  I wish to address a matter to which Deputies Ahern and McCreevy repeatedly referred.  The planned budget deficit is 2.4 per cent compared to last year's planned budget deficit of 2.7 per cent. This is a significant improvement on what Deputy Ahern planned and was on course to achieve this time last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not hear what I said.  I am talking about the planned budget deficit.  Let us deal with facts.  The national debt is expected to fall by 5 per cent or more relative to GNP.  I will give more facts that may be unpalatable.  Last year the underlying current budget balance was in significant deficit &mdash; there was a good performance relative to preceding years, nevertheless there was an underlying deficit.  To achieve a current budget surplus in 1995 from that starting point, while providing for the pro-jobs taxation and other measures which this Government introduced in the budget, would have meant keeping current supply spending, exclusive of the cost of equal treatment, below the rate of inflation.  This would have required <Col N="1061" /> spending estimates far below those prepared by the outgoing Government last winter.</P>
      <P>The net Estimates figure when I came to office was £8,706 million.  The Estimates we published in January, albeit of a different composition, amounted to £8,702 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem arises with what the Government has done since then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>These are facts and I know Deputies opposite do not like to hear them.  The Opposition motion talks of out of control public spending.  One basis for assessing the validity of this charge is to compare the pace of increase in current supply spending planned this year with what happened in the past.  Gross current supply spending will increase significantly this year compared with 1994 &mdash; by 5.6 per cent excluding the special £140 million payment of equal treatment arrears announced in March, or by nearly 7 per cent including those payments.  This year's increase is considerably lower than the average increase of about 8 per cent over the preceding four years when Fianna Fáil Ministers were in charge of the Department of Finance.</P>
      <P>Alternatively one might consider the relationship between current supply spending and national output.  The share of spending in GNP rose over the period 1990-93, but fell last year.  This year again gross supply spending is planned to be lower as a share of national income than in 1994, notwithstanding the £200 million being spent on equal payment arrears.  These facts indicate that public spending is not out of control but being managed in a fashion which, over time, can release resources for much needed job supportive reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition motion talks of the lack of prudent financial planning and of any coherent medium or long term economic strategy.  I am puzzled by these allegations.  The signs are that this year's budget is on course.  This motion has been put down in response to <Col N="1062" /> Government action taken with an eye to the future.  The action announced last week is the very essence of planning ahead and is a clear contradiction of virtually everything Deputy McCreevy said last night.  The Opposition motion talks of the panic decisions of the Government as announced on Thursday, 8 June 1995 and of <i>ad hoc</i> policy announcements of Ministers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts are otherwise. There is no panic.  The actions taken stem from prudent reflection about 1996 and the medium term and are aimed at ensuring there will be capacity for further pro-employment action in 1996 and 1997.</P>
      <P>The Opposition motion talks of the recent damning annual OECD survey on the Irish economy.  Clearly Fianna Fáil Deputies have not read that survey because what they have said is nonsense. I will give some quotations from the survey.</P>

      <P>It also states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Continued growth in employment and real disposable income should sustain personal consumption; ... Activity will also benefit from increased exports; ... Business investment in structures and buildings ... <Col N="1063" /> should increase; ... The expected growth should be sufficient to ensure a further reduction in unemployment; ... With Government borrowing remaining low, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to fall to 85 per cent by the end of 1995; ... Current expenditure targets are consistent with reducing the debt ratio towards 60 per cent by the end of the century.</P>
    <P>The only concern that the OECD had about Ireland's future is that growth in employment and the accompanying decline in unemployment could be so strong as to prompt inflation and consequently a loss of international competiveness. Its judgment is that &ldquo;if such developments are avoided, the economy would be firmly ensconced on a high-growth, low inflation path which might well continue until the end of the century&rdquo;.  No fairminded reader can plausibly portray these as damning comments and conclusions.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated to this House many times, the Government is firmly committed to containing the growth in public expenditure.  This is a key element in our strategy to manage the public finances so as to support sustained employment growth and to conform to the parameters of the Maastricht Treaty.  Far from being the spendthrift Government which certain Members of this House and certain outside commentators have labelled us, we are being responsible and firm in our management of the public finances.  Last week's announcement represents a forward-looking step to disciplined and prudent expenditure planning &mdash; with the objective of overcoming the excessive growth trend in public spending of the last five years when Fianna Fáil controlled the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The importance this Government attaches to strict control of public expenditure is manifestly clear in the commitments we have made in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to limit the growth in current supply services expenditure to 6 per cent in 1995 and to an average of 2 per cent in real terms for <Col N="1064" /> the remaining years 1996 and 1997.  We are firmly committed to ensuring that the fruits of economic growth are not fully absorbed by higher public spending, as has been the case in recent years, but are used in substantial measure of tax reform which will favour the incentive to works, to tackle the poverty trap and to encourage enterprise and growth.</P>
    <P>The difficult and painful correction to the public finances which took place in the 1980s, involved severe retrenchment in Government expenditure programmes and, consequently, in public sector employment.  It also allowed, however, for a significant improvement in the state of the public finances and for some real reduction in the burden of taxation.  The lessons from that period clearly demonstrate that control of public expenditure is of crucial importance if real progress in reducing our debt and the burden of taxation is to be achieved.</P>
    <P>Since 1990, public spending has risen much faster than inflation for three reasons: the deferment of special pay agreements and payments; the introduction of some new or improved services like childcare or reducing the pupil-teacher ratio and the relative absence of cost-saving productivity improvements in public services.  Since 1990, current supply services spending has increased by over 8 per cent per annum on average. The increase in real terms was over 5 per cent per annum on average and this rate of growth simply could not be sustained.</P>
    <P>Labour along with other successful socialist parties has changed and we know how to manage economies in a manner that will ensure we will achieve social justice as well as prudent economic management.</P>
    <P>Sound financial management requires also that we look ahead to the prospects for 1996 and beyond and, in particular, to the outlook for observing the target of a 2 per cent real growth in current supply services spending.  A review of spending trends which my Department has conducted on the basis of the cost in 1996 of existing programmes and <Col N="1065" /> policies, seven months before 1996, has indicated that current supply services expenditure in 1996 could be running a little bit ahead of the 2 per cent limit.  It was necessary, therefore, to take action to avert that risk.  In essence it was forward-looking and prudent to do so at this stage.</P>
    <P>The interim measures announced last week will ensure that we remain on course to stay within the 2 per cent limit for 1996.  These interim measures were not a panic-reaction to so-called out of control expenditure, as has been suggested, but were rather deliberate and cautious decisions taken on the basis of careful analysis of the emerging expenditure outlook for 1996.  Their primary purpose is to ensure that the 2 per cent limit to current spending will not be breached.  This surely is the essence of planning for the future.</P>
    <P>The decision that all Ministers must identify measures to control spending within their Departments in 1996 will enable timely decisions to be made on the adjustments necessary in specific programmes and schemes to ensure that the required savings in 1996 materialise. Early action in identifying areas where savings can be found is no more than prudent and sound financial planning.  It will enable Ministers to review their spending plans in a controlled fashion as part of the overall strategic management approach to the allocation of resources in 1996 and later years within the constraints imposed by the Government's spending target.</P>
    <P>There has been much public comment on the Government decision to restrict additional recruitment to the public service. The Government has no intention to curtail services introduced in recent years which have benefited the general public.  However, the increased staffing levels required to provide these services are very significant and must be fully funded on an ongoing basis by the Exchequer out of general taxation.</P>
    <P>Our first priority is to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that we can continue to maintain these service improvements in the years ahead.  This <Col N="1066" /> can best be achieved by building on the overall budgetary discipline that has so benefited the economy over recent years and remains essential for continued economic and employment growth in the future.  The present rate of growth in public service numbers is incompatible with the Government's 2 per cent real limit on public spending in 1996 and 1997.</P>
    <P>The Government has, therefore, agreed to introduce a measured and balanced policy to stabilise overall public service numbers and ensure that public servants are deployed to the best possible effect.  This policy involves a restriction on recruitment where such recruitment would have the effect of increasing the numbers of posts funded by the Exchequer above that on 9 June, unless there is specific prior Government approval.  The implementation of this decision will, of course, give due regard to the Government's social priorities, especially as regards poverty, as set out in the programme for renewal. In addition, recruitment to maintain the existing level of staff complements may still proceed.  This policy will also allow for a strategic review of the allocation of staffing resources on a sectoral basis thereby ensuring greater efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of services to the public.</P>
    <P>As I indicated already, the OECD survey on the Irish economy is very positive.  There are criticisms but these are in general constructive, in that the concern of the OECD is to ensure that the present successful policies are maintained. Indeed, the key criticism of the OECD in relation to growth in public supply services expenditure is of growth in the recent past, not with the Government's plans to contain growth in public supply services expenditure to 2 per cent in real terms during the next two years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Domestic demand is forecast by the OECD to grow further this year.  The combined effect of the <Col N="1067" /> changes in this year's budget in tax and pay-related social insurance contributions and continued growth in numbers at work will translate into significant growth in incomes.  Aided by transfers from EU Structural and Cohesion Funds, I expect the volume of fixed investment to rise by over 9 per cent following a real increase of 7.25 per cent last year, adding to the productive capacity of the economy.  Overall, I expect growth in the volume of GNP to be about 5.25 per cent in 1995 and some commentators have taken an even more optimistic view.</P>
      <P>This strong economic growth is leading to higher employment.  At budget time I anticipated that in 1995 total employment would grow by 31,000 or 2.6 per cent, with non-agricultural employment expanding by 37,000 or 3.6 per cent.  I have no reason to change these forecasts.  All the indications are that employment is growing rapidly and may exceed our cautious forecasts at budget time.  For example, notified redundancies for the first five months of the year are 25 per cent lower than for the same period last year; employment-related revenue receipts are on target; employment in building and construction &mdash; an important barometer of the economy's health &mdash; is 7.4 per cent higher than a year ago; and according to the IBEC monthly survey, business employment expectations are now the most upbeat they have been in over four years.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, the Government is delivering on jobs.  Indeed, our employment performance is the best in the European Union.  This robust employment growth is leading to lower unemployment. Last month the live register fell by 7,000.  Since the beginning of the year unemployment has fallen by over 11,000.  Unlike some previous periods of falling unemployment, employment growth rather than net emigration seems to be the main factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the OECD's report the prospects for a continuation of this strong employment growth and falling <Col N="1068" /> unemployment are good.  The Government shares this optimistic assessment. However, we are conscious of the need to build on our considerable successes to date, to further increase sustainable employment and reduce the unacceptably high level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>The public finances are too important for party political point scoring.  The fact is that all parties have learned the hard lesson that Governments, like households, cannot indulge in unrestrained borrowing.  We have been to the brink, and have successfully turned away as a nation.  I would like to believe that all parties have gained in political maturity in the process.</P>
    <P>It is true that there has been a limited upward movement in the annual EBR since 1990, but it remains firmly under 2.5 per cent of GNP and there is no evidence, under either previous or present Administrations, that we are in any danger of forgetting the lessons of the 1980s.</P>
    <P>The limited upward movement in the EBR since 1990 reflects several factors. Demographic factors and shrinking employment opportunities abroad, combined to increase the level of unemployment from 13 per cent in 1990 to a peak of some 16 per cent in 1993.  The public service pay bill increased significantly to accommodate arrears deriving from the deferral of pay increases during the initial years of fiscal correction, while pupil-teacher ratios and health services were improved in line with commitments made in the context of successive national agreements with the social partners for continued moderation in pay &mdash; moderation which has improved the competitiveness of Irish industry and contributed a great deal to the strong performance of the Irish economy. Such factors must be taken into account in any fair examination of the evolution of public spending, just as the current budget surplus of 1994 should be portrayed as an underlying deficit.</P>
    <P>In formulating its 1995 budget, the Government's focus was on the need to maintain fiscal discipline while maximising sustainable growth in output and <Col N="1069" /> employment within a low inflation economy. Accordingly, the budget set the Exchequer borrowing target at 2.4 per cent of GNP and within that constraint identified three primary objectives, reward for work, promotion of enterprise and the strengthening of social solidarity.</P>
    <P>The tax and PRSI changes made in the budget, combined with the pay increases agreed under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> will lead to an increase in take-home pay of approximately 2.5 per cent above inflation for a single person on the average manufacturing wage.  The profitability of business should be enhanced through the budgetary measures to reduce taxation on labour and profits. In the medium term, the prospects for 1996 and subsequent years are for continued growth in the international economy, with inflation projected to be relatively subdued.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by reminding the House about the terms of the amendment. In contradiction of what Deputy Ahern said last night, this is the first Government to commit itself in advance to specific targets for the growth in current supply services expenditure.  This is the area of expenditure which, if properly controlled, can yield significant benefits in terms of room for manoeuvre in tackling incentives for work through the tax and social welfare systems and in terms of keeping downward pressure on borrowing and, thus, on interest rates and inflation.  This disciplined approach will provide the resources to promote additional employment, reward work and reduce taxation.</P>
    <P>The OECD economic survey projects a favourable economic outlook, with continued growth in employment and real disposable income.  The Government has accepted the public debt philosophy and targets set out in the Maastricht Treaty.  The general Government deficit is projected at 2.7 per cent of GDP this year.  We have maintained Ireland's position as having one of the best fiscal performances in the European Union, <Col N="1070" /> the best rate of employment creation and the best overall performing economy. In short, the amendment in my name reflects the reality of the careful planning that has gone into this Government's fiscal and economic management. In those circumstances, I commend the amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. D. McDowell Mr. D. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put my cards on the table by saying I believe in maintaining public services and that we as a people have a duty to provide for those who cannot provide for themselves.  We have a duty to provide a health service for the sick and, in the words of the editorial of last Friday's issue of <i>The Irish Times,</i> we owe it to our young people to ensure that our educational standards are improved.  We also have a duty to invest in our future, in roads, public transport, telecommunications and training, the infrastructure which makes our economy work and which directly and indirectly leads to economic growth.  None of this can be achieved without public spending and as a result we as a Government have a duty to make that spending available.</P>
      <P>All of this should be obvious, but it appears it is not.  From the tone of much of what has been said and written over the past week it is obvious that many commentators and Opposition Deputies believe public spending is some sort of evil, a demon that must be slain.  I am proud of the improvements in public services that have taken place since my party came to power in 1992 in coalition with Fianna Fáil.  I am proud of the reduction in hospital waiting lists and the improvements in the education service, particularly for children in disadvantaged circumstances.  I am also proud of the resumption in local authority house building, the improved funding for the arts, civil legal aid and many other areas.  I welcome the infrastructural investment which has been made possible by Structural and Cohesion Funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1992 we focused on areas where improvements are both needed and affordable.  There has been no revisiting <Col N="1071" /> of 1977, the nub of the matter.  Public spending is not inherently bad, nor is it inherently good.  What happened in 1977, and the following years, was irresponsible and wasteful.  Jobs were created in the public service which we could not afford and, worse still, jobs were created for clerical officers and clerical assistants when there was very little for them to do.</P>

      <P>Most public spending serves its purpose but, equally, it is clear that there has been, and still is, great waste within the public service and public spending and the Minister is correct to tackle it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the current position my immediate reaction is to ask what all the fuss is about.  What crisis is it that people are talking about?  There is no budgetary crisis or crisis in public spending.  I do not believe there is any difficulty in regard to public spending.  I accept the Maastricht guidelines and that we must endeavour to reduce our Exchequer borrowing requirement in the next few years.  The debt-GNP ratio is too high and must be reduced progressively.  In short, we should only spend more if we can afford to do so, but this is where I have some difficulty.  The debate over the past week focused on the gross level of spending and failed to refer to the much more important question of whether we can afford to spend more. It took no account of tax revenue, the borrowing requirement or the level of growth.  It ignored income and concentrated exclusively on spending.  This is an economic nonsense, but those who would conjure an economic crisis can scarcely do otherwise.  It is difficult at this time of the year to make accurate forecasts of the 1996 outcome, but the economic indicators are unambiguously positive.  The optimistic growth rate predicted at the time of the budget may be exceeded with obvious implications for tax revenue.  There is no indication that <Col N="1072" /> the budget targets will not be met, the opposite is true.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">

    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. D. McDowell Mr. D. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be dishonest of me not to acknowledge that the Government contributed to the current debate by imposing on itself a guideline of a 2 per cent real increase in spending on supply services next year.  It will be clear from what I said that I regard this guideline as less important than the guidelines contained in the Maastricht Treaty.  I would go further and say that the 2 per cent limit is, of itself, not very important.  What matters is not the gross level of spending but rather the level we can afford.</P>
      <P>Of course, there is another argument against increased spending.  It is argued that public spending increases are dangerously inflationary, especially at a time when our economy is doing well. Those who advance this argument usually claim that the 1995 budget was excessively pro-cyclical, that our economy is in danger of overheating.  I do not accept that argument.  There is no evidence that our economy is overheated, nor is there any evidence that there are inflationary pressures at work.  This annual OECD survey is positively effusive on that point.  Nonetheless I accept that concern on this count is real and certainly would not dismiss the argument out of hand.  In any event, we are all aware that our colleagues in the Department of Finance and the Central Bank are skilled at spotting inflationary pressure at some distance. No doubt the Minister would take prompt corrective action were it to become necessary.  However, I contend it is clearly not necessary at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope I will be forgiven if I engage in an aside: is it not remarkable that the people and the parties who expressed concern about the inflationary effects of public spending are the very same people who argue for income tax cuts and all that they entail in terms of <Col N="1073" /> inflationary pressures and increased demand?</P>

      <P>Those individuals, indeed the social partners, would do themselves more credit were they consistent in their arguments.</P>
      <P>Speaking of consistency, it would be remiss of me not to refer to the absurdity of this Fianna Fáil motion.  For Fianna Fáil to suggest that public spending is out of control is effrontery of a quite remarkable kind.  Social spending this year will rise by 4.7 per cent compared with an average of 8 per cent over the preceding five years.  Public service pay will rise by 5.6 per cent, compared with 8.5 per cent over the preceding five years.  For Fianna Fáil to try to stand those figures on their head is really rather silly and convinces nobody.  It might well serve Fianna Fáil better were they to take credit for the real achievements of the last Government rather than refashioning the record of that Administration to suit the prejudices of their present spokesperson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An interesting feature of this debate is that the record of former Minister for Finance and Deputy MacSharry has been the subject of so much praise.  We are told he did the business by cutting spending and reducing the number of public servants.  No doubt some of that praise is deserved but it is also important to maintain a sense of perspective. It was former Deputy Ray MacSharry who gave us the empty hospital wards, who gave us the obscenity of people dying on trolleys in hospital corridors; it was he who cut spending on health so much that subsequent Governments have had no choice but to increase spending to redress that damage.  The experience of the MacSharry years is also instructive in relation to public service pay.  Certainly, the level of public service pay was stabilised but was achieved largely by postponing special increases to later years.  In fact the action of former Deputy Ray MacSharry contributed in <Col N="1074" /> no small measure to the increases in public service pay in the years following 1989.</P>
    <P>In reading the OECD survey this week one is struck by its uncommonly positive tone.  It seems to me to be quite extraordinary that Fianna Fáil, who clearly could not have read it, or are deliberately distorting it, should draw entirely opposite conclusions.</P>

      <P>The present Minister for Finance is a great talker and, as I speak, has left the House.  I admire the manner in which he put together his contribution this evening.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that Deputy Derek McDowell has not even read the OECD survey because they had this to say:</P>
      <P>As the economic cycle in Ireland is further advanced than on Continental Europe, being closer to that of the United Kingdom, the need to tighten monetary conditions in order to avoid a build up of inflationary tensions is arriving earlier than it is in other ERM countries.</P>
      <P>whereas Deputy Derek McDowell has just stated the opposite.  Deputy McDowell also stated that, when there is revenue buoyancy, it is a nonsense to control public expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DerekMcDowell" hpid="Mr. D. McDowell Mr. D. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy should consult his colleague, the Minister for Finance, because I do not think that was the type of comment he made earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might comment on the state of our economy, one with a mistakenly-planned current budget deficit in 1995, with out-of-control public spending, with a lack of prudent financial planning, with a lack of any coherent medium or long term economic strategy, <Col N="1075" /> an economy bedevilled by panic decisions on the part of the Government as witnessed on Thursday last, 8 June. Indeed the predictions of the Minister for Finance last week did not come to anything.</P>
    <P>I might quote from the introduction to the recent damning annual OECD survey on the Irish economy, to which others have already referred but it is sufficiently important to be placed on the record:</P>
    <P>... despite its good performance, the Irish economy continues to face high levels of public debt and unemployment ... tighter control on public expenditure appears to be necessary in order to sustain progress in reducing the debt to GDP ratio as specified in the Maastricht Treaty and to make room for a further reduction in the tax burden.</P>
    <P>Of course all of those facts were avoided by the Minister for Finance in his selective quotation from that survey. The sad fact is that this rainbow Coalition Government, in the light of that hard-hitting OECD survey, is only beginning to open its eyes to the massive surge in public spending which is and will continue to place unbearable pressure on all sections of our economy, business community and individuals nationwide.  It is sad that this Government had to wait until this OECD survey hit its desk before sitting up, taking notice and panicking.  It is sad that this Government have not learned anything or listened to anything the Fianna Fáil Party has said on the state of our economy in its very positive contributions. The sad fact is that this amalgam rainbow Coalition Government cannot manage our economy.  The truth is that it is a bad amalgam, like a poor dental filling &mdash; a short term solution that does not work properly.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to hide the truth: good economic management is hard to find and certainly was lost when this Government took office.  Sound economic, fiscal and monetary management <Col N="1076" /> had been the order of the day until the Fianna Fáil-led Administration left office in December last.  Unfortunately, mismanagement of our economy has become the norm over the past six months but the truth cannot be escaped.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil left office, more particularly when my present party Leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, left the Department of Finance on 15 December 1994, our economy was in good order, all trends were positive and we had the first balanced current budget in almost 30 years.  As a direct result of the prudent fiscal, monetary and economic policies of Fianna Fáil-led Governments since 1987 employment had been steadily growing, consumers had more to spend, and at long last our citizens were beginning to feel good about the state of our economy.  Christmas 1994 came and went, so too did the firm hand on the spending steering wheel which had been the forte of the Fianna Fáil-led Government.</P>
    <P>Only a short few months ago, the incoming Coalition Government promised firm management of the public finances.  In his Budget Statement of 8 February 1995 the Minister for Finance said:</P>
    <P>We will need firm discipline and strict adherence to our commitments if we are to meet the targets which we have set for ourselves in <i>A Government of Renewal.</i></P>
    <P>How all of that has changed within the intervening four short months, all of us are learning to our cost.  That firm discipline and strict adherence to commitments have gone so that the limp hand that was on the spending steering wheel at the beginning of the year has now fallen off.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil have complained and argued against the totally unnecessary reintroduction of a current budget deficit, sending totally wrong signals to the markets.  Without doubt it is a political scandal that this Government, within a few weeks of its first budget, decided to breach its public expenditure limits <Col N="1077" /> by a huge margin.  Even if the Government decided to ignore the calls of Fianna Fáil, the breaching of expenditure limits within a few short weeks of taking office was grossly irresponsible on several counts.  First, it undermines the credibility of Irish financial policy by placing a question mark over the ability of this Government to adhere for any time to the limits they clearly set for themselves for which, unfortunately, a heavy price will be paid by all our citizens in higher interest rates and taxation.</P>
    <P>In addition, increased expenditure and borrowing reduce the scope and wherewithal for reducing the tax burden in future years.  It is clearly evident that this Government appears to reverse continuously into a <i>cul-de-sac</i> of high spending.  Clearly its priority has been to maintain the scope for spending increases, with tax relief a poor second. An armada of business and industrial lobby and pressure groups has echoed Fianna Fáil's calls for a reining-in of public expenditure.  This is only to be expected since the state of the nation's finances has risen to the top of the agenda.  Despite the warnings and predictions of a myriad of domestic financial market analysts and of a variety of other groupings, only now has the Government gone into reactive mode and panicked, pretending that it has also practised good management and calling for panic streamlining and the skimming of moneys from Government Departments.</P>
    <P>Six months ago, Fianna Fáil had left in place the lowest inflation and interest rates for decades, a current budget surplus for the first time in 30 years, employment rising steadily, rising economic growth and a national development plan which would channel over £7 billion into the economy.  A country should not be run by mismanagement, panic decisions or late night press releases.  We deserve better than that.  In December we were known as a Celtic tiger.  It seems we could now become a Celtic crock but, unfortunately, there is <Col N="1078" /> no pot of gold at the end of this rainbow.</P>

      <P>I wish to apologise if my remarks will no longer be current by the time I conclude my contribution. As reported in this morning's <i>Irish Independent,</i> the Minister for Justice told the Dáil last week of her plans for anti-crime initiatives and more prison places. Two hours later, the Cabinet announced cuts in Garda recruitment and the scrapping of plans for new prisons.</P>
      <P>The 1995 budget promised to keep the increase in current expenditure to 6 per cent over last year.  In fact, it wrote the words &ldquo;we have done so&rdquo; in stone. In his budget speech the Minister for Finance said:</P>
      <P>We must also keep expenditure to levels which we can afford within this constraint.  We said we would keep the increase in current expenditure this year to 6 per cent over last year, and we have done so.</P>
      <P>The claim of continued budgetary discipline was hollow then and is empty now.  It must be remembered that, as the Minister pointed out, the budget benefited from certain once-off factors which will not arise in future years.  Even with that once-off aid the target is no longer achievable and only four months have passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four months ago in this House the Minister stated: &ldquo;...planning for the next three years is not enough.  We need to lift our eyes and focus upon the horizon of the near future, which will take us into the next century&rdquo;.  I will not mention the Minister's projections for the year 2010.  As I said last February, I wish to share the Minister's vision even though I warned that the 1995 budget would not fulfil those aspirations.  I stated at the time: &ldquo;I wonder, at the end of the term of this rainbow Coalition, <Col N="1079" /> with all its colours, what answers will it give when this economy is led into the ground and buried in debt&rdquo;.  The answer I received then from the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, was as follows:</P>
    <P>This is a reforming budget and I want to confront Fianna Fáil head-on regarding the contradictory and inconsistent nature of its charges against Democratic Left and Labour, the left wing parties in this Government of renewal.  On the one hand we are charged with the crime of fiscal recklessness &mdash; Deputy O'Keeffe repeated the charge that we are adding to the public debt.  With Democratic Left and Labour now in Government the charge is that the public finances are in dangerous hands, that we are, as a nation, going back to the spendthrift days of the past.</P>
    <P>How true that is.  In his further remarks, Minister of State Rabbitte coined the prophetic phrase &ldquo;reckless reds&rdquo;.  If he wants to be called that, I cannot object. The truth must come out.</P>
    <P>As recently as 24 May the Minister for Finance informed me in a written reply that the budget day estimate of current account expenditure was revised upwards by £111 million to £11,963 million. In the light of last week's announcement it appears the Government no longer has any expectation of even this revised outcome.  The planned 6 per cent increase for 1995 is long gone.</P>
    <P>As the House knows only too well, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, did not wait 24 hours to increase the Minister's £60 million provision for equality pay in 1995 to £200 million.  A £140 million per day error rate is over £50 billion per annum.</P>
    <P>Current expenditure is out of control and the Minister is right to try to correct it.  However, this Labour Minister for Finance seems to act first and think later.  An example of that is the issue of the ACC Bank board of directors and section 153 of the Finance Bill, which the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland <Col N="1080" /> said was unconstitutional.  The Attorney General, when eventually consulted, agreed.  The Minister reduced corporation tax to 38 per cent at a cost of £43 million per year.  This benefit to small companies and business would be self-financing and an enormous boost to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The 1995 budget was built on the 1994 budget with a percentage increase and other special items such as equality pay.  Did the Minister not find anything in 1994 and earlier years that was no longer relevant?  The Minister knows business but he does not know enough to realise that adding a bit on to last year's figures is not something that even former inmates of Castlerea would counter as good book-keeping.</P>
    <P>In addition to having the economy under control, crime prevention is the next most important task facing this tripod Administration.  Fianna Fáil's bail Bill was voted down and the plan for the new Castlerea prison was scrapped behind the face of the Minister for Justice &mdash; a non-resigning issue.  What is even more odd is that this prison was being financed from capital account and the Minister is, rightly, seeking to control current expenditure.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister's announcement a panic reaction?  I believe it is.  This is the only occasion in my time as a Member when the Government promised cuts during a by-election campaign.  These cuts or savings are only promised.  Some were cancelled yesterday, according to this morning's <i>Irish Independent.</i>  Can we be confident that Minister De Rossa will not do the same again having got away with it in the budget?</P>
    <P>Savings and discipline are necessary where current expenditure is involved. Across the board embargoes such as those implemented by the former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald and the former Minister, Ritchie Ryan, do not give the best results.  History seems to be repeating itself.  Some areas such as Justice and Health require more people and this could be done by reducing staffing in other areas &mdash; not by across the board crude measures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> In 1996 does the Minister for Finance intend to revert to the current budget surplus approach he inherited from Deputy Bertie Ahern.  Until Deputy Ahern is again Minister for Finance we will not have a booming economy. Under the present administration it is giving cause for concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the previous speaker for sharing time with me. This Government motion is complacent, built on a completely false appreciation of our present position and offers nothing but the prospect of further decline in our standards of budgetary management.  The sad fact is that over the past five years, inflation has been less than 15 per cent but public spending has increased by well over 35 per cent. Manufacturing earnings in the same period of time have gone up by 23 per cent but public sector pay and pensions have increased by 50 per cent.  Even allowing for the 11,700 people who were taken on to the public service payroll between 1989 and 1994, it means that average public sector pay has gone up by approximately 40 per cent in a period where the competitive, exposed private sector payroll has gone up by 23 per cent.</P>
      <P>It can be argued that the period from 1989 to 1994 was unusual because in the period 1987 to 1989 we had the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> which held back some public sector wage increases.  However, if one aggregates the <i>Programme for National Recovery,</i> the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and asks what they have done for this country, the answer is that they have driven up public sector spending by a huge amount and that the engine in that growth is public sector wage costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little point in trying to allocate to any particular party in this House a monopoly of virtue or of vice in this matter.  Every party is to some extent responsible for the three programmes to which I have just referred. Taken together they represent a <Col N="1082" /> phenomenon which we have to look at with a cold sceptical stare.  A succession of agreements between the so-called social partners when put together, mean the cost of running this State has exploded during a period when competitive pressures have been keeping down wages and costs in the real economy, that is the non-State economy. Money is being spent as if it grows on trees.</P>
    <P>What is it about jobs in Packard that make them less important than jobs in TEAM Aer Lingus?  What is it about jobs in Sunbeam that make them less important than jobs in Irish Steel?  Why do the social partners, using committees and hidden understandings in these so-called national agreements, exert massive pressure to subsidise employment in one place and at the same time expose vulnerable jobs to competitive pressures, high tax costs and a very substantial tax wedge without any apology to the people who will lose their jobs in these areas?  We should remind ourselves that in 1994 the Packard Electric plant in Tallaght, which employed 800 workers, had a total wage bill of £15.5 million, of that the Government took 35 per cent in PAYE and PRSI.  If that plant had been located in Newry or Wales the Government's share would be substantially less.</P>
    <P>All that money creates what is referred to as revenue buoyancy.  Ministers stand up and talk about revenue buoyancy as if it is a good thing when it is a bad thing.  Revenue buoyancy means that 10 per cent growth in the economy means an 18 to 20 per cent growth in tax yields.  A viciously regressive tax system takes more and more from those who are at work and throws it into the Government coffers.  By the same token, if one looks at what Government has been doing to contain its spending one finds in the five years 1989-94 it allowed its overall expenditure to go up by 35 per cent during a period when inflation was 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>If we permit the Government to continue spending, sucking in by viciously anti-work taxes more and more <Col N="1083" /> resources to fuel this increased expenditure and allow it to go unchecked, we will return precisely to the same economic malaise from which the country suffered between 1982-87.  It will not be characterised by doubling the national debt as it was on that occasion but by the failure of the economy to mobilise itself and prepare for the period during which we will no longer receive massive transfer payments from the European Union.</P>
    <P>We have a golden opportunity between 1995 and the turn of the century to revolutionise this economy and make it an enterprise economy.  During that time we have to transform our system of taxation and social welfare to make it far more worthwhile to work than not to work and our system of taxing the corporate sector so that the taxation rates of non-manufacturing firms are comparable with those across the Border.  We have also to tackle the tax wedge to make sure that a factory in Dundalk is not at a fiscal disadvantage compared to a factory in Newry.  If we do not take the opportunity to revolutionise our system of taxation on work during these five years Ireland, as a member of an enlarged European Union will find it has a very high dependency ratio, a very low earning cohort, a depressed state of enterprise and an absence of entrepreneurial spirit.  Those are the choices we face in strategic terms.  Time is running our for this country to shape up and face up to the facts of economic life.</P>
    <P>Our economy is not in a healthy condition. It is worth remembering that in the United States the percentage of those who are long term unemployed as a percentage of all unemployed people is in the low teens whereas in Europe as a whole it is in the low 40s which suggests that Europe has a big problem with unemployment.  This is as a result of high taxes on work coupled with a high welfare safety net.  Whereas this combination of factors has meant that long term unemployment in Europe as a percentage of total unemployment is <Col N="1084" /> in the low 40s in our poor benighted peripheral country the percentage of long term unemployed is 60 per cent. We are the sickest of the sick in economic terms.  We are the country with the biggest problems, and the lowest participation rate by our potential workforce; yet we tax work out of existence as if it is a luxury.  There must be a different attitude and it will have to start with a number of fundamentals.  First, that the social partners cannot ever again sit around a table and conclude an agreement to allow public sector pay over the life of an agreement to increase at 2.5 times the rate of inflation.  No matter how powerful the public sector unions are, they must be challenged if they think they can get away with that kind of comparative advance over other sectors. No matter who their political allies in office are they must realise the game is over.  We need a realistic approach by the trade union movement which will concentrate on the issue of real take home pay, on reducing the burden of taxation on work, on participation, investment and enterprise.  None of that is possible unless this country faces up to the fact that while Government spending grows demand for extra taxation on work cannot be controlled.</P>
    <P>During the period 1989-94 if public sector pay had increased at precisely the same rate as private sector pay there would have been in this year's budget an extra £780 million to apply to reducing the tax bill.  If we had simply kept public sector pay in line with private sector pay during that period we would be in a position to have a tax revolution. From my experience of this Government since 1994 &mdash; and my party participated in abortive negotiations on the formulation of this Government &mdash; it has embraced the philosophy of high expenditure, recruiting more and more into the public service.</P>
    <P>Finally, it has decided, as Deputy Ned O'Keeffe was saying, to engage in the most extraordinary proposition of scrapping capital projects such as Castlerea Prison while taking extra prison officers into the prison service.  That <Col N="1085" /> is the economics of the mad house and it is symbolic of that kind of economics that we have a half built wall around a former psychiatric hospital.</P>
    <P>This parliament faces fundamental decisions and will continue to over the next five years.  The opportunity exists for a majority here to put in place at the next election a Government which will take on the issue of public spending, which will ask trade unions, workers and businessmen to concentrate on take home pay, which will say we will live within our means and that the benefits of economic growth shall be given back to the people by lower taxation, and which will not resort to the recruiting office or to expenditure as a way out of its political problems.  That opportunity is coming.</P>
    <P>The Government's amendment to the Fianna Fáil motion is so complacent and out of touch with reality that I cannot wait for the electorate to get an opportunity to set us on the right road.  The sooner this Government falls apart the better.  The sooner the internal divisions that are beginning to appear manifest themselves more clearly in a way which will bring this Government down the better.  We cannot wait to get rid of this Government.  The country cannot afford to keep it in office any longer, and the sooner the people have an opportunity to speak decisively on the three-party Coalition which is now in office, the better.</P>

      <P>There is a reference to the OECD report in the motion and the Leader of the main party in Opposition referred to it at considerable length last night.  I wonder is that the same report I read earlier this week.  For the first <Col N="1086" /> time in the history of this State a Government in its programme has committed itself to spending limits.  Last December the policy agreement between the three parties set out clear policy parameters constraining the growth in spending to a maximum of 6 per cent in nominal terms this year and an annual rate of 2 per cent in real terms for 1996-7.  The OECD report states that the expenditure targets of the Government are consistent with reducing the debt ration towards 60 per cent by the year 2000 and it points to a favourable outlook for the coming years.  The report I saw seems to favour rather than condemn Government policy.</P>
      <P>There is a fundamental contradiction between what is stated in the motion and the day-to-day reality in this House where Opposition spokespersons call for further resources for health, education, social welfare, agriculture and a host of other schemes requiring the spending of public money.  The speech for all occasions is still very much part of the Fianna Fáil agenda.  The art of being on two sides of the same fence at the same time has been perfected by Fianna Fáil in recent weeks with particular reference to this motion.</P>
      <P>The Government has recognised the overshoot and has acted accordingly to ensure that targets as laid down are met. The gap is less than 1 per cent of the 1995 gross non-capital supply services allocation, and by having the Ministers identify priorities in a report by this weekend rather than acting recklessly, and indeed to avoid any panic, the Government is engaging in an exercise of discipline, care and realism.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that we are coming near the end of term.  Having had a bad report so far, Fianna Fáil needs some straw to grasp.  The Wicklow by-election is thinly concealed in the motion and, having dialled 999 repeatedly, fortunately there is no fire.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies M. Ahern and McCreevy.  Prudent management <Col N="1087" /> involves a carefully thought out budget, tight control of public spending, no borrowing when one is handed a budget with a surplus of £15 million, and identifying the priorities for available spending. Unfortunately I do not have the time to deal with the priorities the Government identified, which are not the ones it should have identified in the interests of the people with which our Leader, Deputy Ahern, dealt last night.</P>
      <P>Stop-go policies are retrograde in the extreme for the people who deliver the services and, above all, for the people who need the services.  To provide an allocation for a year and, four months later, radically alter that allocation causes serious problems particularly for those who depend on the caring services of health and education.  The Minister for Finance is looking for a saving of £77 million and an embargo on appointments to the public service.  Why was that not done on 8 February?  A former Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, whose name was mentioned earlier, did not tell us four months after introducing a budget that we would have to go back to some other plan.  It is gross mismanagement and incompetence on the part of this Government which was warned often enough by Fianna Fáil and by economic commentators during the past four months that the predictions in the budget were unsustainable.  I blame the ideologies in the Government.  There are extremes of ideology and one cannot, therefore, expect a co-ordinated and integrated policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accuse the Government particularly of having no commitment to rural Ireland.  In the Border region it paid lip-service at the time of the ceasefire but there was no action.  INTERREG money provided by the taxpayers of Germany and France which was supposed to be additional comes as part of our normal allocation.  Another example of the lack of commitment to the rural areas is the abandonment of the prison at Castlerea.  Who would consider it good management to build a wall at a <Col N="1088" /> cost of £1.2 million, leave it there, close the hospital and buy a hotel for the psychiatric patients?</P>
    <P>The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, is intervening to block the building of a factory in Leitrim.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry in a high-handed and precipitate manner suspended the control of the farmyard pollution scheme.  They are further examples of Fine Gael-Labour policy on rural Ireland.  In 1982 they abandoned decentralisation and in 1987 Fianna Fáil reactivated it and many towns and counties have been revitalised as a result.</P>
    <P>Where is the Minister of State with responsibility for the west?  I was disappointed not to hear him in this debate attempting to justify the decision in regard to Castlerea.  It is interesting also that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, never once mentioned Castlerea or tried to justify the decision in regard to it.  Prudent management is not a stop-go approach or a panic reaction such as we saw last Thursday.  Prudent managment is for a Minister for Finance to bring in a budget that will last 12 months, not 12 weeks.</P>

      <P>I support the Fianna Fáil motion.  In 1987 Fianna Fáil inherited a shambles of an economy after the national debt increased in the previous four years from £12 billion to £25 billion, despite what the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, said last night on television when she got her dates mixed up.  Between 1987 and 1992 a Fianna Fáil led Government reversed that trend resulting in a current budget surplus outturn for the first time in many years.  Fianna Fáil Government policies in those years led to low inflation, low interest rates, increased confidence in the business sector, a reduction in unemployment levels, an increase in the numbers at work and an increase in economic growth but what happened since December 1994?  There is convincing evidence of the lack of economic leadership.  There has been no <Col N="1089" /> sense of direction or responsible financial management.  The country has not been governed properly by the rainbow Coalition.  In the Democratic Left Party &mdash; perhaps it should be &ldquo;Democratic Right&rdquo;&mdash; we have evidence of a Damascus like conversion of representatives who, in Opposition, depicted themselves as the champions of the poor and downtrodden.  However, their recent actions show they are lovers of the trappings of power.  The manner in which their leader, the Minister for Social Welfare, treated the unemployed and pensioners will rank as one of the greatest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

During the Cork by-election the Taoiseach promised that if the party won the seat and was returned to power he would license south coast television.

      <P>I said last night we are going down the road we took in the 1970s and 1980s.  I stated there was nothing wrong with trying the experiment but when it is proved beyond doubt that a current budget deficit does not work in an open economy such as ours every party should learn from that. It has been recognised that this is not the correct road to take.  Certain events in the last few weeks remind me of what happened in 1982 and 1987.  I refer to the contribution made by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes.  He set Exchequer borrowing requirement targets for a particular year but the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, who was hospitalised, disagreed with them and made the Taoiseach, former Deputy Garret FitzGerald, back down.  From that moment the Government lost control of public expenditure.</P>
      <P>When the Estimates were published I and other speakers said they were not realistic.  I make no apology for saying that to plan for a current budget deficit again when we had a balanced budget for the first time in 27 years was daft.</P>

      <P>Ten days after the introduction of the budget the Minister for Social Welfare decided to spend an extra £140 million.  As a result of fancy accounting the position will not change. Last week the Minister for Finance stated &ldquo;minor adjustments&rdquo; will be made while newspaper headlines spoke of &ldquo;Taoiseach gets tough on spending&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> It was reported in the newspapers that there will be additional cutbacks amounting to £70 million but the Tánaiste, who was abroad, stated that did not apply any more.  Following a briefing by the Minister for Justice, we understand that the adjustments announced last week do not count for anything.  That is how the Government of 1982-87 behaved.  Whatever one might say about the Government from 1987-89 under the then Taoiseach, former Deputy Haughey and Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, it adhered to its decisions.  I faced thousands of angry parents when cutbacks were made in education.  Whatever my differences were with Deputy Haughey over the years he was the first to do anything about the problems which existed.</P>
    <P>To plan irresponsibly for a current budget deficit given the growth rate in our economy for the last number of years is economically stupid.  When the rainy day comes the Government will not be able to prime the economy.  We were not in a position to do it between 1982-87.  It was not good from a macroeconomic or any other economic point of view.  The Government has adopted the same approach on this occasion. There is a slow down in the UK and US economies and there is a marked slow down in the German economy.  If it is necessary to prime the pump with more expenditure the Government will not be able to do this.</P>
    <P>I always believed that the electorate was prepared to follow a Government which administered the proper medicine. It accepted the cutbacks which had to be made post-1987 on the basis that no future Government, including a Fianna Fáil Government, would go back down that road.  Political parties will pay a heavy price for the irresponsibility shown by the Government over the past six months.  I would make the same point if a Fianna Fáil-led Government had taken this course.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús buíochas a ghabháil leatsa as ucht an cheist seo a cheadú, and I thank the Minister of State for coming in to reply.  I am sure the Minister is aware of this case.  Patrick McLaughlin was arrested in November 1985 on a charge of conspiracy to cause an explosion.  He was given a life sentence, to a maximum of 22 years.  He has served ten years and, like many other prisoners, has lost his family and his dignity.  The problem is compounded by the fact that since his trial he and his family have always maintained his innocence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had an opportunity in the House last week to meet the McLaughlin family. I thank my colleagues who attended that meeting and the Minister for making his officials available at very short notice.  This evening the McLaughlin family called to the House of Commons to put their case to British parliamentarians.  Given that the Secretary of State has approved arrangements for temporary compassionate leave for longer serving paramilitary prisoners in the North it is opportune that we put pressure on the authorities in Northern Ireland and on the Home Secretary to ensure Patrick McLaughlin is given a permanent transfer to Maghaberry prison.  His family were thankful that he was granted a temporary transfer but since then many other prisoners have been granted a permanent transfer <Col N="1099" /> and under the new regulations in Northern Ireland they will be put on parole soon.  It was confirmed by the Northern Ireland Office last week that if Patrick McLaughlin is granted a permanent transfer he will be entitled to parole this year.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Spotlight&rdquo; carried out an investigation of this case and uncovered new evidence.  Scotland Yard requested that evidence from the television and print media and have been in possession of it since last March, yet the family has heard nothing about the case.  I ask the Minister, through her office, the office of the Tánaiste and the London Embassy, to contact the Home Secretary and impress upon him the need for a permanent transfer for this man. This would augur well in the present climate.  The Home Secretary should be requested to put pressure on Scotland Yard to ensure the new evidence is admissible and that it is given to the family's solicitors so that they will have an opportunity to appeal the case in the Court of Appeal.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister's office and the Embassy have been involved for a number of years in prison visits and so on.  This is an opportune time to put pressure on the British authorities in this regard.  Given that many of my colleagues on all sides of the House who met this family are of the opinion that this man is innocent and should be given an opportunity to prove his innocence through the Court of Appeal, I ask the Minister to ensure as a matter of urgency that he is granted a permanent transfer to Maghaberry prison in County Antrim.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton) Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has consistently emphasised to the British Government the importance of prison issues in the context of the peace process and the need to respond positively to the new situation in the aftermath of the paramilitary ceasefires.  It was against this background that the Government, having <Col N="1100" /> regard to the reduced threat to the community, agreed to the early release of a number of prisoners in this jurisdiction. The Tánaiste had devoted particular attention to prison matters, including the question of release and prison conditions, in the discussions which he has had with the Secretary of State in the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference. The Taoiseach also raised the issues with the Prime Minister, Mr. Major, in Moscow and, more recently, in Paris.</P>
      <P>I am aware that for many prisoners in Britain, and their families, the provision for transfer to Northern Ireland is of particular importance.  I have urged the British Government to ensure that the arrangement is operated flexibly, and that as many as possible of those wishing to be transferred are facilitated.  I understand the pressures on families caused by the need to travel long distances, often to isolated locations, for meetings with relatives serving periods of imprisonment.  I understand that over the past year approximately one dozen prisoners have been moved to Northern Ireland, and that in recent weeks a further group have been informed that their requests for transfers have been approved.</P>
      <P>As regards the particular prisoner to whom the Deputy refers, the Department of Foreign Affairs and our Embassy in London have been aware of this case since his arrest in December 1985.  We have since followed the case closely, including the attendance by an Embassy official at the unsuccessful appeal by the prisoner against his conviction in 1988.  The Embassy has continued to monitor closely developments in this case in the period since the prisoner was convicted.  This has included visiting Mr. McLaughlin in prison.  Following these contacts a number of issues of a consular nature were raised by the Embassy with the Home Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among the issues raised was Mr. McLoughlin's wish to be transferred to a prison in Northern Ireland, nearer his home.  Following these representations <Col N="1101" /> Mr. McLoughlin was given, in September 1994, a temporary transfer to Maghaberry Prison in Northern Ireland. Because of its classification as a temporary transfer, Mr. McLaughlin's transfer is subject to renewal.  The British authorities have continued to renew his transfer, and Mr. McLaughlin has remained at Maghaberry in the intervening period.</P>
    <P>I am aware that notwithstanding the renewal of Mr. McLaughlin's transfer he has expressed the wish that his transfer should be made permanent.  We have consistently indicated to the British authorities our wish that all transfers to Northern Ireland, such as that of Mr. McLaughlin, should be put on a permanent footing, and that any legislative changes necessary to give this effect should be made.  We will continue to make this point to the British authorities. In this regard we welcome the fact that a number of recent transfers have been classified as permanent.</P>
    <P>On the question of transfers, the House will be aware that the Bill to permit ratification by this country of the Convention for the Transfer of Sentenced Persons is under consideration by the Dáil, and will hopefully be adopted shortly.  When enacted we will move quickly, as promised in the Government's programme, to put in place arrangements for the transfer of prisoners to this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The House can be assured that the Government is fully aware of the need for sensitive handling of the prisons issue.  The Taoiseach and Tánaiste have identified prisons as among the critical issues on which we must make progress as we seek to advance the peace process. The Deputy can take it therefore that the Government will continue to follow closely developments in this area, including the transfer issue, and to ensure that they receive careful attention in our continuing discussions with the British Government.</P>
    <P>The points made by the Deputy about the prisoner's family having heard nothing about the case and her request that the Embassy contact the Home <Col N="1102" /> Secretary and that Scotland Yard make available the new evidence are reasonable and I will take them up with the Tánaiste and the Department.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Nuclear Testing in the South Pacific.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter.  I have been shocked and appalled by President Chirac's brutal and uncomprising announcement that France intends to carry out eight nuclear tests on the Mururoa Atoll in the South Pacific between now and the end of May next year.  My sense of shock and outrage at this is shared by the leaders of all the party groups on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and by other members of the committee and Houses of the Oireachtas to whom I have spoken today.  President Chirac's announcement that France will sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty next autumn after the completion of this series of tests is utterly cynical and provocative. It amounts to a clear statement that France believes in a test ban treaty only in circumstances where that treaty has no real relevance to French policy.  This will seriously damage the prospects of an early test ban.</P>
      <P>This French move, coupled with the recent nuclear test by the People's Republic of China will exacerbate the difficulties facing us not only in relation to nuclear non-proliferation, but also in relation to nuclear disarmament.  So far France has reportedly manufactured 800 nuclear warheads, 500 of which are currently deployed.  The only point of the current series of tests can be to modernise and fortify its arsenal, if not, to increase it.  I fear we will see an increase in tension on issues connected with nuclear armaments.  That fear was strengthened today during a conversation I had with a diplomatic representative of a nuclear-equipped State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This appalling French decision clearly highlights the grave disadvantages flowing from the fact that the European Union does not have the same solid <Col N="1103" /> treaty basis for a common foreign and security policy as it has for, say, its agricultural policy.  Even with the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty, European Union action in the security field is purely intergovernmental.  That means that other member states of the European Union have no treaty policy lever to exert on the French on this issue.  I should point out also that since the French nuclear deterrent-nuclear capability is not subject to NATO influence, the NATO partners have no lever to bring to bear on this situation either.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what many of our anti-European Union Cassandras claim, greater political cohesion, particularly in the area of foreign and security policy, would give us the means, or more ample means, of curbing the type of nationalistic adventurism in which the French are now indulging to the detriment of the security interests of Europe and the world.  Stronger political cohesion could give us a more effective means to end the ruthless exploitation of the people and natural resources of the South Pacific and the cavalier treatment of the people of Australia and New Zealand.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to protest in the strongest possible terms to the French Government against this monstrous decision.  I ask the Government to make it clear that it will protest and keep doing so and not accept the arrogant French assertion that this decision is irrevocable.  I do not believe that can be accepted in today's world.</P>
    <P>By the same token I take this opportunity to ask Fianna Fáil to take action. The Fianna Fáil spokesman on Foreign Affairs, Deputy Burke, who is present has been very forthright in recent months in his condemnation of nuclear power in all its guises.  I would like to know whether he will now exert himself in the context of his party's curious relationship with President Chirac's to have this obnoxious decision reversed. Whatever means of pressure can be brought to bear should be used by our Government and our political system. This decision has cast the most serious <Col N="1104" /> gloom over efforts I know we all support, irrespective of our political affiliations, to rid the world of the threat of nuclear disaster.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am appalled and disappointed by the decision of the French Government.  Regarding the Government's response, I advise the Deputy that the Tánaiste issued a statement today criticising in strong terms the French Government's decision to resume nuclear testing.  The French Ambassador was received in the Taoiseach's Department today by an official who, conveyed his deep concern and seach, conveyed his deep concern and that of the Government about this matter to the French authorities.</P>
      <P>Last night's announcement of the decision of the French Government to resume nuclear testing has given rise to considerable international concern, especially on the part of countries of the Pacific region.  Statements of regret and disappointment have been issued by a large number of countries including, in addition to Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Canada, Japan, Sweden and Denmark.</P>
      <P>The Government has already expressed its deep concern at the announcement that France intends to resume nuclear testing later this year.  In his statement today, the Tánaiste said that the decision would be viewed as a setback to the efforts to bring about an early and complete ban on nuclear testing.</P>
      <P>The decisions of France and China to continue nuclear testing could have serious implications for the ongoing efforts to bring about early agreement on such a ban&mdash;implications whose full extent cannot be foreseen at this point.</P>
      <P>The Government's concern on this issue has, as I have said, been made known to the French authorities today. For their part, the French authorities have given an assurance that France remains fully committed to signing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in late 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier, the Government's concern at <Col N="1105" /> the nuclear test explosion carried out by the People's Republic of China on 15 May was expressed in a statement made by the Tánaiste on the following day, as well, as in his subsequent reply to questions on the issue in Dáil Éireann on 23 May.</P>
    <P>At the recent NPT Review and Extension Conference in New York, the nuclear powers undertook to conclude a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty no later than 1996.  The conference called on the nuclear weapon states, pending the entry into force of a comprehensive treaty, to exercise, &ldquo;utmost restraint&rdquo;. The resumption of nuclear testing is, therefore, not in keeping with the outcome of the NPT conference.  It is particularly disappointing that two nuclear powers, France and China, have decided to continue testing at this time.</P>
    <P>In his statement of 18 April to the NPT conference, the Tánaiste stated that the moratoria on nuclear testing introduced by the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom and France should continue in force pending the conclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty; and he called on China to introduce a similar ban.  In his Dáil reply of 23 May, and again in his statement of 7 June on the Estimates for his Department at the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Tánaiste reiterated his hope that a unilateral ban would be maintained.</P>
    <P>The approach of the Government to nuclear weapons issues was set out in a resolution on the NPT adopted by Dáil Éireann on 22 March and also in the Tánaiste's statement at the beginning of the NPT conference on 18 April.  Central to this approach is the Government's wish to see: the complete abolition of nuclear weapons and concrete steps taken to this end; an end to the testing of nuclear weapons, everywhere, for all time; and an end to the production and stockpiling of materials, particularly plutonium, for use in the manufacture of nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>The Government also wants to see the environmental, health and safety <Col N="1106" /> issues associated with the nuclear industry effectively addressed.</P>
    <P>As the Tánaiste reported to the Dáil on 23 May, the results of the conference corresponded closely with Ireland's objectives.  On 11 May, the states which were party to the NPT agreed without a vote to extend the treaty indefinitely, to strengthen the process for review of implementation and, importantly, they also agreed a set of principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.  This document identified three specific measures as a programme of action for the implementation of Article VI of the Treaty which concerns nuclear disarmament.  These measures were: completion, no later than 1996, of a universal, internationally and effectively verifiable Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  It was stated that pending the entry into force of such a treaty, the nuclear weapon states should exercise utmost restraint; immediate commencement, and early conclusion, of negotiations for a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive devices; and the determined pursuit by the nuclear weapon states of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally, with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons.</P>
    <P>The Government attach great importance to the fact that all parties to the NPT, particularly the nuclear weapon states, reaffirmed their commitment, for all time, to prevent nuclear proliferation and to work on a programme of action for nuclear disarmament with the ultimate goal of a world free of nuclear weapons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is nonsense when the Chinese and the French are ignoring it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Far from legitimising the possession of nuclear weapons, the indefinite extension of the treaty placed a continuing obligation on the nuclear weapon states to pursue nuclear disarmament. The Government is determined that the nuclear weapon states <Col N="1107" /> will have to answer for their performance in respect of these measures at each future five year review.  It will use the enhanced review arrangements, beginning with the preparatory meeting in 1997 for the review conference of the year 2000, to see that the nuclear weapon states are held to their commitments. Despite the discouraging setback represented by the continuation of nuclear testing, they hope that a comprehensive treaty will be in place when those preparations begin.  The early achievement of a total ban on nuclear testing in all environments forever remains a priority of the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for allowing me raise this matter on the Adjournment but it is regrettable I have to raise it in this manner.  The action of the Minister in lodging a formal objection with An Bord Pleanála is unprecedented in the history of the State.  The Minister has objected to a decision taken by a Government of which he was a member and which is supported by this Government.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry made great play of the Masonite project by visiting Carrick-on-Shannon on his first <Col N="1108" /> day in office to announce its establishment, despite the fact that he was the beneficiary of actions taken by previous Ministers and the previous Government of which the Minister, Deputy Higgins, was a member.</P>
      <P>Why did the Minister object to this project?  Who advised him to do so and why did his Department not clarify the matters he claims are important when the Office of Public Works, the prescribed body, was formally notified by Leitrim County Council when the planning application was lodged?  Why did he wait until ten minutes before the closing time for lodging objections to lodge his appeal?  Did he know what he was doing or did someone advise him badly in regard to the logic of lodging such an appeal.</P>
      <P>This appeal has caused serious damage to Forbairt, IDA Ireland and other promotional organisations of the State. Two weeks ago Members went to the Washington Conference to encourage American industry to locate here.  We used Masonite as an example of a major project that would be based in the Border regions, the focus of that conference. I am sure the Minister is well aware of the shock we experienced on Monday last when we discovered the Minister had lodged a formal appeal to An Bord Pleanála in regard to the project. He stated his main concern was the visual impact the project would have on adjacent amenities.  Did he read the conditions Leitrim County Council put in the planning application?  Did he read the formal conditions concerning landscaping and the preservation of adjacent amenities?  I do not believe he did.  If he had he would not have lodged an objection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The project would create 330 direct and approximately 150 indirect jobs in the area, the equivalent of at least 5,000 in Dublin.  We are talking about an area in great need of investment.  If this plant does not proceed there will be adverse effects for the sawmilling industry in the west.  The plant would be strategically located.  It would be adjacent to the Dublin-Sligo railway line and the N4, it <Col N="1109" /> has a sufficient water supply to allow effective operation of its cooling system and it would be located at the hub of the main material suppliers for the plant.</P>
    <P>This opportunity must be grasped by the Government and all those in a position to expedite the matter.  I appeal to the Minister to discuss his concerns with the company.  He should request his officials to examine the way the planning application was processed by Leitrim County Council and to explain why they did not bring the matter to his notice until such a late stage.  Did the Minister inform the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry or the Taoiseach of his intention to lodge a formal appeal?  From the information available to me, I do not believe he did.  When the Taoiseach was informed of the matter by one of my constituency colleagues on Monday morning last he expressed horror and shock that a Minister in Government should decide to object to a project that had full Government backing.</P>
    <P>I am aware the Minister sent officials of his Department to Drumsna to examine the area yesterday.  The Masonite Corporation went to enormous lengths to ensure the project was environmentally friendly and planned to the highest standards and Leitrim County Council did likewise regarding its preparations. If the project was planned for Galway west, would the Minister formally object to it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to deal with this issue.  I support, and have consistently supported, the proposal to provide a fibre-board manufacturing plant in Leitrim. The raw material, conifers, is available in abundance in the region and I welcome the company in question to Ireland in this venture which will enable the added value from tree planting to be generated here, using local materials and creating much needed jobs in the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1110" /> I discussed the suitability of locating a plant in the west on the occasion of a previous decision in a Government of which I was a member which decided to locate a plant in Waterford.  The decision in regard to this plant was taken on 15 December at a Government meeting, a Government of which I was not a member, and on the basis of a memorandum circulated on that day.</P>
    <P>There are other jobs in the region which must be protected and my concern is to maximise the number of jobs in Leitrim by protecting those already in the area by creating new ones.  A sum of £22.6 million was allocated from Structural Funds for waterways development to, among other reasons, tap the great potential for jobs in water tourism.  The people of Leitrim would be ill served by those who suggest they must lose that potential to benefit from others.  It should be our intention to ensure they benefit from both.  An investment of £30 million has already been made in the restoration of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell Canal, what is now called the Shannon-Erne Waterway.  There were 11,000 boat passages in 1994 through Albert Lock, adjacent to the site of the proposed plant.</P>
    <P>The information available to Leitrim County Council did not show perspectives from the Albert Lock, from the Drumsna berth, from the railway bridge at Lough Tap, or at any place in between.  This is one of the deficiencies involved in discussing questions about the visual amenity.</P>
    <P>I do not see the problem as representing competition between existing and potential jobs in relation to the waterways.  For example, it is not a case of waterways versus jobs arising from this plant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>These are not yuppie jobs but real ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Jobs need to be set against each other.  My concern, as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, with responsibility for waterways, is in relation to the possible adverse impact <Col N="1111" /> of the plant on the visual amenity of the waterways.</P>
      <P>In the past there have been objections by the Office of Public Works in relation to monuments, amenities, flora and fauna.  In this case the Office of Public Works would concentrate on the navigational requirements and the requisite water levels.  I am the Minister to whom responsibilities in this area have been transferred and my concern is entirely with the visual amenity on the Shannon.  The architectural advice available to me indicates that the proposed building is of huge proportions which would have a significant visual impact on an area of distinctive drumlin landscape adjacent to the Shannon.</P>
      <P>Far from taking an impetuous decision ten minutes before closing time, that was the best advice available to me from a senior architect of the Office of Public Works.  It was supplied to the waterways division and transmitted to me.</P>
      <P>If the development were to proceed as planned in its present location, it could impact negatively on the amenity of the waterway and on the development of the tourism potential of the Shannon navigation.  For that reason I have requested my officials to garner further information, examples of which I have given, so that I can consider the matter fully, including an assessment of possible short term and long term amelioration measures.</P>
      <P>There are 11 objectors to the proposed plant.  My objection is solely in relation to its possible visual impact.  My concerns can be addressed in the continuing consultations with the developers, by relocation, adjustment, excavation or by screening.  My responsibility and concern is for the integrity of the waterway.  While appreciating the concerns of other objectors, if mine are addressed, my name can be removed from the list of objectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is better that we have the best plant <Col N="1112" /> that will not interfere with existing tourist amenities.  There are 900 tourism-related jobs in this area.  The people of Leitrim would be ill served by anyone contending that these do not matter. Leitrim has the capability of supporting this new plant and of retaining and developing its tourism potential.</P>
    <P>A meeting between my representatives and those of the company, the Masonite Corporation, took place in Dublin this afternoon.  I am satisfied that progress has been made.  Further meetings are scheduled to take place tomorrow and perhaps the following day.  I am hopeful we can reach a solution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for affording me the opportunity to raise this very serious matter. It is a coincidence that, as we discuss the movement of these very dangerous warheads, the French have again threatened to resume nuclear testing in the Pacific. I can assure Deputy Dukes that we have notified our French colleagues, the Gaullists, that we will be voting in the European Parliament tomorrow evening condemning that French decision.  In regard to the reply given by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Joan Burton, the position is that the Government abjectly followed the nuclear lobby without making any attempt to impose conditions on their decision in relation to the renewal of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.</P>

    <P>To come to the business on hand, will the Minister of State say whether the Irish Government received any notification from the British Ministry of Defence of the movement of these six warheads?  Since I brought the matter to the attention of his Department by way of Private Notice Question last week, has his Department made any attempt to ascertain the future policy of the British Ministry of Defence on the <Col N="1113" /> movement of these warheads?  Has there been any contact with them?</P>
    <P>This has very serious long term implications for our people.  These warheads have previously been moved by land from Aldermaston to the Clyde but on this occasion, for the first time, the Trident warheads were moved by ship, on the <i>Kinterberry,</i> which departed Portsmouth on 4 or 5 June and unloaded at Coalport on the Clyde on 7 June.  It is known that the Trident warhead is a very unstable weapon.  The prospect of its moving through the Irish Sea on a British Navy auxiliary ship on a regular basis is too horrendous to contemplate.</P>
    <P>The Government must lodge a very strong protest with the British Government in relation to the movement of these weapons on 5 and 6 June.  It must make it abundantly clear to the British that we are not prepared to accept the movement of these types of warheads through the Irish Sea, with the threat they pose to our people.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Ray Burke for having raised this matter.  I fully share his concern on the movement of nuclear warheads through the Irish Sea.  I understand that no Irish Department of State received notification from the British Government on such a movement from Portsmouth to the Clyde on 6 and 7 June 1995 on a British Navy auxiliary ship, nor was the Irish marine emergency service, which comes under the aegis of my Department, notified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United Kingdom authorities have been notified that recent reports on the movement of nuclear warheads by the military through the Irish Sea are a matter of serious public concern in Ireland, that such movements present difficulties on a number of fronts and that the Irish Government will be pursuing the matter further.  The initial response from the United Kingdom authorities is that they no longer deploy nuclear weapons on board Her Majesty's ships but that such weapons may be transported by sea.  Furthermore, <Col N="1114" /> they state that shipments do not take place outside United Kingdom territorial waters, that safety is of paramount importance whenever nuclear weapons are involved and that it is long-standing policy of the United Kingdom Government neither to confirm nor deny the presence of nuclear weapons at particular times and locations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am alarmed at reports of the movement of nuclear warheads through the Irish Sea.  My concerns are threefold.  The transport of such materials through the Irish Sea, a narrow semi-enclosed sea with densely populated areas in its environs, poses a threat to the safety of people living in these areas and to the marine environment generally.  The extent and nature of the risks posed by such transport demand advance notification of the transition of ships carrying nuclear warheads or other hazardous materials so that &ldquo;early warning&rdquo; systems can be put in place to deal with possible marine emergencies in the event of an accident or collision.  The increasing traffic in the Irish Sea shipping lane is also a concern because of the increased possibility of accidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pursuing a policy aimed at making the Irish Sea a nuclear free sea.  The following are the steps I am taking in pursuance of this policy.  In keeping with the objective to ensure the highest standards of safety of life at sea, safety of navigation and protection of the marine environment, the Department of the Marine has been participating actively in ongoing discussions on these topics at international level.  Concerns of small island developing states and other coastal states worldwide with regard to the transportation of nuclear materials between Japan and the UK and France led to the adoption in 1993 of the International Maritime Organisation <i>Code for the Safe Carriage of Irradiated Nuclear Fuel, Plutonium and High-Level Radioactive Wastes in Flasks on Board Ships,</i> the INF code, as it is <Col N="1115" /> called.  This code regulates the construction, equipping and operation of ships engaged in the carriage of such substances.</P>
    <P>We have consistently argued that the following additional complementary measures must be incorporated in the code: decisive route planning and notification and consultation with all coastal states while in transit; the restriction and exclusion of certain routes; an emergency response plan in the voyage plan in respect of the ship and cargo; and a compulsory requirement to salvage radioactive material and predetermination of responsibility for this in the voyage plan.</P>
    <P>Our efforts in this respect, for which we have support from other small coastal states, will continue.  The subject is on the agenda of the upcoming meeting of the Marine Environmental Protection Committee, a sub-committee of the International Maritime Organisation.</P>
    <P>We are also pushing to have the INF code incorporated into two EU directives dealing with reporting arrangements for ships visiting Community ports or transiting Community waters. This would at least ensure that all types of radioactive or nuclear materials being carried on ships would have to be notified in advance and would allow for &ldquo;early warning&rdquo; systems to be put in place.</P>
    <P>More recently, the Department of the Marine participated in International Maritime Organisation discussions on the introduction of mandatory reporting and ships' routing systems for vessels carrying hazardous cargoes.  The former will come into force internationally on 1 January 1996; the latter on 1 January <Col N="1116" /> 1997.  Under the ships' routing provisions, special routes could be prescribed for ships carrying INF code fuels or &ldquo;areas to be avoided&rdquo; by such ships could be created.  At present, such systems are only recommended.  States wishing to declare a routing system will have to be in full compliance with guidelines, criteria and regulations to be drawn up by the International Maritime Organisation and have their proposals formally adopted by that organisation. It is my intention to seek a mandatory routing system which would exclude the transport of nuclear materials through the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>Warships, naval auxiliaries or other ships owned and operated by a state and used solely on that state's non-commercial service are normally exempt from international conventions regulating marine transport, maritime safety and protection of the marine environment. However, contracting states to those conventions are asked to ensure that exempted ships act in a manner consistent, as far as is reasonable and practicable, with the international conventions. Warships are to be encouraged to participate in ships' routing systems adopted in accordance with International Maritime Organisation procedures.</P>
    <P>Under existing international law, warships have a right of innocent passage without notification through the territorial waters of any state.  Entry of foreign warships into Irish ports is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  As the Deputy knows it is Government policy to refuse entry if the vessel is carrying nuclear weapons or the visit is part of a naval exercise.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.50 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 15 June 1995.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>Among the major strengths which characterise Irish tourism is our clean physical environment.  However, in Bord Fáilte's annual survey of visitors' impressions of Ireland, a significant minority comment adversely on litter.  I am concerned, therefore, that litter should not be allowed to detract from our visitors' enjoyment and appreciation of our countryside, cities, towns and villages.  The litter problem is in the first instance a matter for my colleague the Minister for the Environment who has already indicated that he intends to develop a sustained and effective anti-litter initiative.  Local authorities which have statutory responsibility for the prevention and control of litter will occupy a pivotal role in the implementation of this initiative.</P>
      <P>A clean environment is in all our best interests, both from a broad national and a tourism viewpoint.  I am strongly supportive of the planned anti-litter initiative and I look forward to the policy statement in the matter which the Minister for the Environment will shortly publish.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Tourism and Trade, I do not have any statutory authority to restrict the importation of newspapers into Ireland from Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is a part of the European Union Single Market, within which <Col N="856" /> goods and services move freely.  Member states may not restrict the movement of goods within the Union, except on the grounds specified in Article 36 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.  Restrictions under Article 36 are only possible on narrow grounds such as the protection of health and public morality.  Any unilateral action by the Government to restrict the importation of newspapers into Ireland from Britain or elsewhere on the grounds of &ldquo;dumping&rdquo; would be illegal and would inevitably lead to infringement procedures being taken against the State by the EU Commission.</P>
    <P>Action to counter alleged anti-competitive behaviour may be instituted under Articles 85 and 86 of the EU Treaty by the EU Commission.  I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, has already advised the National Newspapers of Ireland that, if they are of the opinion that the pricing of UK newspapers sold in Ireland constitutes anti-competitive behaviour, they are free to make a complaint to the EU Commission.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 50, 70, 73, 156, 182, 184 and 185 together.</P>
      <P>The Uruguay Round of trade negotiations concluded in December 1993. The resulting agreement came into effect on 1 January 1995.  The tariff reductions agreed during the Round are to be implemented, for the most part, in annual reductions over five years. Longer periods of up to ten years apply in the case of a limited range of products, such as agriculture and textiles.</P>
      <P>In Ireland's case, the tariff reductions are implemented at EU level by means of changes in the Common Customs Tariff and the first of the scheduled reductions took place on 1 January 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a small country dependent on trade, Ireland has consistently supported trade liberalisation on a multilateral basis, while ensuring that the special needs of sensitive sectors like agriculture and textiles are fully taken into account.  I believe that the successful completion of the Uruguay Round will boost investment confidence and economic growth in all markets, including the European Single Market, while <Col N="859" /> at the same time providing a stable basis for trade and a reduction in trade disputes. These factors, coupled with the general reduction in tariffs and other obstacles to trade world-wide, will open new opportunities for our exporters.</P>
    <P>Last November, my Department published and distributed a booklet which explained the main effects of the Uruguay Round in Ireland.  The booklet was launched at a seminar which was organised in conjunction with IBEC and addressed by the then Director-General of GATT, Peter Sutherland.  An Bord Tráchtála, in its day-to-day contacts with exporters, continues to emphasise the new opportunities that a more open international trading environment has brought.</P>
    <P>Ireland, effectively, participates in the World Trade Organisations as a member of the European Union, the single biggest trading bloc in the world.  The EU is represented by the Commission, negotiating in accordance with guidelines laid down by the Council of Ministers. I and my Department ensure that our particular trade interests are fully reflected in the common EU position put forward by the Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 28, 35, 52, 191, 192, 196 and 202 together.</P>
      <P>As the House will be already aware, the role of my Department is to determine tourism policy, to set targets for the industry and the State agencies under my aegis, to monitor and review results, to oversee the tourist traffic legislation and to champion the tourism industry at Government level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, the role of Bord <Col N="861" /> Fáilte, as defined in the recent Arthur D. Little consultancy review, is to assist in the implementation of Government policy by marketing and promoting Ireland abroad as a tourist destination, helping the less mature elements of the Irish tourism industry to develop and provide marketing information to Government and industry decision makers. The Tourist Traffic Bill, 1995, which was published at the beginning of June, is designed to enable Bord Fáilte Éireann to delegate to a contractor the majority of its accommodation inspection and associated functions and powers under the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1939 to 1987.  The draft Bill does not provide for any change in the existing status of the regional tourism organisations.</P>
    <P>The regional tourism organisations were established by Bord Fáilte in 1963 under section 6 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952.  They are structured as private companies registered under the Companies Acts, limited by guarantee with Memorandum and Article of Association which contain, <i>inter alia,</i> stipulations relating to their management, administration and general business affairs.  The Memorandum of Association for each organisation specifies that it shall operate in accordance with the policies and directions of Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>The core objectives of the regional tourism organisations are: to encourage and promote the development of tourist traffic; to achieve the regional targets for tourism growth in line with national objectives for increased visitor numbers, foreign revenue and employment; to organise the tourism industry in the regions in order to co-ordinate and improve marketing and development activity, and to carry out activities devolved by Bord Fáilte in the area of visitor services, product development and marketing.  The 1995 visitor servicing activities of the organisations will include the operation of 77 tourist information offices which are expected to deal with over 2.6 million personal callers and in excess of one million phone and postal inquiries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> The regional tourism organisations derive their income from a variety of sources namely Bord Fáilte, local authorities, membership subscriptions and commercial revenue generating activities which includes the sale of tourist literature.  Their forecasted operational funding for 1995 is £5.4 million which includes a provision by Bord Fáilte from its grant-in-aid of £1.7 million.  In addition to the normal Bord Fáilte subvention a further £50,000 has been allocated, on a once-off basis, to the county tourism committees which will be funded jointly by Bord Fáilte and from Subhead B3 of my Department's Vote on the understanding that an equivalent sum will be matched by the trade.  The relevant funds will be disbursed through Bord Fáilte and will enable the committees, which were established following the reform of the RTO corporate structures in 1994 to undertake local marketing and promotional activities which are directed at festivals and other events, visitor attractions and special interest activities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 179 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="863" /> Developments in information technology have provided new and real opportunities for exporters seeking success in the global marketplace.  Television shopping, for example, is extremely beneficial for exporters, especially smaller companies, because it allows them to reach an audience which would otherwise be beyond their means.</P>
    <P>For the past number of years, An Bord Tráchtála has been working with QVC, a major home-shopping channel in the US, to develop market opportunities for Irish companies.  QVC have two dedicated &ldquo;Irish Days&rdquo; annually, to coincide with St. Patrick's Day and the Rose of Tralee Festival.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Internet specifically, An Bord Tráchtála is currently examining market opportunities for Irish companies in the Worldwide Web (WWW). As the Deputy may be aware, a number of Irish companies have acknowledged the importance of the Internet as a marketing tool and are using it to promote their products, especially in the quality Irish giftware sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 53 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is certainly my intention that every opportunity should be availed of to capitalise on the potential benefits for tourism arising from the peace process <Col N="864" /> and related developments such as the recent visit of Prince Charles, which attracted very favourable coverage in the British media.</P>
    <P>A special all-Ireland campaign is already under way in Britain as part of the £6.3 million Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative (OTMI), which is also targeting France, Germany and the US. The OTMI, which is co-funded by the Exchequer, the Irish tourism industry, North and South, and the European Union is an industry-led consumer marketing campaign which is designed to complement the activities of Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.  In Britain the initiative involves an additional £2 million spend on consumer advertising on TV and in newspapers which highlights the island of Ireland as an attractive holiday destination for British visitors.</P>
    <P>In addition, I have also provided an extra £1 million to Bord Fáilte, over and above their normal allocation, to give an additional boost to their marketing and promotional efforts in a number of countries.  Some £250,000 of this extra funding is to be spent on a wide range of additional promotional activity in Britain in co-operation with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.</P>
    <P>The peace process has undoubtedly given an extra boost to the promotion of Ireland in the British market with a recent study commissioned by Bord Fáilte indicating the potential for a 19 per cent increase in British holiday-makers this year.  British visitors in January-March of this year increased by almost 13 per cent on the same period in 1994 and I hope that many more British people will follow the Prince's example and visit Ireland in 1995.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24, 57, 170 and 203 together.</P>
      <P>I recognise, as outlined in the Operational Programme for Tourism, that there are certain gaps in the tourism infrastructure available in Ireland. Measures to address these, including the provision of large integrated projects, weather, independent facilities and interpretative centres capable of attracting over 75,000 visitors, have been identified in the programme.  I am satisfied that these measures are well thought-out and will contribute substantially to the enhancement of the visitor's experience in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development have been charged with the implementation of these measures, and a number of unique projects of scale are being evaluated at present.  These will be considered by the relevant management boards.  Where such a project is estimated to cost in excess of £20 million, agreement of the Government and the EU Commission on foot of a cost-benefit analysis conducted in accordance with Community law will also be necessary.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 78, 151 and 159 together.</P>
      <P>Independent product development and marketing management boards were established at the end of October last year to decide on individual applications for EU grant assistance under the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999.  The boards comprise two relevant agency personnel, one official from my Department and three independent business professional members.  The format of the boards thus brings broad practical business and professional experience to the decision making process to augment the tourism-related expertise of the tourism agencies.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the combination of expertise from the private and public sectors benefits the overall decision making process and the quality of the investment itself.  I am also satisfied that all of members of the boards are fully qualified for the task involved and are aware of the importance of their work.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these boards are working well.  Each of the three boards has been meeting at regular monthly intervals and EU grant aid of over £14.3 million towards the development of tourism projects costing in excess of £39 million has been approved by them to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received a very small number of complaints &mdash; no more than a half dozen &mdash; about delay in dealing with applications, but on inquiry it transpired that they arose mainly from the late publication of the operational programme in September 1994 and the <Col N="868" /> backlog of applications that naturally followed.</P>

      <P>The figures released recently by the Central Statistics Office indicate that the number of overseas visitors to Ireland in the period January to March of this year was 615,000, which represents an increase of 16.7 per cent over the same period in 1994.  This impressive performance is in line with the growth anticipated in all our principal markets and indicates that 1995 will be one of the best years ever in terms of overseas visitor numbers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 161 together.</P>
      <P>The emergence of the British economy from recession in 1994 has led to a significant rise in business confidence. An Bord Tráchtála has a comprehensive programme in place to develop Irish Trade to Britain, particularly for indigenous industry.  An Bord Tráchtála is targeting a 17 per cent increase, to £1.67 billion, in non-food indigenous exports to Britain in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to existing programmes <Col N="870" /> for the British market, An Bord Tráchtála is undertaking a number of new initiatives in the UK in 1995.  A programme of market research, buyer presentations and buyer conferences will exploit the growing environmental market. In anticipation of a likely return to growth in 1995 in the British softwear market, the board is also aggressively promoting Irish softwear expertise into this sector.  As the UK is the primary export market for first time exporters, a new exporter programme has been specifically designed to assist these companies in UK market entry.</P>
    <P>Finally the contract clothing sector and Japanese original equipment manufacturers manufacturing in Britain have been targeted for subcontracting opportunities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 174 together.</P>
      <P>Marketing of Irish tourism products and services has been identified as a crucial area for development under the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-95.  There is a range of supports available through programmes administered by CERT and by Bord Fáilte to assist tourism enterprises improve and expand their marketing skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CERT is generally responsible for the provision of tourism training for Irish industry.  As part of its strategy to improve market competitiveness. CERT has devised a wide range of initiatives to assist Irish business develop marketing expertise, including <Col N="871" /> short intensive industry-based marketing programmes, formal national certificate programmes, national seminars, and advisory and consultancy services which are provided directly to the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte also has a significant part to play in this process.  Following the ADL review of the organisation, it will now focus much of its energy and resources on marketing Ireland abroad. It will champion the emergence of a strong marketing ethos from within the sector.  At a technical level, it already operates a marketing graduate scheme and a professional marketing support, consultancy, scheme, both of which are funded under the European Regional Development Funds.</P>
    <P>Under the marketing graduate scheme Bord Fáilte sponsors the placement of marketing graduates in incoming tourism enterprises.  The scheme has been running for a number of years and to date approximately 80 graduates have been placed.  Under the professional consultancy scheme tourism enterprises are encouraged to enhance their marketing and sales expertise by retaining professional marketing consultants over a 12 month period to assist the enterprise put together and implement new strategic marketing plans and programmes.</P>

In addition, we will continue to exploit many of the other fast growing markets which are small at present but which afford growth opportunities. These would include the emerging economies of Poland, Hungary, Czech Republic, China and certain of the Latin American countries.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 167 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Industrial Development, 1994-99, launched early this year, includes a specific sub-programme for market <Col N="874" /> development.  The targets in the sub-programme are to increase indigenous exports by an average of 9 per cent per annum over the six year period of the programme and to increase market share in EU countries by up to 25 per cent, whilst also expanding market share outside the EU.  In order to help Irish firms achieve these objectives, assistance will be provided under three complementary measures encompassing the provision of information on market opportunities and financial assistance.</P>
    <P>ABT in targeting an overall 17 per cent increase this year, including a particularly intensive campaign to encourage exporters to seize new business opportunities emerging in the enlarged EU single European market, under the banner &ldquo;Opportunity Europe&rdquo;.  This will involve a dual strategy of supporting the 800-plus Irish companies at present selling in continental Europe and encouraging Irish exporters who have already been successful in Britain to expand into other European markets.</P>
    <P>There will also be special emphasis in 1995 on encouraging companies to identify opportunities in the Northern Ireland market, some details of which are being provided in a reply to another question today.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39, 44, 68, 178, 180 and 187 together.</P>
      <P>The high level of co-operation which already exists between State agencies on both sides of the Border has resulted in the development of exciting initiatives, designed to assist companies throughout the island to take advantage of the new opportunities which are emerging since the cessation of violence.</P>
      <P>An Bord Tráchtála, the agency for which I have responsibility, is working closely with its Northern counterparts, the Industrial Development Board and the Local Enterprise Development Unit in organising programmes and events with the twin objectives of developing North-South trade and bringing companies from all over the island together to create a stronger impact in overseas markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only last month, I attended one of many such co-operative events promoting Irish products abroad &mdash; the &ldquo;Look is Ireland&rdquo; promotion which took place <Col N="876" /> in Boston.  The focus of this joint initiative was to promote Irish fashion in the North American market.  This is just one example of ongoing joint promotional activities which are advancing a positive image of Irish products, particularly throughout the UK and Europe.</P>
    <P>With regard to co-operative activities relating specifically to public sector contracts, a major conference organised by ABT, in association with the IDB and the British Department of Trade and Industry is due to take place in Dublin later this month.  The aim of this conference is to facilitate and encourage linkages between northern and southern companies in pursuing major public sector contracts in partnership.  Also, ABT's Public Procurement Intelligence service, available on Minitel, can be accessed by companies North and South, and offers information on public procurement tenders throughout the island of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Northern Ireland market has been identified as a particularly important market for southern exporters and ABT is actively encouraging companies which have neglected it in the past to explore and develop its largely untapped potential.  ABT recently published a very comprehensive market profile on Northern Ireland. This is in a user-friendly format and should be particularly useful to southern firms which are unfamiliar with the marketing environment in the North.</P>
    <P>In the coming weeks, I will be launching a series of 15 market reports published by ABT and the IDB.  The reports cover all the major market and product sectors of interest to companies on both sides of the Border.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 177 together.</P>
      <P>An Bord Tráchtála does not provide direct grant assistance to indigenous exporters targeting the Northern Ireland market on the basis that the island of Ireland should be treated as one entity from a marketing perspective, exporters are free to avail themselves of the wide range of other services which An Bord Tráchtála has on offer.</P>
      <P>For instance, in addition to the heavily subsidised market research which An Bord Tráchtála carries out for companies targeting the Northern market, they have recently published a very comprehensive market profile on Northern Ireland.  This is in a user-friendly format and should be particularly useful to those firms which are unfamiliar with the marketing environment in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the coming weeks, I also intend to launch a major new cross-Border market information initiative &mdash; a series <Col N="878" /> of guides to 15 different consumer products sectors, published by An Bord Tráchtála and the Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland.  These guides are very comprehensive and relate to the entire island of Ireland and, will be of benefit to companies on both sides of the Border.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 58, 175 and 176 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has prepared a strategy statement which describes its purpose as a Department and what it is trying to achieve in its work.  The Department's overall mission is: to optimise Ireland's earnings from trade and tourism thereby increasing employment and wealth creation in Ireland.</P>
      <P>The mission statement is supported by trade, tourism and corporate objectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The trade objective is to increase sales of Irish goods and services and particularly to increase exports from indigenous business by 50 per cent in real terms by 1999.  On the tourism side, the Department's objective is: to maximise revenue and employment from the development of a sustainable tourism industry, and, in particular, to achieve a growth of 25 per cent in real terms (over 1993 levels) in foreign tourism revenue <Col N="880" /> by 1996 and 50 per cent by 1999 thereby creating an extra 35,000 jobs in the economy.  Both the tourism and trade objectives are complemented by a corporate objective which is to ensure that the Department meets, to the highest standard possible, the requirements of the Oireachtas, the Government, the Minister and the public.</P>
    <P>Our mission statements and objectives are underpinned by a series of activities and key tasks, which have been identified as crucial to the attainment of our goals.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48, 69, 153 and 190 together.</P>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999 which was agreed between my Department and the EU Commission contains a number of provisions for the development and co-ordination of cultural tourism and tourism angling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These include: (i) the Natural/ Cultural Tourism Sub-Programme which is administered by the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and the Office of Public Works as appropriate; (ii) the Product Development Sub-Programme which assists the development of tourism products of a cultural interest to visitors to Ireland. These include the development of heritage towns, interpretative centres highlighting the results of modern research on the origins of Ireland and on the lifestyles of Irish people and the improvement and presentation of tourist facilities at great houses, historical buildings and stately homes.  This measure is administered by Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development; (iii) in addition, the tourism angling measure will ensure that our coarse and game angling resources are upgraded to the best international standards.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 54 and 188 together.</P>
      <P>The Far East is one of the world's fastest growing markets and is expected to yield substantial tourism and travel business in the years ahead.  Japan currently offers the best potential for Ireland and Bord Fáilte, in co-operation with Aer Lingus, is actively working the market through one of Japan's leading tour wholesalers.  An additional £100,000 was made available to Bord Fáilte through my Department's tourism promotion and development fund for extra promotion of Ireland in this market in 1994.  As a result some 22,000 Japanese visited Ireland last year &mdash; an increase of 22 per cent on 1993 and over 100 per cent on 1991 when we had some 10,000 Japanese visitors.  I have again allocated an additional £100,000 to this market in 1995 with a target of an extra 5,000 Japanese visitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Korea, Malaysia and Indonesia are at present much less developed markets than Japan.  It is estimated, for example, that Britain attracts only some 25,000 Korean visitors per annum.  Bord Fáilte does not maintain a promotional presence in these countries because the existing level of business would not justify the high costs involved.  Nevertheless, in view of their potential for future <Col N="884" /> business, close contact is being maintained with tour operators and publicity and media contacts there.</P>
    <P>Improving access to Ireland will continue to be a key issue in developing the potential of the Far East markets.  Common-rating agreements, where for example visitors can fly from Singapore to Dublin for the same fare as Singapore-London, are a valuable marketing tool in long-haul markets and Aer Lingus currently has agreements in place with Japan, Australia and New Zealand.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 189 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Golf has become one of the fastest growing outdoor activities in Ireland over the past number of years.  In this <Col N="886" /> context the development and promotion of golf tourism has been a major product success and this has resulted in an increasing number of overseas holiday-makers playing golf in Ireland.  Numbers have risen from 95,000 in 1989 to over 170,000 in 1994.</P>
    <P>Because of the unprecedented investment in our golfing product since 1989 Ireland now has a considerable number of golf courses.  Accordingly, under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999, only a small amount of funds are being made available, on an exceptional basis, to assist the development of a limited number of new championship courses in remote areas where they could become the catalyst to encourage tourism development.  The provision or improvement of visitor and learner facilities in Bord Fáilte branded courses, which have not received assistance for such improvements under the last operational programme, will also be supported.</P>
    <P>The emphasis now is on attracting more golfing visitors to Ireland through marketing the superb asset that has been created on the basis of quality, value for money, accessibility, and a friendly welcome.  Bord Fáilte has in place an extensive calendar of promotions and advertising in our three major markets through for example, exposure on international media, campaigns placed in international golfing publications, and posters advertising Ireland's golfing product in international markets.  I have also, in order to maximise key TV publicity, allocated funds through Bord Fáilte to support a number of major televised events, such as the Guardian Irish Holidays Open, which I announced yesterday.  This will ensure that Ireland's superb golf product is kept before world audiences.  The value of such international exposure is immense as regards attracting golfing visitors to Ireland, and all of these efforts together should ensure that golf tourism will continue to flourish in the future.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will know, co-operation between Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board has been ongoing, with success, for many years.  The peace process has opened up huge new windows of opportunity linked with a trouble-free island of Ireland and I am delighted to say that the promotion of the island of Ireland concept is already well advanced.</P>
      <P>The £6.3 million overseas tourism marketing initiative, a private sector led consumer marketing campaign, promotes the island of Ireland as a single destination in our four most important markets, namely the US, Britain, Germany and France.  For the first time, the tourism industry on both sides of the Border, together with Bord Fáilte and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, under the chairmanship of my Department, are participating in the initiative and are selling the island of Ireland as an attractive holiday destination.</P>
      <P>Another recent example of the excellent collaboration which now exists is the unified approach by my Department and the Northern Ireland Department of Economic Development, by the two tourist boards and by industry North and South, at the Washington conference. My Department and the Department of Economic Development, in co-operation with the two tourist boards and the US Department of Commerce, are currently considering ways to progress the Joint Tourism Communiqué which I signed at that conference.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 154 together.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for directional signposting rests with the Minister for the Environment.  However, signposting, both directional and tourist amenity related, is of the utmost importance to tourism.  A good signposting service adds to the safety and interest of a visitor's stay in this country.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to acknowledge, therefore, that there has been a steady improvement in the provision of directional information signposting on primary, national and regional routes.  Furthermore, with the introduction of the National Roads Authority, the continued improvement of signposting on primary and secondary national routes will remain a priority.</P>
      <P>To enhance tourist signposting, a distinctive brown and white tourist sign system has been introduced and the provision of these signs is ongoing; 41 named touring routes have been signposted completely or in part.  Provision for this form of amenity signposting is made under the Tourism Operational Programme and the Product Management Board recently approved a £1.5 million five year national tourist signposting programme to signpost a further series of touring routes in the period 1994-99.  This is an important commitment to ongoing improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that visitors arriving at Dublin Airport and ferryports sometimes experience difficulty in finding access to the main national routes out of the city.  A survey of these routes is now under way involving Bord Fáilte, the Department of the Environment and the local authorities in the Dublin <Col N="890" /> area.  Gaps in signposting will be identified and then remedied.</P>

      <P>A preliminary study commissioned at the end of last year by the National Tourism Council recently reported that potential existed to develop a strong tourism brand which would position an image for Ireland across our main international markets.  The study was an exploratory one but was well received within the council which decided that it now needs to be followed up by a more detailed branding development exercise. This will involve partners in our principal international markets and comprehensive consumer research to establish the feasibility and consumer appeal of a number of the concepts developed.</P>
      <P>I have asked Bord Fáilte, and specifically its new international marketing director, to progress this project as a matter of urgency.  I expect that Bord Fáilte, the sectorally-based advisory group working with it and the international experts being consulted by them, will be in a position to report to me and to the tourism industry generally this autumn on progress.  Broadly speaking, the strategy is to develop the new brand identity for progressive introduction into all our main markets in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="891" /> I am convinced that our tourism marketeers must adopt best international branding practice to differentiate Ireland from the many competing destinations and products in the international marketplace.

    <P>These are indicative figures only, however, and actual allocations in these years will, of course, depend on the decisions taken by the various management boards which were set-up to consider proposals for support.  In so deciding, the management boards will have regard, <i>inter alia,</i> to the parameters set by the operational programme of the availability of matching finance from both the public and private sectors.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 75 and 201 together.</P>
      <P>CERT, our State tourism training agency, has active and on-going links with the tourism industry representative bodies in Northern Ireland, some of which extend over many years.  These include the Training and Employment Agency, the Tourism and Hospitality Training Council, The Hotel and Catering Association and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board.</P>
      <P>There are a wide range of established cross-Border tourism training activities which have attracted funding from the International Fund for Ireland and the EU INTERREG Programme (1989-1993).</P>
      <P>Examples, involving CERT in association with Northern Ireland industry bodies in 1995, are:</P>
      <P>Customer and Information Skills Programme for twenty tourist Information Officers from both parts of the island.  The programme was run jointly by CERT and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board earlier this year.</P>
      <P>Tourism and Customer Care Programme for persons working in tourism and tourism-related enterprises such as banks, bureaux de change and tourist attractions.  The programme is run in partnership with the Tourism and Hospitality Training Council and it is expected that one hundred participants will take part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Total Quality in Tourism Programme for hotels and other toruism businesses in the Border areas.  The <Col N="894" /> programme is aimed at senior managers to enhance their management competencies, particularly in the area of quality, and is being run in co-operation with the Tourism and Hospitality Training Council.</P>
    <P>In the future, I foresee ever greater opportunities for co-operation in tourism-related training activities, North and South.  Such possibilities will continue to be explored in the ongoing discussions which my Department has with its Northern Ireland equivalent.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 162 together.</P>
      <P>I agree with the conclusions of the consultants in relation to the Gulliver information and reservation system as set out in the Arthur D. Little review of Bord Fáilte.  While the concept behind the system was a good one, in its present form, it has not achieved sufficient acceptance or usage.  Moreover, its operation is not a core function of Bord Fáilte.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the direction of the Bord Fáilte Review Implementation Steering Committee, the Gulliver system has been fundamentally reassessed to see if it can be satisfactorily reconfigured.  Ideally, Bord Fáilte's role should be as information provider and stimulator of systems such as Gulliver and not to continue to support and manage such systems once in operation.  At present, an <Col N="895" /> open-ended consultation process with potential partners, investors and contractors is being undertaken to identify all possibilities for a reconfiguration of the system.  As the Gulliver system is operated jointly by BFE with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, there will, of course, be continued consultation throughout the process with our Northern Ireland counterparts and any final decisions in the matter will be taken jointly.</P>

      <P>INTERREG I was intended to help Border areas prepare for a Community without internal frontiers.  The joint Operational Programme prepared by Ireland and Northern Ireland for the period 1991-93 aimed to assist the Border region overcome its special development problems and to promote the creation and development of networks of cross-Border co-operation in order to maximise growth potential.</P>
      <P>Grant applications were considered by joint North/South working groups representative of the sectoral departments and agencies concerned with the particular area in question.  The working groups reported to the overall INTERREG Monitoring Committee which comprised representatives from the Commission and the two administrations. The chairman of the NorthWest Sub-regional CSF Review Committee was an <i>ex-officio</i> member of the Monitoring Committee representing the interests of the Border counties (the chairman of the new Border Regional Authority is likewise an <i>ex-officio</i> member of the Monitoring Committee under the new programme).</P>
      <P>The independent evaluation carried out on behalf of the commission by consultants KPMG showed that the programme had succeeded very well.  Many worthwhile projects were assisted.  The evaluation did, however, indicate that there was a need for greater publicity for the programme locally and for an effective presence on the ground to be able to give additional assistance needed to local groups and individuals in accessing the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following publication of the commission's Green Paper on new Community Initiatives an extensive consultation process was carried out.  The former North West Sub-Regional CSF Review Committee submitted their detailed views at a joint North/South <Col N="900" /> conference held in Ballyconnell in November 1993.  In addition, the views of local and regional bodies in all sectors and spheres were canvassed.  The consultation process proved to be a very worthwhile exercise which was of considerable assistance in helping to refine thinking in relation to the new programme.</P>
    <P>The guidelines set out the development aims of the new programme as: to assist internal Border areas of the European Union in overcoming the special developmental problems arising from their relative isolation within national economies and within the Union as a whole, in the interests of the local population and in a manner compatible with the protection of the environment; to promote the creation and development of networks of co-operation across internal borders and where relevant, the linking of these networks to wider Community networks in the context of the completion of the single market in 1992.</P>
    <P>The guidelines allow for a continuation of measures which were found to be successful under INTERREG I.  As the arrangements in relation to the implementation of the programme worked satisfactorily similar arrangements have been put in place for INTERREG II.  To address the need for greater support facilities locally we have agreed, with the Commission and the Northern authorities, to set up an INTERREG Development Office function to facilitate the promotion of the programme and to improve its visibility within the eligible region.  The INTERREG Development Officer will be based in two sub-offices, one of which will be based in Monaghan town and the other in Armagh city.  Interviews for the post of development officer are scheduled for the end of June.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91, 92 and 93 together.</P>
      <P>While, as Minister for Finance, I have overall responsibility for the national lottery, the operation of the various national lottery funded programmes is a matter for each of the spending Ministers concerned.</P>
      <P>In my own Department's case, the one activity to be funded by the national lottery in 1995 is Gaeleagras na Seirbhíse Poiblí which operates through its headquarters in Dublin and also runs a number of courses in Gaeltacht counties. The amount of money provided in the 1995 revised estimates volume for this particular purpose is £110,000.  The amount paid to Gaeleagras up to 12 June 1995 is £26,282.60.</P>
      <P>The amount of money provided in the revised estimates for each of the years 1991 to 1994 for Gaeleagras was as follows:</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 94, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 106 and 116 together.</P>
      <P>Treatment for those diagnosed positive for hepatitis C, irrespective of the source of infection, is being provided at six designated hospitals.  The treatment, including prescribed medication, is being provided by the public hospital service free of charge.</P>
      <P>The services put in place for persons who have tested positive for hepatitis C will be available for as long as they are required.  The needs of those who have been diagnosed as positive for hepatitis C will be monitored and re-assessed on an on-going basis to ensure that the necessary support services are provided to meet their needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The BTSB has informed my Department that as at 16 May 1995 the number of women who have tested positive for hepatitis C antibodies is 1,220 and 505 of these women are positive for the hepatitis C virus.  Hepatitis C is not confined to women.  The BTSB has also informed my Department that as at 16 May, 1995 12 children have tested positive for hepatitis C antibodies and three of these children have tested positive for the virus.  Three partners have tested positive for hepatitis C antibodies. Some 562 women have attended the <Col N="904" /> special out-patient clinics and 462 liver biopsies had been carried out, at 16 May 1995.  There are approximately 18 women who are on interferon treatment.</P>
    <P>The question of extending the services available to Anti D recipients who are infected with hepatitis C to include general practitioner services free of charge, is under consideration and a decision on this matter will be made in due course.</P>
    <P>A limited <i>ex gratia</i> expenses scheme is being operated by the BTSB to ensure that all Anti D recipients are in a position to avail of the screening, counselling and treatment services.</P>
    <P>My Department has recently written to all hospitals and health boards requesting that medical records be made available to those diagnosed positive for hepatitis C under the National Blood Screening Programme on request, save only in cases where it is considered that it would cause serious harm to the patients physical or mental health.  In such circumstances, it is considered that following consultation with the patient, the record should be issued to the patient's general practitioner for discussion with the patient or alternatively the consultant in charge of the patient should discuss the medical details with the patient.</P>
    <P>The policy document, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, included a commitment to fair compensation for women infected by the hepatitis C virus from anti-D. The Government has decided to establish, as a matter of urgency, a tribunal which will assess compensation on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis in respect of Anti D recipients who are infected with hepatitis C antibodies/virus and the partners and children of these women who are also infected with hepatitis C antibodies/virus.  The establishment of the tribunal is the subject of detailed discussions between my Department and the Attorney General's office and is at an advanced stage.</P>
    <P>Other groups who have members who are positive for hepatitis C are also seeking compensation.  There is ongoing <Col N="905" /> consideration in my Department of the position in relation to people who are positive for hepatitis C who were recipients of blood transfusions.  I have met with representatives of the Irish Haemophilia Society, the Irish Kidney Association and Transfusion Positive and advised them that decisions in relation to access to the compensation tribunal, when established, for groups other than Anti D recipients will be made in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The indicative drugs prescribing scheme has been put in place after extensive consultations and agreement with the Irish Medical Organisation.</P>
      <P>In discussion with the Irish Medical Organisation, in the context of the 1992 GMS review it was agreed that, in common with other developed countries, medicines are not always prescribed in the most effective manner in this country and that, accordingly, there was significant potential for an improvement in prescribing practice leading to better patient care and better use of the resources in the development of general practitioner services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly each doctor was encouraged to examine his/her existing prescribing practices with a view to availing of any available opportunities to make prescribing more effective and less costly for all his/her patients.  To <Col N="928" /> assist in this process doctors were provided with indicative drug targets which had been constructed on the basis of average prescribing costs weighted on the basis of age and sex.</P>
    <P>The duty and obligation of individual doctors to provide the most appropriate management for each patient who presented and, in so doing, to utilise resources available for the optimum care of patients individually and collectively was emphasised by all parties to the scheme.  In this context the right of the doctor to prescribe as he/she considers necessary remains absolutely in place and there is no limitation on the range of items from which he/she can choose to prescribe.</P>
    <P>There are already satisfactory monitoring procedures in place which are operated by the Department and the health boards.  There is no evidence that the scheme discriminates against patients or is adversely affecting patient care.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Prior to the introduction of the incentive-based indicative drug target scheme, the average annual rise in the general medical service drug costs was much greater than that occurring since the introduction of the scheme.  The rise in the ingredient cost of medicines has dropped from an annual average of 11 per cent prior to the inception of the scheme to an annual average rise of 4 per cent in the past two years.  This containment is in no small way directly related to the impact of the scheme and the achievement of more effective prescribing by doctors.</P>
      <P>While we must continue to evaluate and refine the scheme, I have currently no plans to stop or replace the scheme which is not only helping to contain drug costs but is also facilitating enhanced patient care.</P>
      <P>The savings which are being generated by a significant number of doctors in the scheme are being used for the purpose of improving facilities and services for patients.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I presume the Deputy is referring to the level of reimbursement for health board and public voluntary hospitals in respect of the treatment of VHI subscribers.  For the last three years my Department has centrally negotiated with the VHI board an overall amount which was then allocated among the agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="930" /> In the context of the new single market in health insurance, as established in the Health Insurance Act, 1994, the Minister for Health is the regulatory authority for the non-prudential aspects of private medical insurance regulation. As such, it is not appropriate that my Department or I be involved in the making of commercial arrangements between health care providers and any one insurer.</P>
    <P>From this year the Department will no longer be involved in the cash limit process.  Agreement of reimbursement arrangements with the VHI will be a matter for the public health agencies concerned.  Health boards and voluntary hospitals have agreed to participate in common negotiations with the VHI for the public system in respect of income for public hospitals in 1995.  I understand that negotiations are at an advanced stage between the VHI and the public agencies.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> As the Deputy will be aware, the suspension from use of some hospital beds over the summer months has been characteristic of the provision and organisation of hospital services throughout the country for many years. Seasonal closures are usually planned to coincide with a period when staff are on annual leave and when the level of activity has traditionally declined.  In addition, this period is often used as an opportunity to refurbish wards.  All emergency and urgent services, of course, continue to be provided during this period.</P>
      <P>Any decision on the level of bed closures during the summer months is a matter for the health boards and hospitals concerned in the first instance. As in other years, my Department will be monitoring the situation closely and will remain in constant touch with health agencies about this matter.</P>

    <P>Details of projects which have benefited from national lottery funding in the areas of arts and culture, heritage and the Irish language during the years 1987 to 1993 are contained in the Appropriation Accounts for those years. Prior to 1993 moneys for projects in the arts, culture and heritage areas <Col N="938" /> were disbursed through the Vote of the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Details in respect of projects-organisations to which funding was provided in 1994 follow as Appendix 1.</P>
    <P>The total amount of national lottery moneys for the areas of arts and culture, heritage and the Irish language under the aegis of my Department in the current year is £14.396 million, as provided in the 1995 Revised Estimates for the Public Service &mdash; Vote 42: subheads C1, D2, J and K; Vote 43: subhead B; Vote 44: subhead B.  These amounts include grants-in-aid to certain bodies under the aegis of my Department.  In the case of An Chomhairle Ealaíon, which is funded from both the Exchequer and the national lottery, detailed lists of grants given by An Chomhairle are published in its annual reports, copies of which are laid before the Oireachtas. Maidir le Bord na Gaeilge, tá eolas faoi na bealaí ina chaitear an t-airgead a chuirtear ar fáil don eagraíocht &mdash; arbh ón gcrannchur náisiúnta an t-iomlán &mdash; ar fáil ina cuid tuarascálacha bliantúla, a leagtar faoi bhráid an Oireachtais.</P>
    <P>Projects for which national lottery funding has been approved by my Department but for which there have been no payments to date are listed in Appendix 2.</P>

      <P>Local authorities have power under section 42 of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948 to make by-laws for the regulation of swimming pools and bathing places maintained by them or to which the public are admitted.  The by-laws may require the provision of lifeguards and equipment and appliances for saving <Col N="948" /> persons from drowning.  Two local authorities only appear to have made such by-laws.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 125, 126 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>Information on national lottery funding relevant to my Department, including details of recipients and amounts paid, is set out in my Department's Appropriation Accounts.  These are published with the annual reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General, and copies are available in the Oireachtas Library in respect of the years 1990 to 1993.  Information on the 1994 position is contained in the following tables.  The 1995 provisions are set out in the 1995 Revised Estimates for Public Services, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals for projects to be financed by national lottery funds are processed through various stages in my Department, involving both technical assessment and management of demand to match available resources.  Payments in relation to approved projects are made <Col N="949" /> in instalments, or following completion-certification of projects.  Subject to the <Col N="950" /> foregoing, there are no projects which have been approved but not funded.</P>

      <P>The recent allocation of some £2.15 million in grants for small water and sewerage schemes included one grant approval for each county council area.  The scheme approved for Meath County Council was in respect of an integrated water project for Kilmain-hamwood, Summerhill, Enfield and Longwood for which grant assistance of some £71,000 is being made available. My Department is not at present in a position to provide funding for other small scheme proposals.</P>

      <P>Local authority dwellings are let on a weekly tenancy basis in accordance with letting agreements drawn up by the authority.  The terms of these agreements are a matter for the authority but must include the conditions set out in article 83 of the Housing Regulations, 1980.  The authority has the right to reenter upon and resume possession of a house for breach, non-performance or non-observance of any of the provisions of the letting agreement.  This right is subject to four weeks' written notice to quit in accordance with section 16 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) <Col N="954" /> Act, 1992.  I have no proposals to amend these legislative provisions nor have I received any requests from local authorities to do so, but I would consider carefully any such request.</P>

      <P>The Castlebridge Fire Training Centre was opened in 1978 and was used for many years by Wexford and other fire authorities as a centre for breathing apparatus training.  Any initiative in relation to the upgrading of the centre would, in the first place, be a matter for Wexford County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department assists fire authorities generally in relation to training for fire services personnel by providing funds for modern training facilities which are now widely available throughout the country.  My Department also <Col N="955" /> provides funds and administrative assistance to the Fire Services Council which arranges an annual training programme for fire services personnel.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 138 together.</P>
      <P>I recently allocated 55 remedial teacher posts to the primary school sector. These posts are effective from the commencement of the 1995/96 school year.  Schools were selected on the basis of priority of need as determined by my Department's primary inspectorate and having regard to data submitted by the schools.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, on this occasion, the schools referred to by the Deputy were not successful.</P>
      <P>This allocation brings the total number of remedial teacher posts in the primary sector to 1,188.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the Government's commitment to increasing access to remedial education, I will continue to review needs in this area and consider how best these needs can be addressed within available resources.  I wish to assure all schools which applied for a remedial teacher post, but were unsuccessful on this occasion, that their needs will be considered in this context.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach) Niamh Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I recently published a survey of unit costs of first and second level schools which had been commissioned by my Department.  The survey was carried out by external consultants and the data related to the school year 1988-89.</P>
      <P>The survey assembled a considerable body of factual data on the recurrent expenditures of primary and second-level schools and presented detailed analysis of this data under various headings. It illustrated graphically the high level of variation from school to school in per pupil expenditures for overall expenditure and for expenditure under individual cost headings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any conclusions drawn from the study must take into account that it deals with expenditure for one year only; there are differences in the scope of activities provided, i.e. in the ranges and types of subjects offered in the different sectors.  Voluntary secondary schools concentrate traditionally on the provision of academic subjects while the vocational schools and community and comprehensive schools provide a higher proportion of technical-vocational subjects which are more expensive to teach; in the vocational schools it was not possible to allocate costs precisely between general second level programmes and the balance of vocational education committee educational schemes.  As a result, the data on unit costs per whole-time general post-primary pupil for vocational schools may overestimate some expenditures; some cost items are not reported consistently because they <Col N="958" /> are directly incurred by schools in some sectors and not in others.</P>
    <P>With these reservations, I accept that the study indicates some disparity of funding as between the voluntary secondary schools and the other school types.</P>
    <P>The main element in the disparity is the pay costs which were being met at school level.  In that regard, improvements in the funding of primary and second level schools have continued since the survey was carried out.  These improvements address both the overall funding needs and the indications in the study of some disparity of funding as between the voluntary secondary schools and the other school types, particularly in respect of pay costs other than teacher pay.</P>
    <P>At primary level the improvements include:</P>
    <P>(a)  The capitation grant for primary schools has been increased by 51 per cent since the 1988-89 school year.  The capitation grant is currently £40, supplemented by an additional grant of £25 for schools in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>(b)  There has been a major expansion in the number of primary schools designated as disadvantaged and which are in receipt of the additional capitation grant of £25 per pupil.  A total of 310 schools and approximately 82,000 pupils are in receipt of this additional funding from September 1994 as compared with 156 schools with 46,000 pupils in 1988-89.</P>
    <P>(c)  An additional £1.5 million is being provided in 1995 for the scheme of additional capitation grants covering caretaking and clerical services in primary schools.  This increase allows for the full-year cost of improvements made in 1994 which extended grant assistance to</P>
    <P>&mdash;schools with enrolments in excess of 350 pupils</P>
    <P>&mdash;an additional 15 schools designated as disadvantaged</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="959" />&mdash;special schools with eight teachers or more.</P>
    <P>The qualifying enrolment will be further reduced this year with a view to grant aiding up to 200 additional schools.  The increased funding will also enable improvements to be made in the position of large schools that currently have shared secretarial and caretaking services only.</P>
    <P>At second level the improvements include:</P>
    <P>(a)  The <i>per capita</i> grant towards the recurrent costs of voluntary secondary schools has been increased by 18 per cent to £165 since 1988-89.  Since 1 January 1994, schools designated as disadvantaged are now in receipt of an additional capitation grant of £15 per pupil.  The non-pay budgets of the vocational education committees and the budgets of the community and comprehensive schools have also been increased over this period.</P>
    <P>(b)  All voluntary secondary schools with an enrolment in excess of 200 pupils are being grant-aided at the rate of £25 per student, subject to a maximum of £8,750 per annum, towards the cost of secretarial services where such schools are not already in receipt of clerical assistance under my Department's 1977 scheme.  From September 1994, all voluntary secondary schools with an enrolment in excess of 200 pupils receive a <i>per capita</i> grant of £25, subject to a maximum of £8,750, towards the cost of employing a caretaker.</P>
    <P>(c)  The annual budgets of each community and comprehensive school include a provision to enable them to employ at least one caretaker and one secretary on a full-time basis and the majority of schools with an enrolment in excess of 500 pupils are provided with funds to employ a second caretaker and part-time secretarial assistance of up to 20 hours per week.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> (d)  The financial allocations to the vocational education committees include a provision to enable them to provide a level of caretaking and clerical services for their schools.  All vocational schools with an enrolment in excess of 200 students have some secretarial and caretaking facilities. From September 1994, all vocational schools with an enrolment in excess of 273 pupils have a minimum of one full-time equivalent of both a caretaker and school secretary.</P>
    <P>(e)  Over £600,000 has been provided in 1995 for the expansion of the scheme of grants for secretaries and caretakers at second level to schools with fewer than 200 pupils.  The increased funding will also enable improvements to be made in the position of large schools that currently have shared secretarial and caretaking services only.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Education outlines the intention that, in the future, the funding of all primary schools will be put on the same basis, with additional funding for schools designated as disadvantaged. At second level, the Government is committed to achieving a 90 per cent completion rate at senior cycle by the year 2000.  The White Paper acknowledges that expenditure on second level education, in order to meet the projected increase in participation rates, is a necessary investment in social and economic well-being.</P>

      <P>The average annual cost of over £20 million was arrived at by extending the methodology used in the costings commissioned by the teacher unions, which were prepared on a very <Col N="961" /> limited basis, to cover a longer timeframe and more realistic number of teachers retiring.</P>
      <P>The £30 million is an actuarial estimate of the additional annual liability which would arise for the first 40 years. The estimate is based on the current average age (41) of teachers and assumes that a proportion of those eligible would avail of the early retirement facility.</P>
      <P>I consider that little purpose would be served by my Department and the teachers' side exchanging their estimated costings of the teachers' claims given the diversity in the basic assumptions used for estimation purposes.  In the circumstances, I have suggested that it would be preferable if the claims were costed independently.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 143, 144 and 145 together.</P>
      <P>Table 1 hereunder sets out the amount of lottery funding disbursed by my Department under the various grants of support for voluntary and community organisations for each of the years 1990 to 1994 and the allocation for 1995.  I have also given details of the allocations for the grant schemes that were not lottery funded in the years in question in that table.</P>
      <P>The lottery funds allocated to my Department have been used to fund a number of schemes of grants and other supports to voluntary and community organisations.</P>
      <P>As there were a very large number of individual grants under the various schemes in the years in question, I do not propose to circulate the details with this reply.  Details of all grants paid in 1993 were placed in the Oireachtas Library for the information of Members in March 1994 and details of all grants paid in 1994 were likewise placed in the Library in March of this year.  I have now arranged for details of all grants paid in the years 1990 to 1992 to be placed in the Library for the information of Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to 1995, Table II hereunder sets out details of grants paid or approved from the national lottery subhead to date.  The amounts shown under the Community Development Programme as the 1995 allocations are provisional.  Payments to projects participating in the programme are made on a quarterly basis and depend on continued progress on the implementation <Col N="964" /> of the agreed workplan and receipt of accounts and returns for payments previously issued.  It will be noted that in some cases payment of the 1995 allocation has not commenced yet.  In these cases receipt of tax clearance certificates or completion of contracts, etc. is being waited before payment can commence. In relation to the scheme of grants for lone parents return to work or second chance education initiatives, no grants have yet been approved in 1995.  This scheme was advertised on 9 March and the deadline for receipt of applications was 26 April.  The applications received are currently being assessed and it is expected that the grants will be allocated in early July.</P>

      <P>The age limit for payment of child dependant allowances to long term social welfare recipients including those receiving unemployment assistance at the long term rate, where the child remains in full-time education, has been progressively increased in recent years.  This year, I have extended the age at which the child additions paid with long term payments are made to 22 years for those in full-time education.</P>
      <P>Child dependant allowances paid with short term payments, including unemployment assistance at the short term rate, are payable up to the age of 18 years.  Any extension of this age limit, or any alternative scheme of allowances for the people concerned, would have financial implications and could only be considered in a budgetary context having regard to available resources.</P>

      <P>Under the scheme of grants for voluntary organisations, once-off grants may be made to help voluntary and community groups working with disadvantaged groups or in disadvantaged areas.  The number of applications received to date under the grants scheme is in the region of 1,000 and these are being processed at the regional offices at present.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the State export credit insurance scheme was restructured at the end of 1991.  Cover is now provided for short term political risk and medium-term commercial and political risk.  Short-term commercial risk cover, provided by the State up to end of 1991, must now be obtained from the private sector.</P>

      <P>I have no plans at present to employ consultants to review the role and operations of An Bord Tráchtála. My predecessor commissioned the review of Bord Fáilte because it was perceived that its structure was unsuitable to meet the challenges of marketing Ireland as a tourism destination. Bord Fáilte had become multi-functional and, as a result, the focus on its <Col N="976" /> core marketing and promotional activity had become dissipated.</P>
      <P>No such lack of focus exists in relation to An Bord Tráchtála.  In fact, a review of An Bord Tráchtála's role was comprehended under the Culliton review of industrial policy which concluded that its primary function should continue to be the promotion of trade from the indigenous sector.</P>
      <P>I recently reviewed and revised An Bord Tráchtála targets for indigenous export growth and set a new target of doubling the 1993 level of indigenous exports by 1999.  I am anxious that, having set this ambitious target, it should have a good prospect of being achieved. Consequently, the board of An Bord Tráchtála, on which my Department is represented, has begun an internal review of staffing levels, resource allocations and priorities.  Of course, my Department also keeps An Bord Tráchtála's promotion programmes under continuous review to ensure that they are as effective as possible.</P>

      <P>This is a commercial matter in which I have no legal function.  However, I understand from inquiries with the main ferry companies that there have been no increases in respect of the transport of live lambs to the Continent since 1994, but I understand that some private ferry companies operating on the English Channel have increased their charges for the transport of live animals to the Continent.</P>

The amount involved was £3.122 million approved by Government in respect of restoration work on the GPO in Dublin. The money was disbursed over the years 1990-93 and the breakdown is as follows:</P>
