    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton) Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Food Aid Convention, 1995, done at London on the 5th day of December, 1994, and amended on the 13th day of March, 1995, copies of which were laid before the Dáil on 7th July, 1995.</P>
      <P>Since its foundation the United Nations has identified access to adequate food as a universal human right and as a collective responsibility.  The Universal Declaration on Human Rights, 1948 recognised that &ldquo;everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well being of himself and his family, including food...&rdquo;.  In 1974 the World Food Conference reaffirmed that every man, woman and child has the inalienable right to be free from hunger and malnutrition, to develop fully and maintain their physical and mental faculties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the most recent figures published by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, 800 million people are chronically undernourished. Among them are more than 200 million children under the age of five who suffer from acute or chronic protein and energy deficiencies.  That is an affront to the entire international community.  The continuing problem of <Col N="938" /> world hunger is a severe rebuke to our collective past failures and an insistent challenge that we now establish conditions of adequate food security for all. We in the international community do not have a more urgent task.</P>
    <P>There is a growing recognition on the part of the international community that renewed efforts and imaginative approaches are urgently needed to address the problems of underdevelopment and poverty which persist in so many parts of the world.  The concept of sustainable development was strongly endorsed at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and will remain an important objective for all developing countries.  In Rio the international donor community renewed its commitment to provide the necessary financial and technical assistance to enable developing countries to make much greater progress in overcoming the problems, including food shortages which prevent their people from achieving an acceptable quality of life.</P>
    <P>This year is the 150th anniversary of the famine in Ireland.  Irish people today find it unacceptable that this terrible experience is now being visited on innocent people in parts of our world.  It is important to acknowledge that many of the causes of famine and food shortage are to be found not only in local political instabilities but in wider collective international failures.  We, in the international community, have yet to address adequately the impact and management of issues transcending national boundaries, including the global environment and the way in which the world resources are divided.</P>
    <P>Global statistics speak for themselves. The developed world has roughly one-fifth of the world's population while enjoying four-fifths of global income.  It consumes 75 per cent of the world's energy, 75 per cent of its metals and 85 per cent of its food.</P>
    <P>The armaments industry and the failure of Governments to control arms is <Col N="939" /> another major and growing factor leading all too often to political and economic instability in the developing world.</P>
    <P>Irish foreign policy has been and continues to be aimed at preventing conflict, promoting development, economic growth and co-operation, controlling the supply of arms and promoting disarmament.</P>
    <P>The House is being asked to endorse an international framework for the provision of a comprehensive policy of food aid for countries with serious food difficulties. The Food Aid Convention is an essential component of the international response to problems of hunger and underdevelopment.  It is not in itself a complete answer to the challenge of establishing adequate food security, but it does represent an important step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline briefly the legal and technical background to the convention. The Food Aid Convention is one of two separate legal instruments which form the International Grains Agreement, 1995.  The other legal instrument is the Grains Trade Convention, 1995 which will be ratified by the European Union on behalf of all member states and does not require ratification by individual member states.</P>
    <P>The first International Wheat Agreement was negotiated in 1949 and was updated on successive occasions, leading to the International Wheat Agreement, 1986.  In 1967 the original agreement was extended to include the first Food Aid Convention.  The second Food Aid Convention was agreed in 1971.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Treaty of Accession to the European Communities, Ireland became a party to the 1971 Food Aid Convention.  Since then our contribution under the Food Aid Convention, like that of all other member states, is counted as part of the overall European Union contribution.</P>
    <P>The 1971 Food Aid Convention was succeeded by the conventions of 1980, 1986 and 1995.  In addition to the European Union the other parties involved <Col N="940" /> in the negotiations for the 1995 conventions were Argentina, Australia, Canada, Japan, Norway, Switzerland and the United States.  The text of the convention was agreed in London on 5 December 1994.  That text was subsequently amended on 13 March, 1995 to allow amendment of the minimum annual contribution of the United States from 4,470,000 tonnes to 2,500,000 tonnes.</P>
    <P>The Food Aid Convention, 1995 was opened for signature, ratification and accession at the United Nations headquarters in New York from 1 May to 30 June 1995.  Ireland signed the convention in New York on 30 June 1995 and it entered into force with effect from 1 July 1995.</P>
    <P>Article 1 of the 1995 convention defines its objective as to secure, through a joint effort by the international community, the achievement of the World Food Conference target of at least ten million tonnes of food annually to developing countries in the form of grain suitable for human consumption.</P>
    <P>The convention provides that such aid may be in the form of grain, pulses, rice or cash equivalent, together with a contribution towards transport costs.  The European Union is committed to providing 1,755,000 tonnes in wheat equivalent. This compares to the obligation by the Community to provide 1.67 million tonnes under the 1986 convention. As with previous conventions, the new EU total is likely to be divided internally as between 55 per cent to Community operations and 45 per cent to national operations.  Under the 1986 convention, Ireland's share of the EU total is expected to be 4,000 tonnes.</P>
    <P>For some years it has been the practice to make the Irish contribution in cash.  Under the terms of the convention, cash contributions shall be used, as far as possible, to buy grain from developing countries.  This is an important feature of Irish policy in relation to the convention because it means the disturbance to local markets is minimised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="941" /> The Irish contribution as under previous conventions, will be borne by the Vote of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry but will count in fulfilment of the Government's objective of making steady progress towards achieving the UN goal of 0.7 per cent of GNP devoted to official development aid.  In recent years, the annual contribution has amounted to £500,000 in 1992; £545,000 in 1993; £564,000 in 1994 and £544,000 in 1995.  The cost of Ireland's commitment will continue to be of this order of magnitude, subject to fluctuations in market prices for wheat, exchange rates and freight charges, because our commitment is to an overall tonnage.  We then buy that tonnage which ultimately determines our contribution.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise to the House, that in addition to our food aid convention obligations, Ireland takes significant additional measures as part of the international effort to alleviate malnutrition and hunger in developing countries.  This year, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is providing a £1 million cash donation to the World Food Programme in recognition of its vital work in combating world hunger.  These funds have been committed to emergency food operations in Africa.  My Department made a voluntary contribution of £400,000 to the World Food Programme in 1993 and £500,000 in 1994.  We have also provided extensive humanitarian assistance in cases of compelling need, Rwanda being a recent example.</P>
    <P>It is also important to note that in recent years the European Union has consistently exceeded its obligations under the Food Aid Convention.  In the marketing year 1993-94, for example, the Community and its member states provided a total in cereals of 2.5 million tonnes as food aid, thus comfortably exceeding the minimum obligation under the 1986 convention of 1.67 million tonnes.</P>
    <P>Food security is a vital issue which affects everyone in the developing world.  The Irish Government has <Col N="942" /> sought to make it a growing and priority sector in terms of Irish aid.  In target Irish aid areas where food production opportunities are limited, Ireland will continue to support income generation projects and strategies that involve farmers in the identification of needs and possible solutions.  We will encourage the promotion of technologies to overcome problems in food production utilisation and storage.</P>
    <P>The FAO has recently stated that &ldquo;children under five and pregnant and nursing women are frequently the principal victims of food insecurity....  A major cause of child illness and malnutrition is women's heavy workload, which forces them to cut down on meal preparation and family care&rdquo;.  Through Irish aid programmes, Ireland will do everything possible to support the empowerment of women as an integral part of our development co-operation programmes.</P>
    <P>In November 1994 the EU Development Council adopted a resolution stating, <i>inter alia,</i> that &ldquo;food security including nutrition issues should be adopted as a guiding principle underlying development programmes ...&rdquo;.  The Irish Government fully supports and endorses this strategy.  I hope the World Food Summit to be held in Rome next year will define for the international community a new agenda on food security that will enable us to move towards the new millennium free of the shadow of starvation anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P>Over recent years, the ending of the Cold War has removed consideration of development issues from the constraints of ideologies and differing world views. There is now widespread international agreement in both developed and developing countries on the concept of sustainable development; the importance, in the widest sense, of investment in people; concern for the rights of the environment; the importance of equal and full respect for the rights of women and the essential requirement of food security as a basic and core human right.</P>
    <P>In August we celebrated the tenth anniversary of Live Aid when people in <Col N="943" /> Ireland and throughout the world were particularly conscious of starvation in Ethiopia.  Ten years later, Ethiopia has undergone a political and partial economic transformation.  In recent years, droughts have occurred in Ethiopia as severe as those that occurred at the time of Live Aid.  However, the reason one million people did not die in these droughts is due to the fact that a series of measures had been put in place both by the local government and the international community which supplied food aid together with improvements in the road infrastructure.  This meant that particularly deprived areas affected by the droughts did not suffer the starvation of a decade ago.</P>
    <P>Much of southern Africa is currently experiencing one of its worst droughts for a long time and the expectations in relation to harvest have been substantially reduced.  The Irish aid programme, acting in advance of problems arising, has committed additional resources to those areas of southern Africa particularly affected by this season's drought.</P>
    <P>In discussing Africa we often talk about negative rather than positive outcomes. Properly organised food security with the co-operation of the international community, the national development agencies and the NGOs will mean that the starvation people experienced from time to time need not recur.</P>
    <P>The food aid convention is an important framework for international food action, one which has in the past demonstrated its value and effectiveness. I commend this motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister of State on introducing the debate on this convention and welcome the opportunity of making a contribution.  I would point out, however, that last June in this House the Minister of State promised to organise an initiative on the question of food aid and food security in the autumn.  When replying, will she give us some indication of any initiatives <Col N="944" /> she will take in this regard?  This is an important issue.  There is major concern about the role of the EU and the effectiveness of its delivery of aid and we do not often get an opportunity to discuss these issues in the House.</P>
      <P>This year we are commemorating the 150th anniversary of the great famine. We are in a position to make ourselves aware of the reality of famine in the world today.  It is clear from the Minister of State's contribution this morning and the bishops' pastoral letter of last Sunday week that famine is not the fruit of divine anger or exclusively natural events but rather is due to a combination of factors such as crop failure, war or unjust social and political economic structures.  That was the case in the 1840s and it holds true today.</P>
      <P>We can learn lessons from the Irish experience of famine and parts of the world ravaged by famine. The bishops' pastoral letter points out that over 700 million people do not have enough to eat each day, that 40 million people die each year from hunger and hunger related diseases and that one third of all children in Africa are malnourished. The presence of a sizeable Irish diaspora, many of whose ancestors left Ireland in famine times, is a reminder of the plight of refugees and displaced persons in so many different parts of the world.</P>
      <P>Advanced technology makes it possible to predict changes in climate, crop failures and consequently areas of likely food scarcity.  Wherever famine occurs it is largely as a result of human action or inaction.  The appalling lack of action led to the ethnic cleansing in former Yugoslavia and the massacres in Rwanda and Burundi, to name two countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Food Aid Convention, 1995, introduced by the Minister, which Ireland signed in New York on 30 June 1995, will remain in force for three years up to the end of June 1998.  The objective of the convention is to secure the achievement of the world food conference target of at least 10 million <Col N="945" /> tonnes of food aid suitable for consumption annually in developing countries. Ireland's share of this is 4,000 tonnes. For some years it has been the practice to make Irish contributions in cash.  The Irish contribution will be borne by the Vote of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  This is taken into consideration also in fulfilment of the Government's objective of making steady progress towards achieving the UN goal of 0.7 per cent of GNP devoted to overseas development aid.  I understand that the annual contribution of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry for 1995 had been estimated at £620,000 but the actual figure, as the Minister said in her speech, is £544,000. The Minister also referred to the fact that an extra £1 million is being contributed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>
    <P>I asked on a number of occasions why two Departments deal with overseas development aid.  I would always imagine the Department of Foreign Affairs would take the lead role.  The only answer I received is that it does not matter where the money comes from as long as it helps the people in developing countries.  That is fair enough.  I do not believe we should have high levels of administrative costs and schemes should not be cumbersome or bureaucratic.</P>
    <P>We are in a very serious position where the price of food is increasing on the world market, surpluses have diminished and the gap between world and Community prices has narrowed.  Many Governments question the effectiveness and suitability of food aid, indeed food aid has been cut by 40 per cent in the US.</P>
    <P>I read some debates of the European Parliament and have taken part in debates in the Parliamentary Assembly in the Council of Europe.  I have heard national parliaments question the need to make progress to achieve the United Nations goal of 0.7 per cent of GNP devoted to overseas development aid. Recently, some British Conservative members at a Council of Europe meeting stated that this figure had been <Col N="946" /> plucked out of the air.  I already raised this matter in the House with the Minister of State.  The United Nations should have much more to say concerning this issue.</P>
    <P>I am pleased President Mary Robinson highlighted the situation in developing countries.  The fact that she travelled to these countries has drawn world attention to the millions of people who do not have enough to eat each day and that people are dying each year from hunger and hunger related diseases.</P>
    <P>On 22 June 1995 the European Commission adopted a proposal for a new regulation on food policy and food aid management concerning special operations in support of food security.  This proposal is aimed at simplifying existing legal instruments to enable the EU to deal with the growing number of countries requesting aid and to improve its actions while maintaining the overall objective of combating poverty.</P>
    <P>The new regulation has three main themes: first, food aid as a key component of long term strategy.  Priority in this respect is to be given to instruments such as structural food aid, local purchasing and triangular operations with the aim of contributing to the development of agricultural food security; the promotion of local trade and the interregional economy in the developing countries.  In addition to the allocation of staple foodstuffs, the aid can also be used to supply other inputs or raw materials to build up reserves and conduct public information and training schemes.</P>
    <P>Second, we must amend the list of potential recipients of Community aid and, third, bring together all the existing legal instruments on food aid into a single body of rules.  We will all welcome proposals to simplify the existing legal instruments but the Minister is aware that there has been strong NGO reaction to the transfer of food aid funds from the Director Generalate for development, known as DGVIII, to humanitarian food aid known as ECHO. <Col N="947" /> The Commission in its discussions with NGO networks justified the transfer as corresponding to humanitarian food aid whereas, according to the NGO network, the concept is unclear, creating much confusion and major problems of co-ordination between DGVIII and ECHO.  The transfer of projects has already been informally attempted this year when NGOs were told that approximately 50 projects have been transferred to ECHO.  These projects were not of a short term nature and did not fall under the mandate of humanitarian aid.  ECHO confirmed this by rejecting projects on these grounds. This shows there is an uncovered gap between food aid and emergency aid. The refugee food aid is also involved in the transfer.  There are strong arguments to keep the bulk of refugee food aid in DGVIII.  First, in dealing with the prolonged refugee position, the food security of the region has to be taken into account.  It needs a programmed approach.  This is important in view of educational activities and environmental impact.  Second, the substantial demand for food is best guaranteed out of the wider food aid budget.  Third, when a rapid response is needed, DG8 is often placed in a position to react quickly with its strategically placed warehouses, trucks, etc.  This method is more effective than very expensive air bridges which cannot deal with large quantities.</P>
    <P>In general NGOs are concerned about the proposed transfer of this major block of funding away from development purposes.  Moreover, given the fact that half the ECHO funding goes to the East, this also represents a geographical shift.  The NGOs associated with EURON aid have welcomed the increased emphasis on food security but have questioned some of the changes and the speed with which they are taking place.  The demarcation line between DGVIII and ECHO is still unclear.  ECHO handles only small food aid grants for immediate emergency use <Col N="948" /> while DG8 handles the large food shipments for longer-term emergencies, for example, in Ethiopia and Angola.</P>
    <P>Food security is defined as access by all people at all times to enough food for an active healthy life.  There is a particular difficulty in the refugee camps where food can be used in a political way.  Rumours about cuts in rations and the pipeline drying up can lead to chaos. These changes can cause serious problems for some NGOs who have supported hospitals and orphanages and school feeding programmes for many years.  The international relief agency CONCERN has expressed concern regarding food distribution needed in Ethiopia in recent years.  The facts speak for themselves.  Of the 43 NGO programme proposals transferred by the food security unit to ECHO in 1995, 41 were rejected as they did not fit in with ECHO's mandate.</P>
    <P>In 1993, according to a food forum article, global redistribution of food by public sector agencies reached a record 17 million tonnes which fell far short of meeting the real need.  In fact, the amount of food aid required in 1993 had been estimated at 24 million tonnes to 27 million tonnes, about 50 per cent more than was available.  The level is not being maintained and in 1994 total food aid fell to around 14 million tonnes.  For the world food programme this shift towards emergencies has been even more marked.  In 1986 the world food programme allocated 75 per cent of its resources to development activities, the remainder supported relief and refugee operations.  In the years 1993 and 1994 more than 85 per cent of its resources went to humanitarian emergencies and refugee needs.</P>
    <P>It is projected that the food aid requirement to cope with the status quo in the year 2020 is likely to be 60 to 80 million tonnes which is four or five times the current supply.  Food aid is an increasingly scarce resource that requires co-ordinated effort to bring together the financial resources, technical skills and food to maximise the positive impact of each.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="949" /> An article dated 20 September 1995 in Reuters report stated that the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, FAO to which the Minister referred, sees the food aid shipment dwindling next year.  It warned of food levels falling to the lowest level since the 1970s and low income food deficit countries being hit further by sharply rising cereal import costs forecast for 1995-96.  It further stated that many national food crises persist in Africa and several other parts of the world and that the food supply is tightening in 1995-96.  It forecasts that food aid shipments would be down by one million tonnes compared with 1994-95 and the lowest level since the mid-1970s; for the second consecutive year food aid shipments, including cereal, would fall sharply below ten million tonnes, the minimum annual target established by the World Food Conference in 1974 for developing countries.</P>
    <P>FAO states that cereal production in southern Africa is expected to be one-third below normal in 1995-96. The subregion's cereal imports and food aid needs have risen substantially since the previous year and a large number of refugees in Rwanda and Burundi will continue to require emergency aid while excessive rainfall and floods have damaged crops in south east Asia.  It said that cereal import prices would rise sharply due to high international prices and ocean freight.  It concluded that the continued decline in world cereal reserves meant that world food security in 1996-97 would depend critically on a substantial increase in cereal production in 1996.  This highlights the seriousness of the issue.  Some of the changes I referred to earlier could mean that countries such as Brazil, which has a high GDP <i>per capita,</i> could be excluded from the new proposals while new countries, such as the new Asian independent states, could become eligible.  Obviously that would be welcome but it would be disastrous if under proposed changes countries were excluded.  Similarly food aid programmes which have a development <Col N="950" /> aspect need support.  I agree with what has been said about it.  It would be welcome if fertilisers, agricultural implements and pesticides could be included.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs published a report on Third World debt which is one of the main problems in developing countries.  I pay tribute to the committee and the chairman of the sub-committee, Deputy Pat Gallagher, for his work in this area.  The committee points out that Third World debt is a major barrier to positive development and self-sufficiency across the southern countries; Third World debt has increased substantially since the 1994 report was published.  The total development assistance from the developed world in 1994 was $5.5 billion less than in the previous year and debt repayments rose by 6 per cent.  These figures illustrate that the debt crisis is still an acute problem in the developing world.  The committee considered it timely to review progress on the approaches towards a resolution of the problem and to put forward recommendations for action by Ireland in the context of our membership of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.  Will the Minister consider the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs?  I welcome the convention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to support the motion to ratify this convention which is absolutely essential and entirely commendable.  If one wanted to comment on it one would refer to the modest contribution Ireland makes.  I am a bit surprised to learn from the Minister's speech that our contribution is only 4,000 tonnes of wheat equivalent. That is a very tiny figure, and also a tiny proportion of the European Union's contribution.  I feel we could increase our contribution greatly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a bit disappointed to see we are giving aid in the form of cash rather than food.  I say this from the point of view of our rather privileged position as one of a minority of countries which produces more food than we consume <Col N="951" /> and has large stockpiles of different types of food.  In the context of wheat and cereals, we have large tracts of set aside land, which is disappointing from our own point of view and particularly disappointing when there are hundreds of millions of people who are starving or severely undernourished.</P>
    <P>One of the disadvantages I see in the encouragement that appears to be given in this convention to many of the donating states to contribute cash rather than food is that it may well have the same effect in some of the least developed countries that the Famine had here.  We are always reminding ourselves that there were large exports of food from Ireland in the late 1840s but the food was being sold for cash.  If we are encouraged to buy grain or other forms of food from some of the least developed countries, although they are short of food, they are forced to sell it for hard currency because of the economic circumstances in which they find themselves.  It is a terrible thought that after the passage of 150 years since the devastating Famine here we could be a party to the same mistake that was made in respect of this country 150 years ago.  I would much prefer to see Ireland making its contribution in food.</P>
    <P>It has been the tradition since the late 1940s that aid tends to be given in the form of wheat or wheat equivalent cereals. However, there are other foods particularly in Ireland that are available in substantial surplus, are less internationally acceptable and less palatable internationally because there are a great many people in the world who have never eaten products such as beef or butter and would find them unpalatable. However, with proper arrangements those for whom beef and butter would be appropriate might get them as would those for whom grains are appropriate.</P>
    <P>There is a danger that countries whose output of food in a particular year does not equal their requirement will export food because of their requirement for hard currency.  That <Col N="952" /> should be avoided.  The level of debt has heavily distorted the economies of many poorer countries, especially in Africa, and the paramount need to repay or service debts takes precedence over what should be the paramount need to feed their own people.  This is a tragedy of the times in which we live.  It is probably true, although we can never check it exactly, that the level of famine and hunger in the world today is much greater than it was in the past.  In the past people tended to be more self-sufficient; they did not survive if they were not.  Living in a much more complex global economy today, people can find themselves in the extraordinary and frightening situation, borne out by the figures quoted by the Minister, in which the developed one fifth of the world consumes 75 per cent of the world's energy, 75 per cent of its metals and 85 per cent of its food.  That means that 15 per cent of the world's food is available for 80 per cent of the world's people. The international community has a fundamental duty to try to adjust the situation and to do so rapidly.</P>
    <P>The obligation of the international community under this Food Aid Convention of 1995 is to provide ten million tonnes of wheat or wheat equivalent. However, the obligation under article 3, paragraph 4 seems to amount only to about five million tonnes from the countries that are listed.  I do not know the explanation for that.  Perhaps the Minister would deal with that in her reply.  I hope there will not be a shortfall.  It is disappointing that the contribution of the United States has dropped from four million tonnes to 2.5 million tonnes.  There may be technical or other explanations for that but, on the face of it, it is disappointing, particularly as there is a huge surplus of grain in storage in the United States and also in Canada.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not indicate in her opening speech the recipients, particularly of Irish aid.  Under the convention a donor country can designate where it wants the aid to go.  I would like to know where the Irish aid goes, and also <Col N="953" /> where the European Union aid goes. We do not have a list of the countries that get aid.  The only identification of them seems to be in article 3, paragraph 1 where the recipients are listed as the least developed countries followed by other low income countries and lower middle income countries.  I would have thought that the vast bulk of the aid should go to the worst off.  I do not know what constitutes a lower middle income country.  I am sure many of them have their problems but starvation of a significant section of their population is probably not one of the problems in such countries.</P>
    <P>In recent years the European Union has succeeded, because of the changes in the Common Agricultural Policy, in reducing its surpluses of food.  It has particularly reduced its intervention stocks of beef, but still produces substantially more than it consumes.  Much of the surplus is difficult to sell in commercial terms.  It is one of the crying shames of the age in which we live that food continues to be dumped from time to time because of inability to sell it commercially.  That is inexcusable at a time when so many people are starving. The principal object of our efforts should be Africa where the problems are greatest and are likely to continue to be so.  We should remember that as well as the question of debt which has complicated the economies of so many of the weaker countries, we have geo-political questions of a type that did not exist in the past which have also complicated things and made it much harder for people.  As a result of man's interference with the environment we also have environmental problems which did not exist before and which can have a major bearing on the ability of weaker countries to produce food.  They are no longer able to produce it in the traditional way due to external environmental influences.  Because the developed world is causing these difficulties for very weak countries and their people, it has a corresponding duty to try to rectify the consequences.</P>
    <P>I fully support this convention but I <Col N="954" /> must comment on its modesty.  It is almost a cause of shame to us that a Minister should announce we are giving 4,000 tonnes.  A few parishes in this country would produce that.  It is extremely modest when we see on our television sets the awful suffering of people.  Where people suffered in the past, our fathers and forefathers were able to say they did not know.  We cannot they probably did not know.  We cannot say we do not know because we see it every night of the week on our television screens.  Our obligation is to respond to the need.  A relatively rich and certainly very fertile country like Ireland has an obligation to do more than this.  I would love to see us doing more in non cash food terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I welcome the opportunity to discuss an important development issue in the House.  Although it is something we have debated in committee on many occasions in the past two or three years, this is the second occasion only on which a debate has taken place in the House.  My contribution can be of a limited nature only, and because of that I will touch on just a few points.</P>
      <P>Most of the aid which will go through this convention will go to the World Food Programme which is an agency of the United Nations.  At a time when the United Nations has been subjected to such a battering and so much criticism over its actions in Bosnia, it is important to remember that the UN is only as good as its members.  The World Food Programme is a good UN agency.  It facilitates international action to relieve famine and also to deal with food security as part of a wider development agenda.  It is important that we be seen to make a contribution to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While our minimum contribution is very modest, it should be recognised that in recent years we have given more than was required of us, the Department of Agriculture having given an extra £1 million this year and the Minister of State's own Department having given extra contributions in 1993-94.  I <Col N="955" /> hope that such additional contributions, from whatever source, continue to be made by the Government.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the amount of food committed under the Food Aid Convention has decreased.  In an era of technological development, when we pride ourselves on many developments in the international sphere and when people are encouraged to surf the internet, it is a mark of shame on the world community that the minimum agreed under this convention has been significantly reduced on that agreed under the 1986 convention.  This is not something about which the international community can be proud.  Food security is a very basic need in absolute terms in emergencies such as Rwanda and as part of a wider development strategy such as that undertaken in respect of Ethiopia in the past ten years.</P>
    <P>Some members referred to the significance of this convention in the year we commemorate our famine.  In considering what this convention can achieve, it is also important to note that this is the tenth anniversary of the Ethiopian famine. Ethiopia has suffered climatic and other adverse conditions since then that would have produced a much worse famine were it not for the development strategy undertaken there of which food aid and security formed an important part.  In our contribution to the convention we should ensure that, where possible, we become involved in long term development and, while acknowledging its importance, not merely operations such as Band Aid.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to the link between food aid and the international debt problem.  The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs will consider our second draft report on this issue this afternoon. I urge the Government to continue to press for the alleviation of debt on less developed countries in the south, particularly those in Africa, at the October meeting of the IMF and the World Bank.  It is interesting to note that the World Bank has made a move in this direction and has tabled a paper for <Col N="956" /> consideration which admits that previous development strategies have failed.  This is a welcome move and the Government should support it.</P>
    <P>I also urge the Minister to bring to the Government's attention the concerns of the Sub-Committee on Development Co-Operation regarding the Government's consideration of contributing to ESAF, a branch of the IMF.  We would prefer our contributions to go towards strict development programmes; Members of the sub-committee would not favour a Government contribution to ESAF.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Deputy O'Malley's sentiments whereby he would prefer Ireland's contribution to be given in food rather than cash.  The inappropriateness and distorting effect of such donations in the past is well documented. To stimulate local markets in developing countries, it would be preferable for developing countries to buy from the developing world for the developing world.  In that regard I have no hesitation in supporting the Government's position that our contribution be given in cash rather than in grain or other foodstuffs.  There are many examples of where contributions in the form of food have not worked.  Cash contributions enable the World Food Programme to be administered effectively and help stimulate local producers and local markets.  I unreservedly support this convention and urge the Government to continue to provide additional contributions over and above our minimum requirements.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed at the lack of enthusiasm for this debate.  It appears that what happens far away is easily forgotten. The question of food and its distribution, money and debt does not <Col N="957" /> receive enough attention.  In this part of the world we are destroying food surpluses while in other parts people do not have enough to eat.  We know from revised histories of our famine that one of the main problems was not the shortage of food, but a difficulty with distribution, similar to what is now known as debt payments, and so on.  Food was exported to pay debts because of the <i>laissez-faire</i> attitude to the economy. The difficulty in regard to food shortages arises from the worldwide <i>laissezfaire</i> attitude &mdash; there are certain things that cannot be touched.  We are unwilling to face up to certain structural problems because the better off in the world are not willing to pay the ultimate price that would be required to ensure that everybody has enough to eat.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about tackling the difficulty in regard to food shortages we must ensure in the short term that people receive direct food aid.  It is pointless talking about long term structural problems unless people are fed in the meantime.  Short-term food aid is very important.  However, in the long term we must examine the underlying problems and ascertain why countries producing cash crops have food shortages. We must also examine the part played by debt servicing in many Third World countries in the creation of famine and food shortages.  Unless the developed world is willing to seriously examine the question of restructuring the debt problem and pay a price, we will not resolve the difficulties of famine or food shortages.</P>
    <P>We are all familiar with the adage that if you give a person a fish you feed him for a day but if you teach him to fish you feed him for life.  We will resolve this problem only by enabling countries to produce their food and this involves tackling the current economic cycle.</P>
    <P>It puzzles me how poor countries such as Rwanda and Somalia always manage to find money to pay for expensive technological equipment, such as guns, from the First World but cannot find money to buy food.  What driving economic <Col N="958" /> force makes that possible?  Yet it defeats us in the First World to provide those countries with an adequate amount of food?  Up to 90 per cent of such weapons are produced in the developed world and a large proportion in the European Union.  How can the countries in the European Union manipulate matters in such a way that poor countries can always find money to pay them for weapons &mdash; I doubt if they are giving them away for nothing &mdash; while they cannot find a way of ensuring that surplus food could be produced in such a way that would meet the requirements of Third World countries?</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that it is pointless taking sides of beef out of cold storage and sending them to Africa.  However, it is amazing that we cannot match production with requirements and, similar to the arms industry, provide a mechanism for poor countries to pay for food supplies.  It seems one can incur debt to buy arms, but not food.  If we are serious about eliminating poverty, we have to tackle the root causes.  In the meantime we should take the necessary emergency steps.  These include the redistribution of wealth and debt restructuring.  I hope the World Bank, the IMF and others will be able to get their political masters to bite the bullet on that issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am encouraged listening to this debate and that which has been taking place for some time about the context in which we operate food aid policies because it seems there is a growing awareness of the need to underpin what one might call the sticking plasters of the problem with longer term policies which would have some effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not succumb to the populist temptation to go for the easy targets. What we need to do and what the European Union, the United States and the world community generally in the developed world should do is formulate an articulated food aid policy, of which this Food Aid Convention would form part, which would look forward for a considerable period on a contingency <Col N="959" /> basis.  This should be accompanied by a fundamental change in world trading policies to allow developing countries break free of the bonds which surround them as a result of having to produce a single cash crop which is totally foreign to the needs of their economy in order to fund Government expenditures, including expenditures on arms to which Deputy Ó Cuív referred.  Unless food aid policy is integrated with a change in trade policy we will not have much success in tackling the root causes of famine and poverty.</P>
    <P>I do not go along with the ritualistic denunciation of the West and banks for bleeding these poor countries dry of their limited resources by insisting that they repay the money borrowed from us because governments in those countries have a responsibility to use their resources from domestic operations as well as aid from the international community wisely.  We should not forget that in some parts of the world millions of people have died from famine caused not by exploitation by anyone outside but by civil war and internal political divisions.  As Deputy Ó Cuív said, many of these regimes can afford to buy arms, but not food.  I cannot see how it helps the people who have died and will die from hunger to miss our target in that way.</P>
    <P>Regimes in those countries have an enormous responsibility to eradicate the disease which, in many cases, they have caught from the West of believing that they have to maintain relatively large armed forces in order to fight their internecine battles.  They believe the West will save them by providing food aid, lending more money and &ldquo;restructuring&rdquo; their debt.  By this most of us mean we will not ask them to repay the money they used, in some cases, to build the most outrageous show projects which have no effect on production and, in others, to make investments they were advised by the World Bank and others to make &mdash; frequently, this was <Col N="960" /> about the worst possible advice that could be given.</P>
    <P>While maintaining our long standing and, I hope, expanding commitment to provide food and development aid, I would like to see us contribute to a development in thinking on trade policy, without which there is little prospect we will see any of these countries emerge into a position where they can begin on a reasonable basis to provide for themselves.  That will be difficult.</P>
    <P>It was a source of great disappointment that this issue received almost no attention in the Uruguay Round of GATT.  While there was much drama about the rows between the United States and the rest of the West about trade policy and intellectual property rights between the United States and Europe, there was no drama about the fact that the world trade system condemns many otherwise fertile countries to produce a single cash crop for export, most of the revenue from which is controlled by governments every bit as venal and subject to corruption as governments elsewhere and which, quite often, cause famine, want, poverty and debt for their people as a result.</P>
    <P>I hope that this issue will be dealt with in the White Paper on foreign policy to be published later this month and that we will have an opportunity to discuss the wider context of this problem when we come to consider that White Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton) Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  Their insights will be very valuable. Each speaker raised two or three separate points which are of major significance. This is an indication of the complexity of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kitt raised the question of the delivery of food and development aid and asked why the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is involved. While policy on overseas development <Col N="961" /> assistance is led and largely determined by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the development co-operation division, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry is involved because agricultural matters have to be dealt with.  Our participation does not require a great deal of administration work. Therefore, no effort is wasted.</P>
    <P>There is a value in having Departments such as Finance and Agriculture, Food and Forestry involved to some extent in the sense that the formulation of broader policies in which those Departments are involved sets the context for much of what happens in the developing world.  As we strive to formulate a comprehensive foreign policy, which I hope will reflect the interest, generosity and tradition of the Irish people, it will not be sufficient for us to say that we should give money through development co-operation.  This year almost £90 million will be spent.  This represents a 50 per cent increase over a two year period.  We must also strive increasingly for coherence so that when the Minister for Finance attends meetings of the World Bank his contribution in relation to developing economies is coherent in terms of the policy on development pursued by the development co-operation division and Irish NGOs.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that the Department of Agriculture Food and Forestry should participate and be aware of the policy issues of the development co-operation division.  It is useful that both Departments are involved.  I would like to see greater contact between Ministers and would like them to look at the coherency of policy in this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kitt raised the issue of the changes in the Commission particularly in DG VIII and ECHO.  I share many of his concerns.  This issue will be raised at the development council meeting in December.  We have taken the position, broadly in line with that adopted by many NGOs, that we do not wish to see ECHO become a massively expensive EU humanitarian operation which will replace organisations or NGOs already <Col N="962" /> working effectively.  It is fine if it is in addition to them, but if it becomes a massive EU humanitarian organisation I am not particularly interested.  There is considerable contact between the Department and the Commission on the formulation of ECHO regulations and we will examine them in great detail at the development council meeting.  We also maintain detailed contact with NGOs because we wish to see EU aid delivered effectively and efficiently. Where there are other bodies available they should be used to the maximum rather than creating new structures.  We do not need more organisations.</P>
    <P>Debt is one of the most critical features of the debate on development. When I lived in Tanzania we used to buy milk in buckets from the local dairy from time to time.  There was fat on top of the milk which would have to be skimmed off.  The fat was used to enrich the milk and was given under one of the international food aid programmes. Everyone spent time trying to separate the milk from the fat as children would not use the milk with globs of fat floating in it.  There must be detailed thinking on the interaction between local production, markets, the development of income for local farmers and self sufficiency.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley asked why Irish aid was in cash form rather than in kind. Only cereals should be included under the convention and not beef and milk products.  In the past we supplied skimmed milk powder to the World Food Programme and that was used in refugee camps were there is need for emergency and immediate supply.  It may be rather difficult for local populations at the receiving end of food aid to use it or store it and it can be extremely expensive to transport food. In terms of trade development, it may be possible to source food locally or in adjacent countries and offer a market for the food without disturbing the traditional diet or market.</P>
    <P>As a result of food aid to Africa there is now a strong preference there for rice. <Col N="963" /> However, many parts of Africa are relatively dry and it is almost impossible to produce rice.  That item will be an expensive import or food aid crop. Traditional staples which are more drought resistant are going out of fashion in parts of Africa as they are not seen as a trendy, more modern food. We have a global communications network and people are aware of what is eaten in different parts of the world.  In terms of local tastes it is difficult to meet food demands particularly where there is an arid climate or drought.</P>
    <P>Many speakers mentioned the arms industry.  I will accompany President Robinson on her visit to Rwanda next week.  The tragedy is that Rwanda is probably one of the most fertile countries in Africa as it has frequent rains and can produce three crops a year.  If the refugees go home they can produce food in a 12 to 14 week period.  The genocide, hunger and want in Rwanda is the result of political failure and a complex ethnic problem.  It is also a reflection on the international arms industry.  If an agreement can be arrived at and the refugees return home the international community must ensure a period of rehabilitation.  Rwanda is capable of producing large quantities of food and does not need huge inputs of chemicals or machinery.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to the fall in the US contribution which is regretted. The US made it clear they are anxious to meet their original commitments but Congress imposed budgetary pressures on the American development programme.  The US said it will regard the new figure of 2.5 million tonnes as a minimum rather than a ceiling, in other words, they hope to exceed that figure.  It is regrettable that because of a political view of aid the American contribution has fallen.  However, that is a domestic political matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley asked who are the recipients of Irish aid.  In the main they are the poorer countries in Subsaharan Africa.  The bulk of EU assistance also goes to that region.  In addition to the <Col N="964" /> special contribution made by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry this year we are responding to special appeals for aid from parts of southern Africa where drought is widespread. Countries such as Lesotho are experiencing severe drought and food shortages.</P>
    <P>I thank Members for their contributions and confirm that the Irish Aid Programme, in the name of the Irish people, in this, the 150th anniversary of the Famine, is spending the highest ever amount, almost £89 million, on development assistance of which food aid and food security forms part, something all of us would like to see expand in the years ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:</P>
      <P>Local Elections Regulations, 1995.</P>
      <P>copies of which regulations in draft were laid before Dáil Éireann on the 22nd day of September, 1995.</P>
      <P>The draft regulations are laid before the House in accordance with section 22 (5) of the Local Government Act, 1994 which provides that, where regulations under that section are proposed to be made, a draft thereof shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the regulations shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="965" /> The need to bring forward the regulations at this time arises from the necessity to implement the European Union Directive on the right to vote and stand at local elections for citizens of the European Union residing in a member state of which they are not nationals.  This right was provided for in the Maastricht Treaty under which every citizen of the European Union residing in a member state of which he or she is not a national shall have the right to vote and stand as a candidate at municipal elections in the member state in which he or she resides under the same conditions as nationals of that State.  The Treaty provided that the exercise of this right would be subject to detailed arrangements to be adopted by the Council.  These arrangements are set out in a Council Directive made on 19 December 1994 which requires that any necessary consequential changes in domestic law should be effected before 1 January 1996.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is pleasant to record that, in the matter of the right to vote and stand at local elections, we are well ahead of other member states.  For decades before the Maastricht Treaty our local elections law had been more liberal than anything envisaged in the Treaty.  The right to vote at local elections was extended to all residents, irrespective of nationality and citizenship, in 1963.  In 1974, the citizenship requirement was repealed in the case of candidates at local elections.</P>
    <P>Therefore, implementation of the European requirements does not demand any substantive change in local electoral law.  However, a technical change to give full effect to the directive is required and is provided for in Article 120 of the draft regulations.  In that article, the Minister for the Environment is assigned the function of certifying that Irish citizens wishing to stand at a local election in another member state are not disqualified under our law from standing at local elections here.</P>
    <P>While the timing of the regulations responds to European requirements, the substantive purpose is to up-date and <Col N="966" /> consolidate, with necessary amendments, the detailed rules for the conduct of local elections here as part of the ongoing programme of electoral law reform.  The programme began with the enactment of the Electoral Act, 1992 which consolidated the law onto the conduct of Dáil elections and the registration of electors.  The Presidential Elections Act, 1993 and the Referendum Act, 1994 continued this process in the presidential elections and referenda codes.  Overall, the objective of the programme is to bring all the various branches of the electoral law into the last decade of the 20th century on which substantial progress has been made.</P>
    <P>The existing law in relation to local elections is contained in a number of statutes beginning with the Electoral Act, 1963 and in a number of statutory instruments, the principal of which is the Local Elections Regulations, 1965. The primary legislation on local elections was restated, in amended and updated form, in Part III of the Local Government Act, 1994.  That Part provides the enabling power for making regulations and, once these are in place, the way will be cleared to repeal the existing statutes and statutory instruments.</P>
    <P>In addition to consolidating the rules for the conduct of local elections, the draft regulations bring procedures at these elections into line, as far as appropriate, with the Dáil election rules in the Electoral Act, 1992.</P>
    <P>The principal change of substance provided for in the regulations is an increase in the amount of the deposit required of candidates at local elections. The level of deposit under existing regulations is £10 in the case of elections to the council of a county or county borough; in the case of elections to other local authorities &mdash; borough and urban district councils and town commissions &mdash; the deposit is £5.  These levels were set 30 years ago by the Local Elections Regulations, 1965.  I understand the current equivalent value of £10 and £5 in 1965 would be approximately £110 and £55 respectively.  It is not proposed to <Col N="967" /> increase the levels of the deposit to take account of the change in the value of money over the past 30 years; instead, the regulations provide for more modest levels of £50 and £25.  To offset the impact of the proposed increase in the deposit levels, the threshold for the refund of the deposit is reduced from one-third to one-quarter of the quota. This follows the precedent set for Dáil elections in the 1992 Act.</P>
    <P>The draft regulations allow a returning officer greater flexibility in relation to the time for counting of votes &mdash; an exercise in which we are all interested.  Under existing regulations, the count may not begin until 9 a.m. on the day after polling day and counting between the hours of 11 p.m. and 9 a.m. may take place only with the agreement of the candidates.  The draft regulations provide that counting for every local authority must begin not later than 9 a.m. on the day after polling day, leaving open the possibility of an earlier start.  In addition, they provide that a returning officer must proceed continuously, so far as practicable, with the counting of votes except during time for necessary rest and refreshment.  The regulations will not affect the practice in some local authorities, where counting for individual electoral areas may commence at different times.  The change in relation to counting arrangements corresponds to amendments to the other electoral codes proposed in the Electoral Bill, 1994 now before the House for Second Reading.</P>
    <P>The regulations also include technical changes in the rules, bringing them into line with changes made in the Dáil election rules.  For example, there is a minor change in the format of the ballot paper, to provide that the surname of the candidate and the name of his or her party will be in large capitals, the forename and surname of the candidate will be in small capitals and the remaining details on each candidate will be in ordinary characters.</P>
    <P>The penalties for offences at local elections will be increased to the same <Col N="968" /> levels as those applicable to offences at a Dáil election.  The level of existing penalties, which were set in 1965, is considerably lower than those under the other electoral codes.  This position will be rectified in the new regulations.</P>
    <P>The chapter in the 1965 regulations dealing with meetings and terms of office of local authorities is not reproduced in the draft regulations.  This is because it is more appropriate that these matters, which are not strictly electoral, should be dealt within primary legislation rather than in regulations. The matters are now dealt with in Parts II and V of the Local Government Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, the regulations form part of the continuing process of electoral law reform.  In consolidating and updating the regulations, the opportunity is taken to harmonise procedures and practices between the different electoral codes, in so far as this is practicable.  I consider this a worthwhile and useful process, especially in such an important area of legislation as electoral law.</P>
    <P>The regulations are a modest but nonetheless valuable measure of law reform and I commend them to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the updating and consolidation of the Regulations as published by the Minister.  It is the first time since 1965 the Regulations have appeared in one publication and it will be a handy reference for most of us for future election purposes.  The Minister mentioned that some technical adjustments were necessary because of EU law and an EU directive, but we were well ahead of the EU in allowing EU citizens to participate in local elections here.  It is good to see us giving such a lead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note what the Minister said about the increase in deposits from £5 and £10 to £25 and £50 respectively.  This is not, as some might claim, a threat to democracy. Having the deposits at the level of £5 and £10 derided local authorities by indicating that anybody could pay £5 <Col N="969" /> and make a laugh of the political process. The rates of £25 and £50 are modest. If the Regulations are open to amendment I suggest that such figures should be linked to the CPI, might be reviewed every five years and increased in line with CPI increases.  In this case they would have to be rounded up to the nearest pound; one does not want to go forward as a local authority candidate searching for the odd pence.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions of Regulation 51 which brings it into line with regulations for Dáil elections.  Regulation 108 is similar to provisions for Dáil elections which have been in force for the last four or five general elections and deals with the question of &ldquo;intimidating&rdquo; the electorate on the way to the poll.  I agree with the principle that, as Regulation 108 (1) states: &ldquo;A person shall not interfere with or obstruct or impede an elector going to or coming from or in the vicinity of or in a polling station.&rdquo;  This is a necessary provision, particularly in urban areas, to keep candidates, their agents and an assortment of people away from the entrances to polling stations where people were being harassed in a way that reminded me of a western film, the title of which I cannot recall, in which a cowboy had to run along a line of Indians who were clubbing him.  The harassment had reached farcical proportions and had become particularly difficult in urban areas.</P>
    <P>It might be desirable, however, to change Regulation 108 (2) (c) which restricts persons &ldquo;[displaying or distributing] any notice, sign or poster (other than a notice, sign or poster displayed by the returning officer) or card, circular or other document relating to the election...&rdquo;.  I have yet to meet somebody who was intimidated, or even influenced, by a poster in a political context. This regulation is ludicrous.</P>
    <P>I have met Deputies and local councillors who have told me of instances in urban areas where polling stations may not always be in the same place, when people did not know there was a polling station there because there was no sign <Col N="970" /> of election posters or canvassers.  The Minister should consider removing the term &ldquo;display&rdquo; from this regulation.  It should remain an offence to distribute any notice, sign or poster, but it should not be an offence to display a poster within a certain distance of a polling station so that people might be reminded an election is taking place and the location of the polling station might be indicated.</P>
    <P>I would not want to revert to the intimidation of electors going into the polling station, but let us have a little common sense and allow posters to be displayed.  The Minister may wish to regulate the number of posters displayed, for example, but they should not be completely banned.  It is reasonable that a party or an independent candidate should be allowed to have a display at a polling station.  It is good for democracy and would at least remind people an election is taking place.  I do not know anybody who has been intimidated by a poster.  Some Deputies may agree with my doubts as to whether people are even influenced by posters. It would be useful, however, to make the change I suggest.</P>
    <P>The Regulations give us an opportunity to address the topic of local government in general and whether we should bother with elections to local government.  The term &ldquo;local government&rdquo; is a misnomer.  It is not local nor is it government.  It is a form of central strangulation administered locally.  Our system, as it has evolved, is stifling local initiative.  This is not a party political point, it is a political statement about local government because all parties have been guilty through the years. Local democracy is not just dead, we have buried it and poured concrete over it to ensure it will not be resurrected. Democratically elected councillors are ignored, insulted, denigrated and bypassed at every opportunity by all levels of the State, including local government. They have few powers and functions and that powerlessness has led to growing frustration among elected <Col N="971" /> members, county managers and executives.</P>
    <P>The public are also frustrated because they perceive the system to be unresponsive to local needs.  What we have done to local government over the last 20 to 30 years is now a threat to democracy, because it has generated public cynicism about the system and representatives, at local and national levels.  The public think politicians are unable to do anything to improve the quality of life for the electorate; I do not mean strokes or arranging medical cards but policy decisions for the people they are supposed to represent.</P>
    <P>If that cynicism spreads it will infect the entire body politic, which will be a poor day for democracy.  There are signs of it already; pressure groups and single issue candidates signify not an increase but a breakdown in democracy.  People feel they should fight for a single issue and an individual or an area should take precedence over the common good. When that is allowed to happen, politics is debased and cynicism increases.  The current system will permit that to continue. I do not believe in describing problems without putting forward a solution. To remedy this we must ensure real decision making powers return to local level.  People will also have to decide that responsibility must rest at local level &mdash; often they want power and money but do not want responsibility or to take hard decisions but people must accept both sides of the coin if we are to have real democracy.</P>
    <P>There should be real power and real responsibility at local level but we will get neither from a devolution commission. It is nonsense to set up such a commission when it consists of civil servants, eminent and able as they are. One of our better Ministers for the Environment in the last 30 years, the former Deputy Boland, is involved, but the idea is a contradiction.  We are talking about devolving power to the regions but are doing so by letting the centre tell the people at the periphery what they will get.  It should be the other <Col N="972" /> way around &mdash; that is what subsidiarity is supposed to mean.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that but my point is that someone at the top will decide what power goes to the bottom. We should look at the structure from the bottom up.  I give credit to the hard working officials in the Department of the Environment but they will not want their empire diminished.  They will make suggestions such as allocating parking fines towards financing local authorities.</P>
      <P>One example is group water schemes &mdash; we have been talking for 20 years about developing this power to local authorities.  Why is there a centralised system for group water schemes?  Does someone think local authority engineers are such idiots that they cannot approve them?  This is an issue of control and the desire and suggestions should come from the bottom, not the top.  I say that with all due respect to the knowledge, expertise and commitment of those on the devolution commission.  The objection is to setting up something whereby the centre decides what powers will be given to the periphery, rather than the other way round.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>When we discuss the report, if I am wrong, I will say the Minister is right.  However, I do not believe any real power will be devolved in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need institutional reform.  One problem which has existed under several Ministers is that local government reform has been discussed in isolation from central Government.  That cannot <Col N="973" /> be done &mdash; we must talk in the context of institutional reform at national and local level.  This reform must ensure all services are delivered at the most appropriate level, as near as possible to the people.  It must be democratic in the broadest sense &mdash; not only public representatives but local voluntary groups and the community sector should also have a say.</P>
    <P>The reform should make local government the initiator and provider of services, not the body told by the centre to provide that service, without money being made available.  Real reform does not involve the centre deciding what will be devolved to local level, or bypassing local democracy with quangos, <i>ad hoc</i> committees, etc., or Ministers and Governments insulting and denigrating local public representatives by telling them they are not fit to serve on State or semi-State boards.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the Minister and Minister of State wish to reform and have sought co-operation from this House.  Speaking on behalf of Fianna Fáil, I indicated we would co-operate as far as we could in the reform of local government, because it should be above party politics.  Yesterday, however, Minister Howlin's party indicated the extent of its commitment to reform and all-party consensus.  Some party members made a pre-emptive strike &mdash; it may not be the Minister's view but it was put forward as a Labour view which will go to congress.  It reminded me of the politics of nod and wink, an allegation we heard often from the Opposition when we were in Government. This was using local government as a political football.  To hell with local democracy and power and just be cute at this stage &mdash; pretend that the services do not have to be paid for and there are no costs, get rid of service charges because that would be popular in Dublin or elsewhere, try a little sleight of hand and fool the electorate again.  The Labour Party talk about sleight of hand in financing local authorities.  The Minister's colleague, Deputy Costello, issued a press statement on Monday, 2 <Col N="974" /> October, which stated that the Labour Party policy commission called for the abolition of service charges and the rates support grant.  The Labour Party is at it again.  What it did yesterday was bad for local democracy and power.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party proposals look good from a political point of view, although they may not look good from the points of view of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil or Democratic Left.  I presume it is trying to get back on side.  The newspaper headlines read &ldquo;abolish service charges&rdquo;.  Deputy Costello and his colleagues neglected to mention in the press release that they have consistently supported the charges.  The Minister supported them in this House in June or July of this year and they were originally introduced by a Labour Party Minister.  However, he wants to put that to one side.  The Labour Party is now describing service charges as a blunt instrument.  I have news for Deputy Costello &mdash; all forms of tax, such as income tax, commercial rates and VAT, are blunt instruments.</P>
    <P>The proposals announced with a fanfare by the Labour Party yesterday to abolish service charges are dishonest and another attempt to hoodwink the public.  According to the Labour Party they will cost approximately £160 million. I estimate that the cost is nearer to £400 million.  How will it pay for this abolition of service charges, which vary from £50 to £200?  It will pay for it by increasing or changing residential property tax.  In other words, it will bring back some form of rates.</P>
    <P>Who else does it propose should pay? It proposes that the old reliable, the motorist, should pay through increased motor taxation.  By my calculations and the figure of £160 million supplied by the Labour Party for this change in local government financing, the residential property tax yield would have to be increased by about 800 per cent.  I am sure householders will be very interested to know how the RPT yield will be increased by 800 per cent when there was so much squealing about the increases proposed last year, which <Col N="975" /> were subsequently changed by this Government.  Alternatively, a 75 per cent increase in motor and road taxation would not be very popular, along with the increase in tolls proposed by this Government.</P>
    <P>I hope the proposals of the Labour Party yesterday are not an indication of what the Minister for Finance meant when he said he would shift the emphasis from direct taxation in order to leave more money in people's pockets.  How long will people have more money in their pockets?  Will it last two days?</P>
    <P>This must all be seen in the context of other proposals &mdash; mostly made by Labour Party Ministers &mdash; such as a tax on videos and walkmans, which seems to have been abandoned recently, higher ESB charges, tolls and a tax on trucks, proposed by the Taoiseach.  Perhaps that is a debate for another day, but the Labour Party will have to do better than it did yesterday.  The Minister will have to ensure that people know Government policy in this area.</P>
    <P>It is important to mention these matters because we have not had a debate on local government for some time in this House.  Our parliamentary questions on the environment are pushed to one side because of various procedures in the House.</P>
    <P>I welcome the regulations which underline the progressiveness of this country in electoral law for local government over the last 20 or 30 years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the regulations which my party supports.  It is a modest but, nonetheless, significant measure to streamline our electoral laws and bring the rules and regulations for local elections into line with those in respect of general elections.  That is as it should be.  It is a tiny measure which gives additional status to locally elected public representatives at a time when, unfortunately, their status is low.  Therefore, this modest measure is to be welcomed on behalf of locally elected representatives, of whom I am one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="976" /> It is sad that locally elected representatives have been so stripped of function by successive governments since the formation of this State, that in many cases they are seen as a crowd of junketeers waiting for the next junket.  That is grossly unfair to the large majority of locally elected representatives because not all councillors are junketeers, just as not all priests are paedophiles.  A great deal of hard slog and grinding work which deserves recognition is done daily on behalf of our citizens by county and city councillors.</P>
    <P>There is some recognition of the importance of local elections in these regulations.  I support them and particularly welcome the part which seeks to speed up the counting of votes in elections. This country falls far behind others in terms of counting votes and the delivery of election results.  Sometimes candidates have to wait days for the result of an election.  That is particularly acute where a recount is called for, of which I have some experience. On three occasions in the past ten years my result has been the subject of a recount.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>A photo finish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if my 1989 election could be described as a photo finish as I was a respectable 92 votes ahead of the candidate who called for the recount, which yielded me an extra vote for which I was very grateful.  I think that 92 votes is a respectable margin.</P>
      <P>In the 1985 local election I was elected alderman in my ward.  That was a matter of particular pride to me because it was the first time &mdash; and likely to be the only time &mdash; that I headed a poll in an election.  I was just about to be declared elected first past the post when a candidate down the field demanded a recount.  All the votes were put back into the melting pot.  It was two days later before the final result was announced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are inordinately slow in delivering election results.  Any mechanism that <Col N="977" /> could be put in place to speed up results ought to be worked at and must be welcomed. There is a modest measure in these regulations that would help to open up this debate and speed up the counting of votes.  However, a great deal more needs to be done.  We should work towards the electronic counting of votes, as is the norm in most other European countries.  It marks us out as being an inefficient country when there is so much delay between the casting of votes, the finalisation of the counting of the votes and the delivery of results.  It is unsatisfactory in a modern European democracy and is a matter that ought to be addressed.  I ask the Minister to give it his attention in the future.  It would be good for the overall perception of the country abroad as one that deals with these matters efficiently, speedily and well.  It is also important for the nerves of candidates, especially those fighting for the last seats in multi-seat constituencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been looked at, but given the transfer of votes under our PR system it would be difficult to implement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult.  We will have a question and answer session on this later.  If something could be done, even with our very difficult PR system, it would be welcome.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the provision increasing the amount of the deposit.  This, in its own subtle way, will add to the status of candidates.  No good purpose is served when, for a very small deposit, citizens can take it upon themselves to offer themselves as fun type candidates at election time.  It is important that we discourage this happening in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the point made by Deputy Dempsey with regard to indicating more clearly the presence of polling stations on polling days in view of the new regulations that have been put in place in respect of postering.  It is important, especially in urban areas, to indicate more clearly the location of polling booths.  Since the level of activity <Col N="978" /> around these booths has been rightly reduced, citizens often cannot identify the location of a polling station.  It is important that this matter be rectified. It may not be necessary to allow for party political posters; the matters may be addressed by having sufficiently visible posters indicating the presence of a polling booth in a given area.  Something needs to be done to fill the vacuum that has been created by the putting in place of new regulations in respect of canvassing in the general vicinity of polling stations on polling day.</P>
    <P>This is the second local government measure the Government has introduced this year.  In June it introduced the delimiting of the power of local authorities in respect of water charges. Now we have this set of regulations with regard to the holding of local elections. However, all we are doing here is tampering around the edges of local government when what is clearly needed and long overdue is radical overhaul, root and branch, of our local government system under the two key headings of function and finance.</P>
    <P>Since the foundation of the State, local government has always been framed as a creature of central Government. Efforts have been made by successive Governments to advert to this and to undertake some measure of reform.  However, no root and branch reform has ever taken place.  As a result we have a weakened fabric of democracy.</P>
    <P>Democracy is at its best where local government is strong and dynamic and where local citizens are seen to be involved in the making of decisions that affect their daily lives.  One only has to look at Denmark, where local government is strong and dynamic to see how involved are Danish citizens in the whole democratic process, the low level of alienation from democracy and the benefit accruing to democracy within a country from seeking to strengthen the fabric and fibre of local government.</P>
    <P>Increasingly Irish citizens are going abroad.  They can see the level and standard of services delivered in cities and <Col N="979" /> towns where local government is strong and has both the finance and the power to deliver services efficiently at local level.  Very often it is the level of local services that determines the quality of our daily lives.  They are as important as services such as public health and education. The quality of our footpaths and our roads, the quality of the cleansing that is undertaken, the quality of public lighting, the number of books that we have in our public libraries are all factors that determine the quality of lives of our citizens on a daily basis.</P>
    <P>Where local services are delivered to a high standard, there is a citizenry interested in politics, pleased with the result and prepared to pay.  This has not been the case in this country for a long time.  Part of the reason there is such a reluctance on the part of citizens to pay is that they do not see value for money nor a good standard of local services. Added to this is the natural reluctance of every citizen to pay more taxation. However, for the most part citizens are fair and, if they see a good return for their money and enjoy a good level of public services at local as well as national level, they will be more willingness to pay.</P>
    <P>It is time to have a root and branch reform of local government.  The point to which local government has descended can be illustrated by the manner in which even a matter as simple as our litter laws, including fairly recent litter laws, have been framed. There is an obligation on local authorities to administer the law, but whenever citizens who litter are taken to court, the proceeds of any fines must be sent on to the central Exchequer and cannot be retained in the local government area.  That is a measure of how central Government views local government.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of issue that must be tackled in the context of the plans and proposals the Government tells us it now has in respect of the reform of local government.  I understand that two commissions are currently sitting, one to <Col N="980" /> tackle the overall issue of reform of local government and the other to tackle the thorny issue of its financing. That being the case, there is an urgency about having the deliberations of these commissions dealt with as quickly as possible, so that the long overdue reforms that we have all requested can be put in place.  It is as important for the future of the country to deal speedily and efficiently with these matters as it is to deal with issues such as crime and unemployment.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a key point in the context of the reforms in the knowledge that the Minister represents an urban constituency and is aware of the particular needs of cities and the special recognition which must be given them in any reform of local government or change in terms of finance or functions.  I wish to give one example to illustrate my point, the funding of city roads.</P>
    <P>On 26 July last the Minister for the Environment announced that the Government had approved proposals for a major ten-year restoration programme for regional and county roads. While this announcement was correctly given a general welcome, it is a matter of severe disappointment that county boroughs, by which I mean city streets and roadways, have been excluded from the scope of the programme.  Moreover, the exclusion of such roads and streets from additional funding this year has very serious implications for the condition and upkeep of city streets, link roadways and others in housing estates in all borough areas.  It also has additional implications for footpaths.</P>
    <P>In 1992 the City and County Engineers' Association highlighted the particular needs of urban areas.  The Cork City Engineer has repeatedly referred to the needs of Cork city.  I do not refer to the position in Cork to be parochial &mdash; the circumstances which apply to that city apply equally to others &mdash; but because I am familiar with its problems. The huge growth &mdash; in excess of 500 per cent &mdash; in the number of cars since the 1960s is particularly noticeable in urban <Col N="981" /> areas because of their large concentrations of population and the fact that they are major focal points for work, commerce and leisure.  During that time there has been an even more drastic increase &mdash; estimated at approximately 5,000 per cent &mdash; in the number of heavy goods vehicles.  This type of traffic has a disproportionate adverse effect on city roads and streets.</P>
    <P>The explosion in the level of traffic since 1976 has had a very deep and critical impact on our streets.  This is due mainly to the nature of city streets, the multiplicity of junctions and the consequent need for motorists to stop and start, turning movements and travel at lower speeds.  These factors have caused untold damage to city streets, roadways and pavements over a prolonged period.  This damage is far in excess of the damage caused to county roads and wider national primary roads. It is clear that these roads were never designed to cater for this level of traffic in the first instance.  However, we must now deal with the problem and make provision for it when planning for the future.</P>
    <P>In addition to the explosion in the volume of city traffic and the change in nature during the past ten years, severe budgetary restrictions have led to inadequate investment in road maintenance. This problem is now so critical it must be given special attention and special budgetary provision must be made for it in the context of any local government reforms.</P>
    <P>Footpaths which represent a very high proportion of the roads network in urban areas &mdash; they account for approximately 30 per cent of the roads network in Cork city &mdash; are also in a critical condition. The maintenance of footpaths is a cause of particular concern to Cork City Council.  A fair illustration of the problem is the number of public liability claims made against Cork Corporation in recent times.  Despite the best efforts of city managers to reduce public liability costs, annual liability is running at an average of £1.5 million.  These claims have generally outstripped funding from <Col N="982" /> central funds, by which I mean block grants and special scheme funds.  It is not in the best interests of ratepayers or taxpayers to allow this situation to continue or to allow footpaths to remain in a condition which can be exploited by unscrupulous citizens, aided and abetted by unscrupulous lawyers.  The best way to put these people out of business is to bring footpaths up to a condition which will ensure safety for all citizens.</P>
    <P>The escalating crime problem in cities makes the provision of a proper and modern public lighting system essential. This is adjudged by the Garda as a key and important factor in the battle to contain and control criminals and deemed by citizens to give a measure of protection and security in a crime ridden era.  Many people have complained to me about the poor public lighting system. The protection and security provided by a proper and modern public lighting system must be taken into account when making provision for cities.</P>
    <P>I could refer to other issues such as cleansing, waste and other elements which make cities very complex and difficult areas to run efficiently.  I referred to the situation in regard to roads to illustrate my point.  The key point I want to make is that the particular and peculiar needs of cities can no longer be ignored and must be taken fully into account in any new system of funding of local government.  I make this point in the knowledge that the Minister represents an urban area and has a clear understanding of these matters, probably has a better understanding of those issues than a Minister based in an urban town or a country area.</P>
    <P>I have made a strong case for local government reform.  The issue of local government funding is not and never will be an easy one.  Any change in such funding will be met with public resistance, particularly if considered to be additional to current payments.  Citizens need to know that if required to pay extra for local services they would be <Col N="983" /> required to pay less to central Government. Citizens are aware that the most cost-effective system that could be put in place is one whereby services would be administered, designed and funded locally.  There is a major case to be made for the reform of local government funding which should be done without delay.  Any changes in such funding will breed hostility in some quarters and be met with resistance in many others.</P>
    <P>I said here on more than one occasion that my party is prepared to support the Government's introduction of any reasonable system of financing local government.  If the cost of local government services were increased our key requirement would be that there must be a corresponding decrease in the amount the taxpayer would be expected to pay to local government.  Taxpayers cannot be expected to pay for additional local government funding.  That will not work.  Unless and until a root and branch reform of the type I outlined is put in place, I am not optimistic that these regulations will make a difference.</P>
    <P>I fear that unless the local government system can be radically reformed, conscientious people will not be encouraged to enter local politics because, if elected, they would be frustrated by being in a position they could achieve very little and in which would have very little power.  If that continues it will not be good for politics or democracy.  Most of those who go on to become effective politicians at national level learn their trade and cut their teeth at local level.  I firmly believe that it can no longer be ignored that the quality of local government services determines the quality of life of many of our citizens.</P>
    <P>I welcome and support these regulations and look forward to their implementation. I look forward to a more comprehensive debate on local government funding and finance at a more appropriate time.  Essentially this debate relates specifically to these regulations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the minor but important local elections regulations.  This measure will ensure that the rules and laws governing the holding of local elections will be the same as those governing general elections, about which we have learned so much over the years.</P>
      <P>I take my cap off to the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, who decided some years ago, if I recall correctly, to introduce a provision to ensure that there would not be a circus of activity outside polling stations on polling day.  That was a noble decision.  I could never see the need for such activity whereby candidates, irrespective of who they were, positioned themselves adjacent to the polling station.  I do not consider such activity had the slightest influence on how people voted.  That has been shown to be correct now that such a circus has been prohibited.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dempsey suggested that the provision relating to such activity may have gone too far because election day, particularly in rural areas, does not seem to be the same as it used to be; now people hardly know where the polling station is.  I would be slow to reintroduce a system under which on the morning of polling day parties would compete to erect the largest poster.  Perhaps we should leave well enough alone or there should be some public indication as to the location of polling stations.  I will not stay up at night worrying about the matter, but I believe the provision to prohibit such activity was a step in the right direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the Minister's speech, and my understanding, it appears that we are ahead of many European countries in that non-nationals here are entitled to vote in local government elections.  I understand many member states will introduce similar legislation. If the European Union stands for freedom and flows of money, jobs and skills across national boundaries, it is important that all candidates should be allowed to stand for election to local authorities irrespective of whether they <Col N="985" /> are nationals or non-nationals.  I do not believe that anybody would object to that and I am sure that measure will be widely welcomed.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a technical matter to which I, as a politician and a member of Galway County Council, do not give a great deal of thought.  I never spend much time worrying about what happens the day after polling day.  I worry about what goes into the ballot box, not what comes out of it.  The ballot papers are tightly sealed in the ballot box and one can do very little once the decisions are made.  As a politician I hope that the counting procedures at polling stations will keep in step with modern technology and that people will not have to hang around polling stations during counts.  An accurate and full account of the election results should be available as the public are particularly interested in what is happening in the hours following the opening of the ballot boxes.</P>
    <P>The balance has been struck correctly in terms of the deposits election candidates are required to lodge.  Local authority candidates are required to lodge a £50 deposit while urban council candidates are required to lodge £25.  The amount of such deposits will not prohibit candidates from standing for election.</P>
    <P>Through the years much has been said about devolving powers to local authorities and I have been involved in many debates as to how this might be achieved.  I welcome the Government's decision to set up a commission to consider the issue of devolution of powers to local authorities.  The reasons behind this measure, like those behind previous attempts to introduce such change, are sound.  There is a genuine anxiety at local and Government level to ensure there is a change in the powers of local government, and there is a good reason for that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill mentioned the degree of alienation between local politicians and their electorate.  It is difficult to understand why that should be so because nobody is more closely associated with what happens in a council <Col N="986" /> area than the local councillors.  I agree with other speakers who said that being a member of a local authority is not an exciting prospect.  It could be argued that being a TD is not an exciting prospect either, but we move in a different circle.</P>
    <P>These are trying times for many of my political colleagues from all parties.  The public rightly believes it is entitled to high quality local services delivered in a professional manner but it appears many people do not consider they are getting value for money.  In the past many council services were too expensive. I do not intend detailing them here but on occasion those costs were out of kilter.</P>
    <P>I have noticed that single issues which crop up in council areas generally tend to take on a life of their own.  I am talking about issues such as housing and the public objecting to minority groups being housed in certain areas.  On such occasions it is not pleasant being a local councillor because, for whatever reason, the anger generated at public meetings is directed at local authority members even though they may have had little to do with the decision which may have been taken in the Dáil or at some other level.</P>
    <P>We will have to address some other matters if we are to avoid the prospect of major problems arising in our local democracy.  Along with my fellow councillors in Galway I was invited some months ago to a conference organised by our new county manager.  Its aim was to examine the corporate image the public had of our local authority and what that image should be five years from now.  Various discussion groups of councillors from all parties were formed and we were asked to consider what we should do in Galway County Council over the next five years, other than try to be re-elected.  The outcome of those discussions was heartening.  Galway County Council is not any different from most other councils but those discussions clearly showed that, if given the opportunity to make them, councillors <Col N="987" /> were prepared to make the hard decisions.</P>
    <P>The charge is often levelled at local councillors that they never make the hard decisions.  They will not make them if they did not create the problem they are trying to resolve.  We must remember that decisions taken by local authorities directly affect every household in the local authority area whether it is to do with the fire service, libraries, rates, water charges, refuse collection, etc. There is always a connection.  We must put in place a system whereby local people will know they have a well run local authority which provides a quality service at a fair price.  That is what we should mean when we talk about devolution of power.</P>
    <P>Many councillors are concerned that they are now regarded as being merely part of a regulatory body.  In areas such as planning permission, design, the environment, etc. it appears that county councils only tell people what they cannot do rather than what should be done from a development point of view.  That does not wash with many people.  Local authorities must rethink the way they will operate in the future.</P>
    <P>I realise this matter has been referred to many times before but in regard to the £3,000 new house grant, why cannot my local engineer in Mountbellew carry out the inspection and approve payment of the grant?  Our local engineer is as qualified as the Department of the Environment engineers.  Why must the inspection be carried out at a higher level?  It should be remembered that the local engineer is the one who examined the site on which the house stands and if he was sufficiently qualified to decide where the house should be built, he should be allowed to inspect it for grant purposes thereby allowing the grant to be paid locally.  I do not understand why that cannot be done.</P>
    <P>A new disquieting issue has entered the equation in the past year.  I am referring to the National Roads Authority. Every five years, county councils review the speed limits in towns and villages. <Col N="988" /> Speed limit extensions bestow great privileges in many ways <i>vis-à-vis</i> the granting of planning permission, etc, in local areas.  They are normally regarded as the town and village boundaries and town planning is usually undertaken within the speed limit zones.</P>
    <P>Galway County Council's five year review of the speed limits was carried out some months ago.  Our entire technical staff, local gardaí and garda superintendents, representatives of the local community and the town development associations put an enormous effort into deciding on reasonable extensions of the speed limits.  That went on for the best part of a year.</P>

      <P>The National Roads Authority, without telling anybody on what it based its decision, decided to do the opposite.  I cannot understand the connection between local government and what actually happens in other nationally based institutions.</P>
      <P>The local electoral regulations are a step in the right direction.  They will bring local government elections into the same arena as general elections.  I do not expect anybody will have problems with them.  I fully support the regulations before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  I welcome the publication of the statutory instruments in principle.  I recognise that what is involved is mainly technical change, arising out of the necessity to implement the EU directive, in so far as the candidates are citizens and residents of member states.  The Minister referred to the fact that in 1963 Ireland extended the right to vote at local elections.  An extension of this is that people can now <Col N="989" /> stand as a candidate either in Ireland or in any of the member states.  That is a welcome development.</P>
      <P>There are many other technical requirements to which I would like to refer briefly.  I note that some of the general duties of the returning officer have changed, especially in relation to decision making.  Heretofore the decision of candidates was necessary. Why is that not still part of the regulations? I suggest we look at the feasibility of including some provision for the agreement of candidates.</P>
      <P>I note the deposits required of candidates at local elections which were £5 and £10 have been increased to new amounts of £25 and £50.  I accept they are not huge amounts but they are huge increases.  We should look at them with a view to avoiding such increases in the future and consider how they can be accommodated by means of index linking or whatever.</P>
      <P>I welcome sections 42 to 48 which deal with voting by special voters.  I welcome any development where we can further improve the availability of services for special voters.  Section 56 deals with the arrangements for the actual poll, for example, the use of schools and public premises by returning officers. Those of us who have sought election have had many complaints in relation to the choosing of facilities.  I appreciate it is difficult to draw a line concerning whether the electorate should vote in one facility or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this House I represent the constituency of Dublin North Central, and in the Dublin Corporation, the ward of Dublin-Clontarf.  On many occasions constituents have complained that although across the road from where they live there is a polling station, yet they are required to cross a couple of main roads and, perhaps, bypass one or two other polling stations to go to a polling station down the road.  I am not sure how we can reach agreement and identify the electorate who would use these premises but I believe there is a better way.  I suggest the Minister examine the feasibility of having agreement with <Col N="990" /> identified local groups, the local public representatives or people who would be able to assist in the identification of the most suitable facility for a particular catchment area.</P>
    <P>An issue which most of us have come across is the huge number of people involved in administration on the day of polling who are unable to cast their vote.  It is regrettable that the mechanism that enables many citizens to exercise their right to vote is not able to accommodate people who may not be working in their own electoral ward or constituency ward to allow them the right to vote.  I would like to see a mechanism put in place to allow such people to vote.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to item 124 of the regulations which deals with persons elected to one or more electoral area.  Who would want the hassle, the trouble and all that goes with it?  I recognise we live in a democracy but I do not know whether it is correct that one can be elected to multiple constituencies.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made by some speakers to the calibre of candidates. The power they should be able to exercise at local level has been questioned recently.  If there is not sufficient reward and if one cannot make a sufficient input at local authority level where real power is exercised, it will curtail the number of candidates and the amount of good work that can be carried out at that level.  We have seen one such issue in the last 24 hours.</P>
    <P>One of the Labour Party members is present.  The Labour Party has been in Government for a number of years, yet its policymaking commission seems to want to distance it from its responsibilities in Government.  It is ironic that the Labour Party, of which the Minister for the Environment is a member&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions <Col N="992" /> Nos. 1, 5, 15 and 28 together.  My views on the inadequacy of the basic rates of social welfare entitlements are already on record.  I consider that they need to be greatly improved.  Discussions are under way with the ESRI to give effect to the commitment in the programme for renewal to carry out a review of the minimum adequate income rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Draft terms of reference and a timescale for a study will be finalised in the next few weeks.  The review will be completed by mid-1996.  The completion of the ESRI review will coincide with the tenth anniversary of the publication in 1986 of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>The ESRI review will consider the adequacy of the rates of social welfare benefits and allowances.  The study, along with ongoing reviews of the Commission on Social Welfare's recommendations and taking account of a number of other key reports expected, such as that of the expert working group on the integration of tax and social welfare, will form the basis for the formulation of proposals for improvements in the social welfare system in the years ahead.</P>
      <P>The question of funding these improvements will be considered in the light of the resources available when the extent of the requirement is quantified and in the context of the commitment in the programme for renewal for the maintenance and development of the social insurance system.  In the meantime, the priority rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare in 1986 have been implemented since 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, as the ERSI and others have identified families with children as being at greatest risk of poverty, I have taken a significant step towards addressing that issue in this year's budget. Social welfare and related improvements which I am implementing will cost £90 million in 1995 and £212 million in a full year.  The increase in child benefit will account for 38 per cent of the cost of this year's budget improvements <Col N="993" /> and almost 50 per cent of the full year cost.</P>

      <P>The Minister recently committed himself publicly to a basic social welfare rate of £80 per week.  The basic rate for non-contributory pensioners is £62.50.  What is the estimated cost of bringing it up to the Minister's suggested rate of £80 per week?  Where does he propose to get the money, given that the Minister for Finance has required him to surrender some areas under the aegis of his Department to find savings of £630 million?</P>

I did not make such a statement and I am sure the Deputy, being a Fianna Fáil spokesperson for Social Welfare, is well aware that I did not make such a promise. What I pointed out was that if we were to implement the higher range of the recommended rate of the Commission on Social Welfare we would be <Col N="995" /> providing £80 per week to individual claimants.</P>

      <P>It is a mistake to view this issue purely in terms of <Col N="996" /> obtaining additional EU funds for Ireland.  To do so is to misunderstand the role and importance of a further EU poverty programme.  From Ireland's point of view the issue is not a budgetary one.  The real question is what we can do about the gulf between those European citizens who benefit from increased economic growth and those who do not.  Given the objective of a single European market and a political and economic union the value of a European wide anti-poverty programme is that it would create the circumstances for a comparative approach to poverty and social exclusion and thus opportunities for a transfer of experience between member states.</P>
      <P>A further EU poverty programme would also be of importance in ensuring that issues of poverty and social exclusion are central to EU policies and programmes generally.  Article 2 of the Treaty of the European Union recognises that one of the tasks of the Union is to maintain economic and social cohesion and solidarity between all the member states.  The Commission and all member states need to ensure that this aspiration is given real meaning in the day-to-day operations and policy making of the Union.</P>
      <P>The Government is keeping poverty and social exclusion to the forefront on the national agenda by initiating the development of a national anti-poverty strategy.  The strategy will involve all Government Departments drawing up specific plans to target poverty in society in consultation with and participation by people particularly affected by poverty and social exclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, a proposal for a fourth EU poverty programme to combat social exclusion, which requires unanimity, has been blocked by Germany and the UK.  The German Government has objected not only to the timing of the new programme and to doubling the budget, but also raised objections in principle to the proposal. The proposal requires the unanimous acceptance by all member states.  To date, all efforts by the Commission and <Col N="997" /> other member states, including personal interventions by myself on behalf of the Irish Government, have not succeeded in changing the German and UK Governments' opposition to this particular proposal.  It is clear that the objections to the specific proposal put forward by the Commission are deeply rooted.</P>
    <P>The issue of a follow-up to the third EU poverty programme is on the agenda for the meeting of EU Social Affairs Ministers in Luxembourg tomorrow and I have had a meeting in advance with the current Spanish President of the Social Affairs Council who has offered support for my efforts to encourage our European colleagues to move this debate forward.  I will be pressing for an initiative which will give practical expression to Europe's aspirations and commitments to tackling poverty and social exclusion, while taking account of the concerns and views of those who have opposed the specific proposal tabled by the Commission.</P>

I have gone so far as to appoint a special representative of my Department in Brussels to pursue this and <Col N="998" /> other matters on behalf of my Department.

      <Quest>if local authority tenants are currently entitled to claim rent allowance under the provisions of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</Quest>
      <QRef>[13974/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme was introduced in July 1977 and is now incorporated in sections 170 to 191 and 266 to 269 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 179 of the Act provides that where a person's weekly income by way of supplementary welfare allowance or from any other source is not sufficient to meet their needs, they may be granted an increase in their allowance or be paid an allowance to supplement their other income.  This section enables the Minister to make regulations prescribing the circumstances under which payments may be made and this <Col N="1001" /> was done in article 6 of the Social Welfare (Supplementary Welfare Allowance) Regulations, 1977 as amended.</P>
    <P>Local authority tenants pay a differential rent which is income-related, in respect of their accommodation. Responsibility for making and amending differential rent schemes was passed to local authorities in August 1986. Guidelines issued by the Minister for the Environment at the time require local authorities to ensure that rent schemes adopted by them are based on certain broad principles.  One of these is that the rent payable should be related to income and a smaller proportion of income should be required from low income households.  A further requirement is that provision should be included for the acceptance of a lower rent than that required under the terms of the scheme in exceptional cases where payment of the normal rent would give rise to hardship.</P>
    <P>While local authority tenants are not precluded from applying for rent supplement under the current provisions of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, it has been the policy of my Department not to pay rent supplements to tenants of local authority accommodation.  It is considered that the need for such supplementation should not arise because of the nature of the differential rent schemes, that is, the ability of the local authorities to relate rents to household income and the option to invoke the hardship clause where appropriate.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the payment of supplements in such cases would result in an inefficient use of resources with two Departments of State individually addressing the same problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to outline to the Minister what is happening in my constituency in respect of supplementary welfare payments.  One of my constituents pays £20 per week rent for a local authority house and another, who earns a similar income and has the same number of children, lives in accommodation <Col N="1002" /> rented from a landlord.  The person living in the private rented accommodation receives a supplementary welfare allowance whereas the local authority tenant does not.  Surely that is discrimination. Health board officers find it difficult to refuse supplementary welfare allowance to local authority tenants. Will the Minister examine the question of paying such tenants a supplementary welfare allowance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the case outlined by the Deputy appears to discriminated against local authority tenants. As I stated in my reply, it would be more acceptable for local authorities to deal with this issue because they already provide subsidised accommodation through the differential rent scheme.  It would be a waste of departmental resources for the Departments of Social Welfare and the Environment to implement rent assistance schemes when the local authorities could invoke the hardship clause to assist people in such circumstances or take into account the supplementary welfare allowance rates when implementing their differential rents schemes.</P>
      <P>The purpose of differential rent schemes is to ensure that the rents applicable to local authority tenants are related to their income.  If differential rents do not take into account the supplementary welfare allowance rates, the rents are deficient.  This matter should be raised with the local authorities who have the power to vary their rent schemes.  It would be pointless to introduce a new scheme for low income families and local authority housing when one already exists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is well aware that local authorities can go only a certain distance in regard to hardship cases, whereas welfare officers are generally aware of the cause of the hardship and, therefore, should be in a position to assist the tenant in some way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1003" />
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that community welfare officers are in a better position to examine the circumstances of individual cases, but the fact that they do not provide rent allowance does not preclude them from providing assistance in respect of other urgent or special needs.  It is merely a matter of policy that they do not provide a subsidy for rent when the rent is already being subsidised by the local authority. We should examine why local authorities are not addressing the question of having their rent structures related to the calculations community welfare officers make in respect of private rented accommodation.  That would be a much more effective and efficient way of dealing with the problem of local authority tenants.</P>
      <P>City and county managers who recently examined this issue concluded that they would not take a step in the direction I suggest because they consider that, even though they are on low incomes, the security of tenure and the option to purchase validates the higher rents local authority tenants must pay.  I do not accept that argument.</P>
      <P>The programme for Government includes a commitment to bring housing subsidies and assistance under one roof by allocating them to the Department of the Environment and local authorities and that matter is being addressed.  It would be a mistake for the Department of Social Welfare to accept responsibility for house subsidisation when we are examining the possibility of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme shedding the subsidisation of private rented dwellings.</P>
      <P>We must find a way of assisting people to secure accommodation other than through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which was never intended for that purpose.  It was merely intended as a special once-off safety net and not a support for families or individuals on a long term ongoing basis, as is the case with private rented accommodation at present.</P>

      <P>The expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems was established in July 1993 by the former Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare.  The terms of reference of the group are:</P>
      <P>To identify the problems arising from the interaction of the tax and social welfare systems and to identify the steps necessary to achieve greater co-ordination/integration of the two systems, with particular attention to the impact on people's incomes, and to the tax code, social welfare system, budgetary and administrative implications.</P>
      <P>The group was asked to prepare an interim report on measures which could be undertaken in the 1994 budget to reduce poverty traps and increase incentives to work and it presented this report in late 1993.  In this interim report, the working group made two specific recommendations for the 1994 budget.  These were the easing of the means test for lone parent's allowance to make it more attractive for lone parents to take up work, and abolition of the arrangement whereby employers of medical card holders had to pay the health contribution and employment and training levy on behalf of these employees.  Both of these issues were addressed in the 1994 budget and the necessary legislation was included in the 1994 Social Welfare Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group is now preparing its final <Col N="1005" /> report and seeking to complete it by the end of the year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The areas being examined in the final report include basic income in a fully integrated system. Under such a scheme social welfare payments and tax allowances would be abolished and replaced with a payment to everyone, regardless of labour force status, other income and family circumstances.  The problem with such a scheme is that if basic income is high enough to replace social welfare payments, very high tax levels are needed to finance it.  However, some variants, such as a partial basic income, require lower tax rates.  The group is examining the feasibility of such options.</P>
      <P>On child income support, one factor which contributes to poverty and unemployment traps is that social welfare payments include child dependant additions.  The group has been considering the question of shifting some of the support for children from CDAs towards child benefit.  A related issue is the commitment in the Government's programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, to introduce a new child benefit supplement payable to people on low and middle incomes to replace CDAs and FIS.  The group has been specifically asked to include child benefit supplement in its deliberations.</P>
      <P>The other issue being addressed is the unit of assessment.  Even if there will not be a major change in the system, such as towards a basic income scheme, a coordinated approach to the unit of assessment for the tax and social welfare schemes is worth examining with a view to removing some of the current anomalies in relation to, for instance, cohabiting couples.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of financing which the group is also examining, currently <Col N="1006" /> there are four direct charges on employee income &mdash; income tax, social insurance, the health contribution and the employment and training levy.  Each has a different basis, exemptions, ceilings, rates and so on.  This leads to a complex overall structure.  The implications of amalgamating some of these charges are being considered.  The group is also examining ways of making the overall system more conducive to employment creation.</P>
    <P>One of the main objectives of integration is to reduce the number of poverty and unemployment traps.  The group is examining some of the ways these can be eliminated within the existing systems, for example, by a more gradual withdrawal of the medical card.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree there is an obvious need to integrate the tax and social welfare systems because the FIS and tax exemptions overlap and as a consequence those in receipt of FIS pay tax at the marginal rate of 40 per cent?

      <P>As I indicated earlier to the Deputy's colleague, I do not intend to inform the House what I propose to do in the next budget. However, we intend to move to eliminate the anomalies in the tax and social welfare systems.  An expert group has been examining this matter for the best part of two years to identify how this can be done.  Because of the poverty trap to which the Deputy referred, an increase in earned income can result in a net loss in income for the person concerned. This is not an easy thing to do. That is the reason it is taking the expert group so long to examine all the issues. The tax and social welfare systems are extremely complex.  At this stage it would be best to await the report of the expert group which can be debated in full in this House to see what is feasible and to agree a timetable for implementation.</P>

All one has to do is ensure that the tax exemption limit is higher than the FIS limit.  It is as simple as that. Does the Minister agree that this is one element of the overlap which is so glaringly obvious and simple to remedy that he could give an undertaking now that no one in receipt of FIS in 1996 would <Col N="1009" /> be liable for taxation?  It is a simple question of adjusting the tax exemption rates.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Ceann Comhairle would prevent the Deputy reading the full text of what I said in 1994 and 1995 which is consistent with what I said now.  I said that, in principle, all income which is above a certain threshold should be subject to tax in an equitable way.  That is a position in principle in an ideal world but we do not live in an ideal world nor do we have an ideal taxation or social welfare system.  I do not agree with taxing child benefit because in the vast majority of cases we would take money out of the pockets of women working in the home whose only independent income is child benefit.  It is the one social welfare payment that goes almost exclusively towards the rearing and maintenance of children.  It cannot be shown that any other social welfare benefit goes directly to the intended target.  For those reasons I disagree with the taxation of child benefit despite the fact that, in principle, in an ideal world profits from land rezoning and so on should be taxed.  I will continue to argue for an equitable tax system but until we have <Col N="1011" /> one I will resist, tooth and nail, any attempt to tax child benefit.</P>

      <P>Dockers are generally employed on a casual rather than a seasonal basis and in most cases satisfy the contribution conditions for receipt of unemployment benefit for the days they are not working.</P>
      <P>Dockers who exhaust their entitlement to 390 days unemployment benefit require a further 13 paid contributions to requalify for benefit; while obtaining the necessary requalifying contributions they may claim means tested unemployment assistance.  Other dockers who do not satisfy the contribution conditions for unemployment benefit may also claim assistance.

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply is short and disingenuous.  Will the Minister of State confirm that if an ordinary worker works for three days and is off for two days he can claim unemployment assistance for the two days he is off, but if a docker works for three days and is off for two, his income is calculated on the three days he worked?  A sum of £15 <Col N="1012" /> and one sixth of the social welfare rate appropriate to the person is deducted. If someone was earning £62.50 per week you would deduct £15 and £10.  In that way they calculate means which often results in a casual worker such as a docker not being entitled to unemployment assistance on days not worked whereas people in other categories with the same income would be so entitled. Will the Minister confirm if he considers that to be a fair system?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should refer to his colleague who was in the ministry. It was during his era that the clause was introduced.  I appreciate the point made by the Deputy.  It is one which I made on many occasions.  Dockers are not regarded as seasonal workers in the ordinary way and the question as framed implies that they are.  Generally speaking, they are regarded as casual workers.  While I appreciate the points made by the Deputy, the matter has arisen in the past number of years as a result of legislative changes made about two and a half years ago.  I do not wish to be revisionist but that is the origin of the problem.  We must look at the position as it affects dockers.  I met some of their representative groups and consideration is being given to identifying ways to overcome the problems raised by the Deputy.  At this stage it would be inappropriate to proceed further until the report is available.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State has given the impression that most dockers are employed casually whereas many of them are not only employed casually but also seasonally; certainly in places like Galway, dockers will be laid off for two or three months at a time. Does the Minister of State think it tolerable that during those periods such dockers are not entitled to any unemployment assistance and are expected to live on the income they have earned from casual employment in better times of the year?  Is the Minister aware of any other group of workers expected to survive without the assistance of any social welfare or other payment during their periods of unemployment?</P>

I might remind the Deputy that position was the direct responsibility of his party colleague when in Government.  My Department is endeavouring to ascertain by what means it can address problems caused to dockers in those circumstances by previous legislation, whereby their earned income in any given year was assessed in determining their eligibility for unemployment assistance. That legislation was introduced by the Deputy's party colleague.  We hope to address it in due course.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 9, 12, 65 and 66 together. The first step in the process of transferring responsibility for the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme from the health boards to my Department, was taken when responsibility for funding the health boards in respect of disabled person's maintenance allowance expenditure was transferred to my Department with effect from 1 August 1995.</P>
      <P>The legislative basis for transferring the administration of the scheme will be contained in legislation to be introduced in this Dáil session.  It is my intention that the scheme will begin to be directly administerd by my Department in early 1996 following the enactment of that legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The transfer process is a complex one given the task of adapting what are in effect eight different administrative systems to produce one system.  The arrangements for the transfer of data from the health boards in relation to the existing claim load are under way and the detailed administrative arrangements which will apply in the new scenario are being devised.  The number and grades of staff required to administer <Col N="1016" /> the disabled persons maintenance allowance scheme by my Department will depend on the precise arrangements eventually agreed.</P>

      <P>Credited contributions have been an integral feature of our system of social insurance since its inception. They are essential to preserving the continuity of insurance cover for social welfare benefit and pension purposes. They are awarded for the purpose of maintaining a person's social insurance entitlements, already acquired by virtue of previous contributions, when for reasons beyond their control they are unable to make the requisite contributions themselves.  Contributions are credited to individuals in certain circumstances and under certain prescribed conditions.  The most common of these relate to periods of certified incapacity for work due to illness&mdash; during which disability benefit may be <Col N="1019" /> payable&mdash;and periods of proved unemployment&mdash;during which unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance may be payable.</P>
      <P>Credited contributions are reckonable only for the purposes of satisfying the second contribution condition applicable to social insurance benefits and pensions which requires that a minimum number of contributions be paid and-or credited in a specified period. That is usually the last complete tax year before the benefit year in which the claim is made.  The first condition which must be satisfied requires a prescribed number of paid contributions, thereby ensuring a certain level of attachment to the social insurance system over the insurance lifetime of the insured worker.</P>

If they had not worked until 1973 and had worked from 1973 to 1993 they would be entitled to a full pension.  Is the credits system, therefore, operating equitably?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a complex issue which requires change.  There was an opportunity to address this problem in 1988 when a new Pensions Act was introduced to take into the scheme people who had been self-employed for a number of years.  I presume the Deputy is referring to post-1953, not 1973.  The problem is the average of contributions over the period of years. The earlier the person was registered in insurable employment the more difficult it is for that person to qualify for the minimum pension now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised this issue on numerous <Col N="1020" /> occasions when I was in Opposition and, try as I might, I never managed to succeed in getting an answer that addressed the problem from those on the Government side, and not because they deliberately tried to avoid it.  In so far as I can I will try to answer it.  There is a case to be made for addressing the anomalies which have been raised by a number of Deputies on both sides of the House.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the problem addressed.  I indicated to the House previously that I have asked a group in the Department of Social Welfare to examine the matter with a view to identifying how best that problem can be addressed.  The Pensions Board report dealt with this issue at some considerable length and, as it is the subject of another question, it would not be appropriate to proceed with the answer to it at this time.</P>

      <Quest>the total cost in 1994 and to date in 1995 of lone parent's allowance; the steps, if any, he is taking to pursue the other parent in order to ensure that they contribute towards the maintenance of the lone parent and the child.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 37, 42, 68 and 69 together. The &ldquo;Liability to Maintain Family&rdquo; provisions in Part IX of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, are based on the widely-accepted obligation on people to maintain their spouses and their children.  Under the legislation, where a lone parent family is dependent on a social welfare payment, the person who is liable to maintain that family must contribute to the Department towards the cost of the family's income support.</P>
      <P>By the end of 1994 the number of maintenance orders transferred to the Department amounted to 425 and this figure had grown to more than 530 at the end of August 1995.  Total receipts from liable relatives amounted to some £260,000 in 1994.  Receipts in 1995 to the end of August amount to some £220,000 and are expected to reach £300,000 by the end of the year.  In 92 per cent of cases, the receipts result from the transfer of maintenance orders.  At the end of August 1995, 232 liable relatives were contributing to the Department on a regular basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Applications to the District Court for an order against a liable relative who fails or neglects to contribute towards the cost of payments to his family will be considered when all other efforts fail. In dealing with such applications the court must be satisfied that the liable <Col N="1022" /> relative is able to pay.  Cases will be pursued to these lengths where the circumstances warrant this action.  No application has yet been made for a court order against a liable relative.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>My question related to the steps taken to pursue the other parent to ensure they contribute to the maintenance of the lone parent and the child.  There are several thousand lone parents, specifically those in receipt of what was the unmarried mother's allowance. There are also several thousand cads who abandon the mother and child and leave the taxpayer to fund their upkeep.  How serious is the Department about pursuing those individuals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The identification and pursuit of putative fathers in unmarried cases and the need to interact more effectively with family mediation services at the initial desertion or separation stage, to ensure the maintenance issues are resolved are some of the issues that emerged during the operation of the system.  A series of procedures are put in place and proceeded with if the Department's officials are satisfied that the person who has gone missing, so to speak, is in a position to pay.  The situation of those who are not in a position to pay, those who are dependent on a social welfare payment, such as unemployment assistance, is taken into account because in the normal course of events that individual would be getting the single person's rate.</P>
      <P>The operation of the provisions, including their applicability to unmarried parents, is being reviewed in the context of the proposed introduction of a unified lone parent support scheme announced in the 1995 budget.  The issues I mentioned will be considered in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Expenditure on lone parent's allowance in 1994 amounted to £170.5 million in respect of 40,700 lone parents.  In 1995 it is estimated that £192.6 million will be paid in respect of 44,000 lone parents.  Expenditure on deserted wife's <Col N="1023" /> allowance is £6.4 million in respect of 2,100 deserted wives in 1994 and £6.8 million in respect of 2,100 deserted wives in 1995.  Expenditure on deserted wife's benefit is £65.8 million in respect of 13,700 deserted wives in 1994 and £70.7 million in respect of 14,200 deserted wives in 1995.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>They are alarming figures&mdash;£170.5 million for 40,700 lone parents last year and an estimated £192.6 million for 44,000 lone parents this year.  What contribution is made by the other parents towards the maintenance of those lone parents and their dependants?  What steps is the Department taking to pursue these people? The taxpayers are paying up to £200 million to support lone parents and their dependants while, from my information, little effort is made by the Department to ensure the other parent makes a fair contribution to the upkeep of the mother and dependants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my initial answer I indicated the procedure followed.  An applicant is expected to give information as to the location and identity of the missing parent.  The Department then follows up such an application. Members who follow such cases will be aware of the procedures used to ensure as far as possible the elimination of abuse.  However there are difficulties in the best run houses, hence the scheme whereby maintenance payments are set against such fathers.  It had to start somewhere and it is progressing as indicated by the figures I gave initially. Deputies opposite can be assured the procedures for the protection of taxpayer's interests in such cases are being utilised to a greater extent than in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that a figure of £300,000 is insignificant in terms of the £200 million paid to lone parents and deserted wives?  He will remember speaking on this legislation which relieved the wife of the <Col N="1024" /> onus to pursue the spouse for maintenance. That responsibility was removed to make the scheme more streamlined and effective&mdash;the family would not have to recoup the money themselves.</P>
      <P>What resources is the Department using and how many staff are detailed to pursue those people?  Large numbers of them are not facing up to their responsibility to contribute to the upkeep of their families.  They may not come forward and it is the responsibility of the Minister and the Department to pursue them.  These are well-heeled people who are obliged to contribute to the maintenance of their families but are not doing so.  What plan does the Minister have to deal with this problem more effectively?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Resources are being deployed to do what the Deputy is seeking. A number of issues should be borne in mind.  The thinking behind the maintenance recovery measures is that if lone parents require social welfare support as a result of desertion, separation or unmarried parenthood, because of no or inadequate maintenance from their partners, the State is entitled to recover at least some of this cost from the liable relatives.</P>
      <P>The problem arises&mdash;this is what the Deputy does not address&mdash;in that quite a high proportion of such people are themselves in receipt of unemployment assistance or benefit.  In that situation it is simple to determine the other partner's income.  Areas differ greatly but of cases I have dealt with both in Opposition and in Government, a high proportion involve the Department paying social welfare to the other partner also. In such cases there is not much sense spending time and energy pursuing such people because we have the information at our disposal.</P>

      <P>The school meals scheme was originally introduced in 1914.  Currently, under section 274 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, county borough councils, urban <Col N="1027" /> district councils and town commissioners are empowered to make arrangements for the provision of meals for children attending national schools within their areas.  Such meals may be provided free of charge provided certain conditions are fulfilled.  These include, first that the local authority is satisfied that any of the children attending a national school in their area are unable, due to lack of food, to take full advantage of the education provided for them. In addition provision of meals may also be made in schools outside the local authority area if at least half the children attending the school reside in the local authority's functional area or in dwellings owned by the local authority. A second condition is that the local authority has ascertained that funds other than public funds are not available or are insufficient to defray the cost of the food provided.  A third is that the local authority has sought the approval of the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>Once such sanction is received, the local authority may recoup half the expenditure on such meals from the Oireachtas.  In practice, the Department of Social Welfare refunds 50 per cent of the participating local authorities' expenditure on food.  The other 50 per cent and any administration costs are paid by the local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed by the Minister's reply.  My question was whether the Minister had any plans to amend the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 to deal with the untenable position that children, especially at primary level, are going to school hungry.  I have been told by certain school principals in my constituency that this happens.  Does the Minister not agree it is appalling that in one part of my constituency children are going hungry and do not benefit from this scheme, while in another part other children do benefit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I tabled the question was to ask the Minister for Social Welfare if he would consider amending the Act to <Col N="1028" /> allow for a substantial expansion of the school meals facility.  In common with my colleague, Deputy Joe Walsh, I am disappointed that the Minister for Social Welfare is not here.  Questions are tabled well in advance, the rota is drawn up and it should be possible for a Minister to organise his calendar to allow him to attend this very important part of the democratic process.</P>

      <P>Although the legislation <Col N="1029" /> on school meals is within the remit of the Department of Social Welfare, in effect the Department is mainly the paymaster for 50 per cent of the costs relating to the provision of meals.  The local authority, not the Department of Social Welfare, is responsible for identifying schools where there is a need to provide free school meals.  Information on the potential number of children who might be eligible for school meals if the scheme was widened to include county councils is not held by this Department. Thus, an estimate of the costs involved cannot be calculated by the Department of Social Welfare.  I can give the Deputy statistics on the number of participating schools and the number of children facilitated, if that is required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the adjournment of the debate, I raised a number of issues in relation to the regulations, to which I hope the Minister will respond. <Col N="1076" /> If he cannot respond in the House, I would welcome a written response.  In principle, I welcome the regulations, which I hope will give us an opportunity to put the necessary EU regulations in place.  I ask for the sections which I identified to be clarified.  I also referred to the calibre of candidates for local elections, the input of those candidates and the need to give local authority members the opportunity to participate in real local democracy and meet a real challenge.</P>
      <P>The new system of payment of expenses to local authority members has been in place for over a year and should be reviewed.  I understand that the new system does not cover certain expenses which members incur in their duties and does not adequately compensate them for their outgoings.  I say that as a member of Dublin City Council.  I know that the regulations did not limit the number of meetings required &mdash; indeed, the Labour Party, which is in control of the civic alliance, has reduced the number of meetings of the city council, from in excess of 220 or 230 to 70 or 80, in line with the expenses we now receive. Many of my colleagues around the country may not fully appreciate the amount of work involved in Dublin City Council, which represents a population of over one million people.  The system warrants a simple review, with a particular focus on Dublin.</P>
      <P>Before the debate was adjourned, I referred to the Labour Party's announcement of its party policy document on the abolition of local service charges, for which it obtained as much press coverage as possible.  From what I can gather from press reports, the document states that the Labour group opposes service charges and that a Labour Party policy commission wants all service charges abolished and an end to paying a rate support grant to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How does this document fit in with Labour Party policy in Government? People should not be hoodwinked in this regard and there should be a clear <Col N="1077" /> understanding of the standing of this document.  What is its status?  When will it be implemented?  Deputy Ferris will speak next and perhaps he will respond to these questions.  Exactly how was it costed?  The Labour Party is aware of the huge costs for motorists in Ireland, which are in excess of the European norm.  In Dublin City Council, for example, which it controls, it has encouraged policies to discourage motorists from using their vehicles.  How does this all add up, when the proposals ask for the funds to be raised from residential property tax, motor tax and other such taxes?  It is a position that should be clarified.  Any party in Government should take on the responsibility of Government and we should be clear as to whether it wishes to get press attention or separate its roles in Government when on this side of the House it could make what we now see as failed promises.</P>
    <P>I have more respect for those involved in local authorities who take the sincere approach of supporting the requirement to give funding to local authorities.  The rate support grant is very important.  There are huge funds involved, given the millions of pounds allocated and the finance derived from such grants in each local authority area to cover the huge amount of expenditure that is required, for infrastructure from sewerage schemes to roads, footpaths, the provision of services and so on.  It is an issue that warrants a sincere approach.  I look forward to a response to the questions I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the points raised by my honourable friend, Deputy Callely, have no relevance to local statutory instruments, it is important that I respond to his remarks.  Whether the Labour Party is in or out of Government, through a specialised committee with an input from elected representatives and officers at constituency level, it continues to evolve what it sees to be a fairer way to approach the question of taxation and funding local authorities. <Col N="1078" /> Just because one's party is in Government one should not sit back on one's laurels and accept everything as a <i>fait accompli</i>.  This is especially the position when one sees these qualities in other parties that have been in Government, either with one's party or on their own. When Deputy Callely's party was in Government on its own, with no influence from the Labour Party, the Progressive Democrats or others, it suggested, through a White paper, that it would abolish service charges. However, the Deputy's party returned to power, did a U-turn and never implemented its suggestion.  At one stage the Deputy's party published a document calling for the abolition of local authorities.  However, the grass roots would not allow his party to do this, and thereby remove one of the most important elements of democracy.</P>

The status of the document is that of an internal document for debate within the party to see if, as a result of the decision of the previous Government and of this Government. the question of funding local authorities <Col N="1079" /> and the devolution of power to local authorities will be properly addressed. This means having the power and courage to have some form of fund raising at local level so that we can have all the flexibility and autonomy we want.  If that is the kind of power we are speaking about, it means that people like Deputy Callely will be asked to stand up and be counted.  It is only then that the Deputy will run with the hare and hunt with the hounds, as he has done in the past.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope my comments will redress some of the problems that arose from the previous contribution.  The record will show the efforts of the present Minister not alone to fund authorities properly under the existing unsatisfactory structure, but to restructure them to give real power back to people in the local areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had the pleasure and the honour to serve my county for 28 years.  I know something about the structures of local authorities, their funding and powers until a Government abolished rates on private property which created many of the problems we now have.  These regulations address the procedure whereby people may proceed to get elected.  One of the most important aspects of regulations in this area is that we make it easy for as many people as possible to cast their votes in all elections without departmental interference which can be catastrophic when it comes to the revision of boundaries as in the <Col N="1080" /> case of my local authority when a document was produced recently for it by the Department.</P>
    <P>Owing to the ham fisted revision of my constituency some people who have lived all their lives in specific areas adjacent to polling stations under the jurisdiction of South Tipperary County Council have been moved at the stroke of a pen into another voting area. Twenty-seven people previously in Dundrum now vote in Clonoulty West in north Tipperary.  This is an example of departmental interference in setting schemes for polling stations.  Having compiled a polling scheme identifying the suitability of various polling stations adjacent to people in rural Ireland, close to villages and, where possible, suitable buildings or indeed availing of the generosity of some private property owners to provide facilities to bring the poll as close as possible to the people, we in the county council electoral area were notified on Monday, 25 September last to reconsider some of these areas.  It was suggested that we close polling stations and move people from one area to another for voting purposes.</P>
    <P>There are enough problems in trying to convince people there is a genuine reason to vote especially at local authority level.  I share the views expressed by Deputy Connaughton.  Given the limited power left to us under the present structures to finance local authority organisations, our credibility with our electorate is diminishing all the time.  If we make it more inconvenient for people to vote we will reduce the voting electorate and may reduce the total valid poll.  This would be bad for democracy. The Department should recognise that local authorities go into great detail when devising polling schemes and endeavour to reflect the views not of political parties but of public representatives and community groups.  They do not lightly decide the location of polling stations.  They make their decisions in the interests of the electorate and in an effort to ensure that people will cast their votes for the candidates of their choice.  All the political parties in south <Col N="1081" /> Tipperary believe the Department should have no say in deciding schemes for polling stations.  Under the previous Act if the Minister was not satisfied with a scheme he could reject it and submit an alternative one, which is what happened last Monday.  We sent this scheme back to him.  The Department should give local authorities the power to decide the location of polling stations.  Decisions are not taken lightly and every effort is made to take into account the views of the public, whom we are elected to serve.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Connaughton's reservations about the autonomy being vested in the National Roads Authority. We continually make such provisions in legislation and then discover that the relevant bodies are not answerable to the House for their actions.  Although there are representatives of political parties on the National Roads Authority it is difficult to contact them or get them to meet locally elected representatives and local engineers to discuss the layout of roads or the routes for bypasses. Local authorities have to employ consultants to formulate proposals which will comply with the regulations laid down by the National Roads Authority. It is important to guard any powers we have.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the regulations dealing with postal voting and special voters. In other democracies in Europe and elsewhere where there is compulsory voting the ballot paper is the most irrelevant document in an election.  For weeks in advance of an election ballot papers are available in post offices, outside churches and in schools and Government buildings and people who wish to cast their vote by post in advance of the election are permitted to do so once the ballot paper has been authenticated by a post office official, a local government official or the county secretary.  This means people who have to be elsewhere either on holidays or business can cast their votes in advance of polling day.  The introduction of a similar system here should not pose any difficulties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1082" /> In Ireland receipt of the ballot paper is one of the final acts in the voting procedure. Before people are given a ballot paper they have to produce some form of identification and the ballot paper is then stamped by the returning officer.  If there is no stamp on the ballot paper when votes are counted it is declared null and void.  Consideration should be given to liberalising the system so that prior to elections ballot papers can be issued to people who know they will not be in their constituencies on polling day. That is a reasonable request.  When I tried to explain our voting procedure to people in jurisdictions where this system operates satisfactorily they found it very complicated.</P>
    <P>The special voters' list was devised in an attempt to address the problems experienced by sick people unable to cast their votes in polling stations.  Most people love to go to polling stations; it is part of history, a part of what they fought for and they like to meet people there.  However, many people are unable to go to polling stations because they are confined to hospitals or nursing homes, are in wheelchairs or are confined to bed at home.  Voters' names can be included on the special voters list once they have received a certificate from their doctor and answered the questions &mdash; some of which are insulting &mdash; on the questionnaire.</P>
    <P>Once the special voters list is compiled it should not be necessary for sick people to reapply for inclusion on it every October.  Despite the efforts made to keep the list up to date, unfortunately some people's names are omitted from it.  Even though names are removed from the list once the people leave an area, no effort is made to ensure they are put on it elsewhere.  Some people derive great pleasure from taking names off the list but find it difficult to put them on it elsewhere.  This may have to do with the fact that they know which way the person will vote.  Despite our secret ballot system, there is an extraordinary amount of information available on the way people vote.  This may be because people in a democracy &mdash; I <Col N="1083" /> am glad I live in one &mdash; are not ashamed to state their position on issues and the parties they support.</P>
    <P>It is important to provide every facility possible for people whose names should be on the voting register but have been omitted due to computer error.  I am aware of proposals to compile a late register two or three weeks in advance of an election and this would be a progressive step.  It is important to ensure that all people entitled to vote are named on the register.</P>
    <P>Time does not permit me to elucidate on some of the other provisions in the regulations.  It is important to have regulations in place and for Members to be given the opportunity to discuss their pros and cons.  People working at the coalface know the problems involved in ensuring that people can cast their votes.</P>
    <P>The comments made by my colleague and me on the attitudes of Governments, Government parties and Opposition parties towards local authorities are on the record.  There can be a change in attitude towards local authorities and the stronger and more independent they are in regard to funding and taking decisions, the better for democracy and all of us.  Sometimes local authorities are used as a forum from which representatives avail of the opportunity to bash governments.  That is par for the course.  My colleagues at local level who have not made it to national level like to avail of any opportunity to have a good political debate. That is part of democracy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the local elections regulations.  They are necessary to update our legislation in line with EU regulations.  Under those regulations nationals of other EU member states are entitled to vote in and contest local elections.  These regulations update our law in line with European regulations.  When cavassing in by-elections and local elections, I have received complaints from nationals of other EU members states about the fact that they are not entitled to vote in our national elections and perhaps that matter could be considered.  Many of those people wish to retain their national passports, but are willing to give their expertise to this country and pay taxes here.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note the increase in the deposit that must be lodged by those seeking a nomination for a local election, but I query the benefits of that change.  Deposits of £50 and £25 are required to be lodged by candidates in various local elections and such a sum will not prohibit candidates from standing for a local election.  The allocation of votes has decreased from one-third to one-quarter.  Having talked to people involved in local government and local election counting procedures.  I am aware that many counts take place to ensure that candidates do not lose their deposits.  If it is necessary to continue a count for another hour or more to ensure that a candidate does not lose £25 or £50, one needs to question the validity of a system where people are held in suspense for a number of hours and put under pressure.  Perhaps a 10 per cent quota could be imposed on the first count and it would not be necessary to hold subsequent counts if candidates did not reach that quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lack of power at local government level is worrying and we must <Col N="1085" /> encourage people to get involved in politics at that level.  Chambers of commerce, community and other groups appear to be more enthusiastic and have greater ability to cope with issues than local government authorities.  As a previous speaker said, the reason for that probably relates to funding.  In 1977 the Government of the day abolished rates on houses and, in doing so, removed the means by which local government mainly raised its finances.  Unfortunately, our party at that time, which was competing for votes, agreed that if it had been returned it might have introduced a similar measure.  It is easy to be wise in hindsight.</P>
    <P>The measure to abolish rates was a major step back from local democracy. In the past those who fixed rates decided where the money was spent or, if they decided to spend extra money, they had to justify it to ratepayers. When candidates canvassed in elections they had to justify local government expenditure.  Power entails responsibility and the holding of responsibility at the lowest possible level is extremely important.  At that stage we were promised adequate funding would be given to rate support grants to make up for the loss of the revenue derived from rates. That may have happened in the short term, but we are all aware that, regardless of what Government has been in power since then, it has not continued. As a consequence, moneys are handed down from the Department of Finance and, unfortunately, during the years they are increasingly handed down with tags attached.  If money is required to tar a section of a road or to build houses, certain criteria must be met. Local authority members can no longer make decisions on where it is best to spend money locally.  Not only must we improve voting procedures at local elections and counting systems, we must take a long hard look at our local democracy base.</P>
    <P>The accessibility of buildings used as polling stations must be reviewed.  Party activists can no longer stand outside stations and tell people how to vote, and <Col N="1086" /> that is only right.  However, in the past those activists could guide voters, particularly the aged or disabled, to the door of the polling station.  There may be steps or long paths leading to polling stations and now that we are preaching about the need to improve accessibility to buildings for the disabled and the aged, the Government should ensure that polling stations, where democracy starts, are accessible.  The booth in polling stations should be better signposted. I was in one last year in which there were six or seven booths and the lack of signposting gave rise to a good deal of confusion.  If we want to encourage people to vote we must make sure that polling stations are as accessible as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ferris referred to the right to the vote for those who are ill or the less abled.  It is unfortunate that a person must register in October to vote, perhaps 12 months prior to an election day. People may become ill in the meantime and, if so, they may not be entitled to vote.  We must introduce some system whereby a person who becomes ill can register to vote in their house, a hospital or wherever they may be, a shorter period than 12 months prior to an election.</P>
    <P>Foreigners are surprised that people who are not in the country on election day because they have to travel abroad on business are unable to cast their vote in an election.  If people need to leave the country on genuine business trips, perhaps on behalf of the State, and are unable to cast their vote on election day, it should be easy to document them and provide a facility whereby they can vote.</P>
    <P>The issue of local government services was the subject of recent banter across the House.  They include bin collections, water charges and other services. Many local authority costs have been increased as a result of European Union sanitation and other regulations, and I do not condemn them.  As a result it has been much more difficult to finance the small services that count from the point of view of local authority members, such as road lighting, maintenance of footpaths and other services. <Col N="1087" /> The situation would be better if local authorities were able to raise finance locally through a system.  We must try to come to grips with this problem.  I welcome the setting up of the commission and I am aware that the Taoiseach, the Minister for the Environment and many others are anxious that some good would come out of that.  However, unless there is cross-party support on this issue, that will not happen.  If the main parties in this House are not prepared to come together and find an acceptable way of refinancing local authorities, democracy at local level will die.</P>
    <P>Many suggestions have been put forward as to how this could be done, including the infamous property tax, the reintroduction of rates and the possibility of allowing local authorities to spend car and road tax revenue at local level.  Those suggestions may be acceptable in some areas but if we in Cavan-Monaghan, which has many county roads but few national primary roads, were forced to agree on the issue of road tax, for example, we would fare much worse than counties such as Louth in which the major towns of Dundalk and Drogheda are located in addition to two national primary roads.  These suggestions may appear simple on paper but they are much more difficult when one attempts to work them out in detail.</P>
    <P>The issue of housing estates is another area of concern to local authorities. Many private housing estates are being developed around the country and the builders of those estates do an excellent job, but what happens after ten years?  Who looks after footpaths and public lighting?  Who provides refuse collection and water supply services? The local authorities do that.  Under the old system, local authorities would have been able to collect full rates on these houses within a ten year period.  Today, although the authorities must provide the additional services, they do not have the ability to operate a proper rate collection system.</P>
    <P>The National Roads Authority was <Col N="1088" /> referred to by a number of people.  We can no longer ask the Minister for the Environment questions about the Monaghan town bypass.  That is only a small issue in national terms but it concerns a problem which is bringing the town to a standstill.  On Friday evenings, one might spend a full hour sitting in traffic and the National Roads Authority is not blamed for that: it is the urban councillors who are told they are doing nothing.  However, the problem is that the power to address that type of problem has been removed from them.  That whole area must be re-examined.</P>
    <P>Accountability can result in additional pressure being created but we must put that pressure back on the shoulders of local politicians.  It is easy to criticise the Government at local level; I did that &mdash; particularly when I was in Opposition &mdash; with many other county councillors.  Government members have also been known to criticise but that is because they are utterly frustrated with their lack of power.  I welcome the statement by the Taoiseach at a recent meeting where he addressed the setting up of the new commission.  He clearly stated:</P>
    <P>Democracy is about responsibility. Where democracy failed, as in Germany in 1933, it failed because people did not want to take responsibility for difficult choices.  Because of a combination of impatience, bafflement and fear they were prepared to hand these decisions over to an apparently charismatic leader, with appalling consequences. In Ireland, as elsewhere in Europe today, local government is the school of democracy.  It is at local level that voters and those they vote for take responsibility for decisions.  If local government is alienated from voters or if voters are alienated from local government, then democracy itself is weakened.  Society's capacity to deal cohesively with wider issues is also weakened.</P>
    <P>The Government must take the whole issue of local government seriously, be it at town commission, urban council or <Col N="1089" /> county council level.  We must make the necessary decisions to ensure that those elected by the people have at least as much power, and hopefully more, than other community bodies which are not answerable to anybody.</P>
    <P>This regulation is a first step in the right direction but much more needs to be done.  In a recent address the Minister for the Environment said:</P>
    <P>Powerlessness is the enemy of innovation and democratic participation. The principle of subsidiarity, that matters should be decided at the lowest practical level, provides the basis for an effective and democratic system of local government.  That principle is flexible enough to accommodate diversity.  While some services require a scale beyond county level, there are many others, particularly those involving direct service to the public, that can best be delivered at the level closest to the people.</P>
    <P>We must keep democracy at local level but it can only be done if we make the local electoral system accessible and available to everybody.  Above all, we must give it back some power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>These new regulations appear to be a tidying up procedure. Deputy Crawford was dissatisfied with some aspects of the regulations but they appear sensible to me.  As the Minister stated, the issue of non-nationals having a vote has already been provided for and in that regard we are ahead of our colleagues in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I became aware of a case recently whereby a person complained about not being able to vote in Dáil elections.  The person concerned put &ldquo;English&rdquo; as the nationality on the electoral form because he was born in England 40 years ago of Irish parents and returned here when he was two months old.  I realise the local authority would not be aware of that information but I often wonder if non-nationals enter their nationality as &ldquo;Irish&rdquo; on these forms. Perhaps that does not cause any great problem and in the case to which I <Col N="1090" /> referred the person would obviously qualify to vote because of his Irish parentage.</P>
    <P>In regard to the issue of the deposit, it is not really relevant whether it is £25 or £50.  One could argue that the deposit should be increased.  In the last local election I contested there were approximately 22 candidates on the ballot paper.  An adequate deposit figure should be agreed which would prevent people contesting an election as a joke. Otherwise, people will simply decide to put their names forward for election simply for the fun of it.  If there were 22 names on a ballot paper one could safely assume that eight or ten of those were serious contenders.  I do not have any objection to a deposit of £25 or £50 but if, as Deputy Crawford stated, people are merely putting their names forward to see if they can win a bet &mdash; I am not convinced that is the case &mdash; his suggestion as to how the votes are calculated may be worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>Having read one section of the Minister's speech twice I do not know what it means.  It reads:</P>
    <P>The regulations also include changes of a technical nature in the rules, bringing them into line with changes made in the Dáil election rules.  For example, there is a minor change in the format of the ballot paper, to provide that the surname of the candidate and the name of his or her party will be in large capitals, the forename and surname of the candidate will be in small capitals....</P>
    <P>Perhaps somebody would enlighen me as I cannot understand that.  Is there a misprint or did I miss something this morning?  The paragraph I have quoted does not make sense.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has said, this is part of the Department's programme.  I compliment the Department of the Environment on all the legislation dealing with electoral Bills over the past couple of years.  That does not mean I agree totally with everything that has been introduced.  Even in my time &mdash; three <Col N="1091" /> years &mdash; a number of Bills on this topic have been introduced.  For example, last year there was the Referendum Bill, the presidential election Bill and in 1992 an overall Dáil electoral Bill.  Obviously the Department has done some major work in that area in the past few years on which I compliment it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. G. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The concern raised by the Deputy has been taken into account.  At the back of the report there is a ballot paper which shows that the actual surname is in large print as well and it is followed by the party.  Beneath that, in small print, is the name and address of the candidate.  I think that meets the Deputy's concern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am encouraging other people to look at them carefully although I may not study them too well. Some of the changes made are welcome, including the fact that one can register for an election much later than previously.</P>
      <P>I have mixed views on the fact that candidates cannot stand outside polling stations.  I spent many a cold wet day outside polling stations.  I always thought I was doing a great deal of good, if not getting votes for the party certainly getting votes for individuals.  I never felt my day was wasted.  I spent most of my life doing it for other people rather than for myself.  This has left a void in the life of most people involved in elections.  One was running around like a scalded cat for three weeks prior to the election and did not stop until 9 p.m. on the day of voting.  Suddenly one is like a lost soul, almost not knowing what to do.  In time we will probably discover something new to do on that day. We will probably watch the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell, and others who are noted vote getters and get some innovative ideas.  On the day of the last election we were all lost and did not know what to do.  We thought we should keep out of the pub for at least another 24 hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1092" /> Deputy Crawford referred to the problem of people who are ill or away from home and the fact that there is no proper procedure for giving them a vote.  There are many more people than that involved.  Certainly, in Dublin where most elections are held on Thursday there are many people who live five or ten miles away from their job and because of late night shopping do not get home by 9 p.m.  It may be different in the farming community where it is probably a case of just strolling into town.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest changes we have to make is to change the day of elections. I am pleased there is some movement in that direction in that the referendum next month will be held on a Friday.  This will help people who are travelling back home and registered in the country.  We are all aware that in the past, various parties or candidates ran buses to get people home on the day of an election, but many people around the city will not be able to get home on time.  They leave home early in the morning to go to work and will not be home by 9 p.m.  On the Continent many countries have their elections on a Sunday. I do not know why we automatically rule it out.  I am pleased that an experiment is taking place next month. I hope that will be the first of different trials by the Department and that it tries a Saturday or a Sunday and see what is suitable.  Many people are automatically ruled out at present.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a few comments on local elections generally.  My comments will be coloured by my membership of a local authority in Dublin.  We have to try to get a candidate of a good calibre into a local authority.  To do that we must make the process meaningful and give local authorities power.  Not many members of the local authority with which I am familiar are employees, the majority are Members of this House, professional people or self-employed whose way of life has a certain flexibility. Not many have an employer, probably because they would find it difficult to get off work for meetings which <Col N="1093" /> are held during the day.  Local authorities, while they have to be aware of the inconvenience they cause to their own staff when meetings are held at night, should try to ensure that as well as having good candidates on the local authority there is a cross-section of society.  There is no point in all members being business people or Members of this House.</P>
    <P>Many changes have been made in Dublin City Council during the past couple of years as a result of the legislation passed last year.  It has not improved matters, particularly for those from working or middle class backgrounds. They need facilities to be made available to them and to have their expenses reimbursed.  I am not making a case on my own behalf because I am a Member of this House.  There are some people on Dublin City Council who are unemployed and a few who are employees who obviously have to take time off work and need to be reimbursed. The changes made last year have resulted in a large financial loss to them.  The council has reorganised itself, which means there are fewer meetings. This means that issues are not being teased out and dealt with as well as in the past.  That change last year was bad for democracy and individuals who needed the few pounds.  I realise there may have been anomalies in other areas around the country and some people in some counties may have done well as a result of the changes.  Certainly in Dublin they suffered a large financial loss.  I do not think anybody made money in any event; anything they got was a recompense for the time they had taken off work or for the money they had put in for the whole political gain.</P>
    <P>We talk here all the time about improving the facilities of Members. Local authority members have very few facilities.  At least here I have the use of a photocopier.  There was a time in Dublin City Hall when if you tried to make a few photocopies you hoped nobody saw you.  There has been an improvement in that area.  If you believe in the whole system certain minimum facilities <Col N="1094" /> should be made available to members. Colleagues who have been in this House for 25 years will tell one that things have improved very much so perhaps we are on a gradual upward curve.</P>
    <P>From the date of the next election TDs will no longer be able to run for the office of chairman of county councils or the post of Lord Mayor.  That is a body blow.  As a citizen born and bred in Dublin I aspire to be Lord Mayor at some stage but as long as I remain in this House that opportunity is denied to me.  I am sure Deputy Ring would aspire to be chairman of Mayo County Council at some stage and I cannot understand why it is necessary to deny Members that opportunity.  There might be some justification if one were in west Mayo and could not be in Dáil Éireann, I suppose we have to make laws for the whole country and not just for Dublin. Councillors who are not Members of this House are probably pleased but I do not see it as a positive move and do not think it boosts the status of Lord Mayor.</P>
    <P>We should try to make the role of local authorities more meaningful.  With more power comes more responsibility. A body that raises its own money has more power to make decisions.  All political parties agreed that rates on domestic dwellings should be abolished because the system was unfair and they were abolished in 1977.  The rate support grant was supposed to replace the income from domestic rates.  We have all complained and Dublin City Council in particular has complained strongly about its percentage increase in the rate support grant, especially when it was lower than that of other councils.  While it is true the rate support grant has not been up to the same level the Department is making special grants available to local authorities.</P>
    <P>I would like the whole system to be regularised.  There are no water charges in the Dublin City Council area and I think that is the reason the Department took a very hard line and tried to make us toe the line.  I believe a local sales tax <Col N="1095" /> is the way forward as it could be collected in a painless manner and the local authorities would have their own money.  Nobody knows whether VAT is paid at 21 per cent or 23 per cent and a 1 per cent or 2 per cent local sales tax could be collected in that way.  Last year figures were produced for the total tax take from residential property tax which was in the region of £14-£15 million. The total amount raised by service charges throughout the country was £40 million.  It was estimated that a 1 per cent local tax would have brought in more than the two combined.  I think that is the way we should go.</P>
    <P>It was regrettable that cutbacks were made in local authorities in the late 1980s although some might have been necessary at the time.  Departments such as Health and Education were squeezed between 1985 and 1990 but the money has been ploughed back to those Departments.  However, the Department of the Environment does not seem to have benefited, if money has been ploughed into it, it has not passed it on to the local authorities.  Local authorities have a far greater role and should be used to a greater extent to create employment.  Local authorities control huge areas and have potential for job creation.  They were squeezed between 1987 and 1988 and the money has not been put back into them although it has been invested in other Departments.</P>
    <P>Some local authorities around the country have a number of community employment schemes but there is no one on a community employment scheme in Dublin because of union objections.  Under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work I think the unions finally agreed to community employment schemes.  We could have 1,000 or more people working on community employment schemes as the work is there to be done yet it has not happened mainly because of objections from unions.  Tremendous work could be done under the local authority structure but all Governments have totally <Col N="1096" /> ignored that structure which should be used for employment generation.</P>
    <P>If the Government fell we would have an election within three weeks and the campaign would be short and sharp.  I remember the campaign for the last local elections which seemed to go on for six months because there was six months' notice.  By and large running for this House is easier because when it happens it happens and the flag falls at the same time for everyone.  One would almost be worn out from campaigning in local elections before the election takes place.  Having gone through such a campaign I would like to think we could give more power to local authorities and encourage good people on to them.  This would make their role more meaningful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>This is adult and European literacy week.  I am bitterly disappointed with the 1995 local authority regulations because account has not been taken of the campaign by people who cannot read or write to have a simple photograph of candidates put on the ballot paper.  When the elections in South Africa were held they put a photograph of candidates on the ballot paper.  A man from Castlebar, Ernie Sweeney, walked from Castlebar to my clinic to prove that he was serious about having the candidates' photographs on the ballot paper.  He has campaigned for this and brought the campaign to the Dáil, to every political party and he has gone around the country to preach the message of the forgotten people.  There is no one in the press gallery to take up this story because there is nobody to speak for them.  There are thousands of people who will not go into a polling booth to cast their vote because the presiding officer will have to get two agents from the political parties to witness the vote. That is downright degrading.  I do not blame them for not voting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people are represented by politicians nationally and locally and, like everybody else, they want to go into the polling booth and register their vote. Ernie Sweeney, who was illiterate and <Col N="1097" /> educated himself, has spoken throughout the country.  He was promised by all political parties that this matter would be examined.  As a public representative I appeal to the Minister to allow for the inclusion of a photograph on the ballot paper.  That is not too much to ask.  It is only right to give people who cannot read or write the opportunity to cast their vote at elections.  It cannot be done in time for the upcoming referendum, so I do not ask that, but it would be a great day for democracy if, in the next few hours, the Minister agreed to include in the local elections regulations for 1995 a provision allowing for photographs on ballot papers so that the thousands of people who cannot read or write can vote for whom they wish.  I also appeal to the officials to agree.  I do not know why there is such resistance to the idea.</P>
    <P>I would also like to see included in the regulations a provision to ensure that deposits are returned to public representatives within seven days of an election.  I know a public representative who, after 14 months, has not received his deposit back.  That is not right.  If a person was late in paying the £300 deposit his name would not be put on the ballot paper.  It is only fair, therefore, that anybody who has saved his or her deposit should get their money back.</P>
    <P>The regulations also give a discretion to the returning officer regarding the counting of votes.  Does that mean the count can start after the polling booth closes at 9 p.m. on the evening of an election?  That would be a good thing.  It would take us all out of our misery and enable us to sleep that night.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State has given me sleepless nights in regard to the question of the boundaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of powers, Governments, including this one, tend to do nothing, although when in Opposition they promise to give power back to the <Col N="1098" /> people.  At a county enterprise board meeting recently when a committee was being set up to try to create employment, a Department of Enterprise and Employment directive was read to the effect that no public representative can be a member of or represented on it, not even the chairman of Mayo County Council who is the number one citizen in the county and should be on any board in the county because county councillors and urban councillors &mdash; I am both an urban councillor and a county councillor &mdash; are accountable to the people.  Over the years Governments set up many boards.  There are so many now that one would need a degree to know how they all operate.  We have a county council, county managers, engineers etc., and every facility.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why powers cannot be given to the county councils.  Is there a hidden agenda?  Does the Government want to get rid of the public representatives, of urban councils and county councils because they are considered to be too much of a nuisance? At least public representatives are accountable to the people, and at the end of the year there is an estimates meeting at which the manager can be questioned about any expenditure.  That is not the case on some boards I know of.  I understand the system has been tightened up, but we have too many dictators and too many generals running boards who are accountable to nobody. They should be answerable to the general public, and I hope that happens in regard to the new Leader programme and any future boards.  All such boards should include a quota of urban and county councillors who are answerable to the general public.  I cannot understand why public representatives are not wanted on these boards, and I will not support it.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk over the years about giving powers back to the local authorities, but this has not been done.  A public representative can ask a question at a county council meeting, table a question in the Dáil or telephone the Department of the Environment <Col N="1099" /> and be told to contact the National Roads Authority, but who elected the National Roads Authority?  How many votes did it get and to whom is it accountable?  Power must be given back to local authorities and the Dáil and taken away from officials.  I do not care who I offend this evening &mdash; what we want are strong Ministers who will tell the officials how things should be done, not officials telling the Government what to do.  I accompanied a deputation recently to meet a Government Minister whose official I will not name because he does not have the right of reply here. I was present to fight on behalf of the people I represent and listened to what went on, and heard that official dictate to the Minister.  I am not a violent man but a very shy person who holds himself back.  That evening I had to bite my tongue and hold myself back.  I was certainly upset and wrote to the Minister and told him I felt that official had overstepped the mark.  It is we who have to answer to the people and represent democracy.</P>
    <P>In my constituency of Mayo West a major controversy has developed regarding the buying of houses in private estates by the manager of the council to house people on the housing waiting list.  This has caused much concern to the residents in private estates who raised mortgages to buy houses and now do not know who will be landed next door to them.  The councils can buy as much property in the county as they wish and do not have to inform the elected public representatives.  That should be looked at.  This dictatorship must stop and there should be co-operation between the elected members and officials.  It is up to us to take the power away from the officials and give it back to the public representatives who are answerable to the people.</P>
    <P>In the past few weeks legislation was introduced to give powers to county councils in respect of taxis and hackneys. When I questioned the county manager in this regard he told me that council officials will have the power to <Col N="1100" /> decide charges and the allocation of licences while the elected representatives are given the job of deciding how much the general public should have to pay in rates, and so on.  That is not what I call democracy, it is more like dictatorship. If they want to give back powers to us, they could do so on a trial basis.</P>
    <P>I am a member of an urban council and a county council.  There are three urban councils in County Mayo, Castlebar, Ballina and Westport, and they do a worthwhile job.  Such councils accumulate a small budget from rates that may be expended on projects in the towns in question.  Towns that have an urban council are much better off than those which do not.</P>
    <P>It is now proposed to set up regional authorities.  Although I am a member of a county council, I advocate abolishing them and establishing urban district councils in every small town.  I would extend urban councils to take in other areas, but I would not favour setting up regional authorities because, once again, that would take powers from the elected representatives, in other words, from the people.  As elected representatives we frequently have to make harsh decisions, but we are not fearful of setting our rates each year because local authorities provide a worthwhile service. County managers, secretaries and their officials do a good job, but are being undermined by the plethora of new schemes, such as Leader and REPS.  I urge the Government to bring all those agencies under one umbrella and the people should be brought back into the process.</P>
    <P>We have been given a commitment that a referendum will be held on the question of votes for emigrants.  As chairman of the Westport Emigrants' Committee I visit London every year to meet our emigrants.  They love this country and probably have more respect for it than the citizens who live here. The majority of them are in tune with what is taking place here because they buy their local papers every week.  They want the country to progress and are willing to play their part and many of <Col N="1101" /> them would like to vote in elections here.  Will the Minister consider giving them the vote to which they are entitled?  Americans do not have any difficulty in casting their vote in presidential elections because there are American embassies all over the world. Our emigrants should be able to vote in Dáil and European elections in particular.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting in Castlebar a few weeks ago to discuss short wave radio and was amazed at the number of people who attended.  One might ask what relevance short wave radio has to local government.  Our emigrants are crying out for information on what is happening here and short wave radio would be a cheap means of proving them with such information.  It would be good for tourism and the Government. For a sum of approximately £4 million we could set up a short wave radio system, create more jobs and transmit the Irish message across the world.  The All-Ireland football and hurling finals were transmitted in this way.  I had the pleasure of being interviewed by the BBC on short wave radio at a meeting in Castlebar and received letters from all over the world in response.  My message was that the Government should provide the necessary money to communicate with our emigrants.  For a small sum of money we could do more than merely talk about how well they are doing abroad.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to consider having photographs of candidates on ballot papers.  This would assist those who are ashamed of not being able to read or write.  I do not want the Minister to say he is considering this matter but that he will do something about it so that people, such as Ernie Sweeney, will not have to waste time campaigning for this when his time could be better spent helping such people.  If the Minister introduces this measure under these regulations he will satisfy thousands of people, especially those who do not have anyone to speak for them.</P>
    <P>The boundary commission does not <Col N="1102" /> understand local government or the difficulties faced by those representing rural constituencies.  Mayo is one of the largest constituencies and there will be many by-elections in the future if the present system continues.  It is not possible for public representatives to travel all over their constituencies late at night to attend meetings.  If I had the courage I would have voted against the legislation but as a democrat I did not want to be out of line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Ring on his contribution.  I agree with many of the important issues he raised in his common sense approach to the debate.  He spoke about the necessity for candidates' photographs to be placed on the ballot paper, an issue which has been raised on many occasions in the past.  Despite different Ministers holding the Environment portfolio, little action has been taken on this matter and the request appears to have fallen on deaf ears.  Illiterate people are very good at hiding the fact that they cannot read or write and I meet such people at my clinics.  Two weeks ago a lady telephoned me and when I asked her to spell a townland with which I was not familiar, she said it would not be possible for her to spell it when she could not even spell her name.  I have been dealing with that lady at my clinics for more than two years. In normal conversation she was able to hide the fact that she could not read or write, but had to admit in the course of a telephone conversation that this presented an enormous difficulty for her.</P>
      <P>We tend to underestimate the number of people who cannot read or write. The least we should do is ensure that a photograph of each candidate is carried on the ballot paper to give them an opportunity to vote for the person of their choice.  Even if this means that the position would be improved for only a few hundred people it would be a job well done.  I do not know of any reason this cannot be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> Deputy Ring mentioned the composition of State boards which are set up under statute.  It is a feature of recent legislation that politicians are barred from sitting on such boards.  When we stop bashing one another in this House we tend to turn on the media and blame them for many of our ills.  The public perception of politicians is not what we would like it to be, but when legislation is passed to prevent politicians from sitting on State boards the public cannot be blamed for having a lack of trust and faith in them.  This matter will have to be rectified as we have to face the music at various meetings week in, week out and put our jobs on the line every three to five years when we are held answerable to the people for our actions not just inside, but outside the House.  By and large, public representatives are decent people who try to do the best job they can.</P>
    <P>The local elections regulations are straightforward.  One of the biggest changes that has been made in recent years is that political parties are no longer allowed maintain a presence outside polling stations.  There was a time when canvassers having campaigned for three to four weeks spent the day outside the polling station when in general, a good atmosphere was created, more so in rural than urban areas.  When going to vote one almost had to bring a shopping basket because of the volume of literature handed to them.  This presented an obstacle.  We insulted the intelligence of voters by thinking they might change their mind outside the polling station.  Many people, particularly the older generations who were used to fighting elections in that fashion, were sorry that this change was made.</P>
    <P>Whenever local authority elections are held new faces always emerge.  We should encourage more people, young people and women in particular, to put their names forward for election to ensure a good spread.  Everyone should feel that they are entitled to run for election.</P>
    <P>New candidates tend to have an <Col N="1104" /> advantage in contesting elections in that they are able to convince the electorate they will change the world.  The reason this goes down well is that the people are not sure what powers local authorities possess and what services they provide.  It is important, therefore, that we make it clear what local authorities can and cannot do so that they become more meaningful for the people they are supposed to represent.  Naas Urban District Council is making an attempt to rectify this matter by explaining how it is run.  I hope this will have an effect in the long term with the result that more people will become interested in politics and participate in the running of local authorities.  One of the reasons there is such a low turn out at local authority elections is that people are not aware what powers local authorities possess. Some people believe that politicians can do whatever they please, but if we were honest we would admit that the influence of politicians has declined enormously in recent years.</P>
    <P>Let me emphasise this point by telling a story.  At a recent meeting of the parliamentary party one of our longest serving members made the point that there was a time when, if the position of postman became vacant, it was simply a matter of picking &ldquo;your man&rdquo;. However, the position has deteriorated to the point where if 100 people applied for the post the only way politicians could be sure that their man would get the job is to recommend the other 99. We should not pretend to the public, therefore, that we have powers we do not possess.  Some Members of the House have now decided and declared publicly that they will no longer hold clinics.  One of the reasons is the number of people who turn up at clinics in the belief that the politician will be able to do something for them although they have been refused and given an explanation. Until we dispel this notion people will continue to live in an unreal world.</P>
    <P>The regulations outline the way in which the count should be conducted. As someone who is usually elected on the final count, I often wonder why <Col N="1105" /> there is such a difference in the length of time it takes to conduct the count in five-seat constituencies of similar size throughout the country.  In some constituencies the count can be completed within one day while in others it can drag on for an eternity.  I am not sure if anything can be done in this regard.  In many cases local authorities are fighting a losing battle.  There are so many services to be provided and jobs to be done that in many instances they are all mouth and no clout.  They have not been given sufficient finance to operate effectively. They should be run as businesses and people should know what services are provided and at what cost.  There is a bright future for local authorities but a number of changes must be made.</P>
    <P>Litter from take-aways and late night eating houses poses a problem in many towns.  In some instances conditions are attached to planning permissions which require the owner of the premises to do a clean up.  Litter is unacceptable and young people must be educated to that effect.  Deputy Burke, as Minister for the Environment, introduced legislation in the 1980s but I remain to be convinced that the law is being implemented.  Everyone would benefit if the law were enforced.  Litter louts should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the members of local authorities who give of their time and energy for the benefit of the public at large.  Their work goes unnoticed and is not rewarded for the most part.  I appeal to them to show greater initiative in developing and promoting their towns. Car parking poses a problem for many towns.  If those who work in offices and shops in towns parked their cars on side streets there would be plenty of room for potential customers to park in car parks.  That could make an enormous difference to businesses in a town.</P>

      <P>I do not have any major reservations about these regulations. They afford us an opportunity to raise other matters relating to local elections. It is satisfying to note from the Minister's speech that we are ahead of other EU member states as far as the right to vote and stand for election is concerned. We think we are at the back of the pack on many issues but on this occasion we are out in front.</P>
      <P>Consideration should be given to holding elections at weekends, particularly on Saturdays.  We should make every effort to facilitate those who work outside their constituency, such as long distance lorry drivers who may only be at home at weekends.  I welcome the extension of polling time to 10 p.m.  My organisation recommended Sunday voting but in areas of mixed population this might not be feasible.  It is important to facilitate people to cast their votes.  Disabled voters must register well in advance of elections.  It is not pleasant to ask them to fill up a form which would enable them vote at home as most of them will say they hope to be fit to go out on polling day and cast their vote.</P>
      <P>When voting at home was first introduced if the postman was not accompanied then someone arrived shortly afterwards to help the person cast their vote.  As a result we have the present position.  I know of cases where disabled persons were not eager to complete the form and when an election was called they did not have a vote.  They resented that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deposit for candidates standing for local authorities and town commissions has been increased by £10 and £5 to £50 and £25 respectively.  No one can quibble with that as most people would expect to secure a refund.  The returning officer will have discretion as far as the timing of the count is concerned. It cannot commence later than 9 a.m. but can commence before that <Col N="1107" /> time.  People like the votes to be counted as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of putting photographs of candidates on ballot papers and I note that the surname of the candidate and the name of his or her party will be in large capital letters on the ballot paper.  The forename will be in small capital letters and each candidate's details will be in ordinary characters. That is important.  If a number of candidates have the same surname this could cause problems and people should be facilitated in identifying candidates. The presence of people at the polling station was also raised.</P>
    <P>While some candidates might have welcomed fewer people and less activity around polling stations, especially from 7 o'clock in the evening until the end of polling, stations have been boring, lifeless places in recent years, to the extent that many people have asked whether we could reinstate such activity in the form of amplifiers, posters and all the other paraphernalia.  However, I merely sought to draw a comparison between now and what had obtained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall resist the temptation to comment on the provisions of various Local Government Acts.  Nonetheless, I might make one comment having listened to the previous five contributors to this debate.  While we are all inclined to criticise the powers of certain unelected individuals at local government level, we must remember that it was legislation passed by this House and its Members which vested such powers in them, whether under the Managerial Act, the various pollution Acts, the planning Acts or the National Roads Authority Act.  While we may complain that we do not now have the power or influence we should like at local authority level, all such power emanates from these Houses and can also be altered here.  If we are sufficiently dissatisfied, perhaps we should seriously consider such a possibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the great problems encountered in local government circles is the <Col N="1108" /> continuous lack of finance to fund many projects we should like to see implemented within our functional areas.  I recollect, from a visit to Washington, having seen carved in granite above the facade of their Treasury Department: &ldquo;No Representation Without Taxation&rdquo;, an appropriate message to everybody involved in local government, reminding them that there is a cost involved, which bullet will have to be bitten if people want more real power vested in them at local authority level.</P>
    <P>Having moved from poacher to gamekeeper in this local government area, beginning as a rate collector for my urban district council, afterwards serving as Minister for the Environment, I witnessed much of what occurred at every level in local government.</P>
    <P>Of one thing I am certain, that is that the officials who drafted this statutory instrument are very knowledgeable, experts in their field &mdash; I do not make that comment merely because they are present &mdash; to whom we owe a great deal of gratitude for the many Electoral Acts drafted and the methods deployed to ensure that democracy functions as efficiently as possible.  That is not to say we cannot criticise the occasional handy work in which they engage.</P>
    <P>A statutory regulation, of necessity, is and must be a legal document because disappointed candidates may attempt to use it or earlier instruments to ascertain whether results can be reversed when a close result emerges or a recount is necessary.  While the language used may appear to be somewhat dry and formal, it is necessary.  For example, while it is not specified in this document that local elections must be held under the proportional representation system, there is reference to previous Acts.  It specifies how votes will be distributed under the system but it would have been more helpful had it been specified that all elections here are held under the proportional representation system, or single transferable vote rather than refer to some previous Electoral Act.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of this statutory <Col N="1109" /> instrument is to allow citizens of other European Union member states not only to vote in Irish local and certain other elections but also to stand as candidates, which I particularly welcome. All of us have encouraged citizens of other European Union member states to establish businesses here, and that has been enormously beneficial in creating employment.  If European Union citizens, managing or working in companies and living here consider they can contribute by standing for election, they are more than welcome to do so, bringing their expertise and business acumen to bear whenever they have an opportunity to stand as candidates just as do natives representing the electorate of their local areas.</P>
    <P>Another omission from this statutory instrument relates to the tenure of office of any given local authority or council. It would have been useful to indicate in a document such as this a minimum and a maximum term.  This would inform the public and any Member elected how long he or she could expect to take certain decisions or perhaps influence decision-making in the area he or she represents.</P>
    <P>Since the main thrust of this statutory instrument is the inclusion of citizens of other European Union states in our electoral process, it would have been useful to have specified the electoral system here which varies enormously from that in other EU member states, from the straight-past-the-post system in the United Kingdom, the list system in Germany and the various other proportional representation systems operating, thus informing their citizens adequately of our electoral system within which they must be elected.</P>
    <P>I note that local authorities must fund their elections.  In the case of local elections when urban and county council elections are held on the same day, polling boxes in urban areas are shared with county councils, thereby splitting the expenditure involved.  I see no reason larger local authorities should not pay for the privilege of holding their elections within a small urban area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1110" /> Rather than use terms like Chairperson, Alderman and the like, all officeholders in EU member states are described as Mayors.  With the advent of many more women elected to public office, it is no longer appropriate to use the term chairman; perhaps the Irish version &ldquo;Cathaoirleach&rdquo; would be easier or more appropriate.  Since we are being encouraged to twin with various continental towns &mdash; for which we receive funding &mdash; why not use the term &ldquo;Mayor&rdquo;, and at least afford elected representatives that status.  It would lead to greater uniformity in the terminology used whenever they travel abroad.  That term would be easily understood.</P>
    <P>I note the draft statutory instrument does not explain who cannot stand for election.  In the past there were categories of people who were not allowed to stand.  Age is a barrier; people have to be over a certain age to stand.  People who broke the law, those who were bankrupt or those who used to be described unkindly as imbeciles could not stand.  Have those restrictions gone for those who are bankrupt or in jail?  It might be nice to know if one is serving a term in prison that one could stand in local elections, but I do not think one can.</P>
    <P>The deposit for candidates at local elections is not a big issue.  A sum of £25 should not present a problem for most people and should not prevent them standing.  Under the old system it cost £10 to run in an urban election and that sum is now out of date given the levels of inflation over the last 30 years.  The county council elections will now require a deposit of £50 which is not a large sum.  There are a number of vexatious characters who would put their names forward for every area in the country if they could and I doubt if the increases will deter them.</P>
    <P>I would like to have seen a change made in the arrangements whereby a person may stand in a number of areas for the same local authority.  I see no point in this practice and it should not be continued.  One should make a selection and stand in that area alone.  I recall <Col N="1111" /> in the 1970s one candidate standing in an urban area where there was a ward system and winning in three wards.  A heavyweight candidate could stand in a local election and then stand down and hand on the seat to somebody else, a practice which could upset the democratic balance of wards or county areas. One should be honest enough to stand in one area, win or lose, rather than have people who expect to win in all areas or who wish to cover themselves each way in different areas.</P>
    <P>I would also like to have seen a mention of votes for emigrants.  In the past Deputies from all parties have promised emigrants they would ensure representation. I suggested it would upset the balance of elections if emigrants were to elect Members to the Dáil and that the appropriate House for representation from various parts of the world would be Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>If a German citizen, for example, who has a job in Ireland stands and is elected in a local election, then returns to his native country but wishes to continue serving on a council, what expenses would he be paid?  Would he be paid travelling expenses from Berlin?  Wicklow UDC could find itself in this situation as we have quite a number of European nationals who have set up businesses in the area who could be transferred back to their native countries. If they were elected would they be paid mileage at 74p per mile or get the first class air fare?</P>
    <P>Given that one of the main changes in this statutory instrument could bring about this situation, perhaps the Minister would clarify the point.  I assume they would only get travel expenses within the county if they are members of a county council.  It might be no harm for this document to state as much before a case arises of an official in the EU wishing to travel back and forth to county council meetings.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the scope of the special votes and postal votes widened. It has remained too narrow over the years.  People in the State travel to other <Col N="1112" /> parts of the EU or to the US out of necessity as much as anything else.  With regard to local elections we often talk about wanting to see young people involved in local elections and using their votes.  In the last local elections I found the fall off in the numbers voting was among the younger people, who walked past the polling stations without bothering to vote.  We should encourage them to vote.</P>
    <P>The third level entry points system is one mechanism that discourages young people from voting.  A young person from Wicklow, for example, may only be able to get a college place in Letterkenny, Waterford or Galway.  If they go there how can they vote?  They cannot apply for a postal vote or to be included on the special voters register yet they should be allowed to do so.  The idea of sending fleets of cars and buses to collect people to vote for one party or another is negative.</P>
    <P>If they miss their first opportunities to vote they may never vote again as they may feel they were denied a vote.  I do not know if changes can be made in this statutory instrument at this stage, but the Minister should consider introducing provisions to take into account the students who, because of our education system, are scattered around the country away from the place where they may wish to vote.  The Minister may tell me they can register in the area of their college but that is not the answer.  They may have grown up in a different area, knowing the local representatives and the local problems, and they may want to be represented in their own area.</P>
    <P>The old tin ballot boxes still being used are a longstanding concern of mine.  They are out of date and cumbersome.  Some of the staff who work in the polling stations do not know how to seal them properly and they could easily be opened and the contents tampered with. We saw modern, transparent ballot boxes in use in South African elections. We should re-equip ourselves with modern replacements.</P>
    <P>I do not believe many people, <Col N="1113" /> Members of this House included, know how the single transferable vote system works when it comes to surpluses and continuing counts.  I doubt if anyone could explain it cogently.  Perhaps a document, not using the same language as this one, could be given to everyone, not just to candidates.  Members are here because they have been successful under this system but few of us know how it works in a close vote.  In local elections, there may be a tied vote after ten counts and it may be necessary to check who had most votes on the first count or how many spoiled votes there were.</P>
    <P>When instruments such as these are revised, small improvements would simplify our job of explaining how democracy works in local elections, not only to young people but our canvassers.</P>

      <P>I have looked at the instruments, read the Minister's speech and concur with the proposals contained therein.  In common with Members from all parties, I endorse many of the suggestions and proposals put forward this afternoon.  Democracy is important. When one considers our Constitution and the democratic structures operating on this island, from our Parliament downwards, we probably have the broadest and fairest democratic system in the modern world.  However, those who elect representatives to this House and other bodies fail to recognise their power &mdash; ultimately democracy is vested in and rests with the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At times I worry that we live in a selective democracy, because the State <Col N="1114" /> system and those responsible for its implementation &mdash; the Department of the Environment, the public authorities, the national parliament and the Government of the day &mdash; have collectively failed to provide the people with the maximum opportunity to cast their votes in the easiest and best way possible, in the best possible environment, and as close to their homes as can be arranged.  Over the past 13 years I have fought six elections, one to a local authority and the others to the Dáil.  My colleagues and I in the Oireachtas and local authorities have constantly proposed and recommended changes to take account of parishes, locations, identities and social and geographic factors, so that people can cast their votes in the proper area.  Despite our best efforts our calls fall on deaf ears; no one takes cognisance of the position or brings in these changes, which are not only recommended by us but have been demanded by the electorate.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion when an electoral provision was discussed &mdash; the Presidential Election Act, 1993 &mdash; I called for the establishment of a polling commission under the Minister for the Environment, which would include the county manager, county registrar, local Oireachtas Members and local authority members in each area.  These would go through each area and reach consensus on polling provisions, so that the maximum opportunity to vote would be presented and polling booths would be up to the proper standard.</P>
    <P>In my constituency, some people have to travel 14 miles to vote in an election. This is not fair, especially since in urban areas some people can walk to polling booths.  If this was changed there would be a better democratic consensus. People would feel closer to the electoral system and be happier with the outcome. There are many elections and referenda and the percentage turnout is declining, which is a serious and worrying matter for a democracy.</P>
    <P>It is time to examine the impositions we place on the people and the cost of running elections.  I have been told time <Col N="1115" /> out of number that the public servants involved do not want to inconvenience themselves and were it not for that difficulty we could have elections at weekends. I see no reason why our people should not be let cast their votes for general elections, presidential elections, local elections or referenda on either a Saturday or Sunday, preferably the latter, when people are off work, going to church services and have time to contemplate and cast their votes.  That is not asking too much.</P>
    <P>We have excellent political parties, with armies of workers who could prepare for those elections right up to Saturday night so that people would be fully geared up to vote on Sunday.  The public officials could run the elections and the count could begin on Monday. There is no reason why the officials should not be given time in lieu for this work &mdash; they should not have to carry an unfair burden or not get recompense and time in lieu for working abnormal hours to ensure we have a satisfactory democratic system.  It is time this was examined and I ask the Minister and Government to do so.  We have called for this in the past but it has not happened, so it is important it does now.</P>
    <P>Some schools are closed for election day.  Teachers are paid, children lose days at school and parents are inconvenienced. Some courthouses and local authority premises are also closed and their staff are discommoded.  This would not happen if we had weekend elections. We would save money and not lose man hours.  During elections, voluntary workers who are committed to democracy and political parties and believe they have a contribution to make through the system are prepared to work.  They take time off work for election days and canvass during the evenings and weekends.  This could also be saved by having elections at weekends. We must critically examine this matter and bite the bullet.  We must not be afraid to change to weekend elections, so that Ireland can demonstrate that we have the most fluid, fairest, <Col N="1116" /> efficient and best democratic system in the world.</P>
    <P>I concur with Deputy Kavanagh. Students are committed to the community where they were born and reared.  They move to a different part of the country for a temporary period to be educated at third level but they lose their right to vote in their local area and are put on the electoral register at their third level college.  Some of them become politically involved at college but the vast majority wish to return home.  They should be provided for and not struck off the local electoral register when they move to a third level institution. If elections and referenda were held at weekends they could be allowed return to cast their votes.  This would ensure that a new generation of young Irish people would have a direct input into democracy at all levels and an opportunity to participate in democratically electing the people and parties they want to run the country, or in deciding to amend the Constitution.  It is a distortion of democracy when thousands of students move into an area temporarily and are registered to vote there rather than in their home areas.</P>
    <P>The deposits are being increased from £10 for local authority elections to £50, and from £5 to £25 for town commission and urban council elections, which are very small increases.  I agree with Deputy Kavanagh that these regulations will not be amended for a long time and that the amounts should be £100 for county council elections and £50 for every other election.  It would ensure that only those genuinely committed to the democratic process would offer themselves as candidates, and deter vexatious candidates who put their names down in five or six places, or in several counties.  They do not wish to play a key role in the democratic process but want to effect some sort of invisible change which we do not understand.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Ring and others have mentioned, I see no reason we could not <Col N="1117" /> have photographs of candidates on ballot papers, particularly in national elections, as people may not know new candidates. It would also help those who cannot read or those with declining vision to know where to put their mark or number.  Under the PR system, people like to go through at least a party grouping on a ballot paper and many people are now going through the entire ballot paper.  That is democracy at work, which we should assist.  I know that it would be costly but when the system is in place that would not be a major problem.</P>
    <P>I concur with Deputy Kavanagh in regard to votes for emigrants.  Wonderful people have had to leave this island to earn a livelihood elsewhere.  They have great commitment to this country, regardless of the level of their jobs. They love this land and our people and they look to home for information, inspiration and leadership.  They are proud of the political, economic and sporting successes of this country.  That should be recognised by allowing the election of a number of them to Seanad Éireann, which would not be a distortion of the democratic system.  They could make a vocational, educational and economic contribution to Seanad Éireann and give us the benefit of their experiences.</P>
    <P>Before these draft regulations are ratified, the Minister should make an accompanying document available so that everybody will have a clear knowledge of the intricacies of the PR system. We all know the basics but few people, apart from the professionals, really understand how the final transfers work and how the last seats are decided. Such a document would help to educate and inform people about the intricacies and fairness of the system.  I welcome the changes which are being made and I am delighted to share my time with my Connaught collegue, Deputy Matty Brennan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support these worthy regulations which are a step in the right direction and I am delighted that <Col N="1118" /> they allow citizens of all nationalities to vote in local elections.  I remember canvassing non-nationals who did not have a vote in local elections and it is great that they now do so.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about the voting rights of our emigrants.  I emigrated for a few years and had a great interest in the elections at home and wherever I was living &mdash; in the United Kingdom or the United States.  I remember having the day off work on an election day in the United States many years ago and going to the polling station &mdash; although I did not have a vote &mdash; where people voted by computer.</P>
      <P>Our emigrants should have a vote in all elections, particularly general elections. I have received letters from places such as Australia where Irish citizens would love to vote in this country.  This is the 150th anniversary of the Famine in Ireland and we should allow our emigrants to vote.  Many of the emigrants at that time died on the coffin ships and never made it to the United States.  We have had a long record of emigration for many years.  Our young people like to emigrate.  I spoke about this to some of my colleagues in the Council of Europe, and anyone who holds a Portuguese passport is allowed to vote in elections in Portugal.  Anyone holding an Irish passport should have the right to vote in our elections.</P>
      <P>For the referendum on 24 November the polling stations will be open from 9 a.m. until 9 p.m.  The 6.30 p.m. train from Dublin does not arrive in Sligo until after 9.30 p.m.  The polling stations should be open until 10 p.m. or 10.30 p.m. to allow people going home for the weekend the right to vote.  We must encourage our young people to avail of their democratic right to vote.  Ireland and Great Britain are the only countries which do not hold their European elections on a Sunday.  Why can we not hold our elections on Saturday or Sunday and allow everybody the right to vote?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with putting candidates' photographs on ballot papers.  I was one of those who went to South Africa last year to monitor the elections there.  The <Col N="1119" /> photographs of the candidates were on the ballot papers and that was a great help to people who had difficulty in reading, whether because of poor eyesight or for some other reason.  I trust the Government will consider adopting a similar procedure here and also that our emigrants will be afforded the opportunity of voting in all national elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the regulations. It is time they were introduced to the House.  They have generated much useful discussion regarding democracy and local elections.  I could conclude by saying that I second Deputy Ring's excellent contribution on the basis that it would suffice for my contribution as he covered all relevant aspects very well.  I only disagree with him in his claim that he is a shy man.  I have not noticed this.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's point on special voters, there is a case to be made.  Deputy Matty Brennan spoke on the issue of photographs alongside the candidate's name.  This should be implemented immediately.  Nobody should be debarred, because of any impediment, from casting their vote on election day and nobody should be embarrassed at having the polling station cleared to make a public announcement &mdash; it amounts to that when advising one or more officials as to whom one is voting for &mdash; when the inclusion of a photograph would help where a voter's sight is impaired or they have difficulty in reading.  My only rider to this is that only current photographs be used.  The tendency for political candidates and people in politics is to present a young image.  A photograph that is 20 years old, when the hair style was different &mdash; such as the inclusion of side burns &mdash; could confuse more than it would help.  We wish to help, not distract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accessibility to polling stations is important.  Most of our public buildings have improved in recent years as regards addressing the difficulties for <Col N="1120" /> those with a handicap.  There is an excellent example of this in the House, where marvellous work was done which has been much appreciated.  Many of the schools in rural areas which have been traditionally used as polling stations are closing down.  Other venues, such as mobile offices which provide steps by way of access, are being used that are not suitable.  We must ensure that access to a polling station is freely available to everybody.  I make no apologies for costs in addressing this.</P>
    <P>The polling stations must also be within reasonable reach.  With regard to the closing of our schools, it is not good enough to site the polling stations in a location far removed from voters.  While many may consider us to be in the modern era of the motor car, there are many households where a motor car is not available.  In addition, there is often the difficulty of access to only one car, especially if the husband uses it for work.  He often returns home late, there are small children to be attended to and he and his wife cannot make it to the polling station together as it would mean leaving the children at home. Every precaution must be taken, therefore, to ensure that people get a fair opportunity to vote.</P>
    <P>This leads to the idea of weekend voting, which I would support.  Mobility is an issue here.  For example, people get jobs which entail moving away from home, husbands may go to work on a Monday morning and not return until a Friday evening, there are the long distance truck drivers and students.  In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, other than the third level centre in Cavan town, students attend colleges in Dundalk, Letterkenny or Dublin.  They are then not at home to vote.  Does this mean allowing such people a postal vote or do we allow weekend voting?  We can overcome many of the problems around this matter by allowing weekend voting. I have no preference for Saturday or Sunday; I will accept whatever decision is made in this regard.  Weekend voting would accommodate many people who would have otherwise great difficulty in <Col N="1121" /> voting.  I am unsure as to the necessity for opening to 10 p.m. as it is a late hour in winter time.  If voting takes place at weekends this would not be necessary.</P>
    <P>With regard to the collection of ballot boxes, polling stations in rural areas close down at 9 o'clock in the evening. The gardaí generally move away within an hour of closing.  Following on this, nobody is left in the polling station other than the presiding officer and the ballot boxes.  If the polling station is in a remote area, the officer could often have to wait two to three hours, often until 2 o'clock in the morning, until the van collecting the boxes, which has security attached to it, calls.  In the meantime, there is no security.  It would be more sensible if, when the polling station is closed and the ballot boxes are sealed, the presiding officer and the garda present would travel together to the count centre, deposit the boxes and obtain a receipt from whoever is in charge.  This matter should be addressed as problems could arise.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of an authority for 21 years, being first elected in June 1974.  It has given me much satisfaction to see many benefits coming through the local system.  However, there is always the frustration that the work one wishes to get done, such as the repair of footpaths or water services and the provision of a house for the needy couple, is hampered by the lack of funding. The funding of local authorities must be radically addressed.  We now have a mish mash of national Government and local taxation that is not meeting demands.</P>
    <P>I have increasingly found over the past 21 years that the powers of the local representative are being eroded. This is not good for democracy.  We will never have sufficient funding, but if there is a system which provides for the implementation of levies in one county that are not being collected in another and if there are water charges in one area, county or region and they are not charged in another, it creates much annoyance.  Why can people live in one part of the country and not have to pay <Col N="1122" /> service charges, and yet in another part they pay in excess of £100?  If such charges are applicable in one part, they must be applicable in another.</P>
    <P>Where there are densities of population there are better services, with better revenue going to the local authority in question.  Increasingly, we find remote and rural areas are being deprived.  This drives people to the more densely populated areas where the services are available.  It is not good for the country, nor is it good for democracy. There are numerous instances of this.  For example, with regard to the provision of schools and colleges, young couples, when setting up home together will look to see where the services are available and then try to live in the area if work is available.</P>
    <P>If funding is generated locally it must be spent locally, it is not good enough that the local representatives be responsible for striking a rate to collect so many pounds if they have not got the final say in how it is spent.  Ultimately, it is the local county councillor who will put his name on the ballot paper and be judged by his neighbours.  People can be critical of the political system, politicians and local representatives, but ultimately it is the system that allows people to be accountable and judged every five years.</P>
    <P>Increasingly, the powers of local representative are being eroded.  Community and other groups are being sponsored and given a say on matters for which they have no accountability. The role of the county councillor is being undermined.  I do not accept this situation.  It is not good for democracy. We can be critical of all parties, but in 21 years of local representation I have found that we can have our political disagreements, our different points of view as to how something should be done, yet I have never doubted the commitment of local public representatives elected to Cavan County Council of all shades of opinion, including the two major parties, other parties and independents.  I have never had any doubts about the commitment of those representatives to <Col N="1123" /> the people who elected them.  However, over the years it has proven more difficult to deal with simple issues.</P>
    <P>For many years County Cavan had the worst roads in the country, something we were ashamed of.  This was not the fault of the county council or local public representatives.  Rather the moneys necessary to carry out the repairs were not provided by national government.  I referred to this matter on many occasions when on the Opposition benches and it is important to state publicly that the Government has at last recognised the problem and provided the necessary funding.  In the short time since this happened there has been a response from the public.  It should be remembered that people will respond quicker when they see they are getting a fair share of the national cake and being treated equally with citizens in other parts of the State.  This is as it should be.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the problem of litter scattered all over the countryside.  If we are serious about the development of the tourism industry which is expected to be the major income earner in the future local authorities should be given the power to appoint litter wardens.  We will not be able to sell Ireland as a tourism destination if the countryside is defaced with litter discarded by people who do not think.  This is not fair to the councils, local authorities and communities which have done marvellous work in the development of facilities.  If litter wardens had the power to impose on-the-spot fines people would think twice before throwing their litter on the ground.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh made an important point about the people entitled to stand in local elections.  People with a criminal record, and others, should be debarred from standing in such elections. However, there is no indication in the legislation as to the people who will be debarred from standing in elections. The legislation should indicate the citizens who will not be allowed to stand in elections.</P>
    <P>Given that we are Europeans and <Col N="1124" /> have a great involvement in town twinning, the terms &ldquo;cathaoirleach&rdquo;, &ldquo;chairperson&rdquo; and &ldquo;madam chairperson&rdquo; should be replaced by the European term &ldquo;mayor&rdquo;.  Many people in public life would aspire to such a title. I support many of the points made by Deputies who spoke from the heart in their excellent contributions.  They believe in the system and want to protect it and if the points made by them are accepted we will have done a good day's work.</P>

      <P>This interesting legislation illustrates what good Europeans we are. We have no problem in being one of the first countries to implement the spirit of Maastricht even though other countries have qualms in this regard.  Taking into account our size and population, nobody participates in the affairs of other countries as much as we do.  For example, it is not unusual for an Irish person in Britain to be elected an MP or mayor of a city, while almost every second President of America has Irish ancestors.  We invented the Tammany Hall system which got many Irish Americans into high places in that great land. The Americans introduced legislation which made it very easy to catch a politician on the take or who was corrupt. That was part of the Tammany Hall ethos.  We are still running free and easy and have yet to follow suit in this regard.  The corruption here is minor but their system invites it and they had to legislate for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will come as a culture shock to many to learn that people from other countries can be elected to local authorities here.  For example, Deputy Paddy Sheehan may no longer be able to say that his neck of the woods consists of nothing but briars, bachelors and bullocks as there may be German and Dutch county councillors.  There is a high proportion of nationals from those countries living in the peninsula and Deputy Sheehan could find himself out on a limb politically or, even worse, extinct politically.  He and Councillor Michael Harrington in Castletownbere <Col N="1125" /> may have great difficulty in fighting off the challenge of the Germans and Dutch in a political sense.  It adds an interesting dimension to the debate when one considers that county councils, urban councils and corporations may have members from other countries. This has advantages as they have different outlooks on life and other points of view and we may learn from them.</P>
    <P>At times I am at a loss to understand what the Green Party stands for as very often it is not preoccupied with issues with which I think it should.  I refer specifically to matters dealing with ecology, the greenness of the country, the preservation of wildlife and the implementation of planning laws in towns and cities which virtually ignore green and open spaces and playing facilities, in the pursuit of the building of private and local authority houses and a host of commercial enterprises.  We have lost the run of ourselves in regard to the simplest of items.</P>
    <P>Frequently at Question Time and during debates I refer to the practice of certain local authorities in April cutting down hedgerows where birds have started to nest.  This can often continue until May when the nesting season is in full swing.  Certain people can be relied on to set fire to mountains in order to burn off undergrowth and thereby promote the growth of new grass and heather for the feeding of livestock, particularly sheep.  That type of activity is detrimental to the whole cycle of nature and we seem to be totally oblivious to the damage being done.  While we should defend and guard our heritage and culture through the medium of the Dáil and local authorities, we appear to be indifferent.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be unduly critical of the Green Party but the word &ldquo;green&rdquo; automatically leads one to believe that it is a defender of nature and of all creatures great and small, particularly defenceless wildlife.  One would expect to hear of that in the Dáil and at local level, but I do not see or hear such defence.  People are preoccupied.  When <Col N="1126" /> they speak of &ldquo;green&rdquo; they are worried about the French nuclear testing in the South Pacific, Sellafield across the Irish Sea or a nuclear power station in another part of Europe which may never pose a problem to anyone here as the tests to date have been inconclusive.</P>
    <P>The destruction of a system of wildlife and our environment is taking place under our feet.  With no disrespect to the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, the manner in which we use the word &ldquo;environment&rdquo; is an abomination because we are not really protecting it or concerned about it.  The local authorities and ourselves are supposed to be the guardians of the environment but, instead of protecting it, we are letting it be destroyed.  During the spring everywhere I looked I saw reclamation works destroying hedgerows, ponds and fences and wetlands being drained.  That represents the destruction of our natural environment. It is time we got our priorities right in that regard and studied the meaning of the words &ldquo;environment&rdquo;, &ldquo;green&rdquo; and &ldquo;ecology&rdquo; because at present we have an indifferent approach towards such issues.</P>
    <P>Many of the large cities in Britain, those on the Continent and even Dublin, built by the British and colonialists around the world, were well planned. Green spaces are within a few minutes walk of those great cities.  Merrion Square and Stephen's Green are within two minutes' walk from the Dáil.  If one were in a large Irish provincial town, one would have to walk for half an hour before reaching any form of green space and that might not be a proper one, it might be merely ornamental.  Our planning is diabolical and local authorities are a disgrace.  Officialdom, more than the members of local authorities, is to blame because it knows, or should know, what it is all about.  It is not providing a balanced environment.  We need play areas and playing fields.</P>
    <P>The next item on the agenda is a Bill dealing with bail, crime, drugs and so on.  Many of our problems have arisen because we do not cultivate the proper <Col N="1127" /> environment.  Recreational facilities and playing areas are not available.  It is a madness in the pursuit of what we think is progress.  It is really a blackboard or concrete jungle which is not conducive to a relaxed leisure type lifestyle.</P>
    <P>I hope and trust that reason will prevail concerning water and other local authority charges in the next few months, particularly before the next budget is introduced.  It is crazy that Members of this House who are members of local authorities vote here for some measure, but that when they return to their local towns, counties and cities vote in the opposite direction. Such duplicity is widespread.  It is amazing in a Government made up of Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left that on local authorities one invariably finds that Labour and the Democratic Left will vote against charges whereas Fine Gael, the party with the conscience, votes for them.  All that type of nonsense further ridicules us in the eyes of the public.  It is about time we introduced a system for the betterment of the community which people will support unanimously and stopped being stupid and divisive and chasing votes at the expense of somebody else.</P>

      <P>In any debate on local elections it is inevitable that speakers should consider the role, functions and status of the local government system.  I agree with much of what has been said on all sides of the House about the need for an effective, vigorous and truly democratic and responsible system of local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Quill spoke eloquently about the need for a root and branch reform. With respect to the Deputy, that sounds good, but it is similar to telling a person who asks the way to Cork that he or she should not start here.  The reality is that we are here, we have a system that operates and we must start from that base. While I share many of the viewpoints expressed, I would not be as pessimistic <Col N="1128" /> about the system as Deputies Dempsey and Quill.</P>
    <P>In recent years successive Governments have put in quite an amount of good constructive work into local government reform, and that work is continuing.  I will mention briefly some of the steps which have been taken and those in prospect of being taken.  The current programme of local government reform commenced in 1985 with the enactment of the Local Government (Reorganisation) Act, 1985, which laid down the foundation for the establishment of three new county councils in place of Dublin County Council and established Galway as a county borough with an extended boundary.  The Local Government Act, 1991, the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993, and the Local Government Act, 1994, continued that programme.</P>
    <P>I will list briefly a number of the main elements implemented under the programme of local government reform. Structural reorganisation in Dublin has been satisfactorily implemented and eight regional authorities have been established.  Local authorities have been freed from the <i>ultra vires</i> constraint by providing for a general competence for authorities to engage in such activities as they consider appropriate in the interests of the local community.  Statutory recognition has been given to the policy-making and representational roles of local authority members.  The significance of local authority membership in its own right has been emphasised by changes, such as the exclusion of various office holders from local authority membership.  Statutory authority for town twinning, civic receptions and civic honours enhances the civic role of local authority members.  The General Council of County Councils has been upgraded in recent years with increased funding and new provisions enhancing the legal stature of members' associations and providing for the removal of ministerial control on contributions to them.  New regional authorities and the European Union Committee of the Regions are composed entirely of councillors. <Col N="1129" /> As part of the continuing programme of local government reform the following matters are being dealt with.  They include broadening local authority powers and removal of various ministerial controls, notably in the provision of various amenities and facilities; new devolved by-law making powers for regulation of matters and activities in the local community interest; updating of provisions relating to local authority membership and local authority meetings and procedures, for example, the public will be given a legal right of access to local authority meetings and the general modernisation and improvement of local government law.</P>
    <P>A devolution commission, which will operate under the Department of the Taoiseach, was set up in July 1995 to make recommendations on devolving significant additional functions to local government on the basis of a phased programme.  The commission has been asked to prepare statements of specific steps to renew the local government system. The first statement is expected by the end of 1995.  The question of classification, functions organisation and financial inter-relationships between town local authorities and the county is being examined by the Local Government Reorganisation Commission.</P>
    <P>In relation to finance, everybody is against sin and in favour of virtue, but Deputies will be aware that the Minister commissioned consultants to undertake a professional study of local government financing to honour the commitment in the policy agreement A Government of Renewal.  The commission hopes to publish a White Paper on the subject within a reasonable time.  The study will be undertaken in two stages and will focus on the current finances of local authorities.  It will examine all relevant issues such as existing and potential future expenditure requirements.  Work commenced on the study in July and I understand is on target.  I expect Stage 1 will be completed by the end of this year.  This stage of the study will bring forward funding options to be examined in depth in Stage 2. <Col N="1130" /> My constituency colleague, Deputy Quill, who made an impassioned speech on behalf of urban local authorities, suggested they fared less well than county councils in grants for the improvement and maintenance of non-national roads. That is not quite in line with the facts, because the total grants to urban authorities for the improvement and maintenance of urban roads increased from £6.06 million in 1993 to £10.683 million in 1995.  This represents an increase of 76 per cent in that period.  In the same period, total grants to county councils increased by 64 per cent.  These figures illustrate that urban authorities fared slightly better on a percentage basis than county councils.  It is the Minister's aim to secure the same level of funding for urban authorities in future years.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers noted that the regulations are a modest but nonetheless valuable measure of law reform.  I am pleased that the regulations will bring about an improvement.  In the time available to me I will try to deal with as many of the points raised as possible.  I will begin by dealing with questions concerning deposits.  Most speakers referred to the proposed increase in the deposit and the general view seems to be that we have got the balance right as far as that is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputies Dempsey and Callely, while not having any problem with the amount proposed, were concerned about the sharp increase and suggested the deposit should be index linked.  This is a problem which arises whenever any sum of money is mentioned in legislation, particularly in relation to fines, licence fees, application fees and so on. With changes in money values, the figures mentioned may quickly go out of date.  Index linking is a good idea and is already the practice in some countries. It is a matter which should be addressed on a general basis rather than in these specific regulations and in that context I will note the suggestion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Callely raised the issue of election workers being unable to cast their votes.  The position on voting by polling staff at a local election is that <Col N="1131" /> such a person employed by a returning officer, whose duties are such that he or she is unable to vote at his or her own polling station, may be authorised by the returning officer to vote at another polling station in the same local electoral area.  The reason for confining the facility to the local electoral area is obvious in the case of local elections. There is an entirely separate election in each electoral area and clearly a person could not be authorised to vote in an election in which he or she is not eligible to vote.</P>
    <P>Deputies Jimmy Leonard and Noel Ahern referred to Sunday and weekend voting.  The Electoral Act, 1992 removed the statutory barrier to voting on Sundays.  There is now no statutory reason an election or referendum cannot be held on a Sunday.  The appointment of a polling day is a matter for decision on each occasion and further legislation on that point is not required. It is not clear that more people would have an opportunity to vote if elections and referenda took place on a Saturday or Sunday rather than midweek as at present.  Neither is it clear that voting at weekends would be the only or best way of facilitating those for whom the existing practice is not suitable.  In this context, the proposal to appoint a Friday as polling day at the forthcoming referendum will serve as a useful indicator as to whether electors are facilitated by a move towards weekend voting.  Weekend voting is one of the electoral matters referred by the Minister to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs for consideration.</P>
    <P>I have noted the comments made by Deputies about polling station signs. Deputy Callely commented that some electors in urban areas, who live quite close to polling stations were sometimes assigned to vote at a more distant premises. Polling arrangements are based on a polling scheme drawn up by local authorities as a reserved function.  I am sure local authorities exercise great care in this regard and try to suit the convenience of electors as far as possible. <Col N="1132" /> Deputy Ferris referred to the fact that polling schemes require confirmation by the Minister and, as the Deputy pointed out, this can lead to correspondence between the Department and the local authority on the details of the scheme. Access to polling stations by persons with disabilities was mentioned.  The accessibility of polling stations is regarded as an administrative matter and appropriate administrative guidance is provided to returning officers. They are advised that polling stations should always be located on the ground floor and that they should select premises with a view to facility of access by the infirm and persons with disabilities. They are advised, where necessary, to consider installing temporary ramps.</P>
    <P>Deputies Ferris and Crawford spoke of the need to improve arrangements for drawing up the register and special voters list and also sought improved voting arrangements for persons who have difficulty getting to their polling stations.  That matter will be addressed. The automation of counting was raised by Deputy Quill and others.  There are no specific proposals at present to automate our voting system.  A preliminary examination of this issue some years ago indicated that computerised voting is technically feasible but would involve significant practical difficulties and costs due to our single transferable vote system. With a first past the post system such as that in the United States, machine voting is straightforward; essentially all that is required is a meter to total each candidate's votes.  Such a system would cause problems given our system.  The position is being kept under review in the light of technological developments.</P>
    <P>Vote counting was also raised. Because of the complexity of our system, it would be difficult to get around the situation that currently exists.</P>
    <P>Deputies Ring and Kavanagh raised the question of voting rights for emigrants. Emigrant representation has been the subject of debate in recent years.  There now seems to be a general <Col N="1133" /> acceptance of the principle that emigrants should be represented in the Oireachtas but there are differing views as to what form the representation should take.</P>
    <P>Arising from a commitment in the policy agreement, A Government of Renewal, the Government decided to sponsor a constitutional amendment Bill to provide for the election of three Irish emigrants to Seanad Éireann.</P>

      <P>I can easily understand the reason Bills of this kind come before the House.  As a Deputy representing an urban constituency I am aware, as are my colleagues, of the cancer, that is, crime, in our community.  I also understand that the issue of crime and how to deal with it is a complex one.  As with all complex problems we are sometimes more inclined to seek the quick simple solutions rather than properly considered ones which will have deeper and longer lasting effects.  Along with many colleagues, I have attended meetings of communities where the issue of crime has been discussed.  We must be aware of the crying need of people to deal with this problem.  They want to see action taken by the Legislature and the Minister and obviously it is appropriate that we should respond in a considered way rather than in a kneejerk fashion.</P>
      <P>I suspect there is a danger of throwing out the baby with the bath water.  Our legal system and, for that matter, our concept of democracy, rest on the presumption of innocence for the accused. In the words of the Supreme Court, punishment starts with conviction, not beforehand.  To deny people bail on the recommendation of the Garda treads on this concept.  In France and Italy and many other mainland European jurisdictions, upwards of 40 per cent of people in prison have not been convicted of any offence.  We will be aware from our experience of Irish prisoners abroad that many prisoners spend a lengthy period on remand before they come to court in the first instance.  This is a scenario we would do well to study before going down this road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other realities we cannot ignore.  Our prisons are already full. Those who continually call for support for the Garda Síochána, as we all do, should not forget that the revolving door syndrome deeply affects morale. That is not surprising.  There can be scarcely anything more debilitating for the Garda, or individual gardaí, than to arrest and successfully convict a person over a period in court and to find that <Col N="1135" /> after a six months sentence they are out on the streets again within three weeks. I suspect that if the thrust of this proposal were to be adopted, without the allocation of huge extra resources &mdash; I stress that point &mdash; the revolving door might well become a spinning door.</P>
    <P>I confess I am cynical about proposals to provide for extra spaces in prisons and, indeed, extra prisons.  It is probably like road building.  The more roads one builds the greater the number of cars on them.  I have a suspicion that the same would apply to jails: the more we have, the more we fill.  I accept that the accommodation in our prisons is not adequate.  We will have to provide more places but we should not pretend to ourselves that that in itself will be sufficient to resolve our crime problems.  As I said earlier, quick and easy solutions are easy to articulate; they are much more difficult to put in place.  To quote my Labour colleague in Britain, Tony Blair, the leader of the Labour Party, there is no point just being tough on crime; we also have to be tough on the causes of crime.  We would do well to look to Britain to appreciate their experience. Their laws on bail are more stringent than ours.  The rate of offending while out on bail is also higher than ours.</P>
    <P>Having said that I want to be positive. I accept there is some merit in the proposal put by Deputy O'Donoghue and there are other measures which could usefully be taken.  Unquestionably our courts system needs to be speeded up. If we are to allow people out on bail, as we do at present, we should also reduce the length of time they are waiting to be tried.  In that context, I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister that up to 17 extra judges will be appointed.  Nevertheless, as the new legal term commences, it is clear a great deal more needs to be done.</P>
    <P>In order to relieve the pressure of the burgeoning prison population, further development and expansion of non custodial sentences has to be considered.  A good example is the community service <Col N="1136" /> orders, introduced by this House some years ago.  Sadly, that system has never been properly resourced.  In order to work properly it clearly needs considerable extra resources to be provided for the Probation and Welfare Service which supervises it.  There is no point in providing that somebody should carry out a community service if there is nobody to supervise the carrying out of that service or if nobody looks at what service needs to be done.</P>
    <P>The whole area of juvenile justice was discussed by a Dáil committee, under the chairmanship of Deputy Quill, which produced an excellent report that was debated in the House over two years ago.  Included among the recommendations in that report are many measures, of a punitive nature, which can be taken, short of custodial sentences. I share the disappointment of other Deputies that that legislation has not yet reached us.</P>
    <P>There are also specific measures in relation to bail which could be of assistance in addressing the problem.  As the Law Reform Commission report points out, the measures provided under the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, have never been properly used or used to the full, specifically the measures in relation to consecutive prison sentences, which had a significant effect when first introduced in the mid-1980s, but seem to be less effective now.  The suggestion in the commission's report is that this is largely because of the way it has been interpreted in recent years by the courts. Forfeiting of bail is not being used as widely as it should be.  I appreciate that both measures present some difficulty but we must look to rigorous implementation.</P>
    <P>In regard to the point made in this Bill, I would have been one of those who, until recently, would have said we should jealously guard our civil libertarian record and that we should not make any amendment to the bail laws. I confess I have changed my mind and having examined it carefully I believe there are certain limited circumstances where we should increase the powers of <Col N="1137" /> the courts to refuse bail.  The courts should be entitled to refuse bail where an individual applying for bail has already reoffended while on bail.  In doing that we would limit the individual's rights based on past experience rather than speculation as to what they might do in the future.  I do not know whether that would require a constitutional amendment.  If so, it is something we should consider.  There is also a case to be made for refusing bail to somebody who, because of an obvious drugs dependency problem, is extremely likely to reoffend while on bail.  That will have to be considered.</P>
    <P>The Minister is right when he says we need more time to consider the implications of the Law Reform Commission report before putting any proposal to the people or enacting legislation.  This is the second time in a calendar year that we have discussed the issue of bail. In both cases the proposers of the legislation knew we were awaiting the Law Reform Commission report.  In this case the proposal emanates from a colleague of a Minister who first initiated the commission's involvement in the issue.  A cynic could argue that this has as much to do with seeking political capital from the crime issue as with trying to find a workable solution.</P>
    <P>There is little point in having a Law Reform Commission if we are not prepared to give it the courtesy of considering its findings.  The report is an extensive one.  It addresses how other common law jurisdictions dealt with the issue of bail.  Unquestionably, our current regime is among the most liberal.  It is interesting to note that some countries, such as Australia, which have gone furthest in tightening their bail laws are now considering liberalising them again.</P>
    <P>Our experience in the mid-1980s is interesting.  Then, as now, we were in the middle of a drugs epidemic.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1984, had limited success in reducing the level of crime committed by persons while on bail. This problem, like our drugs problem, has returned.  Last year there was an increase of about 40 per cent in the <Col N="1138" /> number of crimes committed by people on bail.  As the Minister has rightly pointed out, stringent anti-drug legislation has recently been proposed and will, no doubt, soon be considered.  If, as in the early 1980s, we bring our drugs problem under control, we may well see a reduction in the number of offences committed on bail.  The connection is obvious and widely acknowledged by the public.</P>
    <P>I do not doubt that we would have little difficulty passing this proposed amendment or a similar one if it was put to the people as there is widespread support both inside this House and among the general public for changes in the bail laws.  To do so now, however, would be to neglect our duty as legislators, that is to analyse and legislate for the best options open to us.  Clearly we are not yet at that stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamBurke" hpid="Mr. L. Burke Mr. L. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand the positive motivation of the Fianna Fáil Party to bring forward this welcome Bill.  However, the Minister for Justice requires more time to study a report on bail from the Law Reform Commission. This is understandable and very necessary.</P>
      <P>I wish to concentrate on an aspect of law and order that is causing great distress to the vast majority of my Cork constituents.  When I spoke some time ago on drugs and drug related crime I was subjected to many abusive phone calls from people associated with the distribution of drugs.  It is a sad day when a public representative cannot speak his mind on the scourge of drugs. The misuse of drugs especially by young people concerns me greatly.  The drug barons and their pushers have made determined efforts to control the youth. This should not surprise us, given the rich pickings from drug trafficking.  One speaks out at one's peril against these people and their trade, as I can attest.  I know how bad the position in Cork is, so bad that I am reminded of it at my clinics each week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to do something about what I would describe as the urban terrorism <Col N="1139" /> of the drugs racket.  The facts are straightforward.  Drug pushers ensnare the very young at school, often giving them free samples until they are hooked.  To feed this habit requires up to £150 per day, a sum not even a well to do family could afford.  This daily expense is recovered through crime, muggings, aggravated assaults, house breaking and so on.  It is estimated that 85 per cent of crime committed today is drug related and I would not dispute that.  Our society has the fester of a drugs culture that is almost engulfing us. We have to get to the root of this cancer and cut it out.  We do so by taking the big stick to the drug lords and their followers. I believe we are operating against them with one hand tied behind our backs.</P>
    <P>Every member of the security forces should be engaged in the fight against the drug barons who are in effect combating the very authority of the State.  If this means using the Army and its vast intelligence resource, so be it.  In a time of crisis no garda should be delivering summonses, writing out parking tickets or engaged in routine jobs while a major problem of drugs threatens us all.  We must show these drug criminals that we mean business in a dramatic way.</P>
    <P>It is acknowledge that the drugs detection rate is getting better.  There have been notable successes but they do not go far enough.  The modern day Al Capones of this world are getting fat on their ill gotten gains.  They and their families will not, of course, touch the deadly stuff, knowing the problems that will inevitably follow.  In their smug protective comfort they wheel and deal in death and threaten with deadly consequences those who would expose them.  We are fighting a war in every city, town and village and anyone who believes otherwise is living in a fool's paradise.</P>
    <P>I represent a largely deprived area, parts of which have exceptionally high unemployment and are ripe for exploitation. The drugs problem is not only a city phenomenon but towns and rural <Col N="1140" /> communities suffer in the same way.  I know one small place where pushers were driven out with hurley sticks by an enraged community.  It was home brewed justice.  How could one blame those fathers whose children had been damaged in the most unimaginable way?  The lessons of the past should be the springboard to launch an all out offensive against drugs and that means sparing nothing in resources and manpower.</P>
    <P>There should also be a new awareness programme about the drugs culture that has taken hold here and elsewhere. Young people and teenagers are at risk and should receive the highest priority in any education campaign.  I know a great deal has been achieved in this regard but we need to do more.  The worst sight of all is to see a person under the influence of drugs, a sight that is becoming all too common.  The price the family and the person has to pay for this addiction is horrendous in the extreme and the price society pays is no less damaging.</P>
    <P>We stand on the threshold and what we decide now will determine the future of our society.  Is it to be one poisoned by drugs and its dreadful fall out or a society free from the ravages of a sub culture that is eating away at all the principles we hold so dear?  That is the challenge that faces us all and it cannot be swept aside.  If we are to pass on our Irish culture and all we hold dear to succeeding generations we had better defeat the importation of illegal drugs and put the drug barons and pushers in a place where they belong, prison.  How does one describe the person who pulls the strings of the deadly drugs trade &mdash; he or she is nothing but a slave trader. How does one describe a person who ruins life as casually as one goes for a walk &mdash; a terrorist with a lot of blood on his hands.  Perhaps one passes on the street without recognising them the cowardly fat cats drooling on their ill gotten gains.  We must concentrate on stopping them and cutting them off from their supply.  By putting the drugs <Col N="1141" /> problem under tight wraps we effectively will find solutions to many of the criminal and social problems affecting our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this fundamental issue and I recognise the wide divergence of views.  It is very wrong to hold out the promise of a solution which is false because it will not redress the problem it hopes to address.  False hope is worse than having no hope at all.  In times of crisis there is always the temptation to seek a quick fix solution and there is no doubt we are currently facing a law and order crisis which threatens to undermine society.  I do not believe that the introduction of preventive detention will address the root causes of social breakdown and I do not believe that it will satisfactorily address the symptoms.</P>
      <P>Last week the Law Reform Commission published an examination of the law on bail.  While it was not mandated to make specific recommendations, its findings should be of concern to those who see restrictions on bail as a panacea for all our ills.  Any move to further restrict bail would undermine the presumption of innocence which is at the heart of our legal system.  If a constitutional amendment along the lines proposed by Fianna Fáil and endorsed by other elements of the political establishment were put to the people and passed it would result in the introduction of preventative detention.  I accept the spirit behind the introduction of this Fianna Fáil Bill, but that does not take from its effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Fianna Fáil Bill any person charged with an offence could be remanded in custody if the judge is satisfied, &ldquo;that there is a probability that the person will commit a class of criminal offence ... if admitted to bail&rdquo;. Eleven years ago Members of Dáil Éireann debated our bail provisions at some length prior to the passage of the Criminal Justice Bill, 1994.  That Act contains several provisions relating to offences committed while on bail. Eleven years on, those provisions have <Col N="1142" /> had little effect on the number of crimes committed by people on bail.  The latest figures show that under 3,000 indictable offences were committed by persons on bail last year.  That is around 9 per cent of detected offences as against 10 per cent for the previous year.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that our bail laws are being abused, but to what extent is the abuse of bail a significant factor in the mounting crime figures, and to what extent have we latched on to the issue of bail as an easy answer?  The rate of offences committed by people on bail has stabilised at around 9 to 10 per cent, yet in England, which has far tighter bail restrictions, the rate is about 17 per cent.  We should bear that in mind, because we like to quote statistics from England in connection with all our other ills but refuse to recognise statistics such as those I quoted.  The objective evidence is that restricting bail has little effect in crime figures.  It is also true that those intending to abuse their bail have plenty of time to do so.</P>
    <P>Spiralling crime rates, together with a shortage of judges and cumbersome legal procedures have led to increasing delays between a person being charged with an offence and the case reaching trial.  It can take anything up to two years to get a person to court.  Two years in preventive detention or out on bail is a very long time.  Reducing these delays would go a long way towards cutting the number of crimes committed by people on bail because they would have less time to reoffend while on bail.  If we do not reduce the delays the net effect of restricting bail will be simply to consign large numbers of people to indefinite detention in preventive custody pending trial.  We will have sacrificed one of our most fundamental liberties, and what will we have gained in return?  The evidence does not indicate that our streets will be significantly safer as a result.</P>
    <P>The so-called revolving door syndrome has had a far greater impact on crime figures than the availability of bail.  This is caused to a large extent by the lack of prison spaces, but we have not yet addressed the central issue of <Col N="1143" /> how we use available prison space.  Are the right people receiving custodial sentences? In reply to a Dáil question earlier this year the Minister for Justice informed me that in 1992, the most recent year for which figures are available, 1,665 people were imprisoned for civil debt or the non-payment of fines. How many places would have been created by the building of a prison at Castlerea?</P>
    <P>In reply to another question I was told that the average amount owed by people imprisoned for civil debt or non-payment of fines was about £761.  The sentences ranged from five to 90 days and, in the case of debt, no remission of sentence is allowed, regardless of any extenuating circumstances.  It is absurd that debtors should be taking up scarce prison places while violent criminals are freed due to lack of prison accommodation. It is equally absurd that we should be paying between £600 and £700 a week to imprison people for what may be relatively insignificant offences.  In many cases people fail to comply with a court order to pay a civil debt or a fine simply because they cannot afford to do so.  In such cases an alternative method of payment, for example, budget instalments, should be worked out.</P>
    <P>Since 1992 the situation has been further exacerbated by restrictions on the powers of the Minister for Justice to reduce fines.  Where a person can afford to pay but refuses to do so, community service orders would be a more appropriate sanction than imprisonment.  The Government is committed to ending imprisonment for civil debt and non-payment of fines where practicable.  I hope this will be given the urgent attention we seem to be giving other issues. The revolving door syndrome must be ended, and the release of persons from prison must be part of a pre-planned process.  In this regard I hope the Minister will examine the establishment of a parole board.  I am sure she must be sick of hearing me say it, but it is indicated in the Programme for Government, and <Col N="1144" /> it would go a long way towards putting order on the release of persons back into the community.</P>
    <P>Offenders must come to realise that, when sentenced, they will serve their time.  By the same token, all persons must be presumed innocent until they have been convicted of a crime, and they must be assured that their basic freedoms will be vindicated.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the Fianna Fáil amendment is proposed as a codicil to Article 40.1 of the Constitution, modifying the statement that &ldquo;all citizens shall, as human persons, be held equal before the law&rdquo;.  That statement is an implicit and explicit recognition of equality.  It is the bedrock on which our Constitution rests, and any attempt to undermine that statement of equality undermines all our rights.</P>
    <P>In an era of spiralling crime rates we are forced to weight individual liberties against the public good, but there is no evidence that the introduction of preventive custody would have any effect on the crime rates.  In the absence of such evidence I am not prepared to endorse any further restrictions on the granting of bail.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill.  When I speak in this House I always try to treat the subject before us in a realistic fashion.  I will do no less when speaking of the need to restrict the granting of bail by the courts because it is a sensible course of action to take.  Many people who have been granted bail have gone on to further offend for a variety of reasons.  These may include further crimes of robbery or larceny to provide for a family before being sent to jail.  This was anticipated <Col N="1145" /> by Mr. Justice Murnaghan in his landmark judgment in the O'Callaghan case when he said: &ldquo;A prisoner facing a heavy sentence has little to lose if he commits further offences.  A prisoner may consider that he has to go to prison in any event and, in an effort to get money to support his family, may commit further offences&rdquo;.  It is interesting to read in the Law Reform Commission report that there is a provision for giving tougher sentences to people who commit crimes while on bail.  For some unknown reason that does not appear to be happening.  This element is one of the central planks for the limitation of bail and should be understood and accepted by everyone.</P>
    <P>The Government has turned tail on this issue and the public should be made aware that while the Minister knows and accepts &mdash; at least she did last spring &mdash; that a change in our bail laws is necessary and desirable, she is either unwilling or incapable of doing anything about it.  We all remember the Minister's about-face on this issue and it is not difficult to know from where the pressure came to change her mind.  It is regrettable that, while the Minister and the other members of the Government drive around in a protected environment and some even enjoy a well guarded home, many others in this city and elsewhere are afraid to close their eyes through fear of attack.  Worse still, people are even afraid to stop at traffic lights for fear of being robbed in that short time and in broad daylight.</P>
    <P>The increasing drug problem is a major factor.  I am not laying all the blame for this at the Minister's door or that of the Government, but it must be realised that there is a drug problem, that people rob to feed that habit and irrespective of whether they are on bail, as long as they are at liberty they will have to rob to pay for their drugs.  Those people must be taken out of circulation. It is the ramblings of the irresponsible that would suggest they should be set free after arrest and charge when they do not have the capacity to stay out of trouble because of their dependence <Col N="1146" /> on drugs.  There must be a reasonable likelihood that they will reoffend and that alone would give rise to the reservations expressed by Mr. Justice Walsh, also in the O'Callaghan case, when he stated:</P>
    <P>From the earliest times it was appreciated that detention in custody pending trial could be a cause of great hardship and it is as true now as it was in ancient times that it is desirable to release on bail as large a number of accused persons as possible who may safely be released pending trial.</P>
    <P>As my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, pointed out last week his proposal is not radical and would only broadly bring our bail laws into line with those in Great Britain.  It should be noted that it is up to judges to deny bail if they believe that is necessary.  Would it not be kinder to retain in custody those with a drug dependency and commence a programme of detoxification and rehabilitation to get them out of the clutches of the drug dealers?  Even drug addicts would agree with that.</P>
    <P>Not all crimes are committed by people on bail pending trial but there is incontrovertible evidence to show that as much as one-quarter of all serious crime is committed by people while on bail.  It is ludicrous not to do something about this, insensitive in the extreme to people who huddle in their homes at night for fear of attack and an abandonment of our responsibility and duty to legislate for all the people.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the recent Law Reform Commission report on bail, quite rightly, put forward the notion that bail is a privilege, a respite for an accused before his or her trial and that offending during that period is a breach of that privilege.  According to that argument, the accused who is charged is more often than not guilty and the delays in the system prevent this from being established and a sentence imposed immediately.  Thus, when such offenders offend they do so in a period of liberty to which they are not really entitled but which is granted to them as <Col N="1147" /> a concession.  This argument appears to have particular force where an offender is caught red-handed or the evidence appears overwhelming.  In such cases, trial appears to be a formality.</P>
    <P>One must also reflect on the psychological effects on the public and the gardaí of the release of an offender.  It must damage the morale of gardaí to see an offender recently apprehended for a crime released to commit more crime.  They have a sense of futility about their ability to enforce the law with their hands tied behind their backs. It is a natural reaction of the general public to lose confidence in the system when they see known criminals freely roaming the streets, even though they have been charged in respect of one or more offences.</P>
    <P>We must have regard for confidence levels in the Garda Síochána and the public generally.  It could be argued that public alarm is a valid reason for refusing release.  A murder suspect is generally not allowed out on bail on the premise that he or she might abscond from this jurisdiction.  Imagine the outcry if some of those people were free pending trial.  If we do not respond to people's needs we abdicate our responsibilities and, while I realise it is easier to do nothing than to take courageous and sometimes unpopular decisions, we must be a parliament for all the people at risk from crime.  We must be effective leaders.</P>
    <P>In proposing these changes to the Constitution and our law, we advocate the withdrawal of liberty only on the order of a judge.  In many circumstances it will not be easy to refuse bail.  Many of the people whose liberty would be so withdrawn would willingly and without qualm deprive others of their freedom for no reason.  If there is a balance to be struck, surely it must take that factor into account.</P>
    <P>Those of us who want the bail laws tightened are regularly told we live in the past, have stone age thinking and a regressive outlook.  I prefer to believe we live in the age of realism, the age <Col N="1148" /> when the innocent suffer unnecessarily, are imprisoned in their homes when they should be free to come and go as they please and live in fear when they should have security and peace of mind. If anyone is to be discommoded it should be those who have been through the initial process of arrest and charge for indictable offences rather than the innocent.  We have lost sight of that in recent years.  If the Minister is interested in having a better system of justice that does not unjustly deprive people of their liberty, she must consider a complete overhaul of the criminal justice system, a move I know she will agree is long overdue.  This is something we have been trying to do since coming into Opposition.</P>
    <P>More judges, better courtrooms and consulting areas would speed up the process and contribute to a more humane environment.  Justice delayed is justice denied and the Minister must address the issue of delays in the system, particularly in the traditional holiday period when courts rise and convene only for urgent business.  There is no such thing as the five day criminal or a criminal holiday shutdown.  For them it is business as usual and the Minister must ensure that court lists are shortened considerably as soon as possible. I stated in the House last May that an effective Garda force, a practical code of criminal law and a logical approach to bail and freedom are all part of what makes life bearable for people in any democracy, particularly those living in urban areas.</P>
    <P>I am not advocating the elimination of constitutional freedoms, but the majority of people who walk our streets, drive in our cities and who have to triple lock their doors at night also have constitutional rights and need to be protected from criminals.  I do not need to explain that with freedom goes responsibiliy. If people endanger their freedom through involvement in crime they, and not the innocent, should suffer.  That is what this Bill is about, it is not a plot to rob people of their legitimate freedom. I support the principle and the letter of <Col N="1149" /> the measure and am pleased that this practical solution to a real problem is being put forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute and congratulate Deputy O'Donoghue on his work in preparing this and the earlier Bill on bail.  Listening to speakers from all sides, it is widely accepted that a fundamental reappraisal of our bail laws is urgently required.  Nothing was said to the contrary.  In dealing with crime and related matters &mdash; I was reminded of this by something Deputy Kenneally said &mdash; one is talking about justice not only for the accused, but for all the people.  No matter what sensitivities we may have, to a lesser or greater degree, about the curtailment of freedoms and rights under the Constitution and the common law &mdash; it seems some people become extremely sensitive when we discuss issues such as this &mdash; we have to juxtapose it with the common good and the principle of justice for all.</P>
      <P>Given the opportunities they have had in recent weeks, the failure of the Minister for Justice and the Government to give a commitment to hold a referendum on bail is a disgraceful denial of the right of the people to have their voice heard on this issue.  In circumstances where crime is escalating out of control and drug abuse is rampant, all the resources of the State must be brought to bear to tackle this frightening development.  In 1994, 4,400 detected crimes were committed by persons while on bail.  This warrants an immediate response from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures, which have been increasing steadily since 1990, speak for themselves and provide a stark illustration of the criminal's mentality &mdash; the blatant and deliberate abuse of the freedom or privilege, as Deputy Kenneally rightly described it &mdash; most legal experts concur &mdash; afforded to a suspect or an accused by treating our system of justice with utter contempt.  We can couch this simple statistic in whatever terms we like and say that it represents only 10 per <Col N="1150" /> cent or 20 per cent of the total number of indictable crimes committed in a particular year, but we cannot get away from the fact that we are faced with a crisis.</P>
    <P>Communities in cities, towns and many parts of rural Ireland are under siege.  The Minister, who lives on the outskirts of Dublin city where I and many of my colleagues live and work, is well aware that there is a crisis.  The basic fundamental and constitutional right of law abiding citizens to security and freedom of movement is constantly being undermined by the godfathers of crime and modern day Al Capones marauding our streets with impunity.</P>
    <P>When I say that the necessary measures must be taken to tackle the problem head-on some people challenge me and ask if this means that we should bring out the guns and blow them away; it does not, it means that we should tackle the problem with utter determination and use every resource and facility available to us.  If that means invoking the voice of the people, so be it.  If we fail to do this quickly, our system of justice will be brought into disrepute among the overwhelming majority to whom we look for support for our institutions and system of justice.</P>
    <P>Because of the extremely restrictive conditions for refusing bail laid down by the Supreme Court in the 1966 case, to which Deputy Kenneally referred in detail and the increasing abuse of these restrictions by the criminal, a failure to invoke the voice of the people represents a cyncial disregard for the welfare, well-being and security of our people.</P>
    <P>Let me give a stark example.  If a person is charged with robbery in a case which does not involve violence, he will be denied bail if there is reason to believe he might not turn up for his trial. However, if a person suspected of being a serial killer is arrested and charged and there is no reason to believe he will not turn up for his trial or interfere with witnesses, the court is compelled to grant him bail despite the fact he is likely to commit another murder while <Col N="1151" /> out on the streets.  Surely, this is the embodiment of stupidity of the highest order; our law on bail is an ass.</P>
    <P>The Minister recognised this when she pre-empted the findings of the Law Reform Commission and announced that she was prepared to ask the people to amend the law in a referendum.  Having publicly acknowledged the problem and having decided to take action I could not challenge her bona fides with any conviction.  However, I am convinced that the beseiged public will roundly condemn her partners in Government, the Labour Party and Democratic Left, for the indecent haste with which they scuttled her into a state of paralysis.</P>
    <P>Let me give another less sinister, but by no means less serious example.  In 1993, well before the Minister took office, two well known hardened criminals went on the rampage while on bail robbing shops, service stations, banks, building societies and supermarkets in my constituency.  They were easily identified having been caught frequently on security cameras.  In other cases shopkeepers informed me that they and their sons readily identified them as they ran out of their shops, could tell me where they lived, where they had committed other offences and that they were out on bail.  On one occasion one of them had the audacity to hire a taxi on the pretext that he wanted to be driven into town to collect his dole.  En route he attempted to commit four burglaries &mdash; I am aware of four locations where he stopped &mdash; pointing out on each occasion to the unsuspecting taxi driver that he had important messages to collect. When apprehended and charged these two criminals were again let out on bail thumbing their noses at the Garda Síochána, their victims and the local community who knew them so well.</P>
    <P>We will be informed that consecutive sentences may be imposed for offences committed while on bail, but this is regarded as a sick joke by communities under siege, the victims of crime and all <Col N="1152" /> those who feel they will be the next victim. If the policy of consecutive sentencing is to have any effect, the two gentlemen I described should be removed from society for the rest of their natural lives.</P>
    <P>We have been realistic enough to acknowledge that when we talk about changing the law on bail inevitably this will warrant a significant increase in the number of prison spaces.  Deputy O'Donoghue admitted that substantial additional funds would be required, but is the well-being and security of our citizens to be deliberately ignored or compromised in the interests of fiscal rectitude?  The answer is obvious.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not need the report of the Law Reform Commission to state publicly last March where she stood and that she would tackle this crisis.  I ask her to come clean and renew her commitment to hold a referendum on bail. The many besieged communities in Dublin and throughout the country will overwhelmingly endorse her action.  All in all, given their serious plight, they deserve no less.</P>
    <P>We all welcome the report of the Law Reform Commission on bail and have gained valuable insights from its research and analysis.  The Minister should not hide behind it and use it as a licence for inaction.  If she were to do so in the present climate, she would incur the wrath of decent people in every corner of this city and country.</P>
    <P>Other aspects have to be considered. The revolving door syndrome was mentioned. This presents a serious problem which arose because of the lack of prison spaces.  Some Deputies have argued that providing additional places is not necessarily the correct thing to do.  I do not say it is the final solution but it is part of it.  It is regrettable that the Minister's decision to proceed with the Roscommon prison was chopped overnight. We cannot encourage and promote confidence in a system of justice where those who are charged, found guilty and sentenced to prison are let in one door and out the other.  That must stop except in cases where we can divert the <Col N="1153" /> guilty to community programmes, preferably in their own areas.  Once the judge invokes the option of sending the guilty to prison they should be made to serve their full sentence.</P>
    <P>The right to silence is a sensitive issue.  Some people say a suspect should not be forced to make a statement.  A prominent lawyer, Martin Crotty, BL, who was challenged on the merits or otherwise of removing the right to silence said: &ldquo;innocent people usually demand the right to speak; persons who are guilty usually invoke the privilege of silence&rdquo;.  That says much about what I think of the right to silence in a number of cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister, who is not present tonight, should tell us where she stands and how she interprets the report of the Law Reform Commission.  The woolly elaboration of her diffuse views recently did nothing to enlighten us on where she or the Government stand on the issue of bail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution on this important issue.  I thank Deputies Kenneally and Fitzgerald for sharing their time with me.  I congratulate our spokesman on Justice, Deputy O'Donoghue, for introducing the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1995.  He has proved to be a most effective spokesman on Justice and has adopted a most responsible pursuit of law reform at a time when the level of crime in society is escalating out of all proportion.</P>
      <P>Over recent months he made appeal after appeal to the Minister to respond and face up to the current crime explosion.  One gets the feeling that the Minister cannot obtain the essential support of her Cabinet colleagues for the measures and plans she considers most important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot deny that there is a crisis. People are calling for action.  In recent weeks in my town of Tralee serious crimes were committed.  The people demand action from us as legislators. Every available assistance must be given <Col N="1154" /> to the Garda Síochána no matter what the cost.</P>
    <P>We must ask if there is a major policy difference between the three Government parties on the issue of law and order on the one hand and civil liberty on the other.  In the interests of openness, transparency and accountability I appeal to the Government to come clean on its plans for tackling the present crime wave, and in particular, ensure that further crime is not committed while the accused is on bail.  If there is a problem in the Government parties on this issue then it is not only desirable but essential that the crisis is openly admitted.  The escalating crime rate must be faced up to by the Government. Failure to do so will add further to the present problem.</P>
    <P>One solution is to extend and increase the number of available prison places and I appeal to the Government to put the legislative and operative changes in place which will allow our citizens to go about their lives without fearing for their personal safety or property.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy O'Donoghue on his positive approach to the problem. The Government offered him many opportunities for point scoring but he has been most positive with his offer of practical assistance to the Minister which, to date, has not been accepted. One can only hope that for the good of the people the Minister will accept his offer.  The proposed changes in the bail laws offer an early opportunity to the Minister in this regard.</P>
    <P>It cannot be denied that both the extent and nature of criminal activity in society has been on the increase for a number of years.  While the illegal gain of money or property continues to be the focus of most crime the diversity and extent of violent crime against the person has shown a nasty upward turn in recent years.  While crimes such as murder, rape, sexual abuse and grievous assault were a rare occurrence in rural areas, one has only to read the daily newspapers to see the massive increase in such crime.</P>
    <P>Figures released recently are startling. <Col N="1155" /> There may be as many as 5,000 heroin addicts in Dublin city and it may require in the region of £150 a day to feed an addict's habit.  That is approximately £50,000 a year.  We should consider the trail of disaster which drug addiction leaves in its wake.  Many young people's lives are destroyed both physically and mentally and their aspirations and plans go overboard.  The addict's family is upset and the family unit will more than likely break up.  The cost of maintaining a drug habit is alarming.  If each addict required one victim to steal from each week to feed his or her habit 250,000 crimes would be committed each year and, consequently, there would be the same number of victims.</P>
    <P>The Garda are forced to divert scarce resources into dealing with the primary and secondary effects of drug abuse. This immediately takes a certain amount of pressure off non-drug related criminals. Our courts are the next link in the chain of justice to be challenged.  A clear consequence is obvious in the increased workload which is being forced through the under staffed court system which leads to unacceptable delays in the processing of individual cases.</P>
    <P>The limitations on the granting of bail are dire.  The Minister correctly identified this problem soon after assuming office.  The recent Law Reform Commission report provides shocking new information on the extent of abuse of our bail laws.  The contents of the table on page 36 are particularly alarming.  It shows that 36 per cent of the 98,772 reported offences in 1993 resulted in detection.  Therefore, two thirds of reported crime goes without redress. The second relevant finding is that 9 per cent of all detected crimes were carried out by people on bail at the time of arrest.  This involved a total of 3,201 detected crimes during 1993.  Taking into account the 3:1 ratio of reported crime to detected crime it is reasonable to estimate that a staggering 10,000 crimes are committed each year in this State by those on bail.  This is equivalent to 30 crimes and 30 victims each day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" /> These shocking figures clearly indicate the urgent need for reform in granting bail.  Every day's delay will potentially add a further 30 victims to the number.  This is equivalent to 210 cases per week and 1,000 each month.  I appeal to the Minister, and the Government, to face up to the serious crime level not only in Dublin but throughout rural Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with my colleague.  The subject of bail is one which we all know needs to be tackled but anyone who thinks there is a quick fix solution is misleading the public.  There is no quick fix solution for any aspects of crime.  The problem of crime needs to be addressed in a number of ways, in particular through education, rehabilitation, improvement and reorganisation of the courts.  The question of dealing with offences committed while on bail needs to be tackled in a comprehensive and realistic way. We must remind ourselves that people on bail are not convicted; they are innocent until proven guilty.</P>
      <P>Last May we debated Deputy O'Donoghue's Criminal Law (Bail) Bill.  At that time we were awaiting the Law Reform Commission report on its examination of bail law and the Government gave a commitment that the report would receive prompt consideration.  I said on that occasion that the Deputy would be well advised to await the report.</P>
      <P>The report has been published and, in the circumstances, it would be sensible to turn our attention to its contents and see how we might set about reforming the law in this area.  It would be folly to proceed with any measure of law reform on such a sensitive and difficult subject without giving proper consideration to the commission's report.  Indeed, it would amount to a negation of its work. Can anyone seriously suggest that we can have a full and constructive debate on the matter at a time when a detailed report has yet to receive the attention it undoubtedly deserves?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1157" /> The Law Reform Commission has done sterling work and it behoves us to study its report carefully. My reading of that report so far reinforces me in my opinion, expressed in the debate last May, that there are no easy answers to the issue of offending while on bail, just as there are no easy answers to the crime problem generally.  I might illustrate that point at this stage by outlining very briefly some of the contents of that report.</P>
    <P>In considering the extent of the problem of offending on bail, the commission urges caution in trying to extrapolate &mdash; from Garda figures available &mdash; the overall extent of the problem. On the subject of endeavouring to predict future criminal behaviour &mdash; and in the context of this Bill judges will be expected to engage in such prediction by weighing up the possibility of a person released on bail committing further offences &mdash; the commission concluded that the results of studies conducted with this aim are discouraging.  One section of the report which caused me particular concern was the comment in Chapter 4 &mdash; dealing with the law relating to bail in other jurisdictions &mdash; that there is concern in many countries about the use of bail on the basis that it discriminates against poor defendants. That brings me back to the point I made in the debate in May last about the need to tackle the underlying causes of our crime problem, about which I shall have more to say later.</P>
    <P>Looking at the arguments for and against preventive detention, the report gives very careful consideration to the issue of whether the commission of offences by people on bail warrants a departure from current practices.  A central factor here is whether pre-trial detention constitutes some form of punishment. Undoubtedly this would involve, at least, a curtailment of the present constitutional right to liberty and has implications for a primary principle of the criminal law in this country, namely, the presumption of innocence. Pre-trial detention also has serious <Col N="1158" /> implications for an accused person's ability to mount an effective defence to the charges faced.</P>
    <P>The report also sets out alternative methods of dealing with bail offending, which are a fairly powerful indication that the issue defies simple solutions. The alternatives explored by the commission are, first, to create a specific offence of breaching bail conditions where one of the conditions of bail is that an accused refrains from offending while on bail or create an actual offence of offending on bail; second, to attach, in addition to the normal conditions of bail, a &ldquo;good behaviour&rdquo; condition, a breach of which would lead to detention pending trial on the original charge; third, to estreat bail where the accused commits further offences although the current reluctance of the courts to estreat bail raises serious questions about the viability of this approach. Obviously the position of our courts is governed largely by the social circumstances of many people coming before them and the fact that to estreat bail would undoubtedly cause severe financial hardship on their relatives and-or spouses, a problem we cannot ignore, or the fact that our judges take it into consideration. The fourth alternative explored by the Law Reform Commission was to reduce the length of time a person is at liberty pending trial, which the commission describes as one of the most significant ways in which bail offending could be reduced and, lastly, to strengthen the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, regarding consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail.</P>
    <P>Representing a Dublin constituency I am acutely aware of the problem and the whole question of offences committed by drug addicts.  We need to examine carefully the nature of such offences, the type of sentences to which they would give rise and whether, if we are unable to reduce the period of time before trial, it might be the case that a person effectively would have served whatever sentence a court might impose before being brought to trial.  Equally I <Col N="1159" /> predict that would lead to a severe problem in terms of confidence in our criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>While I can understand the argument being advanced in relation to those likely to serve long sentences, for instance for armed robberies or other similar offences, in the case of those likely to be jailed for relatively more petty offences &mdash; although undoubtedly the type that cause enormous disruption of the happiness and enjoyment of life of many members of society, particularly in the case of those living in inner city flat blocks &mdash; the provisions of this Bill need to be teased out and examined. While I appreciate Deputy O'Donoghue's concern and his desire to act urgently, it is my considered view its provisions must be carefully and thoroughly considered or we might well end up with as many problems created as solved by such amendment.  Indeed the points made by the Law Reform Commission in relation to those remedies which are to hand in some form but which, for whatever reason, are not being resorted to at present, warrant serious consideration.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Law Reform Commission, after a very careful examination of the subject, sets out a number of methods, each with its drawbacks, of meeting the challenge posed by offenders on bail is a persuasive argument against quick-fix measures which are bound to fail.  We should examine closely, in particular, how we could reduce the length of time it takes to bring people to trial.  When talking about people's confidence in our criminal justice system, a critical factor is that it can take a very long time within our system to process a case.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to our plans to supply extra resources to the Judiciary. Nonetheless we must also examine the overall question of streamlining the management of our courts, greater effective use of the Garda and of the Director of Public Prosecutions, thus ascertaining how we can reduce the <Col N="1160" /> length of time it takes to bring somebody to trial.  Our aim must be to tackle crime in such a manner that we reduce the numbers entering our prisons in the first place.  To do so we must first examine the root causes of criminal behaviour which are very complex, in many cases arising from deep-seated social problems, not that the existence of such social problems or poverty should lead us to condone crime in any way.  Nonetheless we must understand the underlying factors which give rise to such offending and, unless we do so, our attempts to solve the crime problem will not amount to much.  Such an outcome would make legislators appear incompetent, bringing measures intended to reduce criminality into disrepute.  The fall-out from such a solution would be nothing short of disastrous for society. No Member of this House serious about solving the problem can afford to allow that to happen.</P>
    <P>Members of the Opposition would do well to take on board the comments of a former Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice, now European Union Commissioner, at a recent IFA conference.  Speaking about violence and crime, Commissioner Flynn said it was important not to become too alarmist on the issue, that the war against drugs and crime would be a long and difficult one and that we would do ourselves no favours by adopting panic responses.  His comments appear relevant to the approach of Members opposite in this debate.</P>
    <P>When I spoke in the debate in May last on Deputy O'Donoghue's Criminal Law (Bail) Bill, 1995, I referred to the difficulties many people faced in the poorer parts of Dublin.  They are persecuted by petty criminals, a particularly sad feature of the crime problem, in that the old and needy are themselves preyed upon for sums of money, sometimes incredibly small.  If defies understanding how so much misery can be inflicted in these circumstances, petty criminals rendering the lives of so many others absolutely unbearable.  In tandem with effective criminal justice measures, we must endeavour to address the <Col N="1161" /> problems of social deprivation at their root causes and make progress in that way.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue and his colleagues have jumped the gun on the legislative proposals.  While the Bill is evidence of the Deputy's commitment to seek to reform the law, such reform should await proper, detailed examination of the report of the Law Reform Commission.  Indeed, I consider the Government would be shirking its responsibility if it did otherwise.  In such circumstances, the Government has no option but to oppose the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I clearly understand the reason Deputy O'Donoghue has introduced this Bill as all Members are aware that the tentacles of crime have spread into every town and village, that it is a nationwide problem.  Much disquiet has been voiced about the bail laws.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1984, provides that a sentence of imprisonment for an offence committed while on bail must be consecutive on any sentence passed for other offences.  We could apply our minds to the interpretation which has been given to that in recent times.  The Law Reform Commission's report points out that the courts interpret the section to permit one of the consecutive sentences to be suspended and that deserves our legislative attention.  I do not speak from a civil libertarian viewpoint, rather I will consider the matters as a practising barrister.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission's report on bail is lengthy and detailed.  It will require adequate time for a proper consideration of its contents.  It does not contain a summary, as is usual for Law Reform Commission reports, making it more difficult to digest its full implications and placing a greater obligation on us not to assume the problems associated with offending on bail can be solved easily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report recognises, as does the thrust of this Bill, that by international standards we have liberal bail laws.  This should not come as a surprise given the <Col N="1162" /> strong judgments delivered in the landmark O'Callaghan case in 1966 and reinforced in the Ryan case in 1989.  The changes in society which have taken place since the O'Callaghan case, in particular the growth in the problem of drug addiction and associated crime and in crime generally, mean we must face new realities which our bail laws need to reflect.</P>
    <P>Although this is no doubt true, we simply cannot cast aside fundamental principles of the justice system such as the constitutionally protected right to liberty and the presumption of innocence. If we were to rush headlong, as this Bill considered only over a two week period might lead us to do, while failing to examine the possibility of reforms of criminal justice legislation as outlined by the Law Reform Commission, we might not do the legislative process the service we are elected to do.</P>
    <P>That is not to say our bail laws do not need reform.  Most Members of this House and most people outside would agree that change is needed to stop the problem of bail offending.  However, that requires careful and reasoned consideration. It was for that reason Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, then Minister for Justice, referred this matter to the Law Reform Commission.  It was asked to examine the issue as an expert body and the obligation is now on us as legislators to give the report proper and full attention.</P>
    <P>The problem of bail offending has many aspects.  It should be clear to all that the solution requires that the underlying causes be identified and remedied.  Figures as to the extent of drug abuse and resultant levels of crime have been mentioned.  The solution is not simply to ensure an earlier incarceration of suspects but to tackle the crime problem at source.  This in turn requires us particularly to examine the reasons so many young people turn to drugs&mdash; sadly it is mainly young people who are involved.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission recognises the complexities and in its report it outlines the extent of the problem of <Col N="1163" /> offending on bail but cautions against drawing assumptions from Garda figures on bail offending.  It expresses the view that attempts in other countries to predict likely criminal behaviour proved discouraging.  From this I infer it is difficult to predict with any degree of accuracy the likelihood that any particular person who applies for bail will commit further offences if it is granted.</P>
    <P>The issue must be viewed from a number of perspectives rather than from a single perspective as Deputy O'Donoghue has done.  It follows that this Bill alone cannot be a solution. Such a Bill should be examined in conjunction with the Law Reform Commission's proposals.  We must recognise Deputy O'Donoghue has demonstrated a genuine concern about the problem, for which he and his party have to be commended.  Hopefully, he will give his support to the Government measures in due course which will undoubtedly necessitate increases in public expenditure and which I will wholeheartedly support.  The resources required to tackle crime should not be sacrificed on the altar of fiscal rectitude.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission in its recent report on bail stated that, &ldquo;By international standards Ireland remands few persons in custody pending trial&rdquo;.  It further said that our law is &ldquo;unusually restrictive&rdquo; in the narrow grounds upon which bail may be refused by our courts.  It is abundantly clear that the two grounds upon which bail may be refused, as laid down in the Supreme Court judgment in the O'Callaghan case in 1966 and affirmed by the Supreme Court in the Ryan case in 1989, are too restrictive and narrow. The growth in the level of serious crime in recent times demands that this anachronism in our law be corrected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are unusual among common law jurisdictions in not having comprehensive bail legislation in recent years.  The time has come to fill the vacuum which exists in our criminal law.  The Minister for Justice criticised Fianna Fáil for <Col N="1164" /> indecent haste in introducing this Bill. Her flimsy excuse was that the Law Reform Commission report warrants critical analysis before any proposal can be put to the people or any legislation introduced.  Nobody believes this nonsense.</P>
    <P>The Minister saw no need to await the Law Reform Commission's report on bail last March when on national television she promised the people a referendum on bail which, she said, in all probability would be held in tandem with the divorce referendum.  The Minister was stopped in her tracks by the swashbuckling Minister for Finance who cancelled the prisons at Castlerea and Mountjoy when the Minister was absent.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice subsequently had a Damascus-like conversion and ran for cover behind the pending Law Reform Commission's report.  She knew as well as everybody else that even if she did obtain rainbow consent for a referendum on bail there would be no place to put the hardened criminals concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister has become a magician saying &ldquo;now you see it, now you don't&rdquo;, with a criminal justice policy which is just an illusion.  Meanwhile the level of serious crime is spiralling out of control. Time is of the essence in tackling the problem and this Bill affords the House the opportunity of recalibrating the scales of justice in order to redress the balance which has undoubtedly tilted in favour of serious and habitual criminals.</P>
    <P>The manner in which Article 40.4.1º of the Constitution has been interpreted by our courts in recent years warrants a review of the provision that: &ldquo;No citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law&rdquo;.  The Irish people are entitled to decide whether this balance is right, fair and just as between the serious criminal and the law-abiding citizen.  Nobody will have to look too deeply into their hearts to ascertain what the answer of the people would be.</P>
    <P>Our criminal law is clearly defective because it does not permit our courts to <Col N="1165" /> remand a person charged with a criminal offence in custody even where the court is quite satisfied the accused person will probably commit serious criminal offences if released on bail.  In the case of a hardened heroin addict not only is he likely to commit a crime while on bail, he almost definitely will &mdash; he must to feed his habit.  We let him on the streets again to prey on the community and we do not even treat the individual.</P>
    <P>The Minister should review what Mr. Justice Murnaghan said in his High Court judgment on the People <i>v.</i> O'Callaghan about the entitlement to bail of a person likely to commit further offences while on bail.  When the Supreme Court decided that case in the mid-1960s, the level of crime, the nature of crimes committed and the overall criminal activity profile were substantially different. Society has changed dramatically in that period and the crime culture is now largely drug driven.  All we say is that the criminal law should be changed to reflect and protect a changed society.</P>
    <P>Our society is eye-balled by criminal godfathers and sinister crime bosses. Every available statistic indicates that a definite part of this criminal subculture is here to stay but the reaction of the Minister for Justice is to maintain our laws as they are, cordial to serious criminal offenders.  Society is entitled to protect and defend itself against these perpetrators of vicious and callous offences against innocent, weak and decent people.  The Minister had better quickly realise that ministerial office means more than fanfare and trumpets.</P>
    <P>The implementation of this Bill would certainly de-liberalise our ultra-liberal bail laws to a certain extent, but in the final analysis it will merely bring us level with out fellow common law countries. It will do no more than empower our courts to refuse bail on similar grounds to which it can be refused by our nearest neighbours across the channel.</P>
    <P>Some so-called civil libertarians, who live in ivory towers somewhere in Utopia, argue there is no right to delimit personal liberty under our law.  In fact <Col N="1166" /> there is ample precedent for this.  To consider individual liberty as an absolute right is erroneous.  The many precedents include the O'Callaghan Supreme Court judgment, section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and the Mental Treatment Act.</P>
    <P>It is timely to reflect on the dictum of Mr. Justice Walsh in the O'Callaghan case, cited in the 1966 Irish Reports, where he referred to the deprivation of personal liberty &ldquo;in the most extraordinary circumstances carefully spelled out by the Oireachtas&rdquo;.  Those extraordinary circumstances have been created by the recent growth of serious crimes. In any event, the philosopher who said &ldquo;freedom to do every mortal thing one wants is to have no freedom at all&rdquo; was right.</P>
    <P>Our proposed amendment to the Constitution is carefully formulated to push back the rising tide of serious crime which constitutes a significant part of our criminal culture.  We want to prevent the commission of crimes by those who were heretofore granted bail even when there was a real likelihood they would go on a criminal rampage as soon as they were released from custody.</P>
    <P>The traditional basis on which bail was granted included grounds which are irrelevant today.  One such ground mentioned by the Minister was that a detained person might experience difficulty preparing his defence while in custody. Because of the growth of the rights of persons in custody, the ability to prepare a defence is not as hampered today as when the arguments on the right to bail were being defined.  The right to liberty as expressed in Article 40.4.1 of the Constitution is not nor should it ever be an absolute right.</P>
    <P>Some argue the creation of a specific separate offence where a person commits an offence when on bail would be a more enlightened approach to this.  This approach has recently commended itself in another jurisdiction and is not without merit.  However, because of the pressing problem created by the level of offences committed by those on bail in <Col N="1167" /> this jurisdiction, one can argue with merit that the problem needs a more determined response.  A new and demanding problem has arisen because of the level of crimes committed by those on bail and minimalist approaches will not succeed.</P>
    <P>The proposed increased grounds for refusal of bail will not deprive persons of bail in an extremely wide range of circumstances. There is no such thing in this country as a non-bailable offence. Admittedly refusal of bail on the likelihood of the person committing further offences is a form of preventative justice but the circumstances in which it would be refused are tightly circumscribed in the Bill.  In any event there are many examples in our criminal justice system where preventative justice has been used.</P>
    <P>This Bill, together with Fianna Fáil's Criminal Procedure Bill, 1995, would bring enlightened and desirable reform to our criminal law.  The new regime would make for more efficiency and fewer delays in bringing criminal offences to trial.  Under the current system some delays are necessitated by antiquated procedures under the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967; these are significantly improved upon in our Criminal Procedure Bill.</P>
    <P>The operation of our proposed system would demand further judicial appointments but this is needed anyway. Unless our criminal procedure laws are changed immediately the arrears and backlog in the list of criminal cases awaiting trial will be such as to lead to further accused persons walking free on the basis of an order of prohibition being granted by the High Court.  This has happened with increasing frequency because of delays in bringing criminal cases to trial.</P>
    <P>The Minister says we need to further consider the Law Reform Commission report &mdash; that is available and we know the arguments on both sides.  Everyone knows that under our laws the criminal <Col N="1168" /> is encouraged to commit further offences while on bail because it is unlikely to alter significantly the criminal penalty he is likely to suffer in many instances.  The most effective way to create a disincentive is to adopt the proposals in our Bill and not to create a further specific offence in relation to offences committed on bail.  This is because the latter will probably not deter a person from committing further offences.</P>
    <P>The courts liberally interpret the provision of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 whereby a person who commits a crime while on bail will get a consecutive sentence &mdash; this is being taken to mean a suspended sentence.  Accordingly, restricting bail in circumstances where there is a probability that the person will commit a further offence or offences on bail is justifiable as a legitimate solution, given the deluge of crime flowing from this type of offender.</P>
    <P>In a civilised democracy the citizen's right to liberty is of paramount importance. However the maintenance and preservation of a civilised democracy pre-supposes the right of law-abiding citizens to go about their daily lives and live safely in their homes without threat to or fear for person or property.  The civil rights of the majority are now under siege.  The Minister and the Government have decided to ignore their plight and are throwing excuses for prevarication and procrastination around this House like snuff at a wake. An individual's civil and human rights must be consistent with the common good and an ordered and safe society. The recent increase in serious crime has undermined and poses a real threat to a civilised democracy.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about the preservation of public peace and order, a civilised democracy and the right of law-abiding citizens to live without constant fear, we have not only a right but a duty to question certain assumptions about <Col N="1169" /> the individual's right to liberty.  With every right comes a duty and any right must be consistent with the fundamental rights of others.  The right to liberty has historically been subjected to some curtailment when public peace and order were under threat, as they are now.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution must at all times respond to human needs, shaped by the fundamental values and pressures of life and respect for life, bodily integrity and liberty.  These must be carefull balanced. This Bill would not derogate from our reputation as a country of enlightened criminal jurisprudence.  It does not contravene any internationally accepted criteria among enlightend common law jurisdictions, the European Convention on Human Rights, or the recommendations for pre-trial custody issued by the committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe.  In short, the Bill would make this country a safer place in which to live.  None of these considerations weighs heavily with the Minister for Justice or the Government which has been <Col N="1170" /> in office for almost a year without giving a legislative or tactical response to the problem.</P>
    <P>The cavalier dismissal of this Bill and other measures proposed by Fianna Fáil to tackle crime must be judged against the Government's paralysis and ineptitude. It appears that we have once again wasted our sweetness on the desert air.</P>
    <P>However, the day of reckoning inches closer with each passing day.  This Government, which cancelled the building of prisons, refused to change our bail laws, refused to implement new criminal procedures and presided over a remorseless rise in the tide of serious crime, will pay a very high price.  This Government, in short, is on a collision course with the electorate.  I believe that the jury is no longer out and is merely awaiting verdict day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>A few weeks ago, a district judge in Dublin imposed a custodial sentence on a 14 year old girl.  When a member of the Garda Síochána took her to the detention centre where she had been ordered to be detained he was informed, through an intercom, that there was no space for her there.  It is the regularity with which this kind of thing is happening, not just in Dublin but throughout the country, that prompted me to raise this matter this evening.  I wish to focus on two matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first is the lack of places.  Any person over the age of 16 years can be sent to St. Patrick's Institution.  This detention centre, which has served the State well, is now suffering from the same problems of overcrowding and pressure on space as other prisons.  Any person under the age of 16 years who receives a custodial sentence is sent to either a reformatory or an industrial school.  These detention centres are operated under separate regimes.  Industrial schools are also used as remand centres which puts further pressure on space.  They are governed by several regulations which are totally outdated and largely unworkable.  The rules governing these centres should be updated but the main difficulty is that the number of places available for the secure <Col N="1174" /> detention of juvenile offenders is pitifully inadequate.  A much greater number of secure places is urgently needed and I wish to ask the Minister whether she recognises this and when she proposes to provide them.</P>
    <P>Professional criminals are taking advantage of the situation to the detriment of the community.  For example, in my city of Limerick it is well known that professional thieves use people under the age of 16 to carry out the offence while they stay a safe distance from the scene of the crime.  They do this in the knowledge that if the young offender is apprehended there is usually no place to detain him.  The young offender also knows this and the reward he is offered totally outweighs the risk of being detained for any reasonable period of time which at this stage has become minimal.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to parental responsibility. Under the Children's Act, 1908, parents can be held financially responsible for the crimes of their children. However, this provision is hedged in by a number of restrictions which have made it unworkable in practice.  In any case the maximum fine for a child, that is someone under the age of 15 years, is £2 and the maximum fine for a young person, someone aged between 15 and 17, is £10.  It is small wonder, therefore, that the courts have rarely, if ever, used this power to impose financial responsibility on parents.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1993, provides that the court can make a compensation order against a person convicted of a crime.  it states that if the person is a young offender then the order can be made against his or her parents.  The procedure laid down in the 1993 Act is far too cumbersome and has proven unworkable in practice.  In no case since the 1993 Act became law &mdash; we have to take responsibility for that &mdash; has a compensation order been made against <Col N="1175" /> the parent of a young offender.  The difficulty is that the money has to be recovered in the same way as a civil debt. In cases where compensation has been ordered this has put the onus on victims to pursue the criminal or his or her parent through the courts.  This is precisely why the law is unworkable.</P>
    <P>What steps does the Minister intend to take in regard to the following: (1) amendment of the 1993 Act to allow compensation orders to be collected in the same way as fines; (2) the immediate provision of secure extra places for young offenders; (3) the extension of the facilities for young offenders to be rehabilitated; (4) measures to directly involve the family of a young person who has been charged with a crime, for example, measures to enable family conferences to be called, to order parents to comply with certain procedures, to attend counselling sessions etc. and (5) to ensure that the Child Attendance Act, 1926, is enforced to combat growing levels of truancy which is inextricably linked to juvenile crime?</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister recognisesd that it is necessary to take urgent steps on all these fronts.  The country is reeling under an avalanche of crime, a growing percentage of which is committed by juveniles.  The old, vulnerable and isolated are cowering in fear in what can now only laughingly be described as the security of their homes.  A disturbingly large and growing proportion of that crime is committed by juveniles, hence the need for urgent action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the provision of detention facilities for young offenders, the responsibility of the Minister for Justice extends to those between the ages of 16 and 21 years while responsibility for offenders under 16 years of age rests with my colleague, the Minister for Education.  My appointment last year as Minister of State at the <Col N="1176" /> Departments of Justice, Health and Education was a recognition by the Government of the need to co-ordinate services for young offenders and young people at risk between the three Departments.</P>
      <P>My priority for those between 16 and 21 years is to make better use of the prison accommodation already available for them and to implement the positive sentence management strategy set out in the Department's policy document <i>The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan</i> which was published in 1994.  I am satisfied that the determined implementation of measures such as intensive probation supervision in the community and other interventions by the Probation Service will prove more effective than providing additional detention spaces for young offenders. The experience across Europe tends to support this view.</P>
      <P>In St. Patrick's Institution, Dublin, there are 122 places for young offenders, both remands and detention. In the open prison Shanganah Castle there are 60 spaces for young offenders while in Fort Mitchel in Cork there are 102 spaces, the majority of which are occupied by under 21 year olds.  I should also say that Mountjoy, Limerick and Cork prisons contain a fluctuating number of offenders under 21 years at any time.  There has been a major upgrading of the accommodation in St. Patrick's Institution with the provision of in-cell sanitation.  The institution's annexe is being examined with a view to assessing its suitability for conversion for education purposes.  In Wheatfield there are state of the art facilities for young offenders.  The very positive regimes in Shanganah Castle and Fort Mitchel contribute to the development and implementation of educational programmes on the rehabilitation of young offenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of new initiatives undertaken by the Probation and Welfare Service has been targeted at young <Col N="1177" /> offenders.  For example, a new project which is aimed at diverting them away from autocrime such as car theft and so-called joyriding has recently commenced in Cork.  The objective is to get these young people to understand the seriousness of their behaviour by offering them education and basic training in car maintenance, the rules of the road and the consequences of car stealing for the victims and their families.  A project in north Clondalkin in Dublin offers more than 25 young people a wide range of skills and opportunities such as computer skills, lifeskills and sport activities.  All projects are kept under review and new interventions will be developed where possible.</P>
    <P>There are 210 residential places for young male offenders and 15 places for girls in the young offender centres in the schools under the aegis of the Department of Education.  I wish to refer to the five centres for young offenders operated by the Department of Education. St. Joseph's Industrial School in Clonmel has accommodation for 75 boys and accepts boys under 14 years of age on the date of admission.  The boys referred to this facility are not guilty of very serious offences and they usually stay there until their 16th birthday.  The Finglas Children's Centre is comprised of St. Michael's Remand and Assessment Centre and St. Laurence's Industrial School.  It can accommodate up to 20 boys under 16 years who can be sent there purely on remand or on remand for assessment.  St. Laurence's Industrial School can accommodate up to 50 boys under 14 years.</P>
    <P>Oberstown Boy's Centre, which is a reformatory school, also incorporates a remand facility.  It provides 20 reformatory school places for boys referred by the courts for up to two year's detention. Boys are in the 14-16 age range on admission.  It also provides ten remand places for boys under 16 years.  Such places are used by the courts to detain boys pending decision on sentence. Trinity House School is also a reformatory school and is the only secure facility operated under the aegis of the <Col N="1178" /> Department of Education.  Unlike the other facilities, it has overt security features and provides 28 long stay places for the most serious offenders in the 14-16 age range on admission.  It also has two remand places.  Oberstown Girls' Centre is a reformatory school for girls. It accepts girls up to 16 years of age on admission and provides eight long stay places for those sentenced by the court. It also incorporates a remand and assessment unit which can take up to seven girls under the age of 17 years on admission.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied with the quality of the services provided by each of these centres.  The adequacy of the provision of places for young offenders is kept under constant review by the Department of Education in consultation with the Departments of Health and Justice. However, it has become apparent that there is a shortage of places to cater for young offenders within certain age ranges.  Accordingly, I recently announced the following improvements in the provisions for children in conflict with the law.  In the case of young female offenders arrangements are being made to provide an industrial school for girls, four additional reformatory school places and three secure places for seriously disruptive girls.  In the case of young male offenders arrangements are being made to provide an additional 28-30 reformatory school places.  Detailed planning work on the implementation of these proposals is now under way and I am satisfied that these improvements will result in a significantly increased capacity to deal with the demand for residential placements among young offenders.  I am satisfied that the present and planned facilities proposed for young offenders are adequate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will be aware and the record will show that I have had cause to highlight in this House on many occasions my concerns <Col N="1179" /> relating to the reporting and prosecution of child abuse cases.  Those concerns ranged over such topics as sentencing policy, prosecution rates, reviewability of the DPP's decisions not to prosecute and the treatment of victims of child abuse in the criminal justice system.</P>
      <P>The record will also show that this is not the first occasion on which I have had to call for procedures to be established, as recommended by the Kilkenny incest report, for the mandatory reporting of child abuse cases. Despite the announcement in April this year by the Minister of State of a new procedure for the notification of suspected cases as between the health boards and the Garda, the key recommendation of mandatory reporting remains unimplemented.</P>
      <P>During the past year, regrettably, there has been cause to turn my attention to the absence of any procedures as between the church and civil authorities in relation to child abuse cases.  Almost a year ago on 25 October I raised the issue with the former Minister for Justice, Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn.  I asked the Minister if she would make it a criminal offence to knowingly conceal or fail to report to Garda adults who are known to have sexually molested children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 8 June this year I asked the current Minister for Justice what consultations, if any, she had had with the hierarchy in this area.  The Minister said there had been no such discussions with the leadership of any of the churches in relation to clerical abuse.  The Minister also stated that the Garda had met members of the clergy to outline Garda procedures relating to the investigations of such allegations and had made a presentation to a diocesan seminar on the matter.  I tabled a question for oral reply yesterday, but it was ruled out of order <Col N="1180" /> on the basis that the Department considered the position was unchanged since 8 June.</P>
    <P>Recent revelations of a number of clerical sex abuse cases make it imperative that clearly understood procedures as between church and civil authorities be established for the reporting of such allegations.  How can the Minister justify an absence of any procedures given the number of clerical child abuse cases which have surfaced over the last year, particularly in recent days?  Will she not agree that the procedures introduced in the health boards for reporting to the Garda could similarly apply to church authorities and other bodies such as sporting or youth organisations?</P>
    <P>Currently there is a controversy surrounding the payment of large sums of money to victims in two cases involving priests.  In both cases it is very notable that there was no prosecution, which means that the abusers remain at large with no criminal record.  How does this state of affairs protect other children? Will the Minister agree that the church authorities should always be bound to report the matter immediately to the civil authorities before entering into any negotiations for compensation with the victim?  Compensation, if any, is additional to reporting, not a substitute for it.</P>
    <P>Listening to and reading interviews with members of the hierarchy, I detect a collective missing of the point.  Child abuse, the fact of it or an allegation of it, is primarily a criminal matter.  The notion of teams of lawyers agreeing monetary settlements for child abuse in the same way as might occur, for example, in a civil claim for personal injuries is abhorrent and not in the public interest in the absence of a criminal prosecution.  Such monetary settlements may well serve the injured party and the abuser well enough, but where is the public interest served in such transactions? What other category of paedophile could, in effect, buy his way out <Col N="1181" /> of a criminal process with, as has been revealed, the knowledge of the church authorities?</P>
    <P>There would also appear to be some confusion as to the legal obligation to report this type of crime.  Archbishop Connell in an interview with David Hanley this week said, &ldquo;there was no obligation before 1987 to do anything of that kind&rdquo;.  On 25 October 1994 the previous Minister of Justice in answer to my question stated:</P>
    <P>A person who knowingly conceals a felon, which includes a person who sexually assaulted a child, or the fact that a felony has taken place, and any sexual assault is a felony, could, depending on the circumstances, be found to be an accessory after the fact and liable on conviction to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment. Where a person knowing that a felony has taken place does not report that felony to the police, then there is an offence of misprison of a felony at common law.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept my bona fides in this matter.  I have no wish to compound the difficulties in which the church finds itself at present and I trust the Minister will accept that my motivation is primarily to ensure that paedophiles are prosecuted rather than protected and permitted to evade justice, as has happened.</P>
    <P>The bishops are currently putting together a policy document on this whole area, but that will be an internal church document.  Child abuse is a crime.  It is always a public matter which the State has a vital interest in prosecuting. The time has come for the State to engage in discussions with the church authorities on this most painful subject.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>In a political career which spans a period almost as long as the Ceann Comhairle's &mdash; just three years short of it &mdash; I have found that on occasions it is good to give credit where credit is due.  I had hoped the Deputy <Col N="1182" /> would have taken this opportunity to say something about two welcome developments which have occurred this week, and today is only Wednesday. The first development was that I signed the necessary orders to implement 44 new sections of the Child Care Act which will give the Garda, the courts and the health boards strong new powers to deal with child abuse and neglect. Yesterday I met my counterpart in Northern Ireland and we entered into arrangements which we hope will lead to a situation where there will be no hiding place for those responsible for child abuse or neglect anywhere on this island, north or south of the Border.</P>
      <P>Regarding the matters the Deputy raised, child sexual abuse is one of the most serious crimes that can be committed and every citizen who has reason to believe or suspect that such a crime has been, is being or is likely to be committed should have no hesitation in reporting the matter to the Garda.  That applies to every citizen of the State, irrespective of his or her position or status.  In that regard, I make no distinction between members of the clergy and other persons.  All of us have that responsibility.  Not to report such matters may leave a perpetrator of such crimes free to re-offend.  That is an important consideration to be borne in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter of special concern to me.  Last April I launched a new procedure for the notification of suspected cases of child abuse between health boards and the Garda.  The new procedure clarifies the circumstances in which the health boards and the Garda are to notify one another of suspected cases of physical, sexual or emotional abuse or neglect of children and gives guidance on the consultations that should take place following such a notification. A central feature of the procedure is a standardised notification system between the agencies.  The new procedure has been prepared by the <Col N="1183" /> Department of Health in consultation with the Department of Justice, the Garda authorities and the health boards.</P>
    <P>As regards the need for similar procedures to be drawn up in respect of the reporting by the church authorities of suspected cases of child abuse, the Deputy will probably be aware that there are no such arrangements in place between the Garda and any of the churches.  I can state, however, that the Garda, at the invitation of the Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, have met members of the clergy to outline Garda procedures in regard to the investigation of allegations of sexual abuse.  In addition, the Garda made a presentation in relation to Garda procedures to a diocesan seminar for local clergy.</P>
    <P>As I said, members of the clergy have the same responsibility and obligations to report crime as any other member of society.  The law does not distinguish between members of the clergy and everyone else, nor does it single out members of the clergy; let us be clear about that.  In this regard, there is a simple guiding principle.  If one has information about a crime, one should inform the Garda.  That is not something which necessarily needs to be laid down in procedures or regulations.</P>
    <P>The question of putting in place regulations or procedures which would compel, presumably under threat of legal sanction, members of the clergy as opposed to any other group to report such matters to the Garda would have to be very carefully considered.  The issues raised are certainly complex.  For instance, the status of information obtained by a priest during confession, and the question of legally compelling him to disclose that information to the Garda, would need careful examination.</P>
    <P>I am determined everything possible will be done to ensure that suspected cases of child abuse are notified to the proper authorities.  The procedures now <Col N="1184" /> in place between the Garda and the health boards are proof of that.  I will continue to work to this end and, notwithstanding the nature of the complex difficulties involved in drawing up procedures between the Garda and the churches, I will keep in mind what the Deputy said tonight as I deal with this most serious of problems.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghlacadh leis an Aire Stáit as ucht teacht isteach agus éisteacht liom tráthnóna.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State is aware, community employment schemes are one of the most flexible ways in which unemployed people have been given a chance to do gainful work.  In rural areas in particular, much useful work has been carried out under these schemes. Of course useful work was also undertaken in urban areas but people living in rural areas have a particular affinity with these schemes.  That might be because in rural areas the work tends to be carried out in the heart of the community and its benefits are immediately obvious to the workers and the general public.</P>
      <P>Over the past number of years, particularly during the time when Deputy O'Rourke was Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, there had been a relaxing of the regulations in relation to these schemes and their development.  For example, the age limit was reduced from 25 to 21 years and the idea of roll over schemes of two and three years was introduced. That resulted in a continuity of work for many types of workers which ensured that these schemes were more effective in the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the persistent unemployment problem and the stated objective of many Government Ministers to give people gainful work, it was a major surprise when regulations were enforced <Col N="1185" /> recently &mdash; they always existed but were never enforced &mdash; which meant that only 25 per cent of workers on a community employment scheme could be re-employed on any extension of that or any other scheme commencing in the following six months.</P>
    <P>In the past number of weeks I have been inundated with calls from various organisers of community employment schemes in my constituency who have come up against this problem for the first time.  I accept that priority should be given to new people anxious to participate in community employment schemes but the Minister is operating a scheme of cutbacks by stealth.</P>
    <P>A number of major problems arise out of the Minister's actions.  First, in some of the more depopulated rural areas of the west coast and the islands, it will now be impossible to get the full quota of workers permitted on various community employment schemes because of this rule.  A community employment scheme involving 30 workers has just been completed in my area but, because of the Minister's regulation, it is now proving impossible to organise a scheme of even 24 workers. At the same time, almost all the workers on the previous scheme are anxious to continue working on the new scheme when it commences.</P>
    <P>Second, participants on community schemes in places such as schools who may have worked as classroom assistants, caretakers, cleaners, secretaries, etc., are being laid off despite the fact that they have skills not replicated in their communities.  Classroom assistants working with handicapped children, for example, face a particular problem because they may have built up a bond with those children.</P>
    <P>Third, a community employment scheme lasts for one year but because people only work either half a week each week or on a week on week off <Col N="1186" /> basis, the number of weeks worked in a year amounts to only 26.  As a consequence, workers are only becoming familiar with the work in hand when the scheme comes to an end.  Constantly rotating large numbers of workers after a period of only 26 weeks can cause difficulty, particularly in jobs where special skills are required.</P>
    <P>Fourth, because of the requirement that priority be given to workers over 45 years of age and that only 25 per cent can be retained on a scheme, a person not yet 45 years of age does not have much chance of getting two years' consecutive work on a community employment scheme.  I call on the Minister to relax this regulation, which has never been fully implemented until this year, and to ensure that those people who want to work can do so.</P>
    <P>Too often in the past, it was said that people on the dole were not willing to work.  Now that we have proved people are willing to work when work is made available, and that they work effectively, the Minister is cutting the ground from under them.</P>
    <P>When one takes account of the social effect of giving people the dignity of work and its effects on family life, it can truly be said that community employment is good value for money.  Any cutbacks in community employment schemes must be regretted.  I call on the Minister to ensure that people who want to participate in community employment schemes and who fulfil the basic unemployment conditions will be facilitated.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Ó Cuív for raising this matter although I <Col N="1187" /> think there is some misunderstanding as to the operation of the scheme and its purpose.</P>
      <P>Community employment is a part-time work programme for the unemployed. It is a practical and focused way of getting people back into the active labour force while, at the same time, achieving valuable work in the local communities.  Community employment presents local communities with an opportunity to tackle and address the issue of social exclusion and the reality of unemployment.  It is designed to provide part-time employment opportunities for long term unemployed workers and others at risk of becoming long term unemployed; to enable a wide range of voluntary and statutory organisations to employ staff and undertake a variety of socially valuable work in local communities; and to increase workers' personal development, improve their future job prospects and deliver economic and social benefits to the community by contributing to local development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Half the number of all persons unemployed have been unemployed for more than one year.  The percentage of persons long term unemployed has steadily increased in recent years.  That figure is higher for persons over 45 years of age and research has indicated that it is much more difficult for such persons to obtain employment.  The longer a person remains unemployed the more difficult it will be to find employment.  Many such people also face other disadvantages, such as low education qualifications and skills.  There is also a concentration of long term unemployed persons in certain communities in unemployment black spots.  Community employment provides a vehicle for these persons to undertake worth-while work, while providing valuable work experience and learning new skills.  It provides an opportunity to regain their self esteem and dignity and can also act as a <Col N="1188" /> valuable support in tackling the problems of multiple deprivation in unemployment black spots.</P>
    <P>Community employment was launched in April 1994.  It replaced two previous initiatives, namely, the social employment scheme and the pilot community employment development programme. It was built on the strengths of these initiatives and designed to address the weakness identified.  It is designed to improve the development opportunities for workers and to enhance the quality of work undertaken.  Its success depends on the ability of local groups to identify work that needs to be done and to manage that work.  Community employment is an important resource to local development initiatives.  It allows local groups to manage and control resources necessary to achieve objectives that the group has identified.  These objectives can be in a wide range of sectors from the arts to education, to the environment.</P>
    <P>Local groups which seek resources under community employment are referred to as project sponsors.  FÁS receives applications for support from sponsors and, having obtained the relevant trade union approval, provides financial support for the employment of workers, the purchase of materials, the employment of a supervisor and the provision of training for workers.  Each project must respond to an identified community need and help develop the skills of workers.  Each worker is employed by the sponsor and must work an average of 39 hours per fortnight.</P>
    <P>Projects are of variable sizes with some employing three or four workers and others employing 11 or more workers.  To advance the objective of local development and to provide a broader range of work options for individual workers FÁS, throughout 1994, encouraged the amalgamation of small projects.  To be eligible, as Deputy Ó Cuív said, one can be of any age and in receipt of unemployment benefit <Col N="1189" /> for over one year; of any age and in receipt of lone parent's allowance for over one year; of 21 years of age or over and in receipt of unemployment assistance or referred by the National Rehabilitation Board.  To make up the qualifying requirement one can combine a period in receipt of the above payments with a period on a recognised training or employment programme. Participation is voluntary and no unemployed person can be forced under the terms of community employment to work on a specific project.</P>
    <P>In reviewing the weaknesses and limitations of former schemes, a key point emerging was the fact that participation on the former social employment scheme was limited to 12 months.  With the introduction of community employment, provision has been made for flexibility in relation to duration so that participants can, under certain defined circumstances, be re-engaged immediately by sponsors for up to a further 12 months.  The primary purpose was to facilitate participants who required further specific development in terms of progression so that their subsequent employment prospects would be further strengthened at the end of their second year on the programme.</P>
    <P>Re-engagement of participants may also occur where a suitable replacement cannot be found for a participant, despite the best efforts of sponsors and FÁS.  In addition, participants who are over 45 years of age and unemployed for more than three years may now participate for up to three years on a project, subject to the availability of places locally.</P>
    <P>Therefore, far from being a restriction in the regulations on the schemes, as implied in Deputy Ó Cuív's statement, these provisions &mdash; in community employment &mdash; provide increased flexibility for the first time taking account of the needs of participants and sponsors. The provision for re-engagement is in line with the Government's concern to <Col N="1190" /> bring greater flexibility into the programme and specifically to provide progression opportunities for participants, many of whom would otherwise return to the live register.</P>
    <P>In addition to the provision for participants over 45 years of age, as a norm up to 25 per cent of community employment places nationally may be used by FÁS for second year opportunities.  The limit on the scale of re-engagement possible is imposed in order to ensure a balance between providing second year opportunities in specific cases and the primary need to provide as many opportunities as possible each year to new participants within a limited budget. The continuous review and development of employment options for the long-term unemployed is a central policy concern of this Government.</P>
    <P>The work of the task force on long-term unemployment set up in 1993 has already led to the announcement of new local employment service arrangements in 14 pilot areas.  That task force is now working on its second report which specifically concerns a review of employment options for the long term unemployed.  In that context the strengthening of progression options is a central policy concern.  The task force will examine how the existing employment options, including community employment, can be further strengthened so that participants can be brought back into the main stream labour market. The second report of the task force is expected at the end of this year.</P>
    <P>Community employment has several significant improved features compared with its predecessor.  These include: wider eligibility criterion for participants and retention of secondary benefits and development modules for participants. Some 26,000 participants are undertaking such development modules. A supervisory development programme has been devised under which some 1,200 supervisors have progressed. Certain participants are able to stay on <Col N="1191" /> community employment for up to two to three years compared with one year on the social employment scheme.  Community employment projects may be approved for up to two to three years in local development areas compared with one year on the social employment scheme.  Annual agreements on the <Col N="1192" /> community employment provision with local partnership areas &mdash; higher supervision grants and higher levels of material grants &mdash; have been introduced in order to support economic and social activity in these disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 5 October 1995.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The free telephone rental allowance administered by my Department is available only to people who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments and who are either living alone or only with children or persons who, because <Col N="1030" /> they are so permanently incapacitated, could not get help in an emergency.  The number of people getting the allowance at present is about 130,000 at an annual cost of some £20 million.  Depending on the level of the pension, a former public servant may be entitled to receive an old age, non-contributory, pension from my Department at a reduced rate and, if he or she is so entitled and can satisfy the living alone condition of the scheme, he or she will qualify for the free telephone rental allowance.</P>
    <P>The free travel scheme is available to every resident in the State who is 66 years of age or over, including retired civil and public servants.  It is also available to people under 66 years of age who are in receipt of certain payments such as invalidity pension from my Department or disabled person's maintenance allowance from the health boards.</P>
    <P>Extending the free telephone rental allowance or the free travel scheme to categories who do not qualify under the current conditions would have financial inplications and could only be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>The free television licence scheme has been in operation since 1968.  Since then it has benefited many of the less well-off members of our society who might otherwise have experienced difficulty in meeting the once-off annual cost of their television licence.  At the end of August 1995, some 183,000 people were in receipt of a free television licence at an annual cost to the Exchequer of £10.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free television licence scheme has been improved significantly by the Government this year.  From this month all qualified pensioners may claim a free <Col N="1031" /> colour television licence as soon as their current licence expires.  Up to now, about half of eligible pensioners were entitled to receive a monochrome licence only, and had to pay the balance of £18 themselves in order to be validly licensed if they owned a colour television set.  This new development will simplify the arrangements for such pensioners, as well as increasing the value of the allowance to them.  The extra cost of this scheme improvement is about £1.5 million in a full year.  Under current arrangements people who qualify for a free licence must obtain their licence from a post office in the same way as members of the public in general.</P>
    <P>The question of introducing a less cumbersome method of administering the free television licence scheme was raised by the Public Accounts Committee in its interim report on the <i>Collection of TV Licences</i>, published in September 1994.  One of the options under consideration in this connection is the automation of licence issue to pensioners under the free television licence scheme.  The extension of the scheme to cover colour licences for all from this month which I referred to earlier has eliminated a major obstacle to this process. Work on the necessary changes is at an early stage and I expect that the relevant operational, accounting and coverage issues will be resolved quickly so that the necessary computer system development can be undertaken in An Post and in my Department.  I am satisfied that change along these lines will be more efficient and will result in a less cumbersome service for pensioners.</P>

      <P>In keeping with the commitment in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, the Government has introduced measures to pay married women affected by the delay in implementing EC Directive 79/7, their legally determined entitlements to social welfare equality payments.  These measures give full effect to the judgement of the High Court of 3 February 1995, at an estimated cost of £260 million.  The arrears payments consist of increases for adult and child dependants and unemployment assistance during the period December 1984 to November 1986. Transitional payments as provided for in the court judgment are also payable in certain cases.  In addition, compensation is being paid based on the increase in the consumer price index from the date the entitlements fell due up to the date on which payments are made.</P>
      <P>Almost 70,000 married women have by now received payment of equal treatment arrears amounting to £145 million and they will receive a further £55 million by the end of the year.  The remaining payments, estimated at £60 million, will be paid from January 1996 onwards over as short a period as possible.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to solicitors' fees is that settlements have been agreed with the legal representatives of those married women who instituted legal proceedings.  My Department will meet the plaintiffs' legal fees as adjudicated by the Taxing Master under the normal procedure whereby a solicitor's bill is examined by the Taxing Master who may either allow or reduce the amount involved.  The question as to whether the married women concerned may be charged additional fees, over and above those to be met by the State, will be determined by the nature of whatever agreement they may have entered into with their solicitors.  It is open to those whose solicitors are claiming costs from them over and above those paid by the State to seek to have them examined by the Taxing Master also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1033" /> The arrangements which I have introduced, in giving full effect to the decision of the High Court, provide a final conclusion to the long-running campaign to obtain the equality payments for married women affected by the delay in implementing the 1979 Equal Treatment Directive.</P>

      <P>Discussions and consultations have taken place involving officials of my own Department, the other interested Departments &mdash; Finance, Health, Enterprise and Employment &mdash; and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners on the issue of payment of PRSI and levies on maintenance income.</P>
      <P>A consensus emerged from these discussions that no changes should be made to the treatment of social insurance contributions on the grounds that they form the basis of individual entitlement to social welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>It was agreed, however, that the health contribution and the employment-training levies should not be imposed on that part of the payer's income which is paid to his-her separated spouse under an enforceable maintenance contract.  This exemption was implemented in the Social Welfare Act, 1995, with effect from 6 April 1995.  This brings the treatment of the levies into line with that of the tax system.</P>
      <P>Social insurance contributions confer substantial benefits on the contributor and ensure an adequate level of social protection.  For this reason, I believe that the arrangement whereby recipients of maintenance payment make social insurance contributions is equitable. The effect of both spouses making a PRSI contribution is that each spouse builds up a social insurance record in their own right, and can each, in due course, qualify for a pension.</P>
      <P>I believe that entitlement to a social insurance pension is a valuable right.  I feel that coverage under the system should be extended as widely as possible and should afford protection to separated spouses.  It is, therefore, appropriate that a social insurance contribution be levied on income from maintenance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20, 22 and 30 together.  Following proposals I recently put forward to the Government, it was agreed that a Commission on the Family would be established, with the following terms of reference: to analyse recent economic and social changes affecting the position of families, taking account of relevant research already carried out, including reports of commissions, such as those on social welfare, taxation and the status of women, and relevant working groups, for example the Expert Working Group on Integration of Taxation and Social Welfare and the current anti-poverty strategy policy committee, and carry out limited research as necessary; to examine the effects of legislation and policies on families and make recommendations to the Government on proposals which would strengthen the capacity of families to carry out their functions in a <Col N="1036" /> changing economic and social environment. The commission would also be expected to make proposals to the proposed all party committee on the Constitution on any changes which it believes might be necessary in the constitutional provisions in relation to the family.  Proposals involving expenditure should be identified and as far as practicable costed; to raise public awareness and improve understanding of issues affecting families.</P>
      <P>The Government decision also provided for liaison with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Family.  The thinking behind the setting up of the commission was, in part, influenced by the recommendation of the committee on the International Year of the Family, 1994, which recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, that a State-funded commission on the family should be established, which would advise the Government on family issues, including the impact of legislation, commission research, act as a national forum for family organisations and promote greater awareness of family-related issues.</P>
      <P>It is proposed that the commission will produce a preliminary report by October 1996 and a final report by, at latest, June 1997.  The chairperson and members of the commission will be announced soon.</P>

      <P>Basic income, in its purest sense, involves the payment of an unconditional basic payment to everyone. The payment would be at a high enough level to replace social welfare <Col N="1037" /> payments.  It would be paid automatically, regardless of the person's labour force status or family circumstances, and would be free of tax.</P>
      <P>The idea of basic income is attractive. It would greatly simplify the tax and social welfare systems.  It would remove the poverty traps associated with means tested social welfare payments.  It would deal with the problem of low take-up of some payments.  The major drawback of basic income is its cost.</P>
      <P>This has led to some interest in developing more limited versions of basic income.  One such option is to pay a basic income to all children.  A particular attraction of a basic income for children is that it could help to address the disincentives and poverty traps caused by the existing range of income supports for children, such as the payment of child dependant allowances with unemployment payments.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Government contains a commitment to work towards a basic income for children by systematic improvements in child benefit and the creation of a child benefit supplement payable to all social welfare recipients and low and middle income families with children.  This year, we took the first step towards this by increasing child benefit substantially. The increase of £7 per month represented an increase of 35 per cent for the first two children and an increase of 28 per cent for the third and subsequent children.  The full year cost of this was £103 million.  The next steps will be considered in the context of next year's budget.</P>
      <P>The general idea of basic income is being examined by the Expert Working Group on the Integration of the Tax and Social Welfare Systems as part of its overall study of how to get rid of dis-incentives and poverty traps in the existing system.  The working group was set up to identify the problems arising from the interaction of the tax and social welfare systems and the steps necessary to achieve greater co-ordination-integration of the two systems.  The group is expected to furnish its report within the next few months.</P>

      <Quest>the reason applicants for old age pensions have their savings assessed at 10 per cent interest when many of them receive less than 1 per cent interest; if he will discuss with the financial institutions the provision of financial advice to ensure that pensioners receive the best possible rates on their investment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The means tests used to determine entitlement to all social assistance schemes include an assessment of the value of any capital or investments held by the applicant.  The assessment rates vary depending on the scheme.  For old age pension purposes an initial £200 of capital is disregarded, 5 per cent of the next £375 is assessed and the balance is assessed at the 10 per cent rate.  The figure arrived at is then divided by 52 to obtain the weekly means and £1 is added to the weekly value thus calculated.  The 10 per cent rate on capital, the purpose of which is to ascribe a national value to the capital owned, is broadly aligned to the representative yield on Government securities.</P>
      <P>I am examining the possibility of rationalising the different methods of assessing the value of capital in the context of the commitment in the Programme for Competitiveness and Work to streamlining and standardising application and assessment procedures, including means testing, in respect of social welfare and other applicants for means tested State assistance.</P>

      <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before reaching pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and a yearly average of at least 20 contributions, or 24 in the case of a retirement pension, registered since January 1953 when the unified system of social insurance came into effect, or the time they started insurable employment if later.</P>
      <P>The yearly average condition gives rise to particular problems for people with gaps in their insurance records. While a number of these problems have been addressed by my Department in recent years, the National Pensions Board, NPB, report Developing the National Pension System recommended a <i>pro rata</i> pension scheme, which, in its view, would resolve the problems arising from gaps in coverage in a more comprehensive way.</P>
      <P>The NPB report recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, a wider range of <i>pro rata</i> pensions related to the average number of contributions over an insured's lifetime, where, for example, an average of 45 or over &mdash; as against 48 at present &mdash; would qualify a person for the maximum rate of pension, while a minimum 30 per cent of full rate pension would be payable for an average of ten to 14 contributions.  It also recommended that the number of paid contributions to qualify for retirement and old age contributory pension be increased from 156, three years, to 520 contributions, ten years.  As such proposals could lead to a reduction in entitlement for future pensioners, when compared to current arrangements, they have to be evaluated very carefully.</P>
      <P>The NPB report, which is both comprehensive and complex, is at present being studied in detail within my Department.  I will bring forward proposals on the issues addressed in the report based on these detailed considerations and in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>Current arrangements allow recipients of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance to take up to two weeks holidays at home each year without interrupting their claim.  Claimants are required to notify their Social Welfare local office at least two weeks in advance of going on holidays and receive their payments when they return.</P>
      <P>In the case of holidays abroad, unemployment benefit may continue to be paid to people while absent from the State for the first two weeks or while representing Ireland in an amateur capacity at an international sporting event.  In the case of unemployment assistance, the legislation provides for a disqualification from receiving payment while resident either temporarily or permanently outside the State.  It is considered that absence from the State for up to two weeks on holiday or while representing Ireland in an amateur sporting capacity does not constitute residence outside the State and, accordingly, no specific legislative amendments in relation to unemployment assistance were considered necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision was made in the Social Welfare Act, 1995, for regulatory powers which are designed to standardise the provisions relating to social insurance and social assistance payments of <Col N="1042" /> people absent from the State or in prison. In the context of drafting the necessary regulations, I am considering the question of increasing the holiday period from two weeks to three with perhaps a more flexible arrangement for those over 60 years of age along the lines suggested by the Deputy.  Any proposals emerging from that examination will also be applied to holidays at home.</P>

      <P>The determination of all applications for residency in this country is a matter for the Department of Justice but asylum seekers who enter Ireland and apply for refugee status are granted permission to remain in the State while their applications are being processed.</P>
      <P>They do not hold work permits and as a consequence have no entitlement to unemployment payments.  However, they may qualify for assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme if they have no other income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Asylum seekers are allowed access to the same services and facilities as Irish nationals in similar circumstances. While they are not entitled to social welfare benefits they may, depending on their circumstances, receive basic supplementary welfare allowance, a rent supplement in respect of private rented accommodation and the health board may also pay any deposit required in <Col N="1043" /> securing accommodation.  Asylum seekers also qualify for health services in the same way as Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>The majority of asylum seekers arrive in Ireland through Dublin and Shannon. Currently the arrangements for the reception of asylum seekers at the main points of entry are co-ordinated on an informal basis.  All asylum seekers are issued with a leaflet which, in addition to information on the asylum examination procedure, contains information on whom they may contact for assistance in securing accommodation, welfare assistance and legal advice.</P>
    <P>In Shannon asylum seekers are referred to the Irish Red Cross which arranges accommodation and advises on the availability of other services.  While accommodation is initially provided in B &amp; Bs asylum seekers subsequently tend to move to private rented accommodation in the Ennis area or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In Dublin applicants are usually referred to the Irish Red Cross or directly to the Eastern Health Board homeless unit.  They are initially housed in hostel accommodation but subsequently they too may be given assistance towards the cost of private rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>In 1993 an interdepartmental committee on non-Irish nationals issued a report on application for refugee status. It contained a number of recommendations in relation to the drawing up of guidelines for the reception of asylum applicants.  In light of these recommendations an interdepartmental committee is currently drawing up guidelines with a view to ensuring that there is a formal co-ordinated approach to their needs.  It is expected that this committee will complete its deliberations soon.</P>
    <P>Deputies may wish to note that the reception and care arrangements for persons admitted to the State on foot of Government decisions such as the Vietnamese and Bosnians are already administered in an integrated fashion by <Col N="1044" /> the Refugee Agency.  This agency is State funded and was established in 1991 under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The Irish Refugee Council also does valuable work with refugees.</P>
    <P>With regard to the proposed introduction of refugee legislation, my Department is aware of the proposals contained in the 1995 Refugee Bill and has provided observations on those proposals. The purpose of the Bill is to put existing administrative arrangements with regard to the rights and entitlements of refugees on a statutory footing. It provides for the establishment of an independent body to examine applications and an independent appeals tribunal to deal with appeals arising in relation to this area.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any cases where asylum seekers may not be fully aware of their entitlement to assistance.  If, however, the Deputy has any information regarding such cases he should bring it to my attention and I will have the matter investigated.</P>

      <P>The response to this year's students summer jobs scheme was very positive with just under 23,000 applications received, of which 18,900 students were approved to participate. At this stage, it is estimated that about 15,000 students worked under the scheme.  The final figure will not be known until all the sponsors have submitted claims to my Department for the <Col N="1045" /> recoupment of amounts paid to the students who worked under the scheme.</P>
      <P>To focus the scheme on those least well off students, one of the improvements I introduced to this year's scheme was that students living at home, whose parents are totally dependent on social welfare payments, would, for the first time, receive an additional £1 per hour worked.  It is estimated that about 3,300 students will be entitled to this payment, which will be issued to the students by my Department in the next forthnight. As smallholders in receipt of unemployment assistance derive income from their holdings they cannot be considered to meet the condition of being totally dependent on social welfare payments. Students whose parents are smallholders therefore do not qualify for the special bonus payment.  This position applies also to all others who have an income other than social welfare payments including the self-employed, part-time workers, parents in receipt of FIS etc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of unemployment assistance, Rule 1(5) of the Third Schedule, Part 1 to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 provides for the assessment as means for unemployment assistance purposes of the estimated value to the household deriving from all income earned by the applicant's spouse.</P>
      <P>The procedure is to take the net income of the spouse that is net of income tax and PRSI, and disregard reasonable travel to work expenses, if any, and an amount to cover other work-related expenses of the spouse. This amount is currently £45 where the spouse is working four or more days per week and otherwise £30.</P>
      <P>Provision for the assessment of spouse's income for old age non-contributory pension is set out under Rule 4(1) in Part II of the Third Schedule to the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993.  It states that the means of a person shall be one-half of the total means of the couple, where they are living together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In assessing the earnings of a spouse certain allowances are made when determining the amount assessable as means.  These are reasonable travel expenses, union and superannuation deductions and the appropriate rate of <Col N="1049" /> PRSI.  The means are then assessed at one half of the couple's total means after the allowances are deducted.</P>
    <P>While the methods of assessment are different, in the case of a person on unemployment assistance, if his or her spouse was earning over £60 per week no adult dependant allowance would be payable, while in the case of a married old age non-contributory pensioner who satisfies the qualifying means test he or she will automatically be entitled to an adult dependant allowance at the appropriate rate.  This is because the spouse's earnings-income will have already been taken into account when assessing the means of the household.  If the spouse is over 66 years, he or she would be entitled to an old age non-contributory pension at the appropriate rate in his or her own right.</P>

      <P>All persons who claim unemployment assistance, including persons who have no employment, self-employed persons and smallholders, and are assessed with means have their weekly rate of payment reduced by £1 for every £1 of means.</P>
      <P>There are presently just over 10,000 smallholders receiving unemployment assistance.  The estimated annual cost in 1995 is £35 million &mdash; average weekly payment £65.</P>
      <P>Unemployment assistance for smallholders and other self-employed persons acts as an income supplement akin to FIS for employees so that their income is at least the minimum social welfare rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The weekly income of a smallholder receiving unemployment assistance will <Col N="1050" /> consist of income from his holding plus any unemployment assistance payable. In determining the amount of unemployment assistance payable, account is taken of the net income derived from farming i.e. gross income from the farm less the expenses necessarily incurred in producing that income.  These expenses include such items as fertiliser, veterinary costs, interest on borrowing for farm purposes, cost of hired labour, repairs to farm building and machinery etc.  The balance of gross income over allowed expenses represents means and this is set against the scheduled rate payable on a £1 for £1 basis.</P>
    <P>Where other applicants for unemployment assistance are fully unemployed and have no sources of means, both categories of claimant would be in the same net income position.</P>

      <P>The payment of a Christmas bonus to recipients of long term social welfare payments has been a feature of the social welfare system since 1980. Traditionally, no provision is made for the cost of the Christmas bonus in either the annual Estimates or at budget time. This arrangement has enabled the Government to determine the level of the bonus and the means of financing it in the light of the emerging budgetary situation during the year.  The question will be considered by the Government shortly and I will be in a position to make a statement on the matter in the near future.</P>

      <P>I reject the Deputy's contention that <i>Irish Press</i> workers were in limbo with regard to social welfare entitlements; 400 of the 600 <i>Irish Press</i> workers received social welfare payments on application.  Applications for payments by journalists were refused in accordance with the legislation.  This refusal was appealed and the deciding officer's decision was upheld by the appeals officer.</P>
      <P>These decisions were based on Social Welfare legislation which provides that persons involved in a trade dispute are not entitled to receive unemployment payments for the duration of the dispute. In such cases, however, their dependants are entitled to apply for supplementary welfare allowance.  A number of <i>Irish Press</i> journalists' dependants did so.</P>
      <P>Social Welfare legislation also provides that a person involved in a trade dispute who has been disqualified for unemployment benefit in this way may apply for an adjudication on the matter to the Social Welfare Tribunal.</P>
      <P>I revived the Social Welfare Tribunal which had not meet since July 1992 on 2 June 1995 as I anticipated that its services would be required in the case of <i>Irish Press</i> journalists.</P>
      <P>On 10 July 1995, the journalists in <i>Irish Press</i> applied to the Tribunal for an adjudication on their claim.  The Tribunal heard evidence from both parties to the dispute at its hearing of 26 July 1995 and issued its decision on 1 August 1995.  It ruled that, on balance, the workers were unreasonably deprived of their employment from 29 May 1995 and were entitled to receive unemployment payments from that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The determinations of the deciding officer, the appeals officer and the Tribunal were made expeditiously and I <Col N="1052" /> was pleased to receive a letter from the NUJ expressing satisfaction with the way my Department had dealt with their members' claims.</P>
    <P>I have asked my Department to examine ways of streamlining the process further in cases of this kind.  Preliminary discussions with the social partners on this have taken place and when this examination is complete I will consider the advisability of changing the system which has worked well since its introduction in 1982.</P>

      <P>The published Estimates for 1995 for the Social Welfare Vote provide for an Exchequer subvention to the social insurance fund of £25.4 million under subhead B.1. &mdash; this represents the estimated amount by which expenditure of the fund would exceed income.</P>
      <P>The latest projected outturn for the social insurance fund indicates an excess of expenditure over income of approximately £35.4 million, which is an increase of £10 million on the 1995 published Estimate.  These figures do not take account of the cost of paying a Christmas bonus in 1995.</P>

      <P>I regard the Combat Poverty Agency as a strategic national <Col N="1053" /> resource in the fight against poverty and social exclusion.  The agency, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, has an important role in advising the Government on policies that impact on poverty, in promoting research into the causes and effects of poverty, in raising public awareness of poverty issues and in supporting pilot projects to tackle poverty. There have been many significant changes in the years since the agency was set up.  These changes include: current development in relation to the articulation and implementation by the Government of a national anti-poverty strategy in Ireland; developments at EU level, including the outcomes of the Poverty 3 Programme; the White Paper on Social Policy and increases in Structural Funds spending; the growing place of community development in the programmes of statutory agencies as a means of tackling social exclusion; and the development of partnerships between statutory agencies, the traditional social partners and the community in tackling local development issues, particularly in the context of the Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development.</P>
      <P>In the light of these changes, I have recently commissioned a review of the Combat Poverty Agency.  The review will identify and describe the full range of the agency's activities to date and priority objectives for the agency in the light of the changed environment in which it now operates.  My intention is that the report will be completed by the end of the year and used in determining the agency's priorities for its next three year strategic plan for the period 1996 to 1998.  The report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as it is finalised.</P>

      <P>The national fuel scheme assists householders on long term social welfare or health board payments and unable to provide for their own heating needs.  At present, a payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks, from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
      <P>An additional smokeless fuel allowance of £3 per week is available to assist people living in the built up areas of Dublin and Cork to help meet the additional costs arising from the ban on the sale of bituminous coal in these areas.</P>
      <P>The scheme was amended in the context of the 1995 budget.  With effect from 16 October 1995, the amount of additional means disregarded will be increased from £5 to £10 and the limit for personal savings will be increased from £2,800 to £5,400.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): St. Vincent's Hospital provides an adolescent psychiatric day service at St. Joseph's Family and Adolescent Centre, Fairview, Dublin 3.</P>
      <P>In 1991, St. Joseph's identified a need for a specialised social skills-education programme for vulnerable young teenagers dropping out of the education system. A pilot project was approved from June 1992 funded by the Horizon initiative of the EU Social Fund.</P>
      <P>The funding for this pilot project ceased in December 1994 although St. Joseph's has continued to operate the service.  However, with effect from 1 October 1995, the Department of Health, through the Eastern Health Board, is providing a grant of £20,000 per annum to enable St. Joseph's to provide additional resources to the programme. Funding will be kept under continuous review in the context of service need.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am not aware of any undue delays in updating disabled person's maintenance allowance, DPMA, payment books.  Payment of disabled person's maintenance allowance is made either by a book of vouchers or cheque issued weekly from the relevant health board.  In situations where books of vouchers are used and amendments fall to be made before the re-issue of such books health boards withdraw the books and make payments by cheque until the new book of vouchers is issued. A disabled person's maintenance allowance recipient would rarely have to visit the community welfare officer, CWO when a payment is being updated and would be unlikely, even in such cases, to have to visit a CWO more than once.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy is aware of any cases where delays are being experienced I will have these investigated with the relevant health board.</P>

    <P>There are amounts owing in respect of non-public duty performed prior to 1992 amounting to approximately £35,300.  Procedures for the collection of the moneys owed are under review by my Department in conjunction with the Garda authorities to ensure that all outstanding debts are collected.  Of course, one option is to discontinue the provision of gardaí for non-public duty to those who have failed to pay for past services by the Garda Síochána.  The Garda authorities point out that, in many cases, it is difficult to define where public duty ends and non-public duty liability of the organisations begins but that the safety of the public must be the ultimate consideration.  In addition, many of these events, which have a community dimension, are organised under pressing financial circumstances and this must also be taken into account in the review.</P>

      <Quest>when the present notional interest rate of 5 per cent on the first £400 of capital for unemployment assistance assessment purposes was introduced; and whether he intends to adjust this to a realistic level having regard to prevailing rates.</Quest>

      <P>The means tests used to determine entitlement to all social assistance schemes include an assessment of the value of any capital or investments held by the applicant in order to determine the level of their weekly social welfare entitlement.  The assessment rates vary depending on the scheme.  In the case of unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance, 5 per cent is assessed against the first £400 of capital and 10 per cent is assessed on the balance.  The figure arrived at is then divided by 52 to give the weekly value.  This method of calculation has been a feature of the unemployment assistance scheme since 1934. A similar assessment is used for old age pension purposes, i.e. after an initial disregard of £200, 5 per cent of the next £375 is assessed and then 10 per cent of the balance.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Competitiveness and Work contains a commitment to streamlining and standardising application and assessment procedures, including means testing, in respect of social welfare and other applicants for means tested State assistance.  In this context, the question of rationalising the different methods of assessing the value of capital for social assistance purposes will be examined.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy will see from these figures there will be no substantial increase in the numbers in receipt of pensions during this period, although some changes within the various components are likely.</P>
    <P>It is anticipated, however, that there will be a considerable increase in the proportion of elderly people in the first half of the next century.  This is a matter which must be planned for.  The National Pensions Board report is being studied within the Department and it is intended to bring forward proposals arising from this examination in due course.</P>

      <P>The free schemes administered by my Department include free travel, a free electricity allowance, a free natural gas allowance, a free telephone rental allowance and a free television licence.  They are available, in the case of free travel, to all persons in the State aged 66 years and over and to certain disabled people under age 66 and, in the case of the other schemes, to persons in receipt of a welfare type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy the living alone condition.</P>
      <P>The free schemes have been improved and extended progressively in recent years.  This year, for example, all recipients of the free television licence are being provided with a colour licence, the free travel companion pass has been extended to existing passholders being cared for by a recipient of the carer's allowance, and the free travel scheme has been extended to include cross-Border journeys undertaken by passholders from both sides of the Border. The question of further extending the scope of the free schemes, together with the relevant costs involved, arises for consideration in the context of the budget and in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>A death grant under the Social Welfare Acts is payable, subject <Col N="1072" /> to the satisfaction of certain PRSI contribution conditions, on the death of an insured person or their spouse or child under 18.  The amount of the death grant varies with the contribution record and, in the case of children, the age of the child.  In addition, where a person dies while in receipt of a social welfare payment, the weekly payment usually continues to be paid to his or her adult dependant for a period of six weeks.  Payment may also continue for six weeks after the death of an adult or child dependant.</P>
      <P>There is also a funeral grant, which is unconnected with the death grant, payable in certain cases under the occupational injuries benefit scheme.  As the Deputy will know the rates of death and funeral grants, in common with all other social welfare rates of payment, are reviewed in the context of the budget each year and this will also be done this year.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that the recipients of contributory old age pension received a fair increase in their rate of social welfare payments in 1995; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>As part of the social welfare budget provisions for 1995, a 2.5 per cent increase in all social welfare and health board payments was provided with effect from mid-June.  This increase applied to personal rates and adult dependant allowances and is intended to ensure that the income of social welfare recipients will keep pace with the predicted rate of inflation this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recipients of old age contributory pension benefited from this general increase in payments.  In addition, a further increase was made available to this category in the amount of the adult dependant allowance payable to those aged under 66 years.  The allowance was increased by £2.90 to £48.10, which represents an increase of 6.4 per cent in <Col N="1073" /> their payment.  In addition, the extension of the free travel scheme, and the provision of free colour television licences will also benefit this group, as well as the fact that the increased rates of payment were implemented some six weeks earlier than in previous years.</P>
    <P>The distinguishing feature of the budget increases provided for in 1995 was the manner in which resources were focused via the child benefit scheme, to families with children.  In the context of this strategy and the resources available to me I am satisfied that the new rates and free scheme extensions and earlier payment provided for in 1995 have allowed pensioners to maintain their real income position over the full year.</P>
    <P>It should be noted also that old age contributory pensioners are currently on 109 per cent of the minimum Commission on Social Welfare recommended rate which is almost 10 per cent ahead of all other categories.</P>
