      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 30 on two different topics. I propose to deal with these two topics separately and I will call the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.  In regard to the first topic.  I received notice from Deputy Liam Lawlor and I call on him to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <P>I said most of what I wanted to say last night, but I want to put other matters on the record.  I referred already to the fact that I was deeply upset and grossly insulted by several of the comments made in relation to this debate.  The stupidity theory being put forward by opponents of this Bill that the people did not know what they were voting for in 1992 is deeply insulting to me and to the people in general. The people voted not to limit freedom to obtain or make available in the State, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law, information relating to services lawfully obtained in other states.  They understood clearly what they voted for.  It would appear that they understood it far more clearly than some of the people who are opposing the legislation before us.  If the opponents of this Bill think people have forgotten or are in any way confused about what they voted for in 1992, let them look at a report in last Saturday's <i>Cork Examiner</i> which showed, once again, the same breakdown as in 1992. When people were asked whether they were in favour of this legislation, 60 per cent were and 40 per cent were not. That is the result of a recent poll which should be taken note of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The right of an Opposition party to table amendments to legislation is essential to democracy.  That is the role of the Opposition.  It is a right that my party has often availed of to great effect in the past.  However, I am concerned about the amendments Fianna Fáil is rumoured to be tabling.  We have the bizarre situation whereby the people voted for the provision of information, legislation has been prepared putting that right on a statutory basis, and Fianna Fáil is considering tabling amendments which would render meaningless the word &ldquo;information&rdquo; in the Bill's title.  I referred yesterday to the understandable confusion of the public which Fianna Fáil seemed bent on heightening.  That confusion relates to the debate, not to what the people decided and clearly want.  What is information in the context of abortion if not <Col N="443" /> names and addresses?  Do the Deputies opposite really believe that people voted to prohibit the giving of names and addresses?  To argue that the term &ldquo;information&rdquo; in the 1992 amendment referred simply to generalities about abortion is to take the people for fools. They are not fools.  We may at times disagree with the conclusion the people come to because it is not the conclusion we want, but the people are definite about what they want.  Having considered it from time to time, although it may not be my own position.  I sometimes agree that the people probably have at heart our best interests as well as their own.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's campaign of misinformation and disinformation continues. Last night one of the Deputies opposite informed us that 23 out of 25 women who registered at a British clinic with Irish addresses turned out not to be from this country.  This is perhaps the most bizarre allegation in a week of bizarre allegations.  Are we seriously asked to believe that women registering at a UK clinic for a procedure which is legal in the UK dream up Irish names and addresses?  That takes this debate into the realms of fantasy.  We must be careful because there are women listening to us now who are in this situation and who do not want to be pilloried, blackened and labelled.  This debate should be dispassionate but should take into consideration the deep passion its subject arouses.</P>

It is incredible to see Fianna Fáil on the run from former Fianna Fáil county councillor, former member of <Col N="444" /> Fianna Fáil, now leader of Muintir na h-Éireann, Mr. Richard Green.

The political opportunism of Fianna Fáil has reached the most disgusting level of sheer hypocrisy one could imagine in Irish politics. A judge of the High Court has, with one clean sweep, compared everyone in this House, including the Chair, to the legislators who prepared for the annihilation of the Jews, Communists, Socialists and Catholic and Protestant socially-minded people in Germany.</P>

      <P>One should look into one's own soul and know where one is coming from.  If one lives in a glass house one should not throw stones.</P>
      <P>In dealing with this Bill we must be mindful of the amendment that is in place and the onus on us to legislate properly and meet the demands of the amendment.  Any legislation we introduce must be in line with the provisions of the Constitution.  There will be no winners in this debate.  We cannot satisfy the demands of either the pro-life or the pro-choice groups.  We must be constructive and sensitive in dealing with the Bill.</P>
      <P>The view of the Fianna Fáil Party differs from that of the pro-life movement on the amendment passed by a 60:40 majority.  It recognises that legislation must be introduced and wishes to ensure &mdash; this is the only difference between us and the Minister &mdash; that the provisions of the Bill are in accordance with the constitutional amendment and do not contain any flaws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I deal with various aspects of the Bill I wish to state where Fianna Fáil stands on this issue as so much has been written in the newspapers during the past week.  It has been stated that the party is hypocritical but nothing could be further from the truth.  It has to be accepted that members of all parties have strongly held well thought out views and that a consensus has to be <Col N="446" /> reached.  It is the view of the Fianna Fáil Party that legislation must be introduced to give effect to the constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>For many members of my party this is an emotive issue.  I recognise, however, that it will have to support legislation &mdash; but in line with the constitutional amendment.  I hold the view that this Bill is not in line with it.</P>
    <P>When Deputy O'Dea was Minister of State at the Department of Health, he did not see a Bill relating to this matter. Deputy Cowen stated publicly that a Bill was not presented to the Cabinet but it was agreed that the Programme for Government would include a reference to a Bill relating to the regulation of information on services outside the State for the termination of pregnancies. The then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, gave a commitment to the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party that any Bill relating to this matter would be brought before it before being ratified because it was well known that many members of the party held strong views on this issue and wished to have an input.</P>
    <P>On the day Deputy Ahern was elected leader of my party when it appeared it would be going back into Government I and many others in interviews with local radio stations pointed out clearly that this issue would cause major problems for many members of Fianna Fáil.  Journalists, therefore, cannot have it both ways.  The newspapers are suggesting that if the party was in Government it would have no difficulty with the Bill and would support it. There would have been much soul-searching about the Bill before the party would have given its approval.</P>
    <P>It is being suggested also that Deputy Ahern should have provided leadership by outlining a definite view on the Bill at the parliamentary party meeting, that he should have subjugated the democratic rights of members of the party and orchestrated its views.  Do the newspapers really believe that the leader of the largest party in this country should try to do this on an issue about which members of the party feel strongly?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="447" /> People have short memories.  It is not all that long ago when the same journalists were saying that Fianna Fáil was a party of yes men and women who could blow with the prevailing wind.  Now that it has exercised its democratic right to oppose the Bill this is portrayed as being expedient.  The party has been consistent in the views it has expressed on this issue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern has provided great leadership in not being afraid to allow members of the party to have their say, to point to the deficiencies in the Bill, to make recommendations which would improve it and, above all, to allow the views of constituents to be reflected in the policies being pursued by the party on this issue while ensuring that any legislation introduced is in line with the way the people voted in the referendum.</P>
    <P>There is a diversity of views among members of all parties on this issue. Deputy Harte has expressed his view within the Fine Gael Party while I understand the Progressive Democrats are to allow their members a free vote. I strongly hold the view that it would be a travesty if Fianna Fáil as the main Opposition Party was to support the Bill on Second Stage given that it contains many flaws.  What would the Government's response be to amendments tabled by Fianna Fáil if it had not pointed to the flaws in the Bill or indicated that it would not be willing to support it on Second Stage unless it was withdrawn to allow the courts to decide certain matters pertaining to it?  Would the Government not ignore the amendments and would it have contemplated showing us the advice of the Attorney General?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister have considered the question of advertising and the associated dangers or included an opt out clause for members of the medical profession, for instance? Fianna Fáil is serving this House and the people it represents well by voicing its opposition to the Bill which contains many weaknesses and flaws.  Two weeks ago the Taoiseach indicated that the referendum on divorce would have to be postponed because certain matters still had to be resolved by the courts.  In doing so he set a precedent for the Government.  Is it not prudent for Fianna Fáil to seek a postponement on this issue which is dear to the hearts of Irish people?</P>

      <P>The anti-abortion lobby refer, quite rightly, to the paragraph in the Government information leaflet circulated before the referendum which stated that the provision of information would not allow for abortion and would be non-directive.  Fianna Fáil claims that what is purported to be information in this Bill is in fact referral.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Information&rdquo; is defined in the dictionary as knowledge whereas &ldquo;referral&rdquo; is defined as giving a direction to a person, a place or a thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Imagine the scenario in a doctor's clinic if a pregnant woman requires the <Col N="449" /> doctor to be both a medical practitioner and a psychologist.  The doctor will outline the preferred options under the Constitution of upholding the right to life.  He or she will discuss the possibility of keeping the baby, putting it up for adoption or having the child fostered until such time as the person or the couple are in a position to properly care for it.  If that fails, the doctor will then have to go through the process of informing the person about the psychological problems that ensue from abortion. Having gone through that whole process, he or she will then produce a list of names and addresses of clinics.</P>
    <P>In regard to the involvement of GPs, the one positive aspect of the Bill is the fact that a person will at least be referred to a high street abortion clinic but, unfortunately, the process of referral will have occurred which, in my view, is repugnant to the right to life enshrined in the Constitution.  I am in no doubt that where &ldquo;information&rdquo; is referred to in this Bill, it is done in the guise of information but the reality is that it is dealing with referral.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his contribution, tried to reassure members of the medical profession by saying that the procedure would not be different to any other which involves the patient moving on to a specialist.  Is it fair to say that instead of &ldquo;moving on&rdquo; the words &ldquo;being referred to&rdquo; could have been substituted?  In so saying the Minister is agreeing with the reservations that we in Fianna Fáil have with the actual interpretation.</P>

It is preposterous to enact legislation which many people believe will be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise the question of the legal position of GPs.  If, under the Act, a doctor gave the names and addresses of clinics in the United Kingdom to a pregnant woman and something went wrong subsequently during the abortion, with consequences for the person involved, would that doctor be indemnified against any claim that might be made by that person?</P>

That claim must be challenged because the Minister, like myself, will have read an article in one of the Sunday newspapers which gave the abortion statistics for the UK and the United States.  Where abortion referral was introduced, the number of abortions increased dramatically and, in the UK, they increased threefold. If this Bill makes abortion more morally acceptable, will there be a dramatic increase, from the present 8 per cent, in the number of abortions?</P>
      <P>Counselling is extremely important and I ask the Minister to examine the issue of counselling in the United Kingdom.  The Bill will incease the provision for counselling from £70,000 to £200,000 but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Throughout history this country has been famed on the world stage, more than anything else, for our exports.  The island of saints and scholars brought education to many parts of Europe and there are hundreds of remarkable Irishmen on the world political stage.  Nobody can deny the very valuable contribution of Irish people to international affairs which is recognised around the world.  There is not any community in the world which does not boast Irish representation of a positive kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, however, a dark side to our exports.  In the past, our convicts and law breakers were exported out of this <Col N="453" /> jurisdiction to foreign fields.  More recently, our jobless people were scattered around the globe as we failed to provide employment for them at home. In some respects, we export our marriage breakdowns by facilitating those who can afford a divorce to obtain one in a foreign jurisdiction and return home to remarry here, a country that bans divorce under its Constitution. One can obtain a divorce if one can pay the dollars in Haiti or some similar jurisdiction and return here as though the marriage was lawfully dissolved and that dissolution will be clearly recognised in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>More shameful, however, are our abortion exports.  At least 14 women each day leave this jurisdiction to terminate a pregnancy abroad.  These are the official figures but we all know that the real figures may be much higher.  We have formulated a convenient English solution to an Irish problem.  This export represents a valve that has allowed us to escape from confronting the sensitive and delicate matter that is abortion.  If this convenient escape were unavailable it is certain that there would be back street abortions in Dublin and a great deal of pressure to legalise the availability of abortion in this State.  Not only, therefore, do we accept the exporting of our problem but we do so without allowing access to basic information.</P>
    <P>By denying access to information we are doing ourselves a disservice as a nation.  We have a poor track record in this regard.  Renowned books and publications on women's health have been banned and removed from libraries in this State because they contained certain information on abortion services abroad.  Women have been forced to rely on an informal network provided by colleagues anxious to help and assist at a time of difficult circumstances.  Individual women have been left alone and unaided at a time when they are most vulnerable and in need of help.  The moral crisis faced by a woman in such circumstances is, in essence, straightforward. Does a girl faced with a crisis <Col N="454" /> pregnancy spend the first weeks furtively seeking telephone numbers, names and addresses, scraping together a few hundred pounds, and an excuse to slip on a ferry and disappear for a few days?  Or can she spend the same time in consultation, seeking advice, guidance, help and counselling of a type that will allow her to form a view and make a rational and informed decision?</P>
    <P>The need for proper counselling on a countrywide basis has been recognised in the Government's Bill.  I welcome the allocation of almost a quarter of a million pounds for such a service alongside a commitment that this country will at last have a comprehensive family planning service throughout the State, not just in the major urban centres.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most important aspect of this Bill is the fact that its content was sealed with the approval of the people by referendum in 1992.  The six to four majority was in favour of the type of information that will be allowed under law following the passage of this legislation. Legislation on the matter of information was promised before, during and after the referendum and this is precisely what the Government is now doing.  The then Fianna Fáil Minister for Health, Deputy John O'Connell, said so at the time and nobody in Fianna Fáil, to my knowledge, publicly aired any disagreement with that view.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that one of the major planks against this Bill coming from the Fianna Fáil side of the House is the speed with which it is being rushed through the Dáil &mdash; speed on the matter of a referendum which was approved by the people by a six to four majority in November 1992, almost two and a half years ago.  The Government is now being accused of proceeding with too much speed by the same party that was the majority shareholder in a Government before, during and after the referendum. I do not believe for one minute that Deputy Bertie Ahern, his Fianna Fáil front bench or his back-benchers are being honest with themselves or with the Irish people when they say this <Col N="455" /> legislation has been brought forward with such haste.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of discussion, debate, agreement and disagreement on this legislation.  I recognise the right of the people to inform and enter into discussion with their public representatives on any legislation that comes before the House.  However, the Society for the Protection of the Unborn Child, in the course of the referendum campaign in 1992, warned people to vote no because that group feared and opposed the provision of names and addresses and information on abortion.  The people decided otherwise and that is accountability and democracy in operation.  It is worth reminding ourselves again of the 1992 wording, lest there be any attempt to rewrite it.  The public record states that Article 40.3.3º was amended by the addition of the following words:</P>
    <P>This subsection shall not limit freedom to obtain or make available in the State, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law, information relating to services lawfully available in another state.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of public record, a matter of fact.  It is precisely what was approved in a referendum, a decision not of any one party in this House, nor of any Government or parliament but of the people as a whole in the exercise of universal suffrage.</P>
    <P>I wish to acknowledge representations I have received from many concerned constituents and citizens in recent times.  I value their views and welcome their advice.  I hope I have in most cases allayed their fears and satisfied their concerns.  This form of dialogue is fundamental to the democratic process and it is my duty as an elected Member to listen to the views of citizens in the course of forming an opinion as to how best I can make a decision in this House on the matter of a regulation or of any given piece of legislation. However, I regret that not all the people I met with or who contacted me were courteous, civil or rational in their <Col N="456" /> approach.  I regret that I have experienced shades of Ceaucescu's Romania and Khomeini's Iran as an unhealthy form of fundamentalism, not for the first time, has raised its unwelcome and frightening head in this State.  As an elected representative of the people, I deplore that.</P>
    <P>This House has been given a mandate by the people, directly expressed in 1992, to proceed along the lines of the Bill.  This mandate includes, as was stated, the right to information to include names and addresses, counselling and advice of a non-directive nature, but not actual referral.  Under this Bill doctors may not make appointments or refer women to a clinic.  I fail to find anything in this Bill that was not discussed at length before the referendum in 1992, and nothing that was not placed before the people prior to voting. I challenge anybody on any side of this House to say otherwise.</P>
    <P>As an assembly we must not impose sectarian moral views on society as a whole as we attempt to do our best to tackle a problem on which consensus is not possible.  The passage of this Bill will not immediately resolve the fundamental problem of why almost 100 women each week travel to England for abortions. However, as the Minister has indicated, the Government has committed itself towards researching the problem with a view to setting up education and counselling services that will minimise the need on the part of Irish women to resort to abortion in respect of unwanted pregnancies.

      <P>We must set ourselves the target of living in a truly pro-life society where human life is respected and protected.  We have seen great strides in recent years towards that objective &mdash; the abolition of capital punishment and the peace initiative in the North are all pointers in that direction. <Col N="457" /> But a pro-life society would not have the disturbing and reprehensible litany of sexual abuse and incest cases that we see appearing daily before our courts.  A pro-life society would not have rape crisis centres being funded by flag-days, pound tickets and other street collections. Sexual abuse clinics in a pro-life society would be welcomed, supported and assisted by the State for and on behalf of the citizenry.  A pro-life society would see the acceptance and expansion of the Stay Safe programme in our schools, which unfortunately is the target of opposition by groups who maintain they are speaking for a majority view in the State.  Our objective must be to respect all human life.  This Bill represents a balance that is worthy of support. Our overall objective must be to reduce the numbers opting for pregnancy termination, a goal which I am sure is shared not only by Deputy O'Rourke but by all of us in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Noonan, on dealing with a problem that was neglected for two years by the previous Government.  It was a question of Nero fiddling &mdash; Fianna Fáil brought in this amendment and then failed to deal with it.  That party is now taking a completely different line which is indefensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil had backbone at one time but seems to have lost it.  Democracy cannot be selective.  We cannot have democracy when it suits us, for example, during a general election.  We are all delighted to be declared TDs, but it is amazing that there are no resignations from the Dáil when people cannot accept a 60:40 majority on an amendment to Constitution.  How can democracy survive if we are so selective?  With all due respect to the present soldiers of destiny, they should examine their conscience on this subject.  It was the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government &mdash; we have been challenged for not explaining the position, but it is unnecessary to explain it to people who are dealing with the matter &mdash; who <Col N="458" /> introduced an amendment to Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution stating: &ldquo;It shall not limit freedom to obtain or make available in this State, subject to such condition as may be laid out by law, information relating to services lawfully available in another State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Lest people did not know what that meant, one million booklets published at a cost to the State, were issued to every household explaining exactly the conditions that would be laid down by law.  It was stated that the legislation would permit a doctor or advice agency to give a pregnant women information on abortion services available elsewhere. To whom was the Government speaking and what did it mean by telling the people that information on abortion services elsewhere would be available? Was it fooling itself or the public, and is Fianna Fáil still trying to fool the public in the stance it is now taking?</P>
    <P>It is appalling that a party which introduced an amendment to the Constitution, held a referendum on that amendment and issued booklets explaining the wording should come in here now to give lectures on abortion.  I have no qualms about talking to people who are concerned about abortion.  It is up to me and every TD to explain that this is an information Bill resulting from the vote of the people in November 1992.  It is unacceptable for Fianna Fáil Deputies to lecture us about abortion, knowing that their party brought in this amendment and asked the people to vote for it.  Deputy Noonan deserves to be congratulated on tackling the problem.</P>
    <P>The people on the pro-life side were concerned about the amendment and battled against it, as they were entitled to do.  However they accepted the people's choice and issued a pamphlet explaining that all factual information on abortion is legal in Ireland.  They said all that is forbidden is aiding someone to have an abortion abroad, making a booking in a foreign clinic or supplying the name and address of one.  They anticipated that if the &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote won, this is what would happen.  We are now <Col N="459" /> being told that people did not know what they were voting for.  The Government went out of its way to explain the position, as did the pro-life group, and the amendment was passed.  The right to information was agreed to in November 1992.  To say that this Government is now introducing abortion is going out of one's way to be as crooked as possible and there is no defence for it.</P>
    <P>On the positive side, I welcome the extra allocation of money for counselling. If we can persuade even one person in ten to go for counselling, even if they set out with the intention of simply getting addresses, it will be a job well done.  I do not deal with the issue of abortion in a comfortable way.  I am tired listening to old men, who unless there is a major bionic change will never experience motherhood, pontificate on this subject.  I will never know what goes through the mind of a woman in panic with an unwanted pregnancy.  We should leave it to God to judge them.  I am tired listening to experts so readily condemning what women do.  If these women are encouraged to go for counselling and realise it is not the end of the world, many of them may never travel abroad for abortions.  To say that this Bill will provide for a mass exit for abortions is unacceptable.  According to statistics, 4,000 to 5,000 women per year travel abroad to terminate their pregnancies. Would it not be much better if we could encourage even 10 per cent of them to accept counselling and stay in Ireland?  I again compliment the Minister on trebling the amount of money available for counselling.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak in this debate.  I listened with interest to the two previous contributions, much of which was sensible.  I do not intend to get into party politics or to start a process of denigration.  Like other Deputies, I have received letters and telephone calls and have met people with strongly held views on this issue.  I do my best to <Col N="460" /> explain my view clearly and with conviction, but a huge gap remains.  It appears that other Members have been on the receiving end of what they term abusive phone calls and letters of condemnation, but my communications on this issue have been cordial and civilised? Everybody is entitled to contact elected Members of the Oireachtas on issues such as this; it is as a result of their votes that we are here &mdash; and we in turn are entitled to our view.  I would ask people to respect those who hold views different from theirs.  Tolerance and the ability to respect other people's point of view is a civilised trait that should be encouraged in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that many of us start with the same sentence, as if we were somewhat on trial in this debate, and I too will begin with that sentence.  I am opposed to abortion and I note that a great many Deputies felt they should state this.  I have never met anyone in Ireland who espoused abortion and I have yet to meet someone who adopts a pro-abortion stance.  Abortion goes against my faith, my upbringing, my instincts but most of all against my sense of womanhood.  However, my conviction does not prevent me from seeing reality and knowing that women leave this country to have an abortion.  The Minister gave the official statistics, in the region of 4,300 women go to England each year to have an abortion but I am convinced the number is far greater.  It stands to reason that for every woman who gives her name and address there is at least another shadowy woman behind her who is unable, for reasons we cannot fathom, to give her name, perhaps for fear of being identified or having her history known. That is extremely sad.  It is incorrect for anyone to say the statistics are wrong &mdash; they are wrong only to the extent that the number is far greater than recorded. That is why I commend the Minister's commitment to major research into the reasons that so many women decide to take that very lonely journey.  What never ceases to amaze me is that although it takes two to bring about <Col N="461" /> conception, whether in a permanent or casual relationship usually only one makes that journey.  From what I have been told, in 90 per cent of cases it is the woman, locked in her own misery and feeling hurt and isolated who has to make that journey alone and wonder whether she will be able to put the experience behind her.  I believe that women never put it behind them because no woman will blithely or lightly have an abortion as it goes against the very nature of womanhood.</P>
    <P>Women by their biological make-up are attuned to conceiving, carrying and bearing a child, clearly any woman who then has to decide to have an abortion has to do so in a furtive way and in a bleak and isolated fashion.  No woman would lightly seek an abortion as it is an invasion of her body and mind.  I trust the Minister will go ahead with this major research as he has announced it publicly in the Dáil and said it will not be put back because the positive aspect of this debate is that we are talking about the 4,500 women who seek abortions.</P>
    <P>Apart from letters to the editor and reflective articles in various newspapers when was this issue last debated?  The Legislature must have debated the issue at the time of the 1992 Referendum but prior to that the major debate would have been in 1983 when the pro-life amendment was debated.  That was a very bitter and divisive debate and I would like to think the outcome of this debate will be more humane.</P>
    <P>Many aspects of life will be brought to bear in the major research that the Minister intends to commission.  During my time in the Department of Education from 1987 onwards I introduced guidelines for sex education in schools and there was a barrage of objections, for example, that this was not the right time or that there was no need for sex education which would despoil innocence. We persisted with its introduction and all Ministers following me have continued it.  Similarly I remember a major policy difference I had with the Church when I introduced the AIDS <Col N="462" /> Awareness Programme in schools, which led to quite a heated debate but when I sat down and talked it out with two bishops of the Catholic education secretariat they saw my point of view. Later with the collaboration of the general secretary of the INTO, Senator Joe O'Toole, I introduced the Stay Safe programme, first on a pilot basis, and then expanded it.  The same type of letters were sent, protesting about sex education and AIDS education in schools when the Stay Safe programme was introduced.  We were told there was no need for it, that it would spoil young people's lives by giving them ideas that they would never be able to contend with.  Sadly, since then there has been an endless stream of reported cases of incest, child abuse and harm to children. I saw a case reported recently where the person said that the Stay Safe programme had helped them to cope yet the same people protest and keep saying that there is no need for such programmes.</P>
    <P>Ignorance is not bliss and education on sexuality must be given in co-operation with parents and against the background of giving children confidence. Of course there is the danger that there may be an awakening in a child of something that he or she may not have thought about but is it not far better that this awakening takes place in an environment in which it is explained what lies ahead in life?  It is very interesting that parents, with the exception of certain groups, have warmly supported the measures that the Department of Education has taken in this area.  Is it not better that we recognise the dangers and seek to explain them to children, not in a sense of warning them off forever but making them aware that the world is composed of all sorts of people and all sorts of situations?</P>
    <P>The Stay Safe programme has been extended throughout the country but not every teacher feels competent to engage in the sensitive task of sex education or to teach the Stay Safe programme. Rather than teachers having to participate in the programme it would <Col N="463" /> be far better for principals, as most of them do, to seek a teacher who would be confident in teaching such programmes.</P>
    <P>Those whom the Minister will commission to carry out the research will find one of the reasons women feel impelled to go abroad for an abortion is a hang-up from earlier attitudes in society towards unwanted pregnancies. I am glad society has opened up on this issue and State agencies have made provision for single women to have and keep their babies.  There was a build up of attitudes towards such matters over the generations.  These are deeply rooted and not easily overcome.  We must continue to talk about such matters and make people aware of the options available.</P>
    <P>It is not only a matter of having sex education and guidance, education on AIDS and stay safe programmes; it is also about people feeling confident about themselves.  Much of the trouble arises because single, young pregnant women worry about their peers, their status in society and what other people will say about them.  They are not able to tell someone about it.  That all builds up, leads to panic and the woman or girl wondering what she can do.  She then sees the need to travel to have an abortion and put her problem behind her.  Of course it never is behind her.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne said he wished so many men would not speak about the matter.  I am anti-sexist and against saying that only a man can talk about this subject and only a women can talk about that one.  Yet, in this case, women, have different feelings because of their biological make-up.</P>
    <P>We can view the Bill as a positive one if some of the amendments which we will put forward are accepted.  I commend the amendment which Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn will put forward on counselling.  I know the Minister has made provision to increase the amount of funding from £70,000 to £220,000 but much more needs to be done.  That is only the tip of the iceberg.  For many <Col N="464" /> years I have made a yearly contribution to CURA.  I do not say that to pat myself on the back.  I met some people involved in CURA a few years ago.  I was convinced they were doing very fine work and signed a standing order.  The Minister should put the funding of such agencies as LIFE, CURA and Cherish on a statutory footing and commit further resources to them.</P>
    <P>Doctors should have an opt out clause.  I am not a professional trained counsellor but over the years I met two women with crisis pregnancies.  One was a young girl and the other a women in her forties.  They both came to me for advice.  I met each person privately and talked the matter over fully with them. I am glad neither of them, although they came to me with the idea of having an abortion, had such a tragedy in their lives.  If we can offer women professional advice about having their babies, the facilities which are available to enable them carry and have their children and a climate where the woman and child will be supported and respected and the child loved, that would be a positive outcome.  As time goes on and facilities are put in place to enable such counselling to be given, women will feel less of a need to go abroad for an abortion.</P>
    <P>I have tried to give my opinions and experiences in a practical way.  Women do not go lightly to have an abortion. They are fragile, vulnerable, isolated and alone.  I hope this will mark the beginning of a climate in which there will be kindness shown to and certainty for women with crisis pregnancies who wish to have their babies here.  I hope the counselling services and other measures promised by the Minister will come to fruition.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment as Minister for Health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister for Health on bringing in this very reasonable Bill.  It acceptably treads the line between the two constitutional provisions on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="465" /> Since Article 40.3.3º was enshrined in the Constitution in 1983, in excess of 50,000 women felt it necessary to leave this country on a trail of misery to terminate their pregnancies.  Throughout the debate and the constitutional and legal arguments and word games that have taken place, we have constructed ourselves into a society where such women felt they could not carry their babies to full term.  It is a shocking indictment of society that the concern expressed during the public debate has not manifested itself in a tangible way so that women feel they can carry crisis pregnancies to full term.  In that respect this Bill is to be welcomed, this being the first time we have approached this problem in a person-centred fashion. No longer will we be caught up on constitutional and legal word games, by and large, meaning nothing to the public. Rather we are endeavouring to clearly recognise the immediacy of the problems confronting women with pregnancies they feel they cannot see through to full term.  The commitment implicit in this Bill and the moneys pledged by this Government, in excess of £200,000, to ensure that any woman in a crisis pregnancy knows she has some counselling available to her and she can talk through this crisis is a very welcome development.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the research referred to clearly indicates that the vast majority of Irish women who feel they have no alternative but to terminate their pregnancy in the United Kingdom have not had any counselling and that, of those who have received any a large proportion return and see their pregnancy through a full term.  In that sense, the departure in this Bill from talking about the issue of crisis pregnancy in constitutional/legal terms to talking about it in terms of counselling, in a patient-centred approach, is very welcome.</P>
    <P>It is my firm belief that this Bill is the result of a constitutional obligation placed on successive Governments since 1992, that its provisions clearly outline <Col N="466" /> the legal position of the two provisions in the Constitution, one, the guarantee of the equal right to life of the life of the mother and the unborn child and, second, the public's demand for information.</P>
    <P>It is important to outline the series of legal developments that led to the introduction of this Bill.  In 1988 and 1989 the Open Door counselling centre case, the Dublin Well Woman Centre case and the Grogan case were heard by the Supreme Court.  At that time counselling bodies were issuing names and addresses and the Supreme Court found this was at variance with Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution.  Subsequently a case was taken by those to the European Court of Human Rights which found the decision to be in breach of Article 10 of that convention.  There the matter rested until the X case, as a consequence of which the Government of the day decided to put three referenda to the people &mdash; on the right to travel, on the substantive issue and on availability of information.</P>
    <P>In regard to the referendum on availability of information it is interesting to note that the pamphlet issued by the then Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Government stated:</P>
    <P>Previous court decisions had laid down that disseminating such information about abortion is unlawful. Following the X case it would be lawful in cases where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the expectant mother but only in those cases.  The European Court of Human Rights has recently found the present restrictions to be in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.  This will also be resolved by the amendment.</P>
    <P>Therefore, to argue now that people did not know exactly what they were voting for in that referendum is somewhat disingenuous since the pro-life campaign and the then Government were the two main protagonists, arguing for different results.  It is interesting to note what the <Col N="467" /> pro-life movement had to say in November 1992 on the information amendment. It lobbied, as it is democratically entitled to do, for a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote, believing, and I quote from the pamphlet they produced:</P>
    <P>The word &ldquo;information&rdquo; means assistance and advice in obtaining abortions, abortion referral and advertising.  At present all factual information on abortion is legal in Ireland.  All that is forbidden is aiding someone to have an abortion abroad, making a booking in a foreign clinic or supplying the name and address of one.  This amendment would make it legal in Ireland to assist in the destruction of an unborn child abroad.  It would also eventually legalise the advertising of foreign abortion clinics in the Irish media.</P>
    <P>While that is not a fair legal interpretation of what &ldquo;information&rdquo; meant in the context of the amendment, it clearly recognises that the endorsement of that amendment would lead to names and addresses being made available.</P>
    <P>Anyone who saw a clip from an RTE &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme on Thursday last, of the then Minister for Health, Deputy John O'Connell, state clearly, within the context of the 1992 information amendment that its endorsement would mean the availability of names and addresses, will have been confirmed in that interpretation.  The main protagonists in that campaign were the pro-life movement for a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote and the then Government advocating a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote.  The result was a clear victory for access to information on services legally available in another State. Within the context of the outcome of that referendum it is my belief that the Government has introduced a Bill the provisions of which are in keeping with the wishes of the people reflected in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>I represent a constituency that in 1992, voted against travel, against information and against the substantive issue; I understand there were four such <Col N="468" /> constituencies.  I have had numerous contacts with my constituents and with people from outside my constituency. With the exception of two in recent weeks.  I found all to have been quite courteous and firm in their convictions about what they believed to be the present position.  We engaged in an exchange of opinions, some going away dissatisfied with mine but, in the case of others.  I was able to outline what I believed to be the legal and constitutional obligations on the Government.</P>
    <P>One point made to me repeatedly by my constituents was that, because they had voted &ldquo;no&rdquo; to all three referenda and, within the context of the provisions of this Bill, specifically against the availability of information, in some way I should feel obliged to vote against this Bill.  The reverse logic was not applicable in their view, that all of the remaining 37 constituencies, and their elected Members, should feel obliged to vote for the Bill.  The Constitution does not allow for regional opt-outs; there cannot be a different constitutional application to the constituency of Cork North West, or to any other whose voters voted against the three referenda.  In constitutional terms I feel obliged to take into account the nationwide result and approve legislation which is in accordance with the wishes of the electorate.</P>
    <P>In the course of representations made to me by constituents much concern was expressed about referral, in which respect I want to draw a worthwhile analogy.  For instance, if a person goes to a general practitioner in need of urgent medical treatment or procedure, in turn requiring consultant medical opinion &mdash; whether it be a triple heart by-pass, orthopaedic surgery or whatever &mdash; and the general practitioner produces a list containing the names, addresses and telephone numbers of ten or 20 consultants qualified to carry out the required medical procedure and says: &ldquo;That is as much as I am prepared to do for you, away with you&rdquo;, such a patient would rightly feel that that was not what they had expected of their general practitioner in referring them for <Col N="469" /> further medical attention.  In normal legal circumstances I understand &ldquo;referral&rdquo; is taken to mean one's general practitioner establishing direct contact with the consultancy service of which the patient is in need.</P>
    <P>Within the context of the Bill, and the counselling to be provided, if a woman decides to opt for an abortion and her general practitioner or counselling agency is in a position to furnish her with names, addresses and telephone numbers, her general practitioner will be prohibited from establishing direct contact with any of those agencies.</P>
    <P>It is important also to outline the provisions in the Bill as most people who made representations to me on this matter were not familiar with the contents of the Bill and had not read it.  They were reacting to a well orchestrated centralised campaign which stirred up fears among people genuinely opposed to abortion, most of which were unfounded.  Those people did not understand that this Bill is derived from the people's expressed wish to have access to information.  This Bill sets in context the legal manner in which such information may be imparted.  It is not possible for a counselling agency to counsel solely on abortion.  If they counsel on that option, they must also counsel on alternative options.  There is no obligation on any counselling agency to counsel on the option of abortion.  In that sense the Bill is well crafted and goes as far as is legally practicable in the context of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It is not understood that none of the 14 sections of the Bill refers to names and addresses.  The right to such information emanates from the 1992 referendum. The Government of the day recognised that and campaigned for it on that basis.</P>
    <P>I am confused, as I am sure are most observers of this debate, as to the exact position of Fianna Fáil.  We are being asked to wait for the outcome of a court case which is pending to have an injunction lifted against the Dublin Well Woman Centre providing names and addresses.  While Fianna Fáil believe we <Col N="470" /> should defer the Bill pending the outcome of that case, it was in Government when the case was listed and its Attorney General, who had an obligation to defend the Constitution, did not see fit to oppose the application by the Dublin Well Woman Centre to lift that injunction.  That is a clear indication that we are still dealing with a slightly constitutional party in Fianna Fáil.  Dr. John O'Connell was Minister for Health in 1992 when the amendment on information was put to the people.  It was clearly outlined on RTE that the amendment would mean access to names and addresses.</P>
    <P>The Constitution provides for the separation of powers: the Legislature legislates and the Judiciary adjudicates on its propriety in the context of the Constitution.  We are obliged to legislate and we will be informed in due course if legislation is found to be at variance with the Constitution.  Some weeks ago Deputy O'Donoghue, the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Justice, indignantly lectured the Government about its failure to legislate, the Government and the House having been reprimanded by the courts for their failure to amend legislation governing the media coverage of incest cases in the courts.  The Judiciary was correct and we were remiss in our duties in that regard and I am glad the Minister for Justice is moving to redress that.  It is illogical for Fianna Fáil and Deputy O'Donoghue to argue that we should wait until we are further reprimanded by the courts before introducing this Bill.  There is no guarantee that the case before the courts will resolve the issue.  As the case is being dealt with in the High Court it can be appealed and thereby further postponed.</P>
    <P>I am deeply disappointed with the attitude taken by the Fianna Fáil Party in this debate.  It is obvious that during the interregnum before the coming into power of the present Government, the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Health, Deputy Woods, was clearly aware of what had been agreed or proposed in negotiations between Fianna Fáil and <Col N="471" /> Labour.  There was an agreement on a much more liberal and possibly unconstitutional interpretation of what was meant by the 1992 referendum on information. I am satisfied the Minister has found the correct balance between the two provisions in the Constitution, the people's expressed desire to protect the right to life of the unborn and their wish to have access to information about services legally available in another jurisdiction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment as Minister for Health.  It is a tough job, but the Minister is used to opening cans of worms.  He did that in the early 1980s and he has been handed another one on this occasion.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate on a most divisive and contentious issue, not only here but worldwide.  Abortion is an issue which raises the temperature because it relates to life.  On the whole the debate here is carried on in a civilised manner, but unfortunately some people on both sides have extreme views and overstep the mark.  Their behaviour cannot be condoned and must be condemned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the final analysis the judgment of what is right or wrong will be made by God.  Individuals must act according to their conscience, but they must take the necessary steps to ensure their decision is based on an educated conscience, not on feelings or emotions.  That especially relates to those of us who make laws. Across the world today nations that espoused abortion as being the ultimate right are having second thoughts.  The misery of abortion has finally been recognised.  The damage it has wrought on individuals, families and society has hit home.  Attempts are rightly being made to roll back those mistaken decisions.  An overwhelming majority of the Irish people, spanning all creeds, classes and sectors of society have expressed their abhorrence of abortion and the abortion culture.  The passing of <Col N="472" /> the referendum on information is being interpreted by some as giving the go-ahead to abortion as long as it does not happen in Ireland.  In 1992 the then Government in the leaflet distributed to all households specifically stated that the giving of information did not equate to referral.  Many who voted &ldquo;yes&rdquo; for information at that time did so on that understanding.  It is patently incorrect to say that the 60 per cent who voted for information were in favour of referral.</P>
    <P>This Bill, as constituted, assists in procuring abortion.  Section 2 states:</P>
    <P>This Act applies to information that&mdash;</P>
    <P> (a)  is likely to be required by a woman for the purpose of availing herself of services provided outside the State for the termination of pregnancies, and</P>
    <P>(b)  relates to such services or to persons who provide them... </P>
    <P>That section refers to assistance.  This is not what the people want.  This is not what the overwhelming majority of Members want but as it stands such will be the result of this legislation.</P>
    <P>Abortion, as all speakers so far have declared, is unacceptable.  If so, this Bill must be turned down.  By accepting assistance, as per section 2, one is acknowledging and accepting the principle of abortion as being legitimate.  On the other hand if the Bill is passed, as is likely, the next logical step would be to allow abortion in Ireland, otherwise we would be hypocritical with a capital &ldquo;H&rdquo;.  This is what some vocal elements want.  The pro-abortion lobby has strong backing and support from the Irish Family Planning Association.  Its views are clearly presented in its publication &ldquo;The Agenda for Choice &mdash; Achieving Reproductive Rights in Ireland &mdash; Goals for the year 2000&rdquo;.  It states that the association gives a special emphasis to maternal and child health through information and access to family planning and safe abortion.  Their publication states clearly, on page 6, that their number one goal is:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="473" /> To promote an environment in which decisions can be freely made by women who have unplanned and unexpected pregnancies.</P>
    <P>In the context of abortion in Britain it states:</P>
    <P>&mdash;  Inform women of their legal rights to safe abortions,</P>
    <P>&mdash;  Provide confidential information and counselling on how to obtain a safe abortion,</P>
    <P>&mdash;  Continually improve access to these services,</P>
    <P>&mdash;  Condemn incidents of any political, administrative or social barriers curtailing this right,</P>
    <P>&mdash;  Wherever possible enter into dialogue with political, religious and cultural opinion leaders to liberalise their attitudes towards safe abortion. </P>
    <P>The foregoing plainly outlines where the Irish Family Planning Association want this country to go, that is in a direction that is repugnant to the majority view held by Deputies who have spoken so far in this House and by the majority of people in this country. They are putting their views forward on a &ldquo;drip, drip&rdquo; basis.  The Bill, as constituted, is another step in that direction. It has been construed to aid, abet and assist abortion which I am sure is not what the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, wants.  What it implies in the final analysis is that abortion is all right and acceptable but not at home.  It is not right or acceptable either at home or abroad.  Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution states:</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="474" /> The information referendum added:</P>
    <P>This subsection shall not limit freedom to obtain or make available, in the State, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law, information relating to services lawfully available in another state.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not give the protection to the unborn which Article 40.3.3º accords it.  Giving more than factual information, names, addresses, telephone numbers and information likely to be required by a woman as implied in section 2, weighs heavily against the unborn and is not what the people want. Requiring doctors to provide names and addresses puts many of them, whose ethical guidelines clearly do not support referring a pregnant woman in order that her child be killed, in an impossible situation.  Clearly there is a case for conscience opt-out clause.  Even though it has been said there is nothing in the Bill which requires a doctor to give the information it has been clearly stated that if he does not he is likely to be brought to court for not providing the information required under the Bill.  I understand the Minister is examining this issue and I hope he will table an amendment to take account of the conscience problem which many doctors face.</P>
    <P>In reply to a recent question, the Minister stated that 13,500 women went abroad for abortions during the past three years.  If this is correct it is a sad state of affairs.  It is sad for those who felt they had to take this course of action.  I do not pass judgment on any person but in many cases abortion was not the cure for the problem.  Psychological scars have been left on many and we cannot and must not ignore the problem as if it does not exist.  We must take steps to help those who face what is for them an insurmountable and unbearable problem.  Improved funding for bodies such as Life, Cura and Cherish must be provided.  Sex education at an early stage must be improved and counselling made more widely available. There is no doubt that many who felt <Col N="475" /> taking the boat or the plane was the only resort would not have done so had they known of the help they could have received.  I am pleased the Minister has announced extra funding for counselling services.  I hope it is only a beginning and when the Bill is enacted the problem will not be forgotten until some other crisis arises.</P>
    <P>What I have found disconcerting during the past week or so has been the distortion, half truths and inaccurate reporting both in the printed media and on the radio of the views expressed by Fianna Fáil TDs.  The reporting has been unashamedly biased in a number of cases.  Why?  The Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, attempted to muddy the waters by stating that Fianna Fáil had agreed a more liberal Bill with Labour, a matter referred to by Deputy Creed in his contribution.  Labour has not said it agreed a Bill with Fianna Fáil. I would like to hear the views of the Labour Party as we have not heard it either yesterday or today.</P>
    <P>At a parliamentary party meeting in October 1994 the Taoiseach agreed that before any information Bill was published there would be an opportunity to discuss its principles with the Fianna Fáil Party.  No Bill came before the party for discussion and the Government fell in the meantime.  We read later that agreement was reached on a Bill, during the discussions on the formation of the new Government, between Fianna Fáil and Labour but this has been categorically denied by our negotiators.</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister run with this Bill?  Why did the press not give equal prominance to the replies to those false allegations?  This gives rise to questions about its intentions.  Over the weekend the historical role of some sections of the media came to the fore, that is to denigrate and make little of the leader of Fianna Fáil, whoever that may be. This is not anything new.  During their time as leader of Fianna Fáil, Eamon de Valera, Seán Lemass, Jack Lynch, Charles Haughey and Albert Reynolds <Col N="476" /> were all castigated and abused, and Deputy Bertie Ahern got the same treatment during the weekend.  This is a cross the leader of Fianna Fáil, the largest political party the one which represents the views of the majority of the electorate, has to carry.</P>
    <P>When he was leader of Fianna Fáil, Mr. Haughey was repeatedly castigated for allegedly not allowing a full, frank and open debate on certain issues. Under the leadership of Mr. Haughey and Deputy Reynolds, Fianna Fáil Deputies never had their right to free speech stifled.  Deputy Ahern, continuing in that mould, decided last week to allow a full, open and frank discussion on this issue at the parliamentary party meeting.  This is what democracy and openness, transparency and accountability are about, and Fianna Fáil is not afraid of these concepts.  Deputies are elected to represent the views of their constituents and it is not the leader of Fianna Fáil or any one person who decided what the party will do.  The silence of some members of other parties and the way in which the Bill is being rushed through gives rise to questions about the Government's policy of openness, transparency and accountability. Has it had a change of heart or has it found it too difficult to continue with its policy?</P>
    <P>I wish to nail another widely reported lie, that Fianna Fáil Deputies bent under the pressure of 'phone calls and of statements by certain individuals.  All the Fianna Fáil Deputies who have spoken have expressed their views and convictions.  I received some 'phone calls but most of the callers were courteous in making their views known to me.  As public representatives, it is incumbent on us to listen to the views of our constituents.  I categorically deny the reports in the press that Fianna Fáil Deputies were brow-beaten into submission. Over the years I have been lobbied on many issues, for example, the rod licence where protestors cut telephone wires, punctured tyres and physically abused people, the designation of disadvantaged areas, the pupil-teacher <Col N="477" /> ratio, problems in relation to dumps, about which people get very agitated, and hare coursing where the abuse was out of all bounds.  There has been no abuse of that nature on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Deputies represent the views of a majority of the electorate, and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, knows this.  That is why he tried to disparage the views expressed by my party. He described the Fianna Fáil position as opportunistic.  Is the Government not guilty of being opportunistic by introducing this Bill on the back of the Framework Document and rushing it through the House with undue haste while at the same time apparently muzzling its back-benchers?</P>
    <P>It is time to consider another referendum which would enable people to cast a straight yes or no vote on this issue and on the deletion of Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>This Article has caused untold problems since its inclusion in the Constitution.  The Bill is both unwise and untimely and will, in its present form, lead to a culture which is inimical to the electorate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am proud that in 1983 I voted in the House against the Bill which promoted the constitutional referendum which resulted in the Eighth Amendment being included in the Constitution. I can still recall the silent hostility and black looks of some Fine Gael colleagues as Monica Barnes and I descended the stairs of the Dáil Chamber after that historic vote.  We had defied the collective will of party colleagues and ignored the political pressures exerted by the then Taoiseach and Ministers.  For a young inexperienced Deputy with less than two years membership of this House it was a distressing experience which I can still recall.  As I exited the Chamber the hairs stood on the back of my neck and my knees shook.  It would have been so <Col N="478" /> much easier simply to have been part of the crowd.</P>
      <P>To the promoters of the Eighth Amendment, Mr. William Binchy, Mr. Desmond Hanafin, PLAC, SPUC and the Fianna Fáil Party, everything was clear, in absolutist terms.  Those who said its wording was ambigious, that it might not say what its advocates propounded were labelled dishonest.  Those who queried the wisdom of its incorporation into the Constitution were the recipients of hate mail and were labelled abortionists.  We are back in that territory this week.</P>
      <P>The advocates of the Eighth Amendment said it would outlaw abortion in all circumstances.  In the X case the Supreme Court rightly decided &mdash; I predicted this in 1983 &mdash; that where pregnancy causes a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother it may be terminated.  The advocates of the Eighth Amendment said it would outlaw abortion in Ireland.  The decision in the X case has determined that where a mother's life is at risk a pregnancy may be terminated in this State, she need not travel abroad.  This is also the position where the risk to her life is due to her being suicidal.  A woman whose life is at such risk is, as a result of the decision in this case, not only entitled to terminate her pregnancy in this State but has a constitutional right to such medical services in this State as are necessary to effect the termination.  Under the amendment, the State is obliged to pay due regard to the right to life of the mother and to respect her constitutional right to bodily integrity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The advocates of the Eighth Amendment stated that it was not intended to affect the right of pregnant women to travel abroad.  In the X case the majority of the Supreme Court held that where pregnancy does not pose a real and substantial threat to the life of the mother she can be injuncted and prevented from travelling abroad.  To remove the spectre of pregnant women being incarcerated in this State the right to travel had to be expressly included in the Constitution by referendum in 1992.  The <Col N="479" /> advocates of the Eighth Amendment said it would reduce the number of Irish women having abortions in England.  In 1983 fewer than 3,000 women resident in Ireland had abortions in England while in 1994 the number stood at 4,500, and it is increasing annually.</P>
    <P>The fundamentalist campaigners on this issue have been consistently proved wrong in all their legal and social predictions. Yet they still fulminate in absolutist and self-righteous terms and are given a credibility which they do not deserve.  They still stalk this House and cast a shadow over this Chamber which ensures that we continue to fail to address the real human issues which need to be discussed both frankly and openly.  As a Legislature, we have to date failed to set our own agenda and, through cowardice, failed to enact legislation to deal with the substantive impact of the Eighth Amendment as determined by the Supreme Court in the X case.</P>
    <P>In 1983 I predicted that the Eighth Amendment would result in endless litigation and in that I have also been proved right.  Rather than creating a climate which in a considerate and humane way encourages women in crisis pregnancies to choose options other than abortion, the Eighth Amendment has been used as a constitutional weapon to persecute a suicidal teenage victim of statutory rape, student groups and pregnancy counsellors.  It has resulted in a plethora of High Court, Supreme Court and European Court judgments.  It ultimately resulted in this State being held in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights by the European Court.  In so far as the Eighth Amendment curtailed access to information, it was held by that court to impose unacceptable and disproportionate restrictions in a democratic society.  The impact of the Eighth Amendment on the provision of information resulted in a further amendment to the Constitution, also made in 1992.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="480" /> The 1992 amendment seeks to ensure that a woman seeking an abortion outside the State can obtain information relating to foreign abortion services and that it is lawful to make such information available to her.  What does not appear to be understood is that this provision has no relevance to furnishing information to women whose pregnancies pose a real and substantial risk to their lives.  As a result of the decision in the X case, such women are entitled to be provided with the fullest information possible and to be referred directly by either doctors or counsellors for the purposes of a pregnancy termination either inside or outside this State.  I shall return to this shortly in the context of the present Bill.</P>
    <P>One lesson, if no other, should be learnt by now, that this complex human problem cannot be solved by constitutional and legislative word games. There is no miracle legislative prescription. Is it not time that we called a halt to the never-ending game of political charades Members on all sides of this House play when addressing the issue? Is it not time for us to confront the real problems that arise and recognise their complexity?  Is it not time for a majority of us to acknowledge that there are no black and white solutions, but many shades of grey?  Is it not time to end political juggling with women's lives and the lives of the unborn?  Is it not time for the male Members of this House to stop talking about women in a deeply offensive and insensitive manner? Should we not, as my Fine Gael colleague, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, stated in 1992, bring to an end the disembodied debate about women's bodies? Is it not time also for the self-proclaimed godfathers and godmothers of the fundamentalist storm-troopers to bow their heads in shame and publicly apologise for subjecting our people to more than a decade of sulphurous, divisive and hurtful debate?  Is it not time for them to publicly acknowledge that the public campaign mounted by them in the early 1980s for constitutional change has been proved tragically <Col N="481" /> wrong and their constitutional pronouncements wildly inaccurate?</P>
    <P>Public pronouncements since the publication of this Bill from those responsible for our current constitutional malaise clearly illustrate their incapacity to come to terms with reality. They live in a fantasy world in which they believe we should all be embraced, where all aspects of human behaviour can be neatly ordered by constitutional words and phrases.  Provided their point is made, it is permissible to outrageously distort historical tragedies to recruit to their cause.  Sadly, the most outrageous distortion has come from a High Court Judge, Mr. Justice O'Hanlon, who has had a distinguished judicial career, a man for whom I have high regard.  His considered reference to the Holocaust in the context of this debate should never have been made.  To suggest that a teenage girl or woman confronted by a crisis pregnancy, with which she cannot cope, who escapes the cloud of hypocrisy which hangs over this island to flee to England for a termination is the moral equivalent of Adolf Eichmann is, in the realm of theological or political invective, an outrageous obscenity. Coming as it does from a judge of this country which closed its doors to those both trying to escape from that appalling event prior to the last World War and to those who were its survivors after that war, to put it mildly, the statement was uniquely inappropriate.</P>
    <P>Very few people seriously believe that any of the theocratic brow-beating and high moralistic craw thumping in which the fundamentalist campaigners engage has resulted in a single child being born on this island which would, without their verbal threats and histrionics, have been otherwise aborted. What, of course, is unknown is the number of frightened young girls and women who have been run out of this country to the abortion clinics abroad, fearful of discussing their personal plight with anyone first because of the public displays of intolerance and absolutism which have been part of our <Col N="482" /> political and social landscape.  What is also unknown is the contribution which the many <i>ex cathedra</i> statements from fundamentalist campaigners have made to the findings in dark laneways and behind hedgerows in parts of this country of the dead bodies of newly born babies, born to mothers so stricken with fear and guilt that they concealed to full term their condition from their families and gave birth alone, unassisted, in the open and without medical help.  Does anyone here still remember Anne Lovett?</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill states that it applies to information which, &ldquo;(a) is likely to be required by a woman for the purpose of availing herself of services provided outside the State for the termination of pregnancies, and (b) relates to such services or to persons who provide them&rdquo;.  The Bill essentially seeks to ensure that those who seek abortions outside Ireland can receive information which details the names and addresses of places in which an abortion can be obtained.  In this context it seeks to implement the Fourteenth Amendment.  It intends to confine discussions on abortion with doctors, counsellors and social workers to the provision of such information which must be &ldquo;truthful and objective and must not advocate or promote the termination of pregnancy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Minister and others have been anxious to draw a distinction between referral and the provision of information. The Bill, however, fails to draw a distinction between a pregnant woman where there is a real and substantial risk to her life and a woman whose life is not at such risk.  In so far as it seeks to curtail referral or advocacy with regard to a woman whose life is at risk, the Bill is constitutionally questionable.  In so far as it seeks to prevent the making of arrangements to assist a woman in such circumstances to obtain an abortion, its constitutionality is also suspect.  For example, as a result of the X case, is a doctor whose patient has a malignant cancer not entitled to advocate and recommend to her that a procedure which includes, of necessity, the <Col N="483" /> effecting of a miscarriage be utilised by her to save her life without running the risk of facing criminal charges?  Is a doctor not also entitled to refer a suicidal rape victim for an abortion to a specific clinic or hospital and discuss her condition directly with those who will care for her there?</P>
    <P>Section 5 (a) of the Bill appears to render such behaviour unlawful whether the referral or advocacy applies to a termination within or outside the State.  It may be argued that section 2 confines the application of section 5 to terminations of pregnancies outside the State only.  If so, it produces the absurd result that it is lawful to advocate a termination within the State to a woman whose life is at risk and unlawful to advocate a termination outside the State to a woman whose life is at risk.  The absurdity is compounded by the reality that no services officially exist within this State to terminate pregnancies in the circumstances in which a termination is now constitutionally permissible.</P>
    <P>The Minister clearly stated that nothing contained in the Bill renders it a criminal offence to advocate that a person should not terminate a pregnancy. As a general approach, those who seek in a humane, considerate and reasonable way to discourage abortion should not be criminalised, but why should it be unlawful to urge a woman whose life is at risk to save her life by terminating a pregnancy and lawful to urge her to sacrifice her life by maintaining a pregnancy?  I wonder if there would be majority support in this male dominated House for a legislative provision which rendered it unlawful for a doctor to advocate to a male patient medical intervention in specified circumstances in which a man's life was at risk.  I very much doubt it.</P>
    <P>The reality is, of course, we should not be legislating for what people are allowed to say to each other, read or publish.  The reality is also that in this day and age any legislation that <Col N="484" /> attempts to do so in so far as it is perceived as a mechanism for social ordering will rapidly fall into disrepute and become irrelevant.  This is the age of multi-channel television, satellite stations, the internet and of the widespread distribution of foreign publications. Other than laying a foundation for further litigation, it is difficult to see what this legislation can achieve.</P>
    <P>In a democratic society there should be a free flow of information and discussion. It is a legitimate desirable objective, with which I agree, for the State to take reasonable action to discourage abortions.  In the realm of discussion and debate this should, however, be primarily in the area of social policy and social intervention and not by the application of criminalising legislation which curtails the rights of freedom of speech and free expression.</P>
    <P>This Bill and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution is part of the constitutional legacy of the Eighth Amendment.  In this House on 20 October 1992 I criticised the Government for promoting the Fourteenth Amendment without publishing the legislation it envisaged enacting.  By doing so and insisting on the referenda on travel and information taking place in a legislative vacccum, it sowed the seeds for the controversy which has arisen on this Bill.  Our freedom of expression should not be constrained in this area by constitutional and legislative provision.  The Fourteenth Amendment, however, ameliorated the impact of the Eighth Amendment and allows us the opportunity of bringing our laws into conformity with our international obligations under European law.  I accept that it is necessary to clarify the position further by the enactment of legislation.  Such legislation must be constitutionally sound and should not turn the clock back by making gestures in the direction of those who have been proved over the past 15 years to have been entirely misguided in their approach.</P>
    <P>The difficult constitutional framework within which the Bill must operate meant it would not be easy to draft.  I <Col N="485" /> expressed some reservations about its constitutionality from one perspective. Its complex provisions relating to various forms of publications, the constraints it attempts to impose on the medical profession and counsellors, its prohibition on the making of &ldquo;arrangements&rdquo;, will in the future all provide fertile ground for further litigation and constitutional challenge.  Mr. Binchy and his friends are already questioning the constitutionality of even allowing the giving of information of the limited variety envisaged by the Bill.  Like the Eighth Amendment, this measure will be utilised by those who believe they have an exclusive insight into God's will, to entrap and persecute members of the medical profession, pregnancy counselling organisations and student groups.</P>
    <P>I hope a number of changes can be made on Committee Stage to address the various parts of this Bill that require amendment.  I also hope the amendments will not be solely intended to appease members of Fianna Fáil who are again playing political games with this issue for their perceived party political advantage.  Many of those in Fianna Fáil who took centre stage in the 1983 debate and who then vilified those who disagreed with them have, in recent days, re-emerged out of the mists of time yet again pontificating, overflowing with constitutional certainties, forgetting that their judgment in this area has proved to be fatally flawed.  In the context of that party, we are again &ldquo;back to the future&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of amendments to this measure, I have little doubt that substantial issues will remain to be resolved with regard to its interpretation, application and constitutionality.  Already over a decade of litigation has been spawned by the legal uncertainty generated by the Eighth Amendment.  It has given birth to a legal industry.  There are substantial grounds for believing that if this Bill is enacted in its present form it will be in breach of our Constitution and of European Union rules which we have a constitutional obligation to <Col N="486" /> implement.  It is also certain that within a very short period whether or not the Bill is amended, an individual or a group will launch a constitutional challenge to it.  In the circumstances, it is desirable that the President refer this Bill, pursuant to Article 26 of the Constitution to the Supreme Court for determination as to its constitutionality. As this is a matter essentially for the discretionary judgment of the President having received advice from the Council of State.  I hope that, if a number of Members of this House express the view that such a constitutional ruling is desirable regard will be paid to what is said and that necessary referral will be made as occurred in the case of the Matrimonial Home Bill, 1993.  Such a referral is entirely necessary and desirable so that there can be no future uncertainty as to the state of our legal system and the laws applicable following the enactment of this legislation.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been described, using the old adage, as an &ldquo;Irish solution to an Irish problem&rdquo;.  This is inaccurate.  It is in reality an English solution to an Irish problem.  It, together with the constitutional amendments made in 1983 and 1992, seeks to maintain a constitutional veil of sanctity and piety over this island which obscures our vision of the many thousands of Irish women who go to England seeking help.  We would be better off ending all the jurisprudential gymnastics and reverting to the pre-1983 constitutional position.  Then we might be able to address the real social questions that need to be answered.  We might also be able to confront realities. On the basis of much that has been said in this House in recent days, there is little hope of that happening this side of the year 2000.  In the circumstances, we have no choice but to proceed with this Bill.  I hope that its final form will be a substantially amended version of the present form.  I await with interest the Minister's response to Second Stage on the matters of concern I have raised.  I hope a substantive response will be forthcoming before Members vote on Second Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to allocate five minutes of my time to my colleague, Deputy Matt Brennan.  I also wish to congratulate Deputy O'Shea on his reappointment as Minister of State.  He was most successful as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture.  I have no doubt that he will be equally successful in his new portfolio.</P>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I am not a member of any lobby group and the views I express are personal, dictated by conscience. This is an issue that has divided people all over the world.  It is highly emotive and must be treated with the utmost caution.  In 1983, the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution guaranteed the right to life of the unborn.  The purpose of that amendment was to prohibit abortion in this State.  Subsequently, the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments in 1992 dealt with the right to travel and the right to information.  These subsequent amendments may not be read in isolation. They must be read in conjunction with the Eighth Amendment.</P>
      <P>It behoves us as legislators to consider not alone our duty but our responsibilities to the pro-life amendment.  It is the overwhelming wish of the majority of Irish men and women to protect the right to life of the unborn.  This is recorded in the pro-life amendment.  In effect, our Constitution guarantees to protect the right to life of the unborn. The right to information, also provided for in this amendment, must only be provided in so far as it does not offend against the right to life of the unborn.</P>
      <P>As legislators we must give an interpretation of the amendment relating to information that is not lethal to the constitutional rights of the unborn.  The present interpretation by the Government does not protect the right to life of the unborn.  As a legislator, I must uphold the rights of the unborn as outlined in our Constitution and, for this reason, I must oppose the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information and not referral is what the amendment dealing with information provided for.  The amendment <Col N="488" /> relating to travel, which is cited in this argument, simply guarantees that there will be no injunctive power, that is, that a woman can travel to another country; it did not create a constitutional right to have an abortion abroad.  We cannot and must not provide information that will aid in the destruction of life of the unborn in this country or in another.</P>
    <P>This Bill will allow foreign abortion clinics to advertise in newspapers and on radio and television, etc.  Firms advertise to persuade people to buy, so is it not naïve to think that this is not promoting abortion?  To permit this would be unacceptable.  The Bill will allow doctors, etc. to hand out names, addresses, telephone numbers of reputable and safe abortion clinics where mothers may go to have their babies destroyed, hardly safe for the baby which the Constitution is pledged to defend.</P>
    <P>This goes far beyond the non-directive counselling spoken of in the pre-1992 referendum booklet circulated by the Government. Doctors will not just provide information but will provide assistance.  A good parallel would be a person supplying the name and address of an arms dealer to a potential terrorist, of a drugs dealer to a drug addict or of an angel dust supplier to interested parties.  This constitutes assistance and complicity in the crime.  Informing a client of how to contact an abortion clinic and giving a patient the name and address of a specialist, even if the doctor does not pick up the phone, amounts to referral as one is assisting the boyfriend or whoever else may be involved in making the telephone call.  The Constitution condemns abortion as it involves the killing of innocent human life.  It is obvious, therefore, that anyone who gives the names, addresses and telephone number, of abortion clinics to those who may procure an abortion or who facilitates in any way in endangering the life of an unborn child is a party to this crime.</P>
    <P>It is only a matter of years before abortion on demand is legalised here in <Col N="489" /> spite of the best efforts of concerned people.  The rate will continue to increase until it reaches the level in Great Britain.  What is the reason for this?  This Bill will have the effect of turning abortion into a morally acceptable option for reasonable people. When abortion was legalised in Great Britain in 1967 its supporters assured everyone that it would be restricted mainly to cases where the life of the mother was at risk or her health could be seriously damaged.  The following year there were 23,641 abortions in England and Wales and by 1969 this figure had more than doubled.  In 1970 it increased by a further 60 per cent and continued to rise before levelling out at approximately 170,000 in the 1980s. These figures can be obtained from official British sources.  Once abortion becomes an acceptable option for reasonable people it is foolish to expect it to become less widespread; the exact opposite is the case.  By placing abortion on the same moral plane as adoption or keeping one's baby this Bill will lead to an increase in the figure just as in Great Britain.  This might take a few years but it will happen.</P>
    <P>In addition, at some stage a smart pro-abortion advocate will declare that we should allow doctors to talk openly to women about abortion as we accept it as part of life.  They will ask why we continue to insist on sending Irish women to England and would it not be more sensible and humane to allow abortions to be carried out here.  The argument will then be complete.  I do not know when exactly this will happen but it will as night follows day.  I tremble at this prospect and we have a moral and legal duty to ensure that it does not happen.  Ireland is now unique in the western world because of its moral values and ethos.  This is a treasure that no one can take from us and the greatest contribution that Ireland has to give to the rest of Europe.  We should fight tooth and nail to preserve it and not throw it away.</P>
    <P>Although Catholic teaching on the sacredness of life is clear this is not a <Col N="490" /> Catholic or religious issue; it goes to the very foundations of the State.  While there is a constitutional right to information it is not stated what information should be provided.  The State must not facilitate the destruction of any life.  We, as legislators, are bound by the Constitution to have respect for human life.</P>
    <P>Last week Deputy Kemmy indicated the Government might be willing to concede on the question of an opt out or conscience clause although doctors had not sought one.  Have they been asked?  This is a human rights issue and both the mother and unborn child have an equal right to life.  On the question of infant mortality, Ireland had a good safety record; the figure is some 4 per cent higher than that in Great Britain due to the high standards of care of our medical profession.  Ninety-eight per cent of all abortions in Great Britain are carried out for social reasons or can be described as abortions of convenience while only 0.9 per cent fall within the category covered by the decision in the X case.</P>
    <P>I am proud that my party has a policy on abortion: it does not wish to see abortion made legal or abortion facilities made available in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is disturbing that over 4,000 Irish women travel to Great Britain each year for abortions.  Unless adequate finance is made available for counselling services to provide more assistance for pregnant women this alarming figure will increase.  Young women should be encouraged not to have abortions; rather they should be encouraged to have the child and put it up for adoption.  Many childless couples would be willing to give such babies a home.  This could be achieved through counselling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have spoken to doctors who are not willing to give the names and addresses of abortion clinics in Great Britain.  The legislation should be changed to allow them opt out.  A doctor informed me recently that a pregnant young woman attended his clinic to state that she would like to have an abortion.  After <Col N="491" /> she had been counselled over a period of three weeks she decided she would not have one.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is passed it will lead eventually to the legalisation of abortion as women will ask why they should have to go to Manchester, Birmingham or London and why abortions cannot be carried out here.  That will be the cry from now on.  It will be a sad day for the country.</P>
    <P>Some politicians have said that the bishops, members of the Pro-Life Movement and a particular High Court judge should not have spoken out about the Bill.  There is freedom of expression and if any bishop or any other person of any denomination wishes to voice their opinion they are perfectly entitled to do so.  Why should any politician criticise them for so doing?</P>
    <P>The amendment put to the people in the referendum in 1992 was not adequately explained.  A general election was held on the same day and the politicians were interested only in being elected.  The referendum should not have been held on the same day as it dealt with a separate issue.  There is a need for another referendum on the question of whether abortion should be made legal to which the answer should be yes or no.  That is what we should have, because if we had a referendum at some time in the future asking whether we want abortion in this country, the answer would be a resounding &ldquo;no&rdquo;. The provision of information is referral and referral leads to abortion, which is wrong.</P>
    <P>This country is at a crossroads.  The Bill provides for more than information; it provides for referral for abortion.  As far as I am concerned abortion is murder. I ask the politicians of all parties whether they believe they are doing the right thing, in passing this legislation.  A letter from one of my constituents, an SRN who worked in England for two years, asked me to stand up for the gift of life and not allow the scourge of abortion to come into our lovely country. That letter was from a woman who <Col N="492" /> worked in England and who saw the results of abortion there.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly about this Bill and I ask all Members of the House to reject it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I found the debate on this issue, both inside and outside this House, deeply depressing.  As we come to the end of the 20th century much of what has been said in this debate is more appropriate to 17th and 18th century attitudes to women than to what I would regard as the more enlightened and progressive approach I thought most groups in our society would have long since had.</P>
      <P>The hallmarks of this debate have not been tolerance, compassion or realism. The debate has clearly indicated that few people trust the judgment of women.  Indeed, the way this legislation was drafted leaves a lot to be desired.</P>
      <P>I want to contrast the attitude of the Government to the changes in the drink driving laws.  After two months in office the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, last night brought forward details of the changes he will make to legislation that only came into effect before Christmas.  I must be forgiven for being suspicious when I ask if the Minister, Deputy Howlin, would have put the same effort into bringing forward this legislation.  Of course, he would not and did not because for two years in the Department of Health he failed to put any proposals to the Government on this issue.  That aside, would the Minister, Deputy Howlin, or any other Minister bring in legislation where the group most affected was not consulted if it involved the construction industry, the farming community or the vintners? There are as many women leaving Ireland every year to have abortions as there are vintners in this country.  Yet, they were widely consulted and the Government's response to their concerns was rapid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The failure of this Minister to consult either the Council for the Status of Women or the Irish Family Planning Association indicates clearly, as the <Col N="493" /> Taoiseach said to me during Question Time some weeks ago, that when the Government was drawing up the Programme for Government, the absence of the provisions on equality was an oversight.  Women are overlooked.  They are under represented at key decision-making levels in our society from the Judiciary, to senior levels in the medical profession, in politics and in the public service.  What we see is what we have in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There has been occasions in the past when I found myself in a political party which took a decision on legislation of this type with which I profoundly disagreed. I am now in the happy position of leading a party which allows a free vote but, yet, I found it extremely difficult to come to a decision on this Bill and I will indicate the reasons later.  My vote this evening will be merely symbolic because the Bill is illiberal and seriously defective.  It is merely a litany of restrictions backed up by criminal sanctions.  In so far as the vote this evening is merely symbolic, I have decided to support the legislation after much thought and with great reluctance because I have come to the conclusion that I do not wish to align myself with some of the most reactionary, conservative and intolerant groups in our society. Defeat for this Bill, bad and all as it is, will send the wrong signals to the groups in our society who, for too long, have shown very little concern for women and the born and who seem to take the view that once a child is born, their interest in pro-life ceases.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the attitude of the Catholic Church to this legislation and to the comments of Bishop Magee who said that consideration would have to be given to excommunicating somebody from the Catholic Church who assisted, in any formal way, a person to procure an abortion.  That wise commentator, Dick Walsh, said on Saturday that in all the years of IRA atrocities, when some of the most heinous barbaric acts were committed by individuals both here and in Northern Ireland, he never once heard the Catholic Church contemplate <Col N="494" /> excommunicating those people from the Church.  Indeed, when that point was raised with the Church, it said such action would be counter productive.</P>
    <P>I have never once heard the Catholic Church speak out on men who abuse their children both physically and sexually. On the radio recently, Joe Duffy spoke to two people who talked about the dreadful physical, mental and sexual abuse perpetrated on them by their father over many years.  I have not heard anybody in the Catholic Church consider excommunicating such fathers.</P>
    <P>Will Bishop Magee, others who think like him, and priests who might consider not giving Holy Communion, re-examine, in a more considered and realistic way, their attitude to matters involving what is broadly called the sex agenda? We live in a country that is not perfect. The headline in this evening's <i>Evening Herald</i> concerns a 12 year old girl who is pregnant; she became pregnant when she was 11 years old.  That is the country in which we live and regardless of what laws we have on the Statute Book, there is little point in us pretending that that is not the case.</P>
    <P>When I listened to Deputies speak in this debate I wonder if they really live in the same country in which I live.  I wonder why they close their minds to the reality of Ireland in 1995.  People wonder why there is so much child sexual abuse and why these difficult cases now coming before the courts did not come to light before now.  People get away with child sexual abuse because society turns a blind eye, sweeps problems under the carpet and pretends they do not exist.  It is not any different with abortion than it is with rape, incest or any of that difficult agenda with which we have failed to deal.</P>
    <P>In relation to this Bill, it is worthwhile to examine the history of the family planning legislation.  This Bill, in time, will be a mere historical curiosity as the 1979 Irish solution to an Irish problem now is.  Since then, there have been many Bills until finally, in the past two years, we brought in comprehensive and progressive legislation.  I do not know <Col N="495" /> how long it will take but this Bill will also be a mere historical curiosity as far as the legislation is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am not one of those who believe Mr. Justice O'Hanlon should resign because when we appoint persons to the Judiciary, we do not require them to express their views in advance on this area or on public policy generally.  It is not a requirement for appointment to the Judiciary although it should be a requirement.  I favour the American system because, given the power vested in our Judiciary, it is a matter for the Supreme Court to interpret the Constitution. Indeed, the Supreme Court has given us some of the most liberal interpretations possible over the past 20 years.  It has been ahead of the Legislature in giving basic fundamental and personal rights to our citizens.  I favour an examination of the public policy position of members before they are appointed to senior judicial positions.  If we expect judges to interpret our laws and reflect the modern evolving Ireland, it is not right to appoint people whose minds are closed and who are extremely conservative.</P>
    <P>With regard to Mr. Justice O'Hanlon's remarks, to equate this legislation and this debate with the awful atrocity that was the Holocaust &mdash; perhaps the single worst example of the destruction of human life that has ever taken place in the history of mankind &mdash; was most unfortunate and very inappropriate.  If the judge had seriously thought about the issue I do not believe he could compare what is happening in this legislation with what happened during the Holocaust.  In so far as he has had the courage to express a view, forceful as it is, I welcome the fact that we know what that judge's view is.  For the rest of his time in judicial office, which I think is very short, he has obviously debarred himself from sitting on any case that could remotely deal with this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="496" /> In the context of this debate it is useful to examine why we find it necessary to have legislation of this kind.  It goes back to 1981 and 1982 when weak politicians, during the three elections in that 18-month period, gave a commitment to what is broadly called the pro-life group, and provisions were written into the Constitution.  It is those very provisions that allowed the Supreme Court to let Miss X leave the jurisdiction, to free her from the internment that this State had placed upon her.  In their judgment the Supreme Court said: &ldquo;If it is established as a matter of probability that there is a real and substantial risk to the life as distinct from the health of the mother, which can only be avoided by the termination of her pregnancy, such termination is permissible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The very clause that the pro-life movement wanted to guarantee that we would never have abortion because they did not trust the legislators in this House &mdash; the 1961 Act was not enough for them &mdash; allowed the Supreme Court to say that in cases where the probability is that a woman's life is at risk, then abortion is permissible.  Indeed, abortion is permissible in this State because they did not say that one had to leave the State in order to have an abortion.</P>
    <P>Because that interpretation has now been made and the Supreme Court has decided to adjudicate on the balance of rights between the mother and the unborn, Deputies in this House and others who supported that amendment in 1983 are not happy and they want another amendment.  I can do no better than to quote what Fr. Kevin Hegarty, the former editor of <i>Intercom,</i> had to say in last Sunday's <i>Sunday Tribune.</i>  He said: &ldquo;We cannot treat the Constitution as a slot machine which we play until we get the answer we want.&rdquo;  In other words, the Constitution cannot be used to insert provisions that would provide what a small, secretive, powerful and well-funded group wants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="497" /> That group has failed to accept the democratic wish expressed by the people in 1992.  In a democracy the people are sovereign.  The people expressed their view quite clearly in 1992 and there was no confusion about it.  The then minority Fianna Fáil Government recommended a yes vote on the three issues put before the people: the substantive issue, travel and information.  In relation to what was called the substantive issue, the people rejected the Government's recommendation by 65.4 per cent to 34.6 per cent. In relation to travel the result was 62 per cent in favour, and just 60 per cent in favour of information.  The people were well able to distinguish between the three issues.  They were able to say no to the first issue in approximately the same numbers as they said yes to the other two.  That does not indicate that there was any great confusion.  It was quite clear what the people were voting for and we have a duty on foot of that referendum to bring in legislation.  I welcome the Bill even though it is defective.</P>
    <P>It is important to reflect for a moment on what is often just a statistic in debates of this kind &mdash; the 13,000 women who have left Ireland since 1992 to have abortions in Britain.  We have a major abortion problem in Ireland.  One in 11 Irish pregnancies ends up in an abortion in Britain.  If Britain was as far away as the United State and if it cost £1,000 to get there, we would long since have brought in more realistic legislation to deal with our abortion problem. Because it is a conveniently short journey and relatively inexpensive to get there, we have allowed England to deal with our abortion crisis.</P>
    <P>It is depressing that those who shout loudest about pro-life and the right to life are those who end their interest as soon as the child is born.  I have yet to see them involved with young teenage women who have babies, who are homeless, unemployed, deserted by the father of the child, and perhaps with little support from their own family network. I have yet to see members of the <Col N="498" /> pro-life movement involved in campaigns to do something for those particularly vulnerable women that I often deal with.</P>
    <P>We should ask ourselves why so many women leave Ireland for abortions in Britain.  In my view it is a decision they make after much consideration but they obviously have to make that decision very quickly.  They make it because they believe they have no alternative.  Many of them are lonely or isolated, abandoned, neglected, afraid to tell their loved ones, their parents or even their friends.  The survey carried out by the Irish Family Planning Association showed that, among the small sample surveyed, at least one third of those who went never told anybody that they had made the journey.  They have a weekend off work, a couple of days holidays, they go off on their trip and come back again but get very little help from anybody in this society.</P>
    <P>We should be concerned about life and the plight of those women as opposed to the rhetoric that is heard every time we have a debate.  It reminds me of the debates on family planning which I read over the last few days. There was always this commitment to encouraging natural family planning and the Government was going to provide funds for the Billings method and so on.  That was said to make it look as if the Government was being conservative, reasonable and unbiased, but once the debate was over that was the end of that.</P>
    <P>It is much the same in relation to those women.  Why is it that we have never found out who goes and why they go?  Why have there been no surveys and why has nobody spoken to them? They are not a lobby, they do not ring up their politicians, they are not sending us letters.  They are a silent group in our society whose interests should be vocalised in this debate if we really care about life and the plight of our people. As many Irish women leave this country every year for an abortion in Britain as there are vintners in the whole jurisdiction, and we know the response to <Col N="499" /> the cause advocated by the vintners only recently.  It is a sad fact.</P>
    <P>I am not one who says that men should not comment about these things and I would like to think that I am not sexist or biased.  I appreciate enlightened debate with people putting forward their honest points of view.  What really appalls me is to hear people say one thing in this Chamber, which down the corridor or in the bar they tell you that they have not said.  If their young daughter was raped, was the victim or if her life was threatened, I wonder how many Deputies would not consider abortion as an option.  I really wonder how many Deputies could put their hands on their hearts and say that if they were the father of Miss X they would have insisted that she go through with the pregnancy and have the child. How many could honestly say that?  It is very easy to be judgmental when you are not faced with the problem that those lonely vulnerable Irish women are faced with.</P>
    <P>The Bill is extremely defective and very illiberal.  I want to quote what Proinsias De Rossa had to say on this matter &mdash; volume 424, column 451 of the Official Report.  He said, &ldquo;The mind set that sees the question of information solely on the basis of how it can be restricted rather than how it can be provided is starting from the wrong end of the spectrum.&rdquo;  I totally agree with him. Here we have a Bill in all its provisions that seeks to restrict information.  The whole basis of the Bill is to see how the legislation can restrict the giving of information.  In 1992 people sincerely believed that the result of voting for information meant that more information would be given and received.  I have no doubt about that.  Why is it that when it comes to providing information like telephone numbers there is a big hullabaloo about it?  I have telephone numbers here which are widely available in most post offices.  If you have the Northern Ireland yellow pages you can get all the telephone numbers you like. What happens on the ground does not <Col N="500" /> seem to matter to some Deputies who want the law to say that they cannot be available.  Once the law says it, it does not actually matter what the reality is. That is the sad thing about this whole debate.</P>
    <P>Most sophisticated people will not have any problem about giving or receiving information.  They will not need to ask somebody how they can have an abortion, they will just go off and make their arrangements.  I have to take issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Liz McManus, who said that women do not need to have their hands held.  Most women do not, but the young vulnerable women who are going to be affected by this legislation &mdash; people like Miss X or the 12 year old headlined in the <i>Evening Herald,</i> young children pregnant at that age &mdash; will not be able to make arrangements for themselves.</P>
    <P>Given the judgment in the X case and all the compassion that was released at that time when people in this State could not contemplate interning a 14 year old who had been raped, surely in a civilised society we should not be afraid to allow doctors in particular to make arrangements for young, vulnerable people of that age.</P>

      <P>Guidance is issued to members of the Garda Síochána to the effect that they should notify the victims of crime where a decision has been taken not to prosecute.  All law enforcing authorities are very sympathetic to and concerned about the plight of victims of crime and recognise they suffer not only physical and financial loss but also major psychological trauma.  Separate questions arise not simply with informing the victim of the decision, but also giving information on the reasons for a decision or entering into debate about it.  While this may not present a problem in the majority of cases, if it were to become the general practice major difficulties might arise.  I will give the Deputy an example.</P>
      <P>A person may be suspected of a particular offence and the prosecution hinges on the availability of one particular witness.  If that witness dies or leaves the country obviously the prosecution cannot proceed because they do not have the evidence &mdash; our law requires proof beyond reasonable doubt.  If that fact was published as the reason for non-prosecution, the accused person would have been convicted at the bar of public opinion by virtue of the fact that everybody would have been told that the person would have been convicted &mdash; that would be the implication &mdash; if the witness had not died or left the jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances an individual would have been convicted in public opinion without a trial.  That is contrary to the underlying principles of our system of justice which is that one is innocent until proven guilty.  For these reasons there are major considerations of public policy that preclude the entry to debate or the publication of reasons for not prosecuting in a particular case. If that was done on a general basis a whole range of problems and difficulties would arise on which I will elaborate if the Deputy wants more examples.  This is a matter I have looked into on a number of occasions and I am of the firm view that there should be no change.</P>

      <P>The example quoted by the Taoiseach is very much oriented in defence of the accused rather than in favour of the victim.  Surely the opposite side of the argument is that the DPP, by making an unreviewable decision not to prosecute, could be said to be prejudging the issue, to be judge and jury, since the decision is unreviewable, even privately. Will the Taoiseach agree, that, as Deputy Gay Mitchell said many times as Justice spokesperson in Opposition, an independent office need not compromise the desirability or necessity for some degree of accountability and answerability in the office of the DPP in terms of the prosecution of criminal charges?</P>

      <P>Our system of justice works on the principle that one is innocent until proven guilty.  One is entitled, unless proved by a court of justice to be guilty, to the integrity of one's reputation. To engage in a practice of publishing explanations of non-prosecution in particular cases would cast a slur on the reputation of an individual who had <Col N="504" /> not been convicted of a crime.  The fundamental principle of the common law system of justice is that one is innocent until proven guilty.  There are different systems in other countries, but that is our system, it is the right system and we should preserve it.  We should not dilute it simply to meet the sort of criticism that is inevitable.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach recall a parliamentary question I put to him some weeks ago, to which his reply was quite helpful, about the speed with which the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions deals with cases?  I gave as an example a case I referred as Minister for Transport five years ago in regard to Aer Lingus Holidays and I believe there are many other similar cases.</P>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach had an opportunity to reflect on whether he can put a mechanism in place &mdash; perhaps a regular list of cases with the DPP &mdash; which allows the public to see the stage a case is at at the DPP's office so that it does not vanish forever with no further account of it?  I know it is a difficult area and the Taoiseach gave an undertaking to look at it but has he had the opportunity to consider whether a mechanism could be put in place that permits the public to see the progress of cases or whether the DPP was pursuing them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with that suggestion as it is simply the publication of factual information on processing cases, in other words a factual progress report.  I would have no policy concern about that as it is different from publishing reasons for particular cases being dealt with while others are not.  The Director of Public Prosecutions is quite rightly independent in the exercise of his functions and all I can do is what I have done already, to draw <Col N="505" /> to his attention the Deputy's suggestion. I will draw it to his attention again and he will make a decision on whether it is helpful.  I can certainly see no problem with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that although the Garda have received guidelines on the entitlement of the victims of crime to be informed when no prosecution is being taken, they are not being observed and in no case &mdash; certainly no case that I have come across &mdash; have the victims been informed when a decision is taken not to prosecute?</P>
      <P>Does he further realise this is causing the victim and their families a great deal of anguish and that it could be resolved by a simple amendment to the 1974 Act which would put an obligation on the authorities to inform the victims and-or their families when a decision is taken not to prosecute?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A circular was issued on 8 December 1988 giving guidelines to members of the Garda Síochána telling them the victims should be informed when a decision has been taken about a case.  The Deputy was probably in a better position for some time than most Members to inquire why the Garda Síochána were not enforcing that circular, if that was the case.  I will inquire as to whether the Garda Síochána is abiding by this circular.  I have explained the good reasons that we cannot get involved in giving information on the reasons for non-prosecutions but, as the Deputy suggests, what he has referred to now is a different matter.  I see no problem with conveying that information and I would be very concerned to learn if the Garda Síochána are not respecting that.  I will make inquiries from the Garda Commissioner about the matter and communicate with Deputies O'Dea and O'Donnell who are genuinely interested in this matter although I disagree with Deputy O'Donnell's view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am genuinely interested <Col N="506" /> in this area.  Arising from the Taoiseach's replies he appears to have a major problem with the publication of the fact that the DPP will not pursue a prosecution, which he says should not be done because it may influence public opinion against him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>May I clarify what I said?</P>
      <P>I said I would have a problem with the publication of reasons for non-prosecution but I have no problem with the publication of the fact of non-prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Taoiseach there is a problem with the publication of reasons that a prosecution is not proceeding. However, in reply to a supplementary question from Deputy Brennan he suggested he had no problem with the publication of the fact that investigations were continuing in the DPPs office.  Does he not think that the same opprobrium might be brought on a prospective defendant by reason of the fact that when those investigations are completed there may well be no grounds for a prosecution?  Why does he differentiate?  Is a citizen not entitled to privacy until such time as proceedings are instituted before public opinion is allowed to decide, as he said, whether someone is innocent or guilty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a distinction to be drawn between the fact that a file has been referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions and saying where the file is and what is happening to it, whether it is completed.  That is simply factual information and is readily available under the guidelines already in force.  There is a distinction to be made between that and publishing reasons for a particular decision where one implicitly enters debate about the validity or otherwise of the reasons.  I do not think that is valid for the reasons I have explained in response to Deputy O'Donnell.  To give another example of the difficulties that could arise, the DPP could decide that a particular person is <Col N="507" /> not a good witness and is not prosecuting because he feels the witness would not stand up under cross-examination.  It would not be fair to the witness in question to publish that sort of fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>That should be up to the trial judge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because he may have committed no offence but the DPP may have decided that he would not stand up under cross-examination. These are reasons that one cannot have a general policy decision to publish reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the latter part of my question which relates to an accused person who manages to get an injunction to halt a prosecution, does it not offend the Taoiseach's sense of justice that an injunction could be obtained by an alleged paedophile to halt a prosecution and that the decision would not be appealed by the State on behalf of the victims?  That actually happened in a recent case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That could only have happened if the court agreed to it.  It seems we have two fundamental principles: (1)  that one is innocent until proven guilty, and (2)  that the courts are independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The State could have appealed that decision but did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe one should encroach on either of those areas.  As regards the State making an appeal, that is a matter for the State representatives to decide and in the case of the DPP he is statutorily independent to make that decision on a pragmatic basis. As I explained at great length to the Deputy if we get into a situation where, because of political pressure, we want every decision of the DPP explained he will no longer be independent of politics. We could return to the original situation because prosecutions were <Col N="508" /> decided ultimately by the Attorney General who is politically accountable as the adviser to the Government but for good reasons in the 1970s it was decided that the State prosecution service should be independent of politics. There are disadvantages to that such as the situation to which Deputy O'Donnell referred but there are also substantial advantages that one does not get into a situation where an accusation can be made that a person is not being prosecuted because of political connections or political popularity.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5, together.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at this stage to outline a time-frame for the commencement of all-party talks on the future of Northern Ireland, although I am hopeful that, with goodwill on all sides, we can make early progress in this regard. I believe that there now exists an unparalleled opportunity to build a future where the people of Northern Ireland can live their lives free from hatred, fear and mistrust; and that all the political parties, North and South, have a responsibility to seize the opportunity. That said, the Framework Document is no more an ultimatum than it is a blueprint to be imposed on unwilling people. The priority now, I believe, is to allow the political parties and the people they represent the time and space to reflect on the proposals which the British and Irish Governments have put before them and to consider their potential for securing lasting peace and stability.  In thinking matters through and in working towards a new accommodation, I would challenge all parties to seek the same balance, the same rethinking and the same radical reconciliation that the Governments have sought in the Joint Framework Document.</P>
      <P>I am, of course, ready at any time to meet any of the Northern Ireland political parties to explore with them their ideas on how best to move the situation forward and to discuss with them our ideas as set out in the Framework Document.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that progress be made on the question of arms.  In December the British Prime Minister and I agreed in Downing Street that substantial progress should be made on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach disturbed by the fact that the Secretary of <Col N="510" /> State, Sir Patrick Mayhew, is quoted a number of times in the United States as agreeing with his view that progress must be made on the decommissioning of arms before Sinn Fáin are admitted to talks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish and British Governments agreed that substantial progress should be made on this issue. It is important that it is made and to recognise that there is fear in communities which have been the victims of violence over many years about the availability of substantial quantities of arms which have no defensive purposes.  For example, Semtex is an offensive weapon. There is genuine concern about this issue on both sides of the community. Let us not forget the arms that were used in atrocities against Catholics in Northern Ireland.  Those arms are in commission just as much as those that may have been used by the Provisional IRA in the past.  The problem is not so much the stores of arms but the capacity to produce them at relatively short notice.  Even if all the arms were removed, once the capacity to produce more exists the problem is a real one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge everyone involved to address this problem in a spirit of compromise and look for a solution.  I am addressing my words to Sinn Féin, the loyalists organisations and the British Government. It is fair to say that the three pronged approach suggested by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the United States, as reported in this morning's newspapers, represents a serious statement of position by the British Government.  It deserves an equally serious response.  In all the contacts I have had my endeavours in this matter &mdash; this is true also of the Tánaiste and all Government representatives &mdash; were to try to bring the parties closer together on this very difficult issue.  I do not suggest this is an easy issue.  There is much negative symbolism involved but it is important that people make an effort to come closer together in their positions on this issue. It is not a minor question but neither is <Col N="511" /> it the only item on the agenda.  I would not wish to allow it dominate the agenda but it is an important item nonetheless.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Taoiseach's view that it is an important matter.  The amount of arms in the possession of those on all sides is a great worry.  Does the Taoiseach see it as a precondition to either side being involved in talks?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  We are talking about trying, by political means, to get people to deal with this issue seriously.  Obviously, access to Ministers is a means of leverage for getting progress on this issue.  The British Government want to exercise the maximum legitimate leverage to have the question of arms dealt with, not only from the point of view of its own prospective but from the point of view of the understandable prospective of those in the Unionist community who see themselves as having been victims of IRA violence over a long period.  Those prospectives cannot be ignored or swept aside.  It cannot be said that they do not count; they do count but so also do the concerns which are felt strongly in the Nationalist community about loyalist arms.  They, too, are legitimate concerns. If we can deal with arms on one side we will find a formula for dealing with them on the other.  Just as when the IRA ceasefire came into being it led to the loyalist ceasefire, if the question of arms is dealt with by one side it would have a benign effect on having it dealt with by the other side.  That is what the Government is working for in all its contacts.  I know we have the support of the House in endeavouring to deal with this seriously.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one option. One must be careful about complicating the issue by introducing new factors. The issue is very complicated at one level but very simple at another.  We must give political reassurance to people that these arms will be put in a condition where they cannot or will not be re-used.  The question of how exactly to deal with that is a difficult one.  The British Secretary for Northern Ireland divided the issue into three.  He referred to the issue of principle, the modalities and the symbolic issue.  There is room for serious discussion on the question of modalities.  I would like to see all sides make an effort to engage seriously on that issue.  I say to Sinn Féin, to the loyalist paramilitaries and those who represent them: &ldquo;please try to engage in serious business like dialogue particularly on the second of those issues so that we can see some kind of progress on the question&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I note that the Taoiseach stated there should be time for reflection before we enter into talks with the parties in the North.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that under the three strand talks process the talks between the Dublin Government and the Northern parties is a matter for the Dublin Government &mdash; the British Government not being involved in that process &mdash; and the bilateral talks held to date having been held under the remit of Mr. Michael Ancram?  Will the Taoiseach assure the House that, whenever he deems it appropriate to move, he and the Irish Government will do so, so that the British Government will be unable to break the rules under the three strand process, the proactive initiative being taken by the Irish Government?</P>

      <P>I did Deputy Jim Mitchell an injustice in that his question is relevant to No. 5, as is Deputy Bertie Ahern's, so I will deal with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe, in the case of Strand 2, there is room for the Irish Government to take the initiative to instigate bilateral talks.  Successive Governments here have kept clear of Strand 1 talks, accepting that was an internal Northern Ireland issue, but the Irish Government has a legitimate interest in Strand 2 and can initiate discussions if it wishes.  To come to Deputy Jim Mitchell's point, it <Col N="514" /> is really a matter of pragmatic judgment &mdash; there is no advantage in issuing invitations that will be rejected; there is a positive disadvantage in so doing, because you invite a rebuff which makes your position worse.  I have taken steps &mdash; this is true of the Tánaiste and others &mdash; to constantly inform myself of Unionist opinion by various means, to ensure that we understand the views of Unionist parties.  I would be delighted to meet Unionist parties at any time, in any place, where it would be useful and will continue to work towards circumstances in which that will happen.  Nonetheless, I do not see a lot of advantage &mdash; for that matter nor did my predecessor &mdash; in issuing formal invitations merely to be able to say one had done so, if there is not a real prospect that they will be responded to in the same formal and positive way.</P>

      <P>As I already indicated in the House, I am prepared, as part of an overall settlement, to introduce and support proposals for change in the Irish Constitution to implement the commitments contained in the Framework Document and in the Downing Street Joint Declaration.  I envisage that, in due course, the Government will consult the other political parties on the wording of such proposals.  However, for the time being the priority must be to communicate the principles set out in the Framework Document to the people of this island, North and South, with a view to winning their support for them.</P>

That being said, <Col N="515" /> the sooner we can reach agreement in this House on the wording of a possible change the better because my instinct tells me that we shall encounter some difficulty whenever we get around to dealing with this issue.  Will the Taoiseach agree that it would be important to begin the process before we get close to the stage at which we might have to put this matter to the people?</P>

      <P>Yes, this is a matter with which we should deal in good time, say, before we get anywhere near putting something to the people.  It is my firm hope to be able to initiate formal and informal discussions with the Opposition parties in very good time on the matter.  However, we are not nearly at that stage.  We must first get the parties engaged in dialogue on the Framework Document.  Only when they have essentially reached agreement, or reached a point at which they want to discuss the specifics of what we might do in terms of the precise wording in the Constitution, will we have to put forward specific wordings for discussion.  Well in advance of that stage being reached, obviously it would be appropriate for me to have discussions with the Opposition parties in the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>The Framework Document represents the shared understanding on the part of the Irish and British Governments on what might constitute an acceptable outcome from future political talks.  It is designed to give impetus, focus and direction to a process of three-strand negotiations towards a political agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have emphasised before, however, the document is a framework for discussion and not a blueprint to be imposed.  Both Governments believe that we have got right the complex of balances across the many core issues within and between the three relationships. At the same time, we are open to the ideas and arguments of anyone who believes otherwise.  In that spirit, I welcome the recent publication by the UUP of their policy document <i>A Practical Approach to Problem Solving in Northern Ireland</i> and the DUP <i>Formula for Political Progress.</i>  Both are contributions to the process of debate leading to negotiations and signal a willingness on the part of the parties concerned to engage in dialogue.  I have placed the two documents in the Oireachtas Library and I believe that, like the Framework Document, they deserve careful consideration, representing as <Col N="517" /> they do the views of the political representatives of a substantial majority of the Unionist community.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise, lest there be any doubt, that endorsement of the Framework Document would not be a precondition to entering talks about it, although, as with all political dialogue, it should be a precondition that people would be prepared to listen as well as talk.  I should add that I am greatly encouraged by a recent poll which showed that a majority of UUP and DUP supporters believe that their parties should take part in talks on the Framework Document.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is the same as that to Deputy Jim Mitchell's question &mdash; I do not see any point in making public statements about the issuance of invitations unless I was satisfied that those invitations would be accepted.  It is better to pursue a pattern of informal, private contacts.  The Deputy asked a question.  I answered but I am really not prepared to go any further than that.</P>

      <P>Was the Taoiseach encouraged by the statement on Friday evening last of Mr. John Taylor when, on behalf of the Ulster Unionist Party, <Col N="518" /> he said they would welcome talks with the Irish Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought that was a very significant and positive statement, showing a realistic appraisal of the position on the part of Mr. John Taylor.  Of course, it is a matter for the Unionist parties to come to conclusions on this issue.  I am absolutely convinced that it is in the interests of Unionists, and of unionism, that its representatives engage in constructive dialogue with other parties on this island and, of course, also with British political parties. Constructive dialogue is the way to solve problems.  In the Framework Document we are moving to a complete redefinition of the type of issue with which we are dealing, moving away from traditional concepts of territorial nationalism towards new ways of defining nationality, not mutually exclusive but mutually supportive, when it will not be a question of one flag or another but devising circumstances in which it will be possible for people, with different traditions and nationalities, to share the same land without either feeling lessened or less, in their integrity or that of their views.</P>
      <P>In the Framework Document we are moving towards a redefinition of the whole issue and it is worthwhile for Unionists to enter into discussions with other parties in that kind of atmosphere. It is possible for all sides to achieve positive gains here.  By redefining the problem we have moved it away from being a zero-sum game.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Taoiseach's view on the balance of the complex nature of the Framework Document.  The balance is right and it is vitally important that we encourage the Unionists to take part in talks.  Does the Taoiseach consider that at this stage it is necessary to be proactive rather than reactive regarding the talks and the Framework Document, particularly phases two and three?  Does he consider that rather than sending invitations we should make the effort to reach out to <Col N="519" /> the Unionists and all elements within society, if not directly the Unionist Party as a first step, at least some elements within Unionist society such as the business community or others in the North?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly agree with that view, that is what we should be doing.  The main question is how public one should be about one's proactivity. There are times when it is appropriate to be proactive in private rather than in public on the basis that more can be achieved in that way.  It is a question of political judgment as to where, when and how various approaches should be made.</P>

      <P>I am concerned about the Irish Government's tacit agreement with the position of the British Government, particularly the Northern Ireland Secretary of State when he equates with equal status the Framework Document and any document made available over the weekend prior to the publication of the Framework Document.  As head of the Irish Government will the Taoiseach indicate the status of the Framework Document <i>vis-à-vis</i> other party documents which were made available shortly before the publication of the Framework Document having regard to the fact that it represents an intergovernmental position and took two years to produce?</P>

    <Col N="520" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously an intergovernmental position has a status different from that of a party position. Nobody would suggest otherwise.  I certainly was not doing so.  It is very important, and I hope the Deputy would not suggest otherwise, that if Unionist parties go to the trouble of publishing a policy document, we in this House should read it, it should be lodged in the Dáil Library so that all Members of the House might read it and that we should treat the positive ideas in it with respect, which is what I did.  That is the right approach.  We are never going to reach the position where we will have dialogue with Unionists if we constantly remind ourselves that their documents are merely documents of a political party or parties whereas the Framework Document is a Government document.  Their documents may be only documents from a political party, but they are documents from a political party or parties which represent a large number of people and their views must be taken into account if we are to solve the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach speaks of respect but he does not have to lecture me about respecting other traditions on this island.  Does he believe that the Northern Ireland Secretary of State equated respect to the Framework Document when on the night of its publication he suggested to a Unionist audience that in the event of their not liking any of it, they should not be concerned and that whatever they brought forward themselves would do?  He said that on television.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the approach we should adopt in this matter. We should be looking at the positive dimension of any statements made <Col N="521" /> whether by the Unionist community, the Nationalist parties, Sinn Féin or others. There are many positive ideas in the Framework Document.  It addresses very difficult questions which all parties in different respects at various times have avoided.  They are now on the table put there by two sovereign Governments.  Any documents published subsequently by other parties will have to address the issues the two Governments have put on the table. That is a major step forward and that is what I mean when I say that the Framework Document is a challenge.  We must also give the other parties involved the self confidence to come forward with their ideas and the recognition that their ideas may have validity just as much as there is validity in the Government's ideas.  That is what I am trying to do, it is the balance I am trying to strike.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there has been some discussion about the development of a co-ordinated Unionist response to the Framework Document. However, the fact remains that an agreed settlement will require accommodation between the two traditions rather than consolidation within either. To that end, there is no meaningful long term alternative to a comprehensive <Col N="523" /> process of dialogue involving representatives from the Unionist and Nationalist traditions.  I, and indeed many others, have been using every appropriate opportunity to communicate that message to both communities.  The reaction of the people in Northern Ireland to the Framework Document, as borne out in opinion polls, strongly points to a widespread public understanding there of the need for compromise on all sides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

In his daily contacts with the Unionist community will he impress on them the need for their participation in all-party talks rather than for them to separate into one particular body?  Will the Taoiseach accept that it is only when we sit across the table, eyeball to eyeball with people who hold opposite views, that we will realise whether people on both sides are prepared to compromise?</P>

It is very easy and reassuring to enter into dialogue with people with whom we are already in agreement. That is why it is important that we try, as we did with some, but not with enormous success, to widen the representation at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation so that it would not be seen as a body simply consisting of Nationalists.  We need to be challenged in our views just as much as Unionists need to be challenged in theirs.  It would not be appropriate for me to tell the Unionist community what arrangements they should make.  If they want to participate they are entirely free to do so and we will be happy to talk with them through any channel they discern is in their interest.

I <Col N="525" /> would like to know whether the review into the office of the Attorney General, which did not find it necessary to include the recommendation that the post of Attorney General ought to be full time, or the commitment in the programme for Government will take precedence in the future?  The public would be interested to know whether reviews carried out from time to time could be used as a stalking horse to allow for a U-turn given that they may recommend something contrary to that contained in the programme for Government.  In that case what would take precedence?</P>

      <P>The programme for Government, which represents an agreement between three parties on this question, would take precedence.  It is the view of the parties in Government that the Attorney General should be full time subject only to the requirement that he or she maintain his or her status as a practising barrister.  There is no question of that being changed by any internal reviews, audits or examinations.</P>

      <Quest>his views on whether a reasonable fee scheme should be among the issues requiring further consideration as part of the restructuring of the Attorney General's Office to ensure that the huge fees paid to barristers, such as during the Beef Tribunal, will not need to be paid by the taxpayer again.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of a reasonable fee scheme is entirely separate from the restructuring of the Attorney General's Office, which is designed to improve the effectiveness of that office.  It must be appreciated that if the State is to be properly represented in any action, it is required to secure the services of advocates in an environment where there is competition for those same services.  Any fees agreed by the Attorney General cannot be set in isolation from this basic fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach consider that fees of the scale paid in the beef tribunal were necessary?  Is it necessary to pay fees of that scale to achieve the standards we all desire in carrying out such an important role? Will the Taoiseach offer an opinion on whether we should look at ways of avoiding the payment of exorbitant fees when we do not have to consider a tribunal? When such an occasion arises that is the last issue on people's minds, particularly those party to the dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Guidelines have been prepared in regard to the appointment <Col N="527" /> of counsel for tribunals in future.  One of the guidelines is that where a daily charge is an element in the rate or method of remuneration of the barrister an open ended daily fee structure should be avoided.  There should be a process for renegotiation of the fee if the work tends to be of a longer duration in terms of days than originally anticipated.  With the benefit of hindsight one could say that was the mistake made in the tribunal, which lasted much longer than expected.  It is probable that the State should have renegotiated its fees downwards to take account of the fact that the duration would be longer than originally planned.  That lesson has been learned and the guidelines deal with that situation.  We are speaking here with the glorious benefit of hindsight.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="529" /> The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs will be leading the Government's delegation to the Investment Conference on Ireland which is to be held in Washington on 24-26 May next. This is in line with the wishes of the US organisers of the conference that governmental delegations should be led at less than Head of Government level, in order to avoid any possible shift away from the conference's economic focus to more political matters.  I might add that, in the same spirit of respecting this preference, the British Government delegation will be led by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland rather than the Prime Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach is aware there was some confusion in reply to a written question some weeks ago when we understood the Taoiseach would attend the Washington Conference and it was stated that the Tánaiste would be leading the conference.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that he will not attend the conference?  In view of so many opportunities for industrialists and the country in the presence of President Clinton there would be a strong case for a Government delegation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The conference should not be dominated by State ceremony as it is mainly designed to enable 700-800 US firms to network with 300-400 delegates from this side who are <Col N="530" /> engaged in business.  I hope the conference will lead to investment and equity stakes being taken by American companies in Irish companies.  It is very important that the Irish and American delegations are made up of people in a position to put business deals together, and not people looking for funding and grants.  I would like to see an Irish delegation made up of people who want to find a partner with whom they can do business which is mutually beneficial and which will lead to job creation.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs who will attend the conference will underline the political support of the Government for this process and its appreciation of President Clinton's initiative in putting it in place.  The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, who has a functional responsibility in this area, will also be present.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>As I outlined in my reply to question No. 1 on 2 February last, the law allows all local authorities to decide, at their absolute discretion, whether to levy charges for services and to determine the scale of such charges and the arrangements for their collection.  The policy agreement <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, recognising the feeling of inequity about service charges, provides for the introduction of a special tax allowance for those who can show that they have paid their service charges on time.  Details of this measure were announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement.  I am at present examining, in line with the commitment in <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> the powers of local authorities to disconnect domestic water supplies for non-payment of charges and I will communicate with local authorities on the matter as soon as possible.</P>

The Minister said local authorities have absolute discretion on whether to levy charges and to determine the scale of such charges.  Will he withdraw the instruction issued by the officials in his Department that there should not be disconnections until the changes are made in <Col N="534" /> the laws as this is causing confusion among local authorities who do not know whether they can disconnect services? They do not know the official policy on this issue and in the meantime they are losing revenue.</P>

On the last occasion I took questions I dealt with this issue under the first priority question and nothing has changed since then.  I reiterated the points I made then to the regional authority in the southeast. No instructions along the lines suggested by the Deputy were issued by my Department and the position outlined in the detailed response I gave to supplementaries on the last occasion I answered questions is still the same.</P>

      <P>I am also anxious to accommodate them.  The Minister does not seem to have heard what I said. Council officials who have 'phoned the Department have been told not to disconnect supplies.  I want to correct a point he made.  On the last occasion he took questions he did not say that only those residents who are able to pay charges should continue to receive a service. This is new information.  Is it Government policy that water supplies should not be disconnected in cases where people have refused to pay the charges until the legislation is passed or can local authorities disconnect supplies if they so wish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities have the power to disconnect supplies to people who have refused to pay charges. I made this clear on the last occasion I answered questions.  My response to <Col N="535" /> detailed questioning by the south-eastern regional authority encapsulates the essence of Government policy, that is charges are levied at the absolute discretion of local authorities, the individual householder who is faced with the charge is required to pay it and if they are not in a position to pay they should be given a waiver.  In no circumstances should a person who cannot pay a charge be disconnected.  The question of disconnection should arise only where a person who is in a position to pay refuses to do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 48 together.</P>
      <P>The review of the drink driving provisions of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, has now been completed and I have decided, with the approval of the Government, to propose amendments to the Act to introduce graded penalties for drink driving offences.  A new Road Traffic Bill to give effect to the changes will be published as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The amendments agreed by the Government will involve changes to the disqualification requirements which apply to drink driving offences.  These will include different minimum periods of disqualification to be determined by the level of alcohol in the driver's blood or urine.  It is not intended to propose any changes to the blood alcohol limit of 80 milligrames which, in common with a number of states, is the highest in the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In summary, the proposed minimum disqualification periods are for a blood alcohol level of 81 to 100 milligrams, <Col N="536" /> three months for a first offence, and six months for a second; for a blood alcohol level of 101 to 150 milligrams, one year for a first offence, and two years for a second; and for a blood alcohol level of 150 milligrams or more, for a &ldquo;refusal&rdquo; offence, and for the old &ldquo;drunk driving&rdquo; offence, two years for a first offence, and four years for a second.</P>
    <P>The changes which have been decided on should not be interpreted as a licence to drink and drive.  The Government is committed to a firm course of action to secure the maximum level of safety for road users.  The measures proposed are designed to link the penalty to the severity of the offence, not to give comfort or succour to the drunken driver. They will provide the basis for effective and ongoing enforcement of our anti-drink driving policies into the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister supplied me last night with most of the information in this reply, he should have done the House the courtesy of waiting until today to make his announcement. This side of the House supports the Government's view that there should be no place for drink driving in this country. Does the Minister accept that many people will consider yesterday's announcement a row back on a previous Government decision and that it will send wrong signals to the public?  To many it will appear that the Government has gone soft on the drink driving issue.  Will the Minister comment on that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the issue of discourtesy, the Deputy is aware the Government meets on a Tuesday and I felt it necessary to make the announcement as soon as possible after the Government made its decision.  This was common practice when the Deputy and I shared a Cabinet table and I did not intend to be discourteous to any Member of the House.  In fact, I ensured that the Deputy and the spokesperson for the Progressive Democrats were notified of the details of the changes in advance of a public announcement. <Col N="537" /> In the context of a row back on this issue, I stated clearly at the outset of my re-evaluation of the Road Traffic Act that the fundamentals of the Smith Bill would be preserved, namely, the new limit of 80 milligrams and the genuine tough approach to drink driving which command public support.  The one issue which I said would be, and was, subject to review was that of grading penalties, an issue which the former Minister, Deputy Smith, considered reviewing.  I believe the people will support and regard as fair a system where the penalty fits the crime, where the more one drinks the greater the penalty one faces. Under existing law, when one reaches the 80 milligram limit the same penalty applies, regardless of the amount of alcohol consumed.  That is bad policy and I am glad to be in a position to recommend changes in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>My comment to the Minister related to his discourtesy to the House.  I acknowledged his courtesy to me and to the spokesperson for the Progressive Democrats.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that the six months suspension for a person caught a second time driving with an alcohol level of between 81 and 100 milligrams will send out wrong signals? I accept that the penalties should be graded but does the Minister not agree that the penalty for a second or third offence should be much more severe than a first offence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The guidelines I put forward are minimum.  It will be open to judges to evaluate the evidence given to them and to impose a more severe penalty if they think fit.  If the details of a case warrant it, a judge can impose a ban from driving for five or ten years or even for life.  It has, however, been the practice that the minimum penalty set out in the law is the one generally imposed by judges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can discuss the details of the Bill when it comes before the House, but I wish to make one further point.  A disqualification from driving for less than <Col N="538" /> a year cannot be petitioned during the course of that year whereas disqualification for more than a year can.  A penalty of one year can be reduced to six months, whereas a penalty of three months is three months and a penalty of six months is six months.  I did not want to propose grading which could overlap, in other words, where a person could be disqualified from driving for one year but get the licence back in six months while at the same time a person disqualified for six months must face the full penalty.  That technicality can be teased out when the Bill comes before the House.  I have put forward my best shot at a fair and tough regime and I will consider amendments from the Opposition during the debate on the Bill.</P>

      <Quest>in view of the fact that bus exhaust emissions are a serious contribution to air pollution in our cities, the regulations, if any, that are in place in line with our European obligations under Directive 93/59/EEC, to introduce measures against air pollution by motor vehicle emissions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Directive 93/59/EEC has been implemented in Ireland by the European Communities (Mechanically Propelled Vehicle Emission Control) Regulations, 1994.  The regulations prohibit the issue on or after 1 October 1994 of the first licence for a car, light commercial vehicle or small bus unless the licence application is accompanied by a declaration from the vehicle manufacturer or authorised agent that a certificate of conformity with the emission standards of the directive has been issued for the vehicle.  These emission standards cover nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, total hydrocarbons and in the case of diesel engined vehicles, smoke.  Details of the standards are set <Col N="539" /> out in a tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Directive 93/59/EEC does not apply to buses which can carry more than eight passengers.  Such vehicles, with heavy goods vehicles, are subject to the provisions of the European Communities (Mechanically Propelled Vehicle Emission Control) Regulations, 1993, which implemented Directive <Col N="540" /> 91/452/EEC with effect from 1 January 1994.</P>
    <P>I intend shortly to make regulations to implement Directive 94/12/EC which lays down revised emission standards for passenger cars with effect from 1 January 1997.  Ireland has strongly supported EU efforts to improve vehicle standards with a view to reducing air pollution, and we will continue to do this.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I have so little time remaining, now that the Minister is present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My vote in favour of this Bill is merely symbolic because it is defective, illiberal and unworkable and, in many respects, it may be unconstitutional. Deputy Shatter voiced concern about <Col N="623" /> this earlier.  The only constitutional interpretation given so far on the amendments to the Constitution on information and travel were given by Mrs. Justice Denham in the Well Woman case in July 1993.  She held that in regard to the right to travel a person was entitled to assistance to exercise that right.  She said that assistance given to a person exercising the right to travel is part and parcel of that right.  She went on to emphasise that such assistance would &ldquo;particularly for economically and socially deprived persons be absolutely essential in order to enable them to exercise their right&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, my view that the provisions of this Bill which prohibit a doctor or a counsellor from making any arrangements in relation to the person to whom they have provided information, may well be found to be unconstitutional. Even if it is not, the Bill interferes in an unsatisfactory way with the private and confidential relationship between doctor and patient.  When faced with a patient, such as Miss X, whose health and life are in danger a doctor will not be able to make arrangements which are in her best interests.  It is grossly unfair to make this a criminal offence and to subject the doctor to a fine of up to £1,500 and possibly erasure from the medical register.  My party will be tabling amendments to ensure that nothing in the Bill interferes with the private and confidential relationship between doctor and patient.  I seek an assurance from the Minister that he will accept amendments in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill also prohibits in an unsatisfactory way freedom of information. Although we were told in 1992 that this legislation would provide for non-directive counselling in one direction only.  It is stated in the guide to the regulations circulated by the Minister that the Bill does not preclude a doctor or agency, in the context of giving abortion information and information on other available options, from encouraging the <Col N="624" /> woman concerned not to have an abortion. A doctor or counsellor may encourage in one direction only; this constitutes directive counselling.</P>
    <P>This Bill will provide those in society who seem to be so intent on going down the road of litigation time and again with an opportunity to entrap those who are providing information.  According to the Bill, this must be true and objective but in whose terms?  Names and addresses are to be found in the Yellow Pages for Northern Ireland which is available in most major post offices here.</P>
    <P>The Bill is not open or transparent.  I am voting for it as a symbolic gesture as I could not bring myself to vote against it and join with those forces who are so reactionary, intolerant, lacking in understanding of the plight of the Irish women and not prepared to allow them exercise their judgment, lacking in compassion and realism.  I am not, however, voting for it with any great enthusiasm and my party will try to amend and improve it to ensure that it is workable and in compliance with constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has produced a Bill which is more than can be said for his predecessor. However, I regret that he did not consult with the groups most affected and who have expressed concern: the Irish Family Planning Association and the Council for the Status of Women.  If this Bill dealt with agriculture, the construction industry or the licensing laws, I could not imagine any Minister not consulting with the groups with the greatest interest.</P>
    <P>Each time this issue has been debated it has led to division.  Doctors in favour of the amendment, doctors against the amendment, handicapped persons in favour, handicapped persons against, teachers, nurses and so on all contributed. It is an extremely divisive issue and I do not believe with the passing of this legislation that the problem will go away.  I fear that this saga will run for many years as happened in the case of family planning legislation.  Perhaps <Col N="625" /> after ten to 15 years we will finally have on the Statute Book legislation that is compassionate and realistic and which deals with the Irish abortion problem. The reality in modern day Ireland is that one in 11 Irish pregnancies end in abortion in Britain and we are not tackling that in this Bill.</P>

      <P>Long before programmes such as &ldquo;Fair City&rdquo; dealt with the issue of abortion in soap opera depth there was a radio soap opera called &ldquo;The Kennedys of Castlerosse&rdquo;. The funny thing about that programme was that if one turned on the radio at lunchtime having been away for a month it was as if one had not been away.  Since the Bill was introduced it has been a bit like &ldquo;The Kennedys of Castlerosse&rdquo;, tuning into an episode of Irish life that happened ten years ago but nothing has changed: the lines are still the same, the same current affairs programmes are running with the same people saying the same things.  It is a bit like the slogan for the cosmetics that my life-partner buys from the Body Shop: re-use, re-fill and re-cycle.  It is also like watching the film &ldquo;The Sound of Music&rdquo; on television at Christmas time &mdash; one can say the lines before the actors do.  There is ideological fog everywhere.</P>
      <P>I was not great at geography at school but I remember learning about how a thick fog results when a belt of warm air meets a belt of cold air over the Irish Sea.  A belt of pro-life wind has met a belt of pro-choice wind over the people and the result is a feeling of <i>déjà vu</i> and thick fog.  I do not think that fog is a great accompaniment to the process of developing the <i>corpus</i> of Irish law, particularly on such a sensitive and important issue as this.  We would be better served by clarity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night I asked myself what are the matters on which I am clear.  I discovered that I am clear on many: that the Irish people are not stupid or totally hypocritical; that it is the job of legislators to legislate; that the Minister for <Col N="626" /> Health does not want to see more abortions and that those who are compassionately against abortion have the absolute right &mdash; even duty &mdash; to work to reduce the number of abortions. When I realised that I was clear on all these things it was a great relief.</P>
    <P>Let me consider first the question of the stupidity or intelligence of the people.  During the past 20 years they have been picking their way through a minefield of change with remarkable intelligence, maturity and fairmindedness, not to mention tolerance.  If I look around this House I see living testament to the tolerance, not to say sense of humour, of the electorate.  Michael D, Michael McDowell, Jim McDaid and I are here, as is Paddy Harte except when he goes somewhere else.</P>
    <P>In every constituency the electorate chooses a wonderful complexity of representation for its parliamentary process and in every election it cuts through the claims and counterclaims, polls and promises, debates and disasters and elects a set of people that does not conform to any narrow pattern.  Now and again, circumstances conspire against the people and they end up with a rainbow coalition that they never asked for. I take full responsibility for that and promise that I will not be in South Africa the next time there is a Government crisis.</P>
    <P>It is not just in elections that the electorate makes sophisticated and civilised decisions.  It makes equally sophisticated and civilised decisions in referenda.  It did so in the referenda on travel and information when it did not give a simple yes or no answer but rather voted in a clever and complex way.  Some people are revisiting that decision and saying: &ldquo;The Irish people do not know what information is; what they really meant was that it was OK for someone to tell another how abortion happens but it was not OK for people to get hold of any of the details about where abortion happens&rdquo;.  When I hear this line of argument I have to admire the persistence and cleverality of those advancing it but <Col N="627" /> it is ludicrous and insulting to the intelligence of the electorate who cast their votes at the time.</P>
    <P>This Bill is about the provision of information and it has been designed, cut and trimmed to fit into the space created by the people when they voted in the referendum.  They were not voting for the right to hear more detailed descriptions of what happens during an abortion and we should not insult them by saying that they were.</P>
    <P>I decided something else last night. The Irish people are not totally hypocritical. I am not saying individuals do not have a little bit of hypocrisy in them; they do.  It is like eating a balanced diet &mdash; everybody needs a little idealism, cynicism, enthusiasm, laziness, moderation, excess &mdash; a great deal of honesty and a little bit of hypocrisy.  It is the mix of all of those that keeps one right but as a nation we are remarkably short on hypocrisy, even on this issue.</P>
    <P>The reaction of people to the X case was not hypocritical.  It was one of honest outrage and shock.  People of all generations, in all parts of the country, looked at that case and said: &ldquo;We may not approve of abortion &mdash; in fact a majority do not approve of abortion &mdash; but we do not want injunctions taken against 14 year old victims of statutory rape.  We do not want Ireland turned into a police State where you have to prove you are not pregnant before you are allowed to get on a boat or a plane&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>By their votes in the ensuing referendum the people decided they did not want ridiculous obstacles put in the way of people trying to obtain an address or a telephone number because they knew well that if those people went into the GPO and looked at British telephone books, they could find that information instantly.  What is hypocritical about any of that?  It would be absolutely hypocritical to suggest that in the Ireland of the 1990s, with Irish people travelling the world for study, work and leisure and tapping into the Internet and CompuServe, one could create a censorship <Col N="628" /> of information with flying squads of censors picking up leaflets, blacking out small advertisements in magazines and tearing out pages of telephone books.</P>
    <P>The people of Ireland are not idiots. They knew what they were voting for in the referendum, namely, information on services legally available in another State.  Do people seriously believe that the voters thought they were supporting a constitutional right to British Airways flight information or to read the Egon Ronay guide to London restaurants? The electorate decided against that kind of hypocritical idiocy and this Bill follows through on their decision.</P>
    <P>This legislation arose out of the X case when the people, in their compassion, were justly horrified at the use of Article 40 of the Constitution to imprison a young, pregnant rape victim in this country.  The Government moved, through the 1992 referendum, to continue the law on abortion in this State but to remove any barriers to women who want to avail of it abroad. That may be hypocritical but it is also compassionate.  We must accept and deal with the ambivalence of our attitude to this problem.</P>
    <P>Through this legislation we are assisting women, in the narrowest sense, to have abortions.  The Government is playing fast and loose with the English language by claiming that giving names and addresses is not referral or that this legislation will not assist women to have abortions.  Like it or not, that is what the people voted for.  Perhaps many members of my party are horrified and shamed by this fact but the results of the referenda speak for themselves.  We cannot re-write history.</P>
    <P>There is division among all parties in this House on this issue.  There is division in my party, as is plainly obvious, on the front and on the back benches. As Deputy Harney recalled this morning, I more than anybody else criticised the fact that Fianna Fáil had to speak with one voice.  I did not like that restriction but we can hardly criticise the leader of a party who gives everyone in that party the opportunity to speak in <Col N="629" /> any way they wish.  I take it as a grave offence to the paragons of political correctness &mdash; a subject dear to my heart in the recent past &mdash; that someone who has done that, namely, Deputy Bertie Ahern, is pilloried for so doing.  I have been on the losing side of arguments more often in my party than any other person.  I had company in this regard when Deputy Harney was a member of the party but she has long since gone.</P>
    <P>The facts of the last referendum are interesting.  A partner of mine, who is a very logical person and not given to histrionics always says when an argument is getting heated: &ldquo;We had better ignore the facts anyway&rdquo;, and most people do.  The outcome of the last referendum was decided in the quietness of people's homes.  I doubt if any politician from any side of this House mentioned the referendum when they were at the doorsteps looking for votes.  He or she was more interested in getting elected to this House.  The people made their decisions in their own way.  They did not have to be bullied by anybody. Over 65 per cent of them voted in the referendum; 13 per cent voted against travel, 40 per cent voted against the provision of any information and the majority voted against the substantive issue as we had recommended.</P>
    <P>They are the facts but many people inside and outside this House are trying to re-write history.  We cannot do that, but we must remember that there is a substantial number of people who are against the provision of information or the right to travel and there is little point in turning a blind eye to that.  I am not one of those people and I do not believe the majority of people in this House hold that view either.</P>
    <P>In addressing this minimalist legislation we should respect the intelligence and the sophistication of the electorate and not try to re-interpret that into something black and white, fundamentalist and hypocritical.  Instead of dancing to the tune of extremists on either side who want to re-interpret the decision of the Irish people, we in Dáil Éireann should do what the electorate <Col N="630" /> put us here to do, namely, legislate.  We put the issue to the people and they told us what they wanted.</P>
    <P>This Bill fills in the details, as closely as possible, in regard to what the people said they wanted.  The initials &ldquo;TD&rdquo; after our names indicate we are here to pass, reject or amend the Bill.  We are not here to postpone it and we cannot hide behind judges' wigs.  If the people wanted to be ruled by the courts they would have told us that a long time ago but they have not done so.  They go out in the wet and the cold during election times and put their folded bit of paper into the ballot boxes.  Those bits of paper are a form of contracts for TDs which allow us to come into this House and legislate.  I have not seen any clause in that contract that says: &ldquo;Only legislate when there is no alternative or when the courts have made it safe to legislate.  Only legislate after this issue has been for years in the judicial system&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I do not go along with any of the demands &mdash; some of them repeated in an advertisement in this morning's newspapers &mdash; that we put off doing our job until the judges have made it safe for us to do so.  There is an advertisement in this morning's newspapers, paid for by the pro-life movement, urging us to do that.</P>
    <P>There is another article in this morning's newspapers which is a true but tragic story.  Somewhere in Cork today there is an 11 year old girl who is pregnant by a 51 year old man.  This child is not 14 &mdash; the age of the girl in the X case &mdash; but 11 years old.  That is the headline in today's <i>The Star</i> newspaper. I quote from the newspaper: &ldquo;An 11 year old girl, who is now pregnant, had sex with a 51 year old man, a court was told yesterday.  The man obviously cannot be named for legal reasons&rdquo;.  That happened in the Ireland of today.</P>
    <P>I wish to put a question, particularly to the male Members of this House and those with young children.  How would they react if they were the father or mother of that young girl?  As a person not afraid to take a gamble, I would say <Col N="631" /> 98 per cent of all the Members of this House would at least consider the option of abortion.  I am quite certain those who say they are pro-life, and vehemently so, would do the very same.</P>
    <P>No one at any meeting at which I have been for the past few weeks has mentioned this issue at all.  In case I was out of touch with the people of Kildare, I attended two Fianna Fáil meetings last night at which there were question and answer sessions.  All types of things were asked but nobody asked about this. Before I left I asked one person about the abortion information Bill.  I knew he had very strong views on the subject which he raised in the past and I respect his views as a person of very sound intelligence.  He said, &ldquo;Yes, Charlie, I would be very much against this and I am glad the party is voting against it&rdquo;. When I asked why he had not made much of it, he said, &ldquo;I am afraid to, and most people are too, because the situation could visit anyone.  That is what I have learned in the past ten years with a family growing up&rdquo;.  That is what is happening in Ireland today and there is no point in closing our eyes to it.</P>
    <P>Regarding this 11 year old child in Cork, I do not want to discuss any of the sad options open to that child and to her parents.  All I want is to point out that real life does not go into hibernation to allow the judicial system to come to conclusions in its own good time.  The judicial system will come to conclusions in its own good time but real life and real crisis pregnancies do not stop.  There is no freeze-frame to allow us to postpone our duty.</P>
    <P>That sense of a duty to be done rather than to be postponed is probably the only thing that will ever unite the current Minister for Health and me.  For the last few days I have been watching him keeping Dermot Gleesons's words closer to his chest than a scapular.  Now, many people think the Minister is a fierce &ldquo;cute hoor&rdquo; altogether, but I have my doubts.  If I was strong in the &ldquo;cute hoor&rdquo; department I would not have <Col N="632" /> been in South Africa when people were having crisis meetings in the dark&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Instead he has brought in legislation which is exactly in line with his political history.  The Minister for Health has never been a leaping liberal.  Will this legislation lead to more <Col N="634" /> abortions?  I honestly do not think so.  If one is desperate enough one will always find the information on where to have an abortion in a British telephone book or scribbled on the wall of a toilet, but it will not come together with data on safety and cost or counselling on all the options.  It is surely better that the family doctor gives the information having taken the time to counsel one in detail and before one makes one's decision.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that counselling properly available would reduce the numbers of Irish women going for abortions. I do not know if that is true.  Only time and research will tell.  I know, however, that any woman in a crisis pregnancy, whether she is 14 or 44, should be helped to deal with it in the light of the best professional assistance.</P>
      <P>It is simply nonsense to say that the provision of information is, <i>ipso facto,</i> referral.  All sorts of elective procedures may these days be chosen by a patient who will then seek information, and names and addresses, from their general practitioners.  At the most trivial level, for example, someone may decide to get a face-lift.  The doctor may think this is a waste of time and money but may provide the name of a plastic surgeon.  It is up to the patient to ring up and make an appointment.  The doctor is certainly not promoting the procedure, but simply providing the name of someone he believes will perform a procedure safely, if the patient insists on that procedure, as opposed to making the patient play lotto through the newspaper advertisements.</P>
      <P>Making it unequivocally legal for a doctor or counsellor to provide names and addresses at the end of a counselling session will not multiply the number of women who go to have abortions, nor will it reduce the number.  To suggest that it will make a huge difference is unreasonable but it allows people who are vehemently against abortion to feel they fought the good fight against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one is against abortion one should do one's level best to reduce the numbers of women who feel they have no <Col N="635" /> choice but to have an abortion.  One should not allow oneself believe that opposing this Bill will reduce those numbers.  It will not and it cannot.  This Bill is neither heroic nor visionary.  It is just cautiously obedient to the will of the people.</P>

      <P>Members of this House have two primary responsibilities: to enact laws in the public interest and to represent their constituents.  It is not always easy to do both at the same time as there is usually no mechanism for accurately determining the views of the people on a particular issue.  On the issue before us today this problem does not arise.  The people expressed their views in 1992 and it is our duty to put those views into law.  The people voted in 1992 for the freedom to obtain or make available information relating to services lawfully available in another state.  This Bill is the minimum required to put that into effect.</P>
      <P>This Bill is an exercise in democracy; the direct expression of the will of the people in the law of the land, but it is also more than that, it is an exercise in tolerance, concern and compassion.  It is a recognition that human problems and specifically, in this instance, the problems faced by women, are not soluble by abstract constitutional and legal theories nor by absolutist dogmas but by practical care and compassion and, ultimately, by respect for the conscientious decision of the individual faced with a difficult decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the benefit of those both inside and outside the House whose memory of events seems to be deliberately defective, let me go through the sequence of events which has brought us to the current situation.  The original amendment <Col N="636" /> on abortion was passed in 1983.  Subsequently, in 1988 the Supreme Court ruled that, in the light of the 1983 amendment, the dissemination of information on abortion such as the names and addresses of foreign abortion clinics was contrary to the Constitution.  The case was brought to the European Court of Human Rights which ruled that Ireland was in breach of Article 10 of the Convention on Human Rights which deals with freedom of expression and the right to receive and impart information. In the light of these events the 1992 amendment on information was put before the people.</P>
    <P>The 1992 information amendment specifically limited the operation of the substantive abortion clause to ensure that information would be freely available. That is the decision taken by the people in the full knowledge of what was at stake.  I would remind the House that the then Minister for Health, Dr. John O'Connell, in a Government of which Deputy Ahern was a member, gave a categorical assurance on television that the passage of the referendum meant that names and addresses of clinics would be supplied.  He answered &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the specific question.</P>
    <P>The argument put forward by the pro-life campaign that the public did not understand what they were voting for in 1992 is self-serving and patronising.  I was not happy that the public voted against divorce in 1986 but I accept that the people knew what they were voting for.  The 1992 information amendment was passed in the light of the European Court of Human Rights ruling which was concerned with matters such as the provision of information on names, addresses, phone numbers and methods of communication.  The public were aware of the issues in the case and, while the explanatory material produced by the then Government had no force of law, it did accurately describe the intent of the amendment and it is that intent which is being put into law by this Bill.  The material which the then <Col N="637" /> Government issued before the referendum specifically said that the legislation resulting from this amendment would permit a doctor or advice agency to give a pregnant woman information on abortion services available elsewhere. This Bill is fulfilling that commitment.</P>
    <P>PLAC campaigned strongly against the 1992 information amendment &mdash; it is now saying that it involved no change in the law and that it was declaratory of the existing law.  If it involved no change why did it campaign so much against it? Its leaflets at the time recognised that the amendment provided for the giving of names addresses etc.  It argued that it should not be passed precisely because it allowed for the giving of names and addresses.  It is now turning its own words on their head and, because it does not like the democratic choice of the people, wants that choice to be ignored. Its suggestion that the public did not understand is patently false and absurd. Maybe it and others will now realise that referenda and legislation are not the way to deal with difficult issues. What we need is an overall approach which allows for information, counselling and support but which ultimately respects the individual's decision.</P>
    <P>We have had four referenda on the subject of abortion in recent years. These have done nothing to prevent abortion; they have done nothing to improve the situation of the woman facing a lonely dilemma.  These referenda were not about the problems of women and children &mdash; they were about alleged absolute principles, not about practical realities.  The abortion wars were fought by proponents of different social views. The casualties were generally people not directly involved in the wars, the women who fought their lonely private battles without the benefit of counselling or information.  Women with crisis pregnancies have voted with their feet and will continue to do so.  Unlike the opponents of this Bill, they do not articulate their needs in public.</P>
    <P>We have to recognise that as legislators there are considerable limits to <Col N="638" /> what we can actually achieve.  We can outlaw the provision of abortion services in this country &mdash; this has been the case for more than a hundred years &mdash; but we cannot actively prevent women having abortions in other countries.  We can try to pretend that we do not have abortion in this country, but that is only true in strictly geographical terms.  We have an abortion problem.  We are now trying to accept this and to do something about it.  We cannot prevent women travelling abroad for abortions but we can, however, provide services which reduce the likelihood of crisis pregnancies occurring.  We can provide services which reduce the trauma for women who are considering an abortion, services for women who choose not to have an abortion and for those who choose otherwise.  Information is an essential component of all of these services.</P>
    <P>The people who oppose the provision of information on abortion are the same people who, over the years, have tried to prevent the various measures which help women and children.  I heard a very esteemed man refer to what he might have done had he been active in the 1930s.  They opposed the introduction of children's allowances, adoption, health services for mothers and children, social welfare payments for mothers, contraception &mdash; in short they objected to all the progressive social legislation that has improved the lot of women, especially those with children.</P>
    <P>It is notable how much energy has been used by conservative forces over the years to try to prevent legislation and schemes which are progressive for women and children.</P>
    <P>In 1944 there was sustained opposition to the introduction of children's allowances &mdash; I see people smile, and it is worthy of a smile.  This opposition used conservative Catholic social dogma for all it was worth.  It is now widely accepted that the children's allowance, now child benefit is the single most effective weapon against poverty in families?  State support for income maintenance provisions is now entirely <Col N="639" /> accepted as part of Catholic social dogma.  In 1944 the people opposed to this measure believe it interfered with the family, but times change.</P>
    <P>In the late 1940s the mother and child scheme was opposed by the same people.  In the early 1950s opposition to adoption legislation and to health services for mothers and children was based on a theory of the rights of the family not to be interfered with by the State.  Adoption is now the option favoured by many people as an alternative to abortion and I am not aware that there is any opposition to the principle of adoption, even though it is not an option now exercised very often.  &ldquo;Interference&rdquo; which provided an income for mothers and ensured a minimum level of health care was undesirable.  Contraception was immoral.  We had a 20 year debate about contraception before the matter was finally dealt with.</P>
    <P>The constant theme of the arguments was that women in particular should be kept in ignorance and should not have access to their own financial resources. Women were not to be trusted with information or money.  The remnants of those arguments underlie the opposition to this Bill.  Women cannot be allowed access to information because they might use it badly &mdash; they cannot be trusted to use it well and they certainly cannot be trusted to know the difference. These same people are opposed to comprehensive family planning services and to sex education in schools.  They want to foster a climate of ignorance where decisions are made out of fear. We want a climate of information where choices are real and clear.  I have every confidence that choices based on information, understanding and good counselling will be good choices.</P>
    <P>The right to information is a right of principle.  It is also a practical provision. Information on abortion services is already widely available.  It is provided in magazines, telephone directories and other sources.  Surely it is better that this information is provided by authoritative <Col N="640" /> sources, by doctors and trained counsellors who can present it in a factual non-directive way.  I hope we do not return to the position that existed when I was a member of Dublin County Council and I had to fight against libraries who removed books on women's general health, from puberty to menopause, because they contained information and descriptions of abortion.  Standard reference books were removed from libraries throughout the country and Easons also removed them from its premises.</P>
    <P>Since 1983 we have had a history of censorship and prohibition of information. This did not reduce the number of abortions &mdash; in fact the numbers have increased steadily at a time when the birth rate is falling, so the proportions are higher than ever.  Censorship and prohibition have always failed in their objectives.</P>
    <P>Ireland is a party to the European Convention on Human Rights.  One of its articles relates to the right to freedom of expression and the right to receive and impart information.  This Government in its Programme for <i>A Government of Renewal</i> places considerable emphasis on the right to information generally and on improving information services.  We want to foster an open and tolerant society.  This cannot be achieved by prohibitions on information.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been criticised for not doing various things, for example, not providing for counselling services.  The Bill deals with information; it cannot deal with all the issues arising.  The Minister for Health in his speech dealt with the provision of services.  The health strategy addresses issues such as family planning services.  The Minister referred to other appropriate services in his speech, in particular to proposals for research into abortion.  This Government is trying to deal with this issue in all its facets, not simply by blanket prohibition but by a wider approach to the provision of services, the availability of information and the promotion of tolerance. We are not promoting an abortion culture.  We are promoting an open, <Col N="641" /> information culture, a culture in which individuals will be encouraged to make decisions based on full information, a culture in which those decisions will not be the subject of the wrath of other people but will be recognised as valid decisions for the individual in question.</P>
    <P>A number of people have referred to the possibility of having an opt-out clause for doctors.  I have no great objection to this but it would be purely a cosmetic exercise.  No doctor is obliged to give information about abortion under this Bill.  The Bill allows doctors to give such information but, as always when dealing with the doctor-patient relationship, it does not oblige doctors to give particular information. There is no necessity for a specific opt-out clause for doctors.</P>
    <P>Calls continue to be made for another referendum on the issue of abortion. We must surely have learned by now that issues such as abortion are far too complex to be dealt with in this way. Life would be simpler if there were absolutes and, indeed, I envy people who have absolute unwavering beliefs but life is not simple and we have to deal with it in all its complexities.</P>
    <P>This House is charged with the task of making laws.  We cannot be influenced in that by those who clamour loudest.  As I said, women with crisis pregnancies do not shout and scream; perhaps they should.  Perhaps all of the people who are opposing this legislation should go and talk to such women.  Better still, they should listen to them.  I do not subscribe to the view that this is an issue that should be dealt with only by women.  I do, however, think that the public discussion should focus somewhat on the responsibilities of men. Very often the reason a woman has a crisis pregnancy is because a man is not prepared to take responsibility.  All of the discussion and debate on this issue over the past 12 years does not seem to have significantly improved this situation. Perhaps the opponents of the Bill could use some of their very considerable persuasion tactics to persuade men <Col N="642" /> that they have responsibilities not just to society at large but to individual women.</P>
    <P>This is International Womens' Day. In many ways rather than addressing the women of Ireland we should be addressing the 4,000 men who must have had a relationship with the 4,000 women who travelled to England and, perhaps, we should encourage those men to face up to their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil made the point that they did not have access during the lifetime of the previous Government to the Bill. My understanding is that Deputy Woods, when he took over as Minister for Health, sought and received the file on this issue from the Department of Health and I understand that he had the file for sufficient time to indicate he would have made his usual comprehensive and detailed examination of all material under his control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and commend the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, for his speedy introduction of it.  Reading the Bill closely one wonders what all the brouhaha is about as it is rather tame.  It is peppered with apologies, there is a prohibition on referral, on advocacy, on promotion, on advertising and doctors and counsellors are made criminally liable if they make an appointment for someone they have treated or counselled.  It is by no means the rip-roaring Bill that provides for the promotion of abortion.</P>
      <P>It is a minimalist Bill in the context of the constitutional amendment passed in 1992.  I am appalled at the unseemly wriggling and twisting in the Fianna Fail Party which adopted one position in Government but a totally different one in Opposition.  That is improper and unseemly for a party that represents the largest number of Deputies in this House.  Deputy McCreevy stated his personal position and that he was in favour of this legislation.</P>
      <P>Article 40.3.3º of the Constitution states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due <Col N="643" /> regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.</P>
    <P>The amendment to that Article is extremely specific and arises directly from it.</P>
    <P>This subsection shall not limit freedom to travel between the State and another State.</P>
    <P>This subsection shall not limit the freedom to obtain or make available in the State subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law, information relating to services lawfully available in another State.</P>
    <P>What we are doing is regulating what is already lawful under our Constitution and what we are bound to do by the provision is to lay down in law the circumstances under which the information will be made available.</P>
    <P>In the past we have shrouded in secrecy the problem of crisis pregnancy, shunned the problems arising from unwanted pregnancies and stigmatised people in that situation.  Above all, the issue has been surrounded by ignorance. This has caused fear and panic as there is nothing worse than ignorance where somebody has to take a lonely journey to England or some other destination. We must destigmatise the 70,000-80,000 women whom we estimate have had an abortion.  They are Irish citizens and we must no longer reject them but nurture them as they have suffered enough already.</P>
    <P>This country has had narrow insular dreams because of its historic traditions. We have looked longingly at the fourth green field without regard to the harsh reality of one million Unionists on this island.  Now, at last we are beginning to address that.  Parallel to this we have had the Catholic dogma of an island unsullied by social problems related to sexuality and relationships such as divorce, contraception, homosexuality and abortion.  Our position is to a large <Col N="644" /> extent determined by our history but its effect is that we have become anti-woman. We must face up to that and redress the imbalance it has created.  We must create a pluralist society.  We must stand by the Republic and by democracy, and by the 60-40 decision on the amendment to the Constitution.  We must ensure that we are never again brow-beaten by dogma or ideology.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party spokesperson on Health, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, described this as a difficult issue and said it was difficult to do justice to everyone concerned. Nevertheless, as per the 1992 referendum we are duty bound to legislate for this information, not, I might add, as hastily as the Government has decided to run with the issue.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party has been accused in the past week of fudging the issue, of playing politics with it and of being hypocritical in not addressing the issue as it would have done had it been in Government.  I reject all those criticisms. Fianna Fáil said that while in Opposition &mdash; remember we are in Opposition on our own and we are not tied to any other party &mdash; it would be objective and that is exactly what the party is doing on this occasion.  The Fianna Fail Party does not run away from issues, nevertheless the issue of abortion information deserves due consideration and assessment.  That is what we are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this were a Bill dealing with financial, agricultural or other matters pertaining to Government policy we would be expected to give it due consideration and to suggest amendments, as required.  However, have we not even a greater right to look more seriously at this legislation to assess its ramifications and the potential it may have for the life <Col N="645" /> and death of the unborn whose constitutional rights are written into our constitution? That is why Fianna Fáil, which represents all strands in society, takes the Bill seriously.  One might look at the Bill from various aspects &mdash; professional, political, constitutional and socio-ethical.  The professional view held by most doctors, nurses and paramedics in this country is that they do not want abortion or to be associated with anything, information or otherwise, that could be construed as leading to assisting social abortion, even in other jurisdictions. It does not make sense to guarantee the rights of the unborn in the Constitution and, in the next breath, bring in provisions to facilitate social abortion even by default.</P>
    <P>Information should be directed towards favouring the continuation of pregnancy and reducing the number of Irish women having abortions abroad. We should not hive off our problems on general practitioners, counsellors, obstetricians and gynaecologists.  That is why Fianna Fáil seek the insertion of an opt-out conscience clause in the Bill.</P>
    <P>It does not make sense for paediatricians, especially neonatologists working tirelessly to look after pre-term babies of low birth rate to make sure they survive without any gross disabilities, and at the same time see people going abroad for social abortions at advanced gestational periods.  Something is very wrong and that is why our efforts should be directed towards eliminating the abortion trail.</P>
    <P>From the political point of view, Fianna Fáil is not aligning itself to any extreme views.  We have not been over-judgmental on the issue and recognise there are various strands of opinion.  We empathise with those in traumatic social and psychological situations as a result of crisis pregnancies.  Nevertheless, we must put down a marker on the issue. Crisis pregnancy mainly refers to pregnancy beset by social and psychological problems, not problems associated with obstetrics <i>per se.</i>  Fianna Fáil contends that the Government should put in place counselling services, aid for <Col N="646" /> women who find themselves in traumatic circumstances and for lone parents, education about pregnancy, etc.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Moffatt for allowing me some of his time.  My views on this are well known from articles and interviews I have given during the week.  I made my views known at the parliamentary party meeting.</P>
      <P>I do not have any real problems with the Bill but, in accordance with the party line, I will vote against it tonight. Before anyone else says it, let me say I am a hypocrite.  Many Deputies, most of them male, are genuine in their views on this matter.  I am not alone in my hypocrisy.  Whether we like it or not, intimidation is alive and well and probably working.  That is a matter which must be brought out in the House.  I know that many of my colleagues have been intimidated over the past number of weeks.</P>
      <P>I take pains to point out that I am not a pro-abortionist or what a number of people have said about me: &ldquo;boys and girls you sent to extermination camps&rdquo;; &ldquo;you passed a death sentence on these trusting little human beings&rdquo;; &ldquo;you were not meant to heal, you were meant to kill&rdquo;; &ldquo;you were not meant to protect life, you were meant to destroy&rdquo;; &ldquo;you are evil, a murderer, you have Satan behind you&rdquo;; &ldquo;Lucifer was a bright angel and you are his successor&rdquo;; &ldquo;the curse of Cromwell be on you&rdquo;; &ldquo;after death comes the judgment, after your death comes your judgment&rdquo;; &ldquo;we will picket your home, we will boycott your practice, money is your God&rdquo;.  The last of these was sent to me in an Oireachtas envelope.  As I said, intimidation is alive and well but I will not bow to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is International Womens' Day. A number of male Deputies have spoken.  The most heinous sexual crimes against women and girls have been committed in cases such as the Fr. Brendan Smyth case, the Kilkenny incest case and the case in Galway which we read about recently where a 51 year old father sexually abused his son and two daughters.  We heard that another priest <Col N="647" /> was sentenced yesterday and Deputy McCreevy mentioned the case of an 11 year old girl who became pregnant by a 51 year old man.  In Tipperary recently a blunt object was used to procure a miscarriage in a teenage girl.  There is only one common denominator among all those cases, the perpetrators are men.  This is something we must look at because we are not paying attention to it.</P>
    <P>In fairness, the positive aspects of the Bill will probably reduce the number of women seeking abortions but we are inclined to look at one, small, narrow aspect of it.  The relationship between doctor and patient will be made a criminal act if we go along certain lines.  As a doctor, I would find great difficulty if, having advised a pregnant girl and asked her to talk to her husband, parents, clergyman, neighbours or whoever and she still insisted on terminating her pregnancy, I had to say to her I was sorry I could no longer help but there is a boat at Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill is the correct one and that with the amendments we will get it right this time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The act of abortion is the wilful and premeditated destruction of the unborn child within its mother's womb.  No matter how one tries to sanitise this act in terms such as &ldquo;termination&rdquo; or &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; it is a violent and brutal procedure against a totally defenceless unborn infant.</P>
      <P>Before embarking down the road of legalising such behaviour, no matter how preliminary the proposals before us, each of us must remember that we were in the same dependent and totally unprotected state at the outset of our existence.  No matter what one's religious beliefs it is extremely difficult to understand how anyone can justify the act of abortion.  It is a total rejection of life at its most vulnerable period of existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill does not come before us as a proposal for dealing with a situation which may arise some time in the future. <Col N="648" /> The most recently available figures tragically illustrate that abortion is a reality each day for 12 or so Irish women.  Since research on the subject of abortion is almost non-existent in this country we can only guess at the reasons women have for going through with an abortion.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt that a small minority of such pregnancies arise from horrible incidents such as rape and incest.  Consideration of the plight of such victims makes a most convincing case for allowing minimal abortion facilities in a modern society.  However, it must be asked if there is a moral basis for developing laws in response to exceptional rather than normal behaviour. Similarly, a certain number of unwanted pregnancies arise as a consequence of immaturity and inexperience in terms of physical relationships.  Again, only the most hard-hearted could fail to understand the trauma caused in such circumstances by an unwanted pregnancy.  At a time when a girl is attempting to assert herself as a young adult, with all its associated pressures, an unwanted pregnancy must seem a disastrous development. If the girl is without substantial family support the difficulties posed by the pregnancy must be almost impossible to face.  Despite these examples of unwanted pregnancies, it would be extremely dishonest to ignore the fact that an increasing number of cases of abortion must involve irresponsible behaviour to one degree or another on the part of the woman, man, or both parties.</P>
    <P>It is not very long since we legalised the availability of contraceptives here, at which time the line adopted by those strongly in favour of their availability was that the widespread availability of a comprehensive range of such devices and medication would remove the need for abortion.  At that time also an increasing number of Irish women were seen to be availing of such facilities in Britain.  Has the legislation of contraceptives resulted in a dramatic fall in the numbers of Irish women travelling to <Col N="649" /> England for abortion?  Sadly, the answer is quite the opposite.</P>
    <P>The only conclusion that can be drawn from these trends is that increasingly abortion is seen as a readily available option of last resort in the avoidance of unwanted pregnancy.  If that be the case one must also ask where this change in the pattern of human sexual behaviour will end.  A simple truth would appear to be conveniently overlooked by those strongly in favour of this Bill &mdash; the fact that abortion is a criminal offence here.  Despite that, the provisions of this Bill propose to legalise the availability of information which, in certain instances, would be certain to result in women travelling abroad to avail of services totally illegal here.  How hypocritical can one become?  The simple, underlying message of such people is that they conveniently want to pass the buck in the case of abortion.  While not wishing to be seen to directly condone the act of abortion, they are only too willing to facilitate its process by passing it over neatly to the services of a neighbouring country.  While this lack of consistency and honesty sometimes may stem from genuine compassion for an individual woman with an unwanted pregnancy, in other cases it arises from the overriding need to be perceived as liberal on social issues.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the effect of this Bill, if enacted, will be twofold.  First, it will result in an almost immediate and significant increase in the rate of referrals to United Kingdom abortion clinics.  Can anybody seriously argue that the provisions of this Bill will be totally impossible to police?  The second and more far-reaching effect will be to open the door to a major, final, push towards legalising abortion in this country within a few short years.  If we accept the legality of providing an environment for referral, eventually it will be seen as logical that we complete the loop in this matter.</P>
    <P>I must re-emphasise the importance and difficulty of this issue of abortion. Anybody who contends that the matter is clear-cut and simple is not being <Col N="650" /> truthful.  To date those in favour of the Bill have failed totally to demonstrate how its provisions will result in anything other than a continuous increase in the rate of abortions among Irish women.  It is estimated at present that one in every 20 families has been directly affected by abortion.  There is nothing in this Bill which would help to reverse this tide of misery.  On the other hand, those of us who strongly oppose any development which encourages abortion also have a grave responsibility in this matter.  It is not sufficient simply to oppose this Bill, it is crucial also that we forcefully encourage at least three necessary developments, the first that significantly increased resources must be invested to ensure that our young people are fully informed on all aspects of human sexuality because, without such education, there is enormous potential for hurt and damage, especially in the case of those in their early teens and young adult years.  Second, we must ensure the easy availability of professionally-trained, well-advertised services to all young women with unexpected, unplanned pregnancies.</P>
    <P>Lastly there is urgent need to promote well-designed and executed research projects into the reasons for the high level of abortion among Irish women because, without the latter, it is totally unacceptable that we should embark on the road of legislative change in this area.  While not doubting the Minister's sincerity in this matter, the Bill is ill-advised and, if enacted, will bring the days of legalised abortion here dramatically closer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>This legislation is required as a result of the 1992 constitutional amendment which established the freedom to obtain or provide information on abortion services abroad. The then Government made it clear that such information included the names and addresses of foreign abortion services; the Pro-Life Campaign itself also confirmed this, and argued for a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote on that basis.  We must respect the <Col N="651" /> democratic decision of the people.  In any case the Government is advised that, because of the information amendment, the Bill would be unconstitutional if it attempted to prohibit the furnishing of names, addresses and telephone numbers of clinics or hospitals where such services are provided.</P>
      <P>Indeed, I quote from the Government Information Publication &ldquo;Key Questions and Answers&rdquo; which was distributed to every household in the country prior to the people voting in the three referenda on the right to life, travel and information on 25 November 1992.  In the case of the information amendment the question was asked &ldquo;What conditions will be laid down by law?&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In response, the Government said that the legislation would permit a doctor or an advice agency to give a pregnant woman information on abortion services available elsewhere provided that counselling was given on all the alternative options open to her.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the sincerity of those who argued against the Bill but they have missed its essential point.  The Bill does not establish the freedom to give names and addresses &mdash; this was already done by the 1992 amendment.</P>
      <P>They have advanced the argument that the information referred to in the amendment was general or non-specific, in a neutral or objective context. However, this argument does not stand up to scrutiny because the people were free to impart general or non-specific information prior to the amendment.</P>
      <P>Therefore, logically the amendment must have provided for additional information from that which was already legally available.  It is the opinion of the present Attorney General &mdash; and of the Attorney General in 1993 &mdash; that this is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to impose conditions on the exercise of the freedom of information to the extent that this can be done without infringing the Constitution, to support the Government's overall policy of reducing the <Col N="652" /> number of women who have recourse to abortion.</P>
    <P>Those who seek to suggest that the people who passed the referendum by a majority of 60 per cent to 40 per cent were in some way confused or did not know exactly what they were voting on can hardly expect to be taken seriously, especially when we consider the fact that the then Minister for Health, Dr. John O'Connell, confirmed on television in direct response to a question that information did include names and addresses.</P>
    <P>In the absence of this Bill, abortion information, including names, addresses and telephone numbers, can already be given to a woman with a crisis pregnancy, without any counselling or information about the other options available to her, such as fostering, adoption and the support services available if she chooses to keep her baby.  When the Bill is passed, all the counselling and information about the other options will have to be given and I am satisfied that this will help to prevent abortions which would otherwise have taken place.</P>
    <P>Efforts are being made to demonise this Bill which does no more or less than implement the will of the people as expressed in the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.  Some would even allege that the Regulation of Information (Services outside State for Termination of Pregnancies) Bill, 1995, is in some way introducing abortion to this country.  This is suimply untrue and has no basis in fact.  So let us focus on the real rather than the imagined in our dealing with this Bill.</P>
    <P>Against the background of the majority of Irish women travelling to the United Kingdom for abortions, not having received any counselling before travelling, and that a considerable number of women decide against abortion where counselling is received, there is at least a <i>prima facie</i> case to suggest that the wider availability of counselling would significantly reduce the number of abortions obtained by Irish women.</P>
    <P>One study of Irish women who are contemplating abortion found that after <Col N="653" /> counselling, 14 per cent changed their minds and continued with the pregnancy. Other research involving general practitioners who provide counselling suggests that the numbers who change their minds and decide to continue with the pregnancy could be as high as 25 per cent.  Research in New Zealand suggests that counselling results in 15 per cent of women who had decided on termination pre counselling changing their minds and continuing with pregnancy post counselling.  If counselling resulted in 10 per cent of Irish women deciding to continue with the pregnancy instead of opting for abortion, based on 1993 figures that would result in 439 fewer women having abortions.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises the importance of counselling for women with crisis pregnancies and the Department of Health has already instigated contacts with the Irish College of General Practitioners in an effort to ensure that pregnancy counselling is provided through family doctors.  However, it is intended that counselling services in addition to those provided by family doctors, will, continue to be provided by the many voluntary agencies.  The Government is also committed to the development of a comprehensive family planning service.</P>
    <P>In association with the Bill we are committing very substantial funding to pregnancy counselling services, including those provided by agencies such as CURA, Cherish and LIFE.  We are also commissioning a major research project to find out more about the factors which cause Irish women to consider abortion so that we can develop educational and other policies to address these factors. The trebling of the resources being provided by the State for counselling services from £70,000 to £200,000 as announced by the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, in his Second Stage speech is an important step in this direction.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health will commission a major study to identify the factors which contribute to the incidence of unwanted pregnancy and those <Col N="654" /> factors which result in the option of abortion.  The information to be collected will consist of basic demographic data such as age, geographic location, marital status, number of children, level of education, knowledge of reproduction and contraception used, if any; factors influencing decision regarding pregnancy, for example social factors, financial reasons, job, education and medical reasons.  It is proposed not just to look at women who have had abortions but also women with crisis pregnancies who decide to continue with the pregnancy and to consider those factors which influence their decision.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to look at a variety of sources, for example, the agencies providing pregnancy advice and counselling, general practitioners, social workers and hospitals.  With regard to women who have had abortions, it is intended that the research will involve data collection at the UK clinics and possibly via the agencies and general practitioners in Ireland who provide abortion information, post abortion counselling and check ups.  These proposals will have to be firmed up and discussed with trained research staff experienced in this field.  Education programmes will be based largely on the finding of this research.  Once the factors have been identified, policies will be put in place to try to reduce recourse to abortion and encourage women with crisis pregnancies to look at other options.  The debate so far has tended to concentrate on women although that has changed somewhat this afternoon.  The responsibility of men in what are termed crisis pregnancies had been in the main overlooked. How many women have felt that there was no alternative to abortion because of the lack of support, both financial and emotional, from their partners? How many young girls have felt coerced into having an abortion through a lack of parental support and understanding?</P>
    <P>When we talk about education, we are not just talking about educating women &mdash; we are talking about educating men to accept their responsibilities. <Col N="655" /> We are talking about educating parents to provide the support and understanding that these girls need.</P>
    <P>It also means educating society to treat those who are pregnant and contemplating abortion with the compassion, support and understanding they need and deserve.</P>
    <P>I believe that any person who looks objectively at the Bill and at the Government's overall policy in this area will see that we are committed to reducing the numbers who opt for abortion. The Bill will play its part in this by ensuring that women in crisis pregnancies are helped to understand that abortion is not their only option.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately when emotive issues, such as abortion, are debated there is a tendency for extremist views on both sides of the fence to be put forward.  The best contribution we in this House can make is to ensure that the debate on this issue is balanced and reasonable.  I am aware that many people believe abortion should be freely available here, but that is not the majority view.  People who hold that view represent a small section of our people.  There are manipulators on the other side of the fence who are misleading decent people around the country with extreme fundamentalist views. They would have us believe that this issue before the House is a simplistic one to which there is a black or white answer.  That is not the proper approach to adopt on this Bill.  Some people will tell us that, in conscience, this Bill must be rejected and will produce all types of false and misleading arguments for that purpose.  Our job is to ensure that those false and misleading arguments are confronted. It is no harm to confront this issue on the level of conscience if that is the basis on which it needs to be confronted. Anybody who genuinely wants to deal with the reality of abortion in our society today could not oppose this Bill.  If the issue of conscience is to be injected into the debate, I ask those who <Col N="656" /> genuinely want to examine their conscience how they can oppose the Bill.</P>
      <P>I will outline why this Bill should not be opposed.  Essentially the Bill provides for a series of conditions and prohibitions on the existing constitutional right to abortion information.  That right was established by the people in the 1992 referendum.  I remember reading a book about the Second World War entitled &ldquo;<i>The Great Lie</i>&rdquo;.  The principle behind the book was that the more one repeats a lie the greater the chance people will accept it as being the truth. It is our job to ensure that the great lie does not apply in this House.  Those who write or say that abortion is being promoted because of this Bill are not telling the truth.  Those who write or say that the liberty to give names, addresses and telephone numbers of clinics in the UK will be directly introduced as a result of the passing of this Bill are not telling the truth.  It is time that was confronted and those people were told the position clearly and calmly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill introduces various conditions and prohibitions on the right established by the people in the 1992 referendum.  There is a specific condition that any information given must be in a form and manner which does not advocate or promote the termination of pregnancy.  Furthermore, there is a specific provision that any such information must be accompanied by counselling and advice on all the courses of action open to a pregnant woman other than the termination of pregnancy.  How does that promote abortion?  Surely anybody who genuinely wants to deal with the reality of abortion favours that type of provision.  The approach established in the Bill is a major advance on the present reality.  No amount of rhetoric can obscure the reality that more than 350 girls and women travel to the UK for abortions every month.  That figure is based on those who give Irish addresses and does not take account of those who stay with a friend or relative in the UK and use those addresses. Most of those unfortunate girls and women travel by boat or plane without <Col N="657" /> the benefit of any advice or counselling. They have no difficulty in securing information as to where they can have an abortion.  They can procure that information immediately on arriving in the UK and can obtain it in post offices here by checking the telephone numbers and addresses of clinics in the UK telephone directory and the yellow pages.</P>
    <P>Let us not fool ourselves about the reality.  The real benefit of this Bill is that many of these girls and women will be encouraged to go to doctors or advice centres for information and counselling.  Evidence from other countries suggests that those who go for information and counselling may adopt options other than abortion in regard to their pregnancy, leading to a saving of unborn babies.  Surely that is an approach worth supporting.</P>
    <P>I have listened to and read what has been said by those who oppose the Bill. Much of the rhetoric appears to be unrelated to either fact or reality.  I challenge those who introduced the issue of conscience in regard to this Bill, and say to them that if they genuinely want to reduce the incidence of abortion or to restrain the increase in numbers of girls and women who go to the UK for abortions, they must support this Bill.</P>
    <P>The question of the Constitution has been raised.  How can any person who believes in democracy ignore the amendment to the Constitution which was passed by the people in 1992?  The first line of attack on the Bill is to ignore this constitutional reality.  That has been very effectively dealt with by the Attorney General.  All Members received letters, as I did, indicating that the right to names, addresses and telephone numbers is being introduced under this Bill.  That is not true, that was the consequence of the amendment to the Constitution.  That fact has been confirmed by the Attorney General, a confirmation which was also the opinion of the previous Attorney General.  I do not see how anybody in logic could intepret the 1992 amendment otherwise.  It makes a nonsense of the law and our <Col N="658" /> Constitution to interpret it in any other way.</P>
    <P>When I read the article by William Binchy in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 1 March 1995 explaining that this Bill is contrary to the Constitution I wondered whether he was serious.  This Bill is a direct consequence of the constitutional amendment passed by the people.  His second line of attack involved a pretence that the people did not know what they were voting for in 1992.  This approach, I suggest, presupposes that there are those with higher intellect and moral standards whose views and opinions are superior to those of the poor ordinary plain people of Ireland who voted for that amendment.  I reject utterly that elitist approach.  His approach also involved ignoring the fact that a pamphlet was distributed to every home in the country by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government in 1992 setting out clearly what the information amendment would do and, furthermore, specifying the conditions that would be laid down by law following its adoption. The pamphlet clearly stated that: &ldquo;The legislation will permit a doctor or advice agency to give a pregnant woman information on abortion services available elsewhere&rdquo;.  How can that be denied now?  Is it suggested it did not happen or is it suggested that people did not read it?  Is it suggested that people did not understand it?  All that nonsense has to be rejected.</P>
    <P>There are those who, for one reason or another, do not want the Bill to go through claiming that the constitutional amendment was adopted in order that abortion could be discussed by the people.  We have the bizarre explanation from William Binchy that:</P>
    <P>... many people believed that even a discussion about abortion in general terms was unlawful and that an amendment was necessary to render it lawful...</P>
    <P>To put it at its mildest and most charitable, such views strain credulity.</P>
    <P>A number of misconceptions were deliberately fostered in regard to this <Col N="659" /> Bill.  There is the suggestion that members of the medical profession would be coerced against their conscience to discuss the possibility of abortion with one of their patients.  That is untrue.  No provision in the Bill obliges any individual or agency to provide abortion information; on the contrary, the obligation to give full counselling on all available options applies only where abortion information is being given. Pregnancy counselling which does not include abortion information is not restricted by this Bill.  The Bill does not preclude a doctor or agency encouraging the woman concerned not to have an abortion.  Doctors and agencies are free to provide counselling either in a non-directive manner or in a manner which is directive away from but not towards the option of abortion.</P>
    <P>I intended to make some comments on the Fianna Fáil position but because of the time limit and because I am not sure of the Fianna Fáil position even at this stage, I will pass over that.</P>
    <P>There is a choice facing legislators. We can proceed with the present position where there is a constitutional right to information, without restriction of any kind.  At present thousands of women and girls travel to the UK each year for abortions without the benefit of advice, information or counselling of any kind.  The Bill will regulate and restrict the flow of information in relation to abortion.  In addition there will be encouragement for those in the very difficult position of unwanted pregnancies to avail of advice and counselling. It is expected that this will help to prevent abortions that might otherwise take place.  How can any person wishing to reduce the incidence of abortion oppose this Bill?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I was a Member during the 1983 and the 1992 referenda debates.  When the Bill was introduced last week there was no doubt that it would cause much heated debate and controversy inside and outside the House.  The fact that the Bill was rushed into the House by the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, on the day the Framework Document was launched, without any discussion with the Opposition, has added to that controversy: so much for achieving consensus.</P>
      <P>Over the years the people have taken a definite stand against the introduction of abortion here.  The railroad approach of the Minister for Health has not helped this debate.  For reasons best known to the Minister he has cobbled together a Bill and rushed it into the House.  When he came under a certain amount of fire about it the impression was given that it was a much watered down version of a Bill that had been prepared by the outgoing Labour-Fianna Fáil Government and, therefore, Fianna Fáil would have to accept it.</P>
      <P>I was a Minister of State in that Government and I was not aware of any prepared Bill.  Certainly, it did not come before the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party.  I question whether such a Bill existed and whether the Minister's action was a ploy to get Fianna Fáil into a cosy consensus in the House.  Fianna Fáil do not operate in that way.  We represent people and it is our duty to ensure that the views of such people are represented in our parliamentary party and in the House.  We have had a major discussion on this Bill.  Deputies have expressed different views, some of which have been heard in the House today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The majority of our people are opposed to abortion and I have no doubt that they are against this Bill.  I oppose it.  That does not mean I do not respect the views of my parliamentary party colleagues.  They have a strongly held view that this Bill is sufficient to meet the referendum on information passed by the people in 1992.  I feel otherwise.  The people voted by a 60:40 <Col N="661" /> majority for information; not information, referral and assistance as the Bill proposes.</P>
    <P>At our parliamentary party meeting we had a five hour debate on the issue. It was obvious on a 5:1 basis that the Bill was not acceptable.  Our leader, Deputy Ahern, and his front bench accepted the wishes of the majority of the parliamentary party.  They requested the Government to withdraw the Bill pending a High Court ruling which is expected soon.  If this did not happen it was made clear by our leader that Fianna Fáil would oppose the Bill.  Over the weekend he has been subjected to vilification, abuse and unbelievable criticism by certain sections of the media for not being liberal enough and for failing to lead a modern and progressive Fianna Fáil Party into the 21st century.  When certain sections of the media show concern for Fianna Fáil I always get worried.  Those sections of the media strongly criticised Charlie Haughey for being a dictator while Deputy Albert Reynolds was supposed to be a bullyboy because he did not listen to the views of his backbenchers. They have spent the past 15 years trying to undermine and write off the Fianna Fáil Party.  When Deputy Bertie Ahern decided to listen and take on board the views of the majority of Fianna Fáil Deputies he was described as a weak leader.  I am delighted he has stood his ground in the face of such media hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Deputies on both sides of the argument have sincerely held views and I do not accept that we are playing politics or pandering to the pro-life groups.  During the refreshing debate on the Bill at the parliamentary party meeting Deputies expressed many concerns about it.  It is only proper that these views are expressed in the Chamber which is not a place for &ldquo;yes&rdquo; men and women who support every Bill.  It should be dissected and teased out and people with strongly held views have every right to oppose it.</P>
    <P>I am totally opposed to abortion but, as legislators, we must ensure that the <Col N="662" /> legislation is in line with the democratic wishes of the electorate.  However, I do not believe the people voted for this legislation in the 1992 referendum and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, should withdraw the Bill even at this late hour. I cannot understand why he felt it necessary to rush it through the House when the Well Woman case has still to be heard by the High Court.  Surely it would have been more responsible to await the decision of the court before introducing this Bill.</P>
    <P>Allowing doctors to give the names and addresses of abortion clinics in other countries constitutes referral and assistance, something the electorate did not vote for in 1992.  I accept that many women go abroad for abortions &mdash; the Minister gave figures of 4,000-5,000, per annum.  I do not know how factual these figures are but obviously the Minister has sources for them.  All women contemplating abortion must be given proper counselling to try to discourage them from having an abortion.  I welcome the allocation in the Bill for pregnancy counselling.  Organisations such as CURA.  LIFE and Cherish do tremendous work in this area, yet successive Governments have allocated paltry amounts to them.  The Minister proposes to increase the present allocation of £75,000 to £200,000 and perhaps it could be increased even further. Will the Minister say which organisations receive this funding as recently LIFE stated it was operating on a shoestring budget?  Priority must be given to the provision of resources for education and counselling.</P>
    <P>The Bill is flawed in that it does not provide for the allocation of resources to agencies giving counselling or to doctors who need to learn counselling skills.  Unlike Dublin and other large towns, there are no counselling agencies in rural areas where the local GP is to the forefront in the provision of such services.  Funding must be allocated to doctors who require training and need to improve their counselling skills and family planning services.  Counselling is also important at the post-abortion <Col N="663" /> stage, yet there is nothing in the Bill which says this service will be provided. The Bill should have sought to reduce the number of women going abroad to have abortions and discriminate in favour of the provision of adequate resources for counselling, education and family planning services.  Given that it has failed to do this, the Minister should consider withdrawing it.</P>
    <P>I totally object to this Bill.  I am not a spokesperson for the pro-life group, I have always believed that the pro-life and pro-choice groups who spend so much time at each other's throats would be better advised to turn their attention to more important matters, such as homelessness, poverty, wife beating and child abuse.  On many occasions these groups have overstepped the mark and put too much pressure on Deputies.  I ignore such intimidation and if people who ring me at home do not give their name and address I refuse to talk to them.</P>
    <P>I am not expressing the views of the pro-life group on the Bill but my views. The Minister should consider withdrawing the Bill about which Deputy Harte has also expressed reservations. The Progressive Democrats Party has decided to allow a free vote on Second Stage.  There is no overall consensus on this measure.  People have very strongly held views on this issue and Fianna Fáil is not playing politics with it or pandering to any group.  This Bill does not reflect the views of the electorate as voiced during the 1992 referendum and it should be opposed.</P>

      <P>The provision by doctors and counsellors of the names and addresses of abortion clinics is abortion referral.  My sincerely held views on abortion have not been formed as a result of legitimate lobbying.  I do not like talking about abortion because when one takes a stand on this issue one is labelled, rubbished and perceived as a single issue person.  There are many issues on my political agenda and abortion is a very important and fundamental one.  A Fianna Fáil Deputy who sincerely opposes this Bill is branded as right wing, fundamentalist, Catholic, conservative, narrow-minded, backward, anti-woman, opportunistic and a hypocrite.  How dare people who use those terms brand others with sincerely held views with such labels?</P>
      <P>I received a statement entitled &ldquo;the Fianna Fáil Position&rdquo; from the Department of Health with the compliments of the Minister for Health, Deputy Michael Noonan.  It says that the Fianna Fáil position represents hypocrisy of breathtaking dimensions.  So much for liberal democracy and a toleration of different views.  People who issue such statements give democracy a bad name. I regret the terms which have been used by the people who support this Bill, on which there should be a reasonable debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder how important abortion is in Ireland to day.  Society has changed and we now have a different attitude to single parents who, by and large, are accepted and shown compassion, which is as it should be.  That was probably not the case in the past when an unwanted pregnancy was seen as wrong and the women involved were often abandoned and could not turn to their families or friends.  They were isolated, fearful and not emotionally supported by their parents or the father of the child, and there was no financial support for them.  I am glad those days are gone.  People are now more compassionate as far as unwanted pregnancies are concerned <Col N="665" /> and that is as it should be.  Resources should be allocated to groups such as Cherish, CURA and LIFE to deal in a compassionate manner with women faced with unwanted pregnancies.  An unwanted pregnancy is one matter, but abortion used as a form of family planning is totally unacceptable and should not be facilitated in any form.</P>
    <P>Like other speakers, I question the timing of this Bill.  It appears that because of pending court decisions the divorce referendum will not be held until next year.  It is as if the Government merely decided to do something to promote its liberal agenda and maintain cohesiveness between the parties in Government.  There was no attempt to persuade or convince people or to have a real debate on this issue.  The Bill was introduced and every attempt was made to rush it through the House although those tactics failed in the past.  Under Garret FitzGerald's constitutional crusade the divorce referendum was introduced overnight to deflect from other problems.  He made no attempt to debate the issues involved with others and, obviously, the people gave their verdict.</P>

      <P>We are not in favour of phoney consensus.  Other Bills passed through this House in which the views of individual Deputies were not reflected.  There were no votes, just cross party support.  That does not reflect the views of the wider society which must be reflected here in political debate.  Members of the Progressive Democrats Party have a free vote on this issue.  There are differences of opinion between members of that party, between members of the Fianna Fáil Party and between members of the Fine Gael Party, all of which must be reflected.  Those opposing the Bill must be respected and their voices heard if democracy means anything here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Abortion is not just a women's issue; as Deputy Burton stated it also involves <Col N="666" /> men.  Very often women are forced to consider abortion because men refuse to support them either financially or emotionally.  I am glad that position is also changing.  All sections of society are now more willing to face up to their responsibilities in this regard.  Many believe that young people support abortion and this Bill, but that has not been my experience in my dealings with them.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas must face up to the substantive issue of abortion; we are merely tinkering with it by introducing this Bill.  That matter must be considered in the context of another constitutional amendment.  Many people will vehemently oppose that course of action, but if the people are given an opportunity to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; in a referendum.  I have no doubt they will say &ldquo;no&rdquo;, and nothing can deflect us from that stark fact.</P>
    <P>This Bill creates an abortion culture which is supported by a powerful minority of interests who have no electoral mandate from anybody.  Abortion should never be an option.  The Bill is the thin end of the wedge, its principles are wrong, it cannot be amended and Members should vote against it on Second Stage.  We must have a calm rational debate on the matter.  It is regrettable that we on this side of the House have been called hypocrites because some Members on all sides object to the terms and conditions of the Bill.  We should not give liberalism a bad name and all sincere views should be respected.</P>

      <P>The debate which has opened up as a result of the publication of this Bill is welcome.  It has brought a serious problem into the open and allowed people inside and outside this House to debate it.  I am glad the <Col N="667" /> debate on Second Stage was carried over to this week.  It allowed many of us to listen to the views of constituents who contacted us about the Bill and the wider issue of abortion.  Approximately 60 people contacted me last weekend about this matter and I spoke to them all; I received a similar number of letters. While this puts a considerable strain on Deputies &mdash; we are elected to cope with that &mdash; it also puts a great deal of strain on their families and spouses.  I insisted on taking all the telephone calls and I met everybody who called either to my office or house. While there were some exceptions, most of those people are genuinely concerned about this matter.</P>
      <P>I hope I convinced some of them that I am as pro-life and anti-abortion as anyone who contacted me at the weekend. I think I was successful in some cases because there was a noticeable change from outward opposition to the Bill on Saturday to &mdash; on Sunday &mdash; a willingness to listen to its positive aspects and indeed on Monday some of them offered to pray for me and give me guidance.  Perhaps some of their prayers helped me to have the courage today to express my sincerely held views on this matter.  I said to those who contacted me that I could not comprehend how they and I, who are pro-life and anti-abortion, view the Bill so differently.  I went on to tell them I believed that if we could tap their energy, talents, undoubted determination and willingness to sacrifice their time and energy I would be willing to play my part in endeavouring to reduce the number of Irish women who go abroad for abortions each year and I have no doubt that many of the positive aspects of this Bill will achieve that.  We should all work together to resolve this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge the great and unselfish work carried out by organisations such as CURA and LIFE.  Members of those organisations in my constituency have done wonderful work in counselling and assisting women to bring their pregnancies to full-term.  They place women <Col N="668" /> in homes or with families for the duration of their pregnancies and, in some cases, where the women insist on having an abortion they provide counselling after the abortion.  Counselling should be provided in all cases of abortion.  I advise any woman with a crisis pregnancy to contact CURA or LIFE with whose work I am familiar, and she will receive every help.  If a woman has any difficulty contacting those organisations I will make myself available to act as a go-between.  I have done so in the past and those organisations have given valuable help to the people concerned.</P>
    <P>Some of the helping organisations are confused by the provisions of this Bill. They will not be obliged to give names and addresses.  They will be encouraged to continue their good work, only now they will be provided with resources to do so.  The Minister has provided £200,000 for organisations such as CURA and LIFE.  I ask him to increase that to £1 million in next year's Estimates as a positive response towards helping to reduce the number of Irish women having abortions.  I am clear in my conscience that supporting this Bill will reduce the number of Irish women having abortions.  I ask the people who contacted me at the weekend to come on board so that we can work together towards providing counselling to all women in crisis pregnancies.  I have no doubt that the energy is there to do that.</P>
    <P>Some positive aspects of the Bill are that it forms part of the Government's approach to minimising the circumstances in which women seek abortions and research, education and counselling will also be provided.  The Bill's emphasis on counselling arises from the fact, established by research, that the majority of women travelling to the UK for abortions have not received any counselling.  It will ensure that any doctors, advice agencies, etc. who provide abortion information to pregnant women do so in the context of full counselling on all the available options without any advocacy of abortion.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not apply to general non-specific information, for example, <Col N="669" /> information about the nature of abortion; that is not necessary.  The information is to be truthful and objective.  It may not advocate or promote abortion and may not be made available on billboards or public notices.  A doctor or agency may not advocate or promote the option of abortion and the information given on abortion must meet the conditions set out on information given to the general public.  Nothing in this Bill obliges any individual or agency to provide abortion information.</P>
    <P>The obligation to give full counselling on all available options applies only where abortion information is being given.  Pregnancy counselling which does not include abortion information is not restricted by this Bill which seeks to ensure that a person or agency giving abortion information cannot derive any financial gain or benefit arising from the choice of abortion or other available options.  My conscience is clear and I think I have convinced a number of the people who contacted me at the weekend that I and they are working towards the same aim.  My interest in this matter will continue and this Bill will help me and some organisations to reduce the numbers of Irish women going abroad for abortions.</P>

      <P>I commend the Minister, the Government, and the previous Minister for Health, for preparing and bringing forward this Bill so early in the life of this Government.  People thought this Government would be unstable, but this shows stability.  Others have suggested that we should postpone the Bill but, looking at all the controversy around us, will there ever be a right time to bring forward this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not afraid to support the Bill because people have voted for information and that is what they will receive.  Whether they wish to use it is their choice.  Choice is the most important aspect because Ireland is now a multi-cultural society, a multi-religious society and a multi-coloured community with varying shades of opinion.  This legislation now gives people a choice.  It <Col N="670" /> is a people's choice, not a women's issue only.  It is a fundamental human rights issue of decision-making for oneself.</P>
    <P>Since 1987, 20,000 Irish women have gone to England for abortions, and these are only the women who gave Irish addresses.  What about those who live in England, the emigrants?  What about those who give English addresses?  The British Office of Population Census has shown that in 1992, 4,000 women had abortions in England and they were Irish; 70 per cent of them were between the ages of 20 and 34; 13 per cent were over the age of 35.  That shows that 83 per cent of the women who went to England for abortions were not youngsters; they were mature women, married women, adults who knew what decisions they were making for themselves and their families.  Also, at least 2,000 women from Northern Ireland travel to England every year for abortions and, together with those in the South, they make up half of the nonresident population that have abortions in England.</P>
    <P>The current situation in Ireland is that one in every ten pregnant women will go to England for an abortion.  Therefore, we cannot ignore this problem.  It is our duty to legislate and we should do so.  We should not be afraid of losing votes.  In the past vital legislation in the areas of health, justice and education was delayed or not implemented because we were afraid of losing votes and were intimidated by those who shouted as loudly as possible.</P>
    <P>I have met many young couples who have difficulty renting accommodation because they have children.  Landlords refuse to house them because they have children.  Why are people rejecting live babies?</P>
    <P>The Minister is examining the question of counselling services for women with crisis pregnancies, but what about post abortion services and counselling? A survey by the Irish Family Planning Association has shown that 40 per cent only of women who travel to England for abortions go for post-abortion check-ups.  Most of these are between <Col N="671" /> the ages of 20 and 30, and live in Dublin city.  Not many from rural areas go to their general practitioners.  They are afraid of telling their problems to the GP because abortion is still a taboo subject. Counsellors should be available to them because nowadays some people speak of those who go to England for abortions as murderers and killers and this makes them feel guilty and ashamed.  Our duty should be to encourage them.  As a psychiatrist, I have not seen any Irish publication on post abortion psychological effects.  Many people say nobody has them, because the women who travel to England for abortions are faceless and nameless, but they are our neighbours, our friends and our family.  How many doctors write in the patient's notes that she has had an abortion? How many of them are instructed by their patients not to do so?</P>
    <P>As for the people who have said they would like an opt-out clause, doctors here always have had the choice to opt out.  Some doctors refuse to prescribe the pill or to see patients who are on the pill.  Others refused to prescribe condoms when they had to be prescribed.  If we have an opt-out clause in this legislation, should we have an opt-out clause for doctors who do not wish to treat patients who have AIDS or TB?  This matter should be left to the Medical Council.  Women will be able to choose to whom they want to go.  We do not want to return to the position where taxi drivers took Irish women to abortion clinics, where Irish women looked at the Yellow Pages at Heathrow Airport in London and chose the first clinic on the list or died following back street abortions.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Well Woman Centre compile a list of approved clinics to which doctors could refer patients following counselling.  If we do not provide for this we might as well scrap the Bill as it will be nothing more than useless paper.  <i>The Irish Medical Times</i> which was previously owned by the former Minister for Health.  Dr. John <Col N="672" /> O'Connell, has this week welcomed the introduction of the Bill because it protects both women and doctors.</P>
    <P>It was my hope that a consensus could be reached on this Bill as happened in the case of the legislation dealing with the decriminalisation of homosexuality and the availability of condoms.  It is not too late for the main Opposition party to change its mind.</P>

      <P>I regret that Deputy Haughey has left the Chamber as he said this measure forms part and parcel of the liberal agenda.  It does not.  For someone who is so sanctimonious that is a glib phrase to use.  In this Bill we are merely giving expression to the democratic decision of the people in the referenda held in 1992.  The voting pattern in 1992 was replicated last week in an opinion poll conducted for <i>The Cork Examiner</i> in which 61 per cent of those surveyed said that information should be made available.</P>
      <P>I have listened to this debate carefully, especially to the contributions of members of the Opposition.  I would describe much of the criticism expressed by them as a monument to bogus punditry; others might describe it as a shoal of red herrings.  I have not been impressed by the quality of the debate. Little compassion, feeling and understanding has been shown for those who decide to have an abortion &mdash; their trauma and desperation has not been reflected in a caring way in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead there has been an unnatural and unhealthy obsession with the unborn, a nebulous and vague term. What does it mean?  What about the rights of the living, including those who are forced to emigrate through economic necessity and those living in poverty? What about those faced with famine and starvation?  Should we not show the same compassion for those who are suffering and dying?  Are they not human beings also and like ourselves in every way?  Do they not bleed when cut and cry out in pain when hurt?  We cannot confine this debate to the unborn. <Col N="673" /> In the past those who are now protesting showed little concern for single mothers.  When single girls became pregnant they were often pushed to the margins of life and treated as lepers and pariahs in society.  Few spoke in their favour.  I know a little about this matter as my mother was one of 15 children in County Clare, 14 of whom were forced to emigrate to America because they were unable to find employment.  No one cared about the quality of their lives.  I could give many other examples.</P>
    <P>In this debate politicians have been speaking as if they were gynaecologists, constitutional lawyers or theologians and have told many gory stories to illustrate their case.  I will tell a different story as part of my contribution.  About 15 years ago during the fundamentalist campaign in America three clergymen, a Roman Catholic priest, a Protestant clergyman and a Jewish rabbi met each week for a chat and a drink and to go for a walk.  They were great friends and had a good relationship.  Unfortunately, the question of when life begins caused friction among them.  The Roman Catholic priest had no doubt in his mind about when life begins.  He said that life begins at the moment of conception when the male sperm fertilises the female egg and would not brook any further discussion on the question.  The Protestant clergyman was not as dogmatic. He said that life begins somewhere between the tenth and twelfth week when the female egg takes on a human form.  The Jewish rabbi who had a wife and family was more philosophical. He paused for a moment and said that life begins when the dog dies and the children leave the home.  He had a broader view of life.  He had reared his family, seen them depart and perhaps wanted more space for himself.  We could learn from him.</P>
    <P>I have received a mountain of lurid and nasty literature in the post.  My secretary in Limerick, who is married with three children, no longer looks at it but dumps it in the waste paper basket, with my approval.  I am not squeamish as I <Col N="674" /> have been down this road before.  One should be qualified to speak about this matter.  I do not know what it is like to give birth and I am sorry that more women have not contributed to this debate.  Too many men have spoken, many of whom have adopted a narrow attitude.</P>
    <P>I founded a family planning clinic in Limerick 21 years ago, one of the best things I have done, to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies.  There is a need for comprehensive family planning education in schools and clinics.  That would be a positive step in reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies and the number of abortions by Irish women.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I express profound concern at the contents of this legislation.  As legislators, we have an obligation to safeguard human life from conception to natural death.  The safeguarding of the right to life of the unborn is of paramount importance.  Article 40.3.3 of the Constitution states that the State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and guaratees in its laws to respect and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.</P>
      <P>This Bill contains provisions which will facilitate citizens of this country in their attempt to procure an abortion. These provisions pose a threat to the right to life of the unborn child which is sacred and which is enshrined in the Constitution by the will of the people. Information made available by virtue of the 1992 amendment must recognise and respect this right.  We therefore have an obligation to uphold and respect the right to life of the unborn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If passed into law this Bill will permit the furnishing of detailed information to a woman or girl about abortion facilities <Col N="675" /> outside the State.  The information given under the terms of this Bill will include the names, addresses and telephone numbers of abortion clinics in any country.  To put it plainly, that amounts to knowingly assisting a woman or girl to obtain an abortion.  To claim, therefore, that this Bill is not about abortion but about information is incorrect and misleading.  I am appalled and surprised that the Minister would introduce such misleading legislation in this House.  I expected more from him.</P>
    <P>I repeat for the Minister's information that the direct and intentional killing of unborn human life, for whatever reason, is in direct contravention of our Constitution.  The Government has a responsibility to preserve each person's right and to protect the weakest in our society.  There is none weaker than the unborn child.  The intentional destruction of its life is never a permissible option for any person or State nor could any constitutional right ever arise which would allow information to be given, the purpose of which would be to defeat the constitutional right to life of the unborn.</P>
    <P>I am not alone in expressing these views.  They are the views of my constituents and others who have been in touch with me in the past week or ten days since this legislation was published. I strongly oppose the Bill.  It is not in keeping with the decision made by the people in the 1992 referendum on information. I believe it will be found to be unconstitutional.  The question and answer memorandum, which the Government of the day issued to help people reach a decision on this issue, specifically stated that directive counselling would not be the result of a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote.  This Bill, however, provides for directive counselling in direct contravention of what the people voted for in 1992.  The giving of names, addresses and telephone numbers of abortion clinics constitutes directive counselling. Such information, as I have already <Col N="676" /> stated, promotes and facilitates abortion. It is not information, it is assistance. The provision of such assistance is precluded by the Constitution.  If this Bill is passed into law it will make access to abortion clinics much easier and will inevitably lead to an increase in the termination of pregnancies.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the thin end of the wedge. If it becomes law it will give the proponents of abortion a foot in the door. That door will continue to be pushed open wider.  Experience in other countries has shown that this is how abortion legislation is introduced.  I ask the parties opposite and the Minister in particular if this is what the Irish people want.  I believe it is not what they want.</P>
    <P>It is naive to suggest that giving pregnant women the names, addresses and telephone numbers of abortion clinics does not constitute abortion referral, which is specifically excluded by the Constitution. It would be naive also to suggest that the Bill, as it stands, would not be successfully challenged in the courts.</P>

      <P>Last night I paid tribute to the professionalism and dedication of our Defence Forces and welcomed the fact that defence is now on the agenda as it should be in the run-up to the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference. I also indicated to the Minister that he should be wary of a slow implementation of the EAG lest other Departments, particularly the Department of Finance, might use the recommendations of the EAG as a pretext for starving the Defence Forces of resources.  I would like to repeat that point tonight. During my contribution the Minister informed me that the Government would make a decision on the EAG recommendations in the very near future.  I welcome this as it is very important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that stage the Minister should have his round of consultations.  I know he has spoken to PDFORRA, RACO and other organisations but it is only <Col N="678" /> when he has the general recommendations that he can tell representative organisations what exactly is involved, what recommendations have been made and how he proposes to implement them.  Therefore, at that time the Minister must undertake full consultations with the Defence Forces irrespective of what talks he has already had because he is talking now in a vacuum.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the role of the military in the whole process of the EAG review.  They played a full role in which I was very much involved.  I found them to be very open to ideas, recognising the need for change as did other people.  They deserve that tribute because they have been depicted as not wanting any changes.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Price Waterhouse report was leaked selectively and used by the media very selectively.  It was part of a process and the leak was damaging in that it sent the debate off at a tangent the real issues were ignored and its many fine recommendations were also ignored.</P>
    <P>Barracks closures are emotive and they have predominated in this debate. They are obviously important but I do not think that we should allow the whole debate to become clouded by that issue.  I am conscious of the social and economic reasons for maintaining barracks but we should also look at the strategic military viewpoint.  The Minister should engage in the widest possible consulations before any action is undertaken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In his contribution last night, the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Defence and the Marine, Deputy Michael Smith, spoke in great detail about the duties and functions of the Army and the very varied nature of those duties.  He identified some problem areas such as the very high age profile of the Defence Forces; the need to rationalise numbers and strengths of units; and the need to put in place a proper recruitment campaign at an early date.  He also highlighted the difficulties <Col N="679" /> accruing from the insufficient number of troops in different units.</P>
      <P>Coming from a Border constituency where we have two major Army barracks &mdash; Dún Uí Neill in Cavan, and Monaghan Barracks &mdash; I am very proud of the work of all the Army personnel in the area over many years.  I know that I speak for the vast majority of my constituents when I emphasise that their work, particularly since 1969, has been most beneficial, much needed and appreciated during that period of severe political trouble on our doorstep.</P>
      <P>Many young constituents of mine are actively seeking enlistment in the permanent Defence Forces as they have seen at first hand the Army in operation and appreciate its high standing within the community.  I know from those young people, who have spoken to me about their desire to join the Army, that they consider this career path very challenging. The quality of those seeking enlistment is very high, both from a character and academic viewpoint.</P>
      <P>It is not just we at home who are proud of the work of the Defence Forces, we are all also conscious of the great service they have given abroad on many United Nations missions.  The work of our soldiers is not always given the recognition it deserves and generally the number of people serving abroad, or the extent of these missions, is not known by the population at large.  Perhaps a better presentation of that segment of the work of the Defence Forces would be worthwhile.</P>
      <P>Our Army's participation in peace-keeping duties demonstrates this country's commitment to the United Nations and to the establishment and maintenance of peace throughout the world.  Of course, at home the duties of the Defence Forces are varied, such as providing assistance in emergencies, industrial disputes, fishery protection and life-saving missions &mdash; all necessary duties which will no doubt continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must have an ongoing recruitment campaign to ensure that the age profile of the Defence Forces is not too <Col N="680" /> high, and obviously constant recruitment and a proper system of retirement would help mobility and promotional outlets.</P>
    <P>Decisions should not be made on the Efficiency Audit Group report prior to the widest possible consultative process and a proper and thorough examination of the implications of any scaling down of military activity.  That is the concern of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>I am very glad that Fianna Fáil, while in Government in 1988, placed the contract for the construction of a new Army barracks in Cavan town which was later named Dún Uí Neill after Eoghan Ruadh O'Neill, one of the dominant figures in Irish history.  The most up-to-date facilities provided in this fine new barracks are of tremendous assistance to the Defence Forces in carrying out their duties in the Border area, and provides an excellent headquarters for the 29th Battalion as well as first class facilities and amenities.  The construction of this barracks was a positive development, replacing the old military barracks in Cavan which was constructed in the late 17th century.</P>
    <P>Many members of the Defence Forces have had long and arduous hours of work on Border duty since 1970.  Border patrolling and acting in support of the civil power prevented many potentially difficult and dangerous incidents from arising.  Thankfully the advancement of the peace process has ended the need for those patrols.</P>
    <P>I am sure that members of the Army, Navy and the Air Corps would have no problem in having improved structures put in place, or an improvement in the efficiency of their operations.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to ensure the widest possible consultation before decisions are reached.  I would like to pay tribute to officials in the Departments of Defence, Foreign Affairs and Justice for the caring and sensitive way in which they have dealt with representations from public representatives and the public at large in relation to sensitive Border patrol and security issues since 1969.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>I begin by placing on record my appreciation of the positive tone of the contributions made by the Opposition Deputies in the debate so far.  The future of the Defence Forces is an important issue.  It is an issue which, in the past, may not have received the attention it deserves.  It is not, however, an issue which should give rise to major disagreement among the parties in this House.  We all share a common objective. There is a consensus about the range of problems facing the Defence Forces.  We wish to see these problems dealt with in a positive way so that the Defence Forces can be reorganised and developed to meet the challenges of today.  There has been some questioning of the bona fides of the Government in relation to its approach to the report of the Efficiency Audit Group.  I would like to make two points in reply.</P>
      <P>First, the problems facing the Defence Forces did not materialise out of fresh air in the past couple of months. The difficulties facing the Defence Forces, the rising age profile, the multi-layered system of administration, the imbalance between pay and non-pay spending and so forth have grown up over a long period.  During much of that period the Deputies opposite were in Government.  I feel obliged to point this out as at least one speaker last night did not seem to be aware of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, I must remind the House that the Efficiency Audit Group, which was established by the then Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey in 1988, was requested, quite rightly, to conduct an examination of the Defence Forces.  It is not as if this Government entered office and headed off on a scalp-hunt with the Defence <Col N="682" /> Forces as the victim.  The process of review was virtually completed by the time this Government took up office. The issue now is how to address the many and wide-ranging recommendations the EAG has made regarding the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence has already made it clear that the Government regards this issue as a priority.  There are many problem areas to be addressed. Clearly if reform is to succeed, it is important that Defence Forces personnel should feel a sense of involvement in the process.  To that end, the Minister is consulting widely with all interested groups, including the representative associations.  While it is understandable that there is a certain impatience for a definitive announcement of the details of the programme of reform, there is an overriding need to get this right. Accordingly, the Government, having taken office only in the past few months, will make no apology for giving this issue the detailed attention it deserves. When all the relevant considerations have been taken into account, an integrated plan of action will be drawn up.</P>
    <P>I have every confidence that the implementation of a reform programme will prove to be a positive experience for the Defence Forces.  It will be the intention of the Government to develop many areas of the Defence Forces.  For example, the Army School of Equitation has a long and distinguished record in show-jumping at home and overseas.  The school has played a major role in promoting the non-thoroughbred Irish horse.  The Minister has asked me to look at ways of developing the school.  In particular, I will be addressing the question of ensuring that a continuing supply of horses will be available for competitive teams in the future.  I will also be anxious to ensure that the school continues to produce top class riders to represent Ireland in international competitions. I intend working on that matter as quickly as possible.  We are all <Col N="683" /> very proud of the success of our Army riders and the reputation they have built up for this country abroad.  They are great ambassadors.  I hope the Government will ensure that the Army Equitation School will continue to expand and continue its great work.</P>
    <P>The Reserve Defence Forces are another area which merit re-organisation and development.  I am encouraged by the fact that the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association has welcomed the prospect of change.  The Minister will be meeting their representative association later this week to obtain their views on the future of An Forsa Cosanta Áitúil and An Slua Muirí, the naval reserve.  The FCA and An Slua Muirí are often overlooked in the debate about the future of the Defence Forces.  Members of the Reserve Defence Forces devote a substantial part of their leisure time during evenings and at weekends to the service of the State.  Throughout the country, the FCA and An Slua Muirí play a central part in the community.  In any programme of reform of the Defence Forces, the important role played by the reserves will be fully recognised.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable in the extreme that, for a variety of reasons, the process of reform in the Defence Forces has been represented in negative terms.  The Government wishes it to be clearly understood that the objective of this process is developmental.  Our objective is to have a Defence Force which is organised, deployed, staffed and equipped to meet the requirements of the 1990s.</P>
    <P>Attempts to denigrate the reform process by references to the EAG review as a cost-cutting campaign are unhelpful in the extreme.  It has already been made clear that what is envisaged is a refocusing of resources, not an economy drive.  In the course of this debate Deputy Smith referred to the decline in the share of available resources devoted <Col N="684" /> to equipment.  There is no disagreement about the need to address this issue.  I am pleased the Deputy seems to agree that a 70/30 split between pay and non-pay expenditure would be more appropriate than the present proportion of 80/20.  The present imbalance did not occur today or yesterday; its correction will be a central aim of the reform process. The intention will be to increase the share of resources available for areas such as transport and equipment.</P>
    <P>In relation to the age profile of the Defence Forces, there is a clear need to develop an integrated manpower plan. Consideration will have to be given to an early retirement scheme.  This problem has worsened gradually over the past number of years and will take time to correct.  I would like to emphasise that the Government is mindful of the need to take into account the personal and domestic dimensions involved in any future reorganisation of the Defence Forces.  It goes without saying that there will be no compulsory redundancies.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their positive remarks about the staff in the Department of Defence and the personnel in the Defence Forces.  We can be very proud of the long and good service given by members of the Defence Forces, backed up by the Department.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs I had the pleasure of visiting Somalia and Lebanon and I came away from both feeling proud to be Irish and to be involved with such fine men and women who give service to this country and the United Nations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for allowing members of the Labour Party to share his time.  A special committee was set up in the Labour Party to work on this matter in consultation with the Minister.  The report which came before the previous <Col N="685" /> Government has not been formally considered by this Government.  My colleagues, Deputy Michael Bell, chairman of our parliamentary party, who led a delegation on this matter.  Deputies Mulvihill, Penrose and others were most impressed by the fact that the present Minister for Defence already has a great awareness of this subject.  He has met the concerns expressed.  The Minister is aware of the importance not only of the reorganisation of the Army, which has been requested by Army personnel, but also of providing for a new streamlined unit for the future.  He is also aware of the importance of the participation of Army units in barracks throughout the country, and my constituency, South Tipperary, is no exception.  We realise the important role the Army's presence plays in Clonmel and the town would be devastated if anything were to happen to Kickham Barracks without the social and other implications being taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Minister on his open and frank manner.  He is implementing the report and not consigning it to the waste paper basket as predicted, which would be a disservice to those who prepared it.  It is imperative that we look at what needs to be done and the Minister has given a commitment to consult the organisations representing Army personnel such as RACCO and PDFORRA.  By reaching an agreement through consultation we can streamline the Defence Forces and bring in new blood at the appropriate time.  Serving troops will be able to avail of voluntary redundancy commensurate with the service they have given to the State.  When phase one has been put into operation we can then consider equipping the force properly for its peacekeeping role. I join the Minister and Minister of State, and the previous Minister of State, in commending the troops who have served with the United Nations; they are a credit to us.  We have earned a worldwide reputation for our positive <Col N="686" /> contribution to peacekeeping.  I am satisfied the Minister understands what needs to be done and has the courage to do it but he will have regard to the economic consequences of barrack closures. As he said, no barracks will close during his term of office but he will be taking the first important steps to rationalise the Army and bring it into the 21st century.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMulvihill" hpid="Mr. Mulvihill Mr. Mulvihill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulvihill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate. The Defence Forces, that is the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps, have played a vital role in the life of this State.  As a former member of the Naval Service I am keenly aware of the contribution of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>I congratulate my fellow county man, Deputy Coveney, on his appointment as Minister for Defence and the Marine.  I wish him well and believe he will serve to the best of his ability.  I congratulate Deputy Barrett on his appointment as Minister of State.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces are facing change but I believe changes must be introduced to upgrade and modernise all aspects of those forces.  Together with my Labour Party colleagues I recently met the Minister to discuss the Price Waterhouse report on the future of the Defence Forces.  The Minister gave the Labour Party delegation a clear and unequivocal undertaking that no Army barracks would be closed.  On behalf of my constituents, many of whom work in the Defence Forces, I welcome that statement as it shows that the Government recognises the social and economic contribution of Army barracks to towns throughout the country. This news has been warmly welcomed by the people of Fermoy who were very concerned about their barracks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When that report was first leaked in the media during the summer constituents expressed concern about the mass closure of barracks throughout the country.  The fundamental flaw of the <Col N="687" /> report is its narrow focus as those who compiled it used the methodology of an accountant but excluded the knock-on economic and social benefits of barracks to the towns in which they are located.</P>
    <P>I take a keen interest in developments affecting the Naval Service.  The Naval Service does not get enough credit for the excellent job it does and which is being made increasingly difficult by Spanish fishermen who are allowed to fish in Irish waters.  I am sure the Minister is well aware of the situation.  I urge him to increase the number in the Naval Service as well as upgrading their equipment. The Minister should also improve the accommodation at Haulbowline.  We must modernise the technology and equipment.  How can we expect them to do a good job with out-of-date, obsolete equipment?  The Naval Service plays an important role in combating the growing drugs problem.  I have said that we should establish a national anti-drugs unit which should be based in Haulbowline Naval base comprised of Naval personnel, Customs Officers and gardai. They should have the latest technology such as lightweight craft to patrol the small inlets around our coastline.</P>
    <P>The wreck of the <i>Lusitania</i> is located off the Cork coast.  The Naval service has stated that it has neither the time nor the manpower to protect it by patrolling the area.  I suggest that the Minister deploy An Slua Muirí on a fulltime basis until this problem is sorted out.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I was one of the Labour Party Deputies who met the Minister for Defence.  I was reasonably happy with the assurance he gave us on threatened Army barrack closures which seems to have emanated from the Price Waterhouse report.  As a person who studied economics I have very strong views on the way reports are formulated.  I am totally unhappy with the drip by drip leaks from the Price Waterhouse report, especially those that concentrated on the closure of Army <Col N="688" /> barracks.  The recommendations of this report, if implemented, would have a devastating, negative effect on many rural communities.  In addition they would have a devastating impact on the morale of the Defence Forces.  It represented an attack on the economic and social contributions of every barracks.</P>
      <P>In recent years the decline of many towns and villages has been hastened by cutbacks in public spending.  Ask any person living in a small rural town or village about this decline and they will say that the railway stations, small schools, post offices and Garda stations were closed down.  A series of closures in any town or village will ultimately result in its demise.</P>
      <P>Many people, including politicians, are inclined too often to pay lip-service to the notion of rural regeneration.  It is ironic that this is now a buzz word. Rural degeneration is a problem we must tackle.  It makes no sense &mdash; this is where I differ from the report &mdash; to adopt balance sheet type accounting criteria when examining the economic role and social contribution made by an army barracks to a town.  I am completely opposed to such methodology on the grounds that it is a fundamentally crude approach.  It fails to evaluate the knock-on social effects of such a decision on the community.</P>
      <P>Some of the proposals, particularly those dealing with army barracks, are not only one-sided and myopic but a grave threat to the economic livelihood and social fabric of the community.  It is ludicrous and incomprehensible that barracks which play a strategic role should be closed down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two major barracks in County Westmeath which illustrate the county's well established, honourable military tradition.  Through their service with UNIFIL, the soldiers of Columb Barracks in Mullingar and Custume Barracks in Athlone have made an enormous contribution to the resolution of conflict throughout the world.  At home the barracks has made a significant contribution to the growth and development of the two largest towns in <Col N="689" /> the county.  Nowhere epitomises the importance and pro-active participation by the Defence Forces better than the military presence in Mullingar.  In financial terms &mdash; and this is the crux &mdash; the Army base in Mullingar contributes directly an estimated £4 million to the local economy each year.  Those who advocate the closure of Army bases have ignored that part of the equation to all intents and purposes.  The Department of Defence has been treated as the Cinderella of the public service for far too long.  Look at the recruitment figures. It is clear that the lifeblood of the permanent Defence Forces is continued annual recruitment.  In 1990 some 648 people were recruited into the permanent Defence Forces and 116 people into the Naval Service.  In December 1990, 30 people entered the Naval Service. In December 1991, 50 people were recruited into the Naval Service. However, there was no recruitment into the permanent Defence Forces between 1990 and 1994.</P>

      <P>In 1994, 420 people were recruited into the permanent Defence Forces and 80 people into the Naval Service.  It is no wonder that the age profile is distorted.  We need an annual recruitment campaign.  I hope the 1995 campaign will be announced without further delay.  Annual recruitment to the permanent Defence Forces should not be sacrificed on the altar of financial rectiude.  The Minister should bring forward, in consultation with the relevant representative organisations, an early voluntary retirement package which should go hand in hand with a commitment to a recruitment campaign.</P>
      <P>The refurbishment and upgrading of Army barracks should be carried out on a planned basis.  The Minister should direct that the recruitment of civilian tradesmen and general operatives be permitted as these people have carried out top class work in the refurbishment, renewal and maintenance areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the establishment of an <Col N="690" /> Ombudsman for military officers in the permanent Defence Forces and this could be done by enacting enabling legislation or through the appointment of a deputy Ombudsman.</P>

      <P>Most countries would consider they owe a debt of gratitude to their Defence Forces and in the case of Ireland there is an international as well as a national debt.  We are proud of our forces.  They have served with outstanding distinction in countries ranging from the Congo to the Lebanon.  All too often, Defence Forces serving internationally do so in an aggressive capacity but our forces have always served abroad in a peacekeeping capacity.  It is a tradition of which we are proud and rightly so.</P>
      <P>Modern times demand modern responses and the current review of the Defence Forces is designed to equip the Army with the means to meet the challenges not only of the nineties but to bring us into the 21st century.  Increasingly, Defence Forces throughout the world take on extra duties in the realms of civil defence, for example, air/sea rescue operations and so on.  Many of these duties require specialist technical and managerial skills.  I hope the reforms proposed by the Government contain a strong and ongoing training element. We live in an age of specialisation and this applies to the Defence Forces as much as to private enterprise.  We must ensure that our Defence Forces keep up with international developments in the relevant fields.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to our Naval Service, which far too often is viewed as the Cinderella of the Defence Forces.  Ask any fisherman about his indebtedness to the Naval Service and you will hear him talk in the highest terms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Changes introduced by the European Union beleaguer the fishing industry and it depends on the Naval <Col N="691" /> Service to protect its interests.  I hope the role of the Naval Service will not only be reviewed but expanded.  I welcome the commitment to full consultation. The closed door approach adopted by the previous administration gave rise to the most incredibly exaggerated rumours about wholesale redundancies, barrack closures and the like. These rumours reached their height last autumn and I hope the more open approach adopted by this Government will have allayed some of the fears.</P>

      <P>One of the most disturbing rumours to emerge last year was that Ireland's international commitment would be scaled down as a result of the review.  Some of the bizarre rumours, allowed by Fianna Fáil in Government, had us abandoning our UN commitment altogether.  Unlike Fianna Fáil.  I urge the Government to ensure that the Defence Forces peacekeeping role is not only maintained but expanded.  It is clear that because of our historic neutrality Ireland, together with other countries such as Finland and Fiji, is in a unique position to not only keep but promote peace and reconciliation in other parts of the world.</P>
      <P>The review is intended mainly to address management structures.  I hope the need for an Ombudsman will be addressed.  Senator Sherlock pointed out recently that the structure of the Defence Forces is such that soldiers often feel they have little redress for grievances.  The existing grievance procedure lacks transparency and is extremely cumbersome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consultation in which the Government is engaged in preparing the proposed reforms must be reflected within the Defence Forces.  As a former serving member of the FCA I would <Col N="692" /> like to give the regular forces and part-time soldiers due credit for their incredible personal commitment and dedication to this nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Clohessy and my junior colleague Deputy McCreevy.  I thank Deputy Penrose for his support for the motion.  It is necessary to look at recent reports which addressed defence matters.</P>
      <P>The report of the Gleeson Commission was produced in the summer of 1990 and, while concentrating mainly on remuneration and conditions of service, highlighted some organisational and structural deficiencies the Commission suggested should be rectified.  The Efficiency Audit Group in 1991 commenced a study involving the examination of the overall organisation of the Department of Defence and, in turn, advanced a number of proposals for its reorganisation.  That group undertook a second study the following year, this time examining internal military administration and methods of improving efficiency within the military structure. The EAG decided to commission an independent study by consultants in order to bring that review to a successful conclusion.</P>
      <P>It is clear that much time and energy has been expended on examining our Defence Forces.  All groups or organisations must adapt and develop to meet the changes of the modern world. Everybody realises that such change is needed and will take place.  Members of our Defence Forces recognise this more than anybody else.  Any accusation that the Army is reluctant to change must be firmly knocked on the head.  However, such changes can be effected only following negotiations with the representatives of the Defence Forces.  Surely that is the road we should follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine what has happened to date.  The Government has refused to publish this report, leaving the members of our Defence Forces dependent on Tom Brady for information.  Is it any wonder they are angry?  They have <Col N="693" /> every right to be.  This report must be published to allow an open debate.</P>
    <P>On 14 February 1995 the Minister for Defence decided to outline his plans for our Defence Forces on national radio, when he informed the nation that this Government would close down barracks around the country &mdash; there appeared to be no doubt in his mind at that point. However, a few hours later, he changed his mind, his backbenchers having made hasty telephone calls informing him that that proposal was not acceptable.  The Minister took their advice and decided to issue a further statement.  Speaking in this House the following day, 15 February 1995 at column 619 of the Official Report the Minister had this to say:</P>
    <P>Before action of any kind can be contemplated on foot of the recommendations of the Efficiency Audit Group it will be necessary to establish an implementation group to prepare a fully costed implementation plan for phase 1 of the proposals.  The first phase, covering a period of three years, will not involve the closure of a single barracks.  It will concentrate instead on the more fundamental issues in the recommendations.  I will not, therefore, be presiding over the closure of any barracks.</P>
    <P>I think that used to be called an orderly retreat.  In this case, that was much welcomed.</P>
    <P>The problem is that none of us can be sure what is the Government's real policy in regard to barrack closures. This Government has treated the Defence Forces with disdain.  The report proposed the closure of 17 of the country's barracks and reducing the numbers of defence personnel by 3,000.  It is clear the Government is treating this report simply as a cost-cutting exercise.  We will not allow this happen.  The message going out to many towns is that their barracks will not be closed until after the next election.  Does the Minister realise that members of the Defence Forces and their families are living in real fear, knowing that he was really serious when he spoke on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; on 14 February?</P>
    <P>The Army has a major influence on <Col N="694" /> the sporting and social life of Kildare.  It is obvious the Government is not aware of the interaction between members of our Defence Forces and the communities in which they live.  For example, on a number of occasions I and my football team, Raheens, have been at the receiving end of that interaction.  The Sarsfields football team in Newbridge often included members of the Defence Forces, although I must admit they broke my heart on a number of occasions.  In addition, the Suncroft hurling team and the Curragh rugby team enjoyed the same support from Army personnel.  My team won a Leinster club championship, having been trained by a Limerick hurler, also a member of the Defence Forces. Today Kildare footballers are pinning their hopes on the shoulders of another Army man from Roscommon, though we shall have to await developments in that respect.</P>
    <P>Before the Minister makes any serious decision let me remind him that he is dealing with people, not merely with numbers and pounds.  It is nothing short of disgraceful that these Defence Forces families must read the newspapers to ascertain what plans are being drawn up for them by the Departments of Defence and Finance.  Last evening the Minister mentioned his consultation with PDFORRA and RACO.  Listening to him one could be forgiven for believing that everything in the garden was rosy.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Consultation must be a two-way process.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated last evening he wanted to deal with some apprehensions that have arisen about the review of the Defence Forces.  He must accept responsibility for much of this confusion. Unless he publishes this report and enters into real negotiations with representatives of the Defence Forces, progress will not be possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister has taken over the reins in the Department of Defence at a most challenging time.  He has outlined some of the problems to be tackled, recognising wide agreement on the need for change.  While nobody expects him to wave a magic wand and cure all ills overnight, some immediate action is <Col N="695" /> necessary, none more than a decision to open up recruitment.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed to note the Minister's colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Seán Barrett, has left the House.  When Deputy Andrews, as Minister for Defence, last year initiated recruitment for an additional 500 Army personnel, the then Fine Gael spokesperson on Defence, the same Deputy Séan Barrett, castigated the Minister on his new style of recruitment, referring to the new recruits as the &ldquo;yellow pack&rdquo; brigade. Obviously, it did not mean much to the Fine Gael Party at that time but there can be no doubting its positive effect within the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>All reports on the subject recognise the rising age profile of our Defence Forces.  The simplest solution to the problem is by way of recruitment.  In the Gleeson report the importance of recruitment was fully understood.  It stated:</P>
    <P>Irrespective of overall manpower limits, the commission is convinced of the need for regular recruitment.  In the past there has been stop/go recruitment into the Defence Forces with periods of intensive recruitment followed by periods in which no recruitment took place.  This practice has resulted in serious manpower problems, the effects of which will continue to be felt for a number of years to come.</P>
    <P>Regardless of what overall manpower limits are agreed, regular recruitment is an absolute necessity and, unless this becomes Government policy, there is no point in talking about a highly trained, well-armed mobile force.  Recruitment is the lifeblood of an Army.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that his colleague, the Minister for Finance, does not have his way and to insist that proper funding is provided for regular recruitment.  It would appear that the Labour Minister for Defence does not fully appreciate what recruitment means to our Defence Forces.  I wish the Minister good luck in that battle, which he must win.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="696" /> The Government has yet to show its real commitment to the Defence Forces, as a result of which morale is fairly low. The Army Apprentice School at Devoy Barracks in Naas, has a capacity for 60 apprentices, and is a typical example of the Government's lack of commitment, yet how many apprentices are there? Fifteen are to be taken on this year. Anybody familiar with Devoy Barracks will be aware that this is a school with a tremendous record.  I am disgusted at the manner in which the Government is allowing this barracks to be run down. There is no other place where apprentices can obtain better training.  The teachers there have produced some marvellous people and trainees from Devoy Barracks have won many international awards.  At a time when so many other semi-State bodies, such a Bord na Móna, CIE and others have ceased recruiting apprentices, the opportunities of young people to learn a trade are becoming ever fewer.  The role of the Army Apprentice School at Devoy Barracks should be expanded.  Is it not ironic that we appear prepared to throw money at any scheme that will take people off the live register, yet an apprentice school that has withstood the test of time, would appear to be facing closure?</P>
    <P>On many occasions I have appealed in this House for major investment in the Curragh, the ideal training ground for an Army which must be developed as such.  Unfortunately, through lack of funding, many of the buildings and houses there have become very decrepit.  Unless major funding is allocated for the Curragh, they will have to close the complex because many of its buildings will collapse.  I say that in all sincerity because, as a public representative for Kildare, I find it very embarrassing that the Curragh has been so neglected.  I do not attach blame to the new Minister.  The barracks at the Curragh is in a poor state because Governments down through the years have neglected it.  I suggest that there is no Army barracks in Ireland more in need of renovation than the Curragh.  There will no doubt be savings in the area of <Col N="697" /> defence as a result of the peace process. I appeal to the Minister to direct those savings to the plains of Kildare.  I am aware he has a difficult job, but money will have to be found as the Army Barracks at the Curragh needs the kind of refurbishment that will require major expenditure.</P>
    <P>I fully recognise that some of the necessary changes in the Defence Forces will be painful but I appeal to the Minister to negotiate with the representatives of the Defence Forces before decisions are made.  Reform must take place in an acceptable manner while at the same time the best qualities of our Defence Forces must be preserved.  For the good of our country let us play our part in improving the structure and capabilities of our Defence Forces.  I call on all Deputies to support the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first opportunity I have had to congratulate the new Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney.  I wish him well in his onerous portfolio and I am sure he will be an excellent Minister.  I am sure he will learn, as I have, that commonsense, business acumen and decision making will not always be appreciated by all his colleagues.  However, the Minister has my good wishes and, perhaps, condolences in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having been in Government, I am aware that when cutbacks have to be made in overall expenditure figures, it is inevitable that a few million pounds will be cut from the Defence Estimate because it is regarded as being low on the list of priorities.  If it is a decision between cutting expenditure for the Health Estimate or the Defence Estimate, the Defence Estimate will lose out.  I expect it was that attitude that led to matters in the Defence Forces being so bad in 1989.  For a number of years prior to that, particularly between 1982 and 1987, due to the constraints on public expenditure successive Government probably adopted that principle also with the result that my party, in particular, because it has been in power from only 1987 to 1989, found the chill wind <Col N="698" /> of Army opposition blowing against it at the time of a general election.</P>
    <P>My party, rightly or wrongly, has always been perceived, at least in Kildare and probably in other counties, as having been good for the Army but, by 1989 Army personnel had come to the end of their tether and we paid a heavy price nationally.  Deputy Power and I were lucky that we did not pay the price but the resentment probably denied Fianna Fáil the opportunity of securing an overall majority, or near it, on that occasion.  The most alarming thing at that time was not that my party had to pay a heavy political price, but that in the course of the election campaign, for the first time in my political experience in County Kildare, everyone connected with the Army from high ranking Army officers to NCOs and their wives all were of the one opinion, that was, that they were being neglected. The former Taoiseach, Mr. Haughey, who formed the incoming Government with the Progressive Democrats, recognised that during the course of the election campaign. Through the Gleeson Commission, and with the assistance of Deputy Lenihan, he set about repairing the damage.  Even though the position was not made public at the time, I conveyed to the then Taoiseach its seriousness and implications for the State.  I cannot remember the matter being raised on either side of the House then but it may have been mentioned outside it.  We should have learned a lesson in that we were perceived as not appreciating the Army until its members had created a racket.</P>
    <P>We have been lucky in this State, that, irrespective of what party was in power, Army personnel from top to bottom have never made overtures to political parties.  We should aim to keep it that way.  Organisations, such as PDFORRA and RACO emerged from the discontent and have worked well. The Government must ensure that morale in the Army remains high.  The discoutent in 1989 was the result of the neglect of successive Governments.  We should learn from that and not adopt <Col N="699" /> the attitude that we have a great Army on which we can call when necessary and then ignore.</P>
    <P>As my colleague, Deputy Power said, there are three Army barracks in Kildare but if they are not refurbished will soon to fall down.  I cannot understand why the Army headquarters has not been located at the Curragh.  Successive Governments have ignored the fact that it is the best location for that purpose.  I am not being parochial or constituency-minded in saying that.  As we are aware, from the decentralisation of other Government Departments many civil servants, their spouses and families, have vested interests in not relocating.  The same applies to Army personnel.  I say to the Minister that this is not a pie in the sky aspiration and should be seriously considered.</P>
    <P>There is an Army tradition in County Kildare.  I am aware that up to eight years ago it was common to find members of three generations of a family in the Army.  That has been the tradition in other counties also.  When people reached recruitment age they were able to enlist and become part of a proud family tradition.  Due to necessary cutbacks in public expenditure in the 1980s and to restraints imposed by successive Governments, that tradition has declined.  Even though some criticism has been levelled at the former Minister, Deputy Andrews, for recruiting applicants on short term contracts, that is better than no recruitment. I wish the new Minister well.  I am aware he has a difficult task, but he should recognise appropriate parameters in making decisions and try to have his Government colleagues, consider the points I have made.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that some of the buildings on the Curragh could be converted into a home or hospital for old soldiers.  I am aware that such a possibility has been explored by the Department and the Army.  I hope there will be some such development.  The Government must realise the need for a revitalised Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>My party and I fully support the motion tabled by Deputy Michael Smith.  The members of our Defence Forces are among the unsung heroes and heroines of Irish society. They are our last line of defence in the face of terrorism and lawlessness.  While we all hope and pray that the ceasefire in Northern Ireland will be permanent, we must never forget the vital role played by the men and women of our Defence Forces in combating terrorism over the past quarter of a century.  They have served us well.  People usually ignore or forget about the Army, Navy or Air Corps until there is a strike in a key service area affecting petrol deliveries, refuse collections or closing electricity stations.  Then the cry on everyone's lips is &ldquo;bring in the Army&rdquo;.  In the past, Army personnel have done vital emergency work keeping essential public services operating.  The Air Corps is constantly engaged in life-saving operations on and off-shore and its personnel have often risked their safety to save life in rescue operations at sea.</P>
      <P>There is also the vital peacekeeping work our Army has performed in trouble spots from the Lebanon to Somalia and Bosnia.  Its daily work is essential to law and order in that it helps to secure and safeguard cash-in-transit consignments.  The presence of armed soldiers is a vital deterrent to vicious gangsters.  Much of that work is humdrum, routine and unpleasant.  Manning Border checkpoints in all kinds of weather and at all hours of the day and night is not interesting and can be dangerous but is essential to the security and welfare of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make these points because there is a tendency to take the Defence Forces for granted.  They are the Cinderella arm of the State &mdash; often ignored and generally under-resourced.  This is underlined by the fact that the strength of the regular Army is 30 per cent below establishment.  That is unsatisfactory and disturbing.  For all those reasons, on behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I <Col N="701" /> welcome the initiative of the Government's Efficiency Audit Group in undertaking a major review of the operations of the Defence Forces.  Its report, and more particularly the report of the consultant the Efficiency Audit Group commissioned, known as the Price Waterhouse report, provides the basis for a comprehensive debate on the nature, functions and future of the Army. This is an initiative welcomed by everyone in the Army, and people generally who are concerned about the future of our Defence Forces.  It is most unfortunate that the leaking of the Price Waterhouse report last year, and the alarmist reporting surrounding it, should have generated so much concern and anxiety, not only within all ranks of the Army, but in the barracks towns where our Army is housed.</P>
    <P>To underline this, one has only to recall the directive from the then Army Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Bergin, last August, in which he expressed his concern regarding the &ldquo;damage to the morale and operational effectiveness of our personnel, both at home and overseas, which has been caused by the leak of the confidential consultant's report, and the related media comment and speculation&rdquo;.  That is a matter about which everyone concerned with law and order here should be concerned.</P>
    <P>More significant, in the context of the findings of the Price Waterhouse consultant, was Chief of Staff Bergin's comments in that letter to all ranks that he, along with the Adjutant General and the Quartermaster General, regarded many of the key recommendations as &ldquo;impractical, unworkable and potentially inhibiting to the maintenance of the operational capacity and future development of the Forces&rdquo;.  This is a serious conclusion by the three key men charged with running the Army and it continues to have particular significance given that the then Quartermaster General, Gerry McMahon, is now the Army Chief of Staff.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> Given the seriousness of how some of the key proposals in the Price Waterhouse report are viewed by the Army, it was unfortunate that the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, should have recently ploughed in and at least given the impression that he would take unilateral action in implementing some of the more sensitive and controversial recommendations of the consultants. Since then the Minister has adopted a more reasonable and responsible line and has rightly indicated a willingness to have full discussions and consultations with the representatives of the various branches of the Defence Forces and especially with their representative bodies RACO and PDFORRA.  I welcome the Minister's statement last night that he will meet these bodies tomorrow.  I wonder whether the timing of these meetings has anything to do with the tabling of the motion before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is as it should be. The Progressive Democrats have no difficulty in supporting the proposal before the House urging the Government to &ldquo;consult adequately with the representatives of the Defence Forces on the implications of the EAG Report on the relevance of the Defence Forces before decisions are implemented&rdquo;.  As I understand it, the representative bodies have no difficulty in participating in a major review of the operations of the Defence Forces but they rightly point out that a range of considerations have to be assessed and carefully balanced.  In other words, it is not simply an accountancy issue of how much money can be spent on the Defence Forces but the social impact of whatever programme of changes is undertaken must also be taken into account.</P>

    <P>In fairness to the EAG in its report to Government, it recommends that &ldquo;this reform programme should be developed with the full involvement of the Military Authorities&rdquo;.  Since that is the case, and given that the leaders of the Army <Col N="703" /> believe that some of the Price Waterhouse recommendations could adversely affect the operational capacity of the Army we have to be careful how we move forward.</P>
    <P>Many of the Price Waterhouse recommendations are sensible and appropriate and should be implemented.  I understand from some of the representatives of the Defence Forces that up to two-thirds of the 90 or so recommendations, dealing with matters such as operational and administrative matters, are generally acceptable and should be implemented.  Clearly, the contentious issues are the overall size of the Army; the brigade structure &mdash; whether one, two or three brigades; the size of the Army, which is directly linked to the number of brigades and the future of some of the 34 permanent barracks and posts occupied by the Army.</P>
    <P>The Efficiency Audit Group recommends that a separate study be undertaken on the emotive subject of what it delicately calls &ldquo;a programme of rationalisation of the use of facilities&rdquo;, which most of us understand as barracks closures.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment by the Minister in the House last night that this special study will be undertaken.  This is a difficult issue involving many complexities. Army barracks represent a vital economic lifeline to provincial towns.  I am aware of the important role played by Sarsfield Barracks in Limerick city and its vital contribution to life in Limerick.</P>
    <P>I hope the current debate on the future of our Defence Forces, stemming from the Efficiency Audit Group report, will result in a comprehensive Government policy on the role and future of the force.  This is something we have never had in the history of the State.  All sides in this debate accept the need for comprehensive change.  There must be an attractive early retirement scheme to improve the overall age profile of the Army.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> Major changes are essential in light of redefining the key role of the Army away from defence of the State against outside aggression, giving greater priority to its current operational role in aid of the Garda, especially in maintaining internal State security, in participating in UN peace-keeping operations, providing fishery protection services and other functions such as air-sea rescue.</P>
    <P>All sides are agreed that there is no question of standing still in the operations of the Defence Forces.  Major change is essential and must be made carefully and sensitively, in the context of full consultation with all the relevant people and representative agencies, from the military authorities to the various Army representative organisations, and the wider community.</P>

      <P>This motion in the names of Deputies Michael Smith and Power focuses on only one aspect of the EAG report, that is the location of barracks. It seems to set out to whip up fears and to exploit them for short term political purposes.  It is not concerned with the effectiveness of the permanent Defence Forces or the welfare of the members of the force.  It is cynical scaremongering by the two Deputies.  I am astonished that Deputy Power, who is a decent and honourable person, would associate himself with that.  I can only conclude that he has been led into error by Deputy Smith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to remind the Deputies opposite that the terms of reference given to the EAG by the former Fianna Fáil Minister for Defence, Deputy David Andrews, specifically provided that the study should have &ldquo;a particular reference to geographical locations&rdquo;.  I would also remind them that a new statement of roles for the permanent Defence Force was announced by the then Minister, Deputy David Andrews, on 21 September 1993.  That statement of roles was announced without any reference to the House, notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 15.6 and 28.3 of the Constitution.  That was a serious <Col N="705" /> omission by the then Minister and I invite the Deputies to look at the terms of those two Articles of the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The new statement of roles for the Defence Forces emphasised the need to focus primarily on the on-island threat of armed aggression on a contingent basis.  While this substantial change in the mission statement of our permanent Defence Force was very welcome and long overdue, it had fundamental implications for the structure of our Defence Forces and their distribution.  I have not heard any of the Deputies opposite make reference to those considerations during this debate. I invite them to tell the House, if they can, how they think our Defence Forces could fulfil the role set out for them in 1993 on the basis of a distribution of barracks and other military posts determined at various stages between the 15th and 18th centuries.  I invite them to tell the public &mdash; it would be convulsed with helpless laughter if it ever tried to listen to them &mdash; how that role could be carried out on the basis of a distribution of military posts and personnel designed for the needs of armies of occupation which moved about on foot, horseback or in horsedrawn wagons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies opposite may not yet have realised it but it is a long time since the Garda Síochána moved away from the distribution of barracks which was decided for the RIC and the Dublin Metropolitan Police.  Deputy Power occasionally passes a splendid old RIC barracks on the Curragh, Herbert House.  No one would ever pretend that there should be a Garda station at that location but it was needed there during the 18th and 19th centuries to quell the occasional rebellious moments of Deputy Power's forebears in the land surrounding the Curragh.  Are we to conclude that the Fianna Fáil Party wants our permanent Defence Force to <Col N="706" /> stay rooted in the 18th century?  Will it explain how this is relevant to the needs of the country today and how it would help us to continue to make the kind of contribution to UN peacekeeping of which we are all so rightly proud?</P>

      <P>I hope the House will have an opportunity to debate the EAG report.  So much of the document has been leaked and so much mischief has been stirred up by partial leaks that it would do all of us, in particular, the Defence Forces good if we knew exactly what we were dealing with.  I know what I am talking about because some months ago when Deputy David Andrews was Minister a somewhat incomplete copy of the report fell off the back of a lorry in my immediate vicinity.  Although it does not suit them to admit it, Deputies opposite will not be surprised to hear that a great many more important matters are dealt with in the report than have been mentioned by them in the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I invite them to reflect on the following points.  We need a permanent Defence Force which is more flexible, composed of larger units, capable of rapid deployment, with high mobility and a better teeth-to-tail ratio than the present force.  The Army needs armoured personnel carriers, additional trucks and more ranger training much more than it needs mouldering buildings which in many cases cost more to keep than they are worth.  We need to maintain our capacity to contribute to the UN.  I have reason to believe that PDFORRA and RACO agree more with me &mdash; perhaps in private &mdash; than we have heard so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are interested in maintaining a UN service, we should reflect on why there is such a high level of interest among the serving members of our Defence Forces to participate in these operations.  Real soldiers want action. <Col N="707" /> They do not want to be square-bashing or peeling potatoes which is what the tacticians opposite would be consigned to if they ever joined the Army on the basis of what has been proposed here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Much reference has been made to the need for change within the Defence Forces.  Nobody would disagree with this but it can be brought about only by real action, not consultants' report.  The role of the Defence Forces has evolved without due cognisance of the need to provide adequate resources to address their changing needs.  One of the major requirements of the Defence Forces is human resources.  While everyone agrees with the reduction in the age profile, the absence of a comprehensive recruitment policy in recent years has caused many difficulties and many young recruits do not know if they will be kept on after their five year contract. Will there be any permanent jobs in the Defence Forces and will men and <Col N="708" /> women be able to have a career?  Will the Minister give a guarantee that there will be continual recruitment to the Defence Forces?  What remedies does he propose to redress the age imbalance?</P>
    <P>While there have been many rumours about redundanc, packages, we do not know the eligibility criteria, the amount to be paid or whether the redundancies will be imposed or voluntary.  It is important to nip these rumours in the bud and address this issue as a matter of urgency.  We do not want to create any uncertainty within the Defence Forces where morale is quite good at present.  I ask the Minister to consult the representatives of the Defence Forces before taking any decisions.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 300 people, members of the Defence Forces and civilians, working in Finner Camp in my constituency.  This camp provides employment for approximately 200 families in Sligo, Leitrim, Mayo and Donegal. While there has been a welcome investment in the camp, we are looking for additional investment.  The air-sea rescue service is also located there.  The closure of the barracks would be detrimental not only to the Ballyshannon area but to the west and north west.  The people who work in the barracks cannot be transferred to Athlone, the nearest barracks to them.  It would be imprudent and ill-advised to close Border barracks. Despite the peace dividend, a rash decision to close barracks would catch us off guard and leave us ill prepared, as we were in 1969.  The Defence Forces are an integral part of the community in which I live.  People in Donegal want our barracks to remain open but they also want a modern, well equipped force and to obtain that I call on the Minister to ensure there is open and meaningful dialogue on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  We all owe a debt of gratitude to the Defence Forces who have served us well at home and abroad.  Nobody is saying that the Army should not change; of course it <Col N="709" /> should, and be flexible and mobile.  The motion calls on the Minister to consult the Army.  I understand the report of the Efficiency Audit Group, which is about to be placed before the Government for decision, is primarily based on the Price Waterhouse consultant's report which was leaked to the media in August 1994.  It became obvious at that time that there was a fundamental difference of opinion between the military general staff and the remainder of the steering group to whom Price Waterhouse reported.  Those difficulties were so serious that the military general staff felt compelled to make an independent submission to the Efficiency Audit Group.  In addition the then general staff issued a letter to all units of the Defence Forces stating that many of the comments and recommendations in the report are impractical, unworkable and potentially inhibiting to the maintenance of the operational capacity and future development of the force.</P>
      <P>As the Minister is aware, the present Chief of Staff was a member of the general staff who issued that letter.  Consequently, there appears to be a serious conflict between the general staff and the Minister in regard to the best way forward.  Having regard to the Efficiency Audit Group's plans for Dublin where &mdash; excluding the headquarters of the Defence Forces &mdash; there are more than 1,500 military personnel, I concur with the views of the general staff.  I hope this is not another attack on permanent jobs in Dublin city because we have lost too many already through decentralisation.  Under the present Price Waterhouse and Efficiency Audit Group proposals approximately 700 jobs would be axed.</P>
      <P>While the Minister may not close any military barracks during the first phase of implementation, by implementing recommendations of a fundamentally flawed report he will force the next Government to do his dirty work.  How can the Minister stand over his decision given that it is in direct conflict with the general staff the Government recently appointed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Our motion is constructive. It calls for consultation with all parties and an end to the uncertainty created by statements from the Minister in this House and publicly about implementing the recommendations of the report of the Efficiency Audit Group.  Talk of phased implementation of the report's recommendations and of no closure of barracks for three years does not help the Army, the Navy or others who may be concerned.  It merely adds to the uncertainty.  Interim measures at this stage will determine, shape and, to a certain extent, tie the hands of future Administrations.  People are suspicious that, in the context of a damage limitation exercise, the Government is endeavouring to get by until the next general election so that the next Administration will have to make the difficult decisions in this regard.</P>
      <P>We need decisions now and for that reason the report should be published. I am surprised it was not published in advance of this debate.  We have all heard about the selective leaks, people being in possession of the document and so on but, in the interest of transparency and all concerned, the report should be published.  Furthermore, not enough consideration has been given to the serious implications of the report for the Naval service.  I understand the report recommends a reduction in the strength of the Navy, which is already below required levels.</P>
      <P>As a man of the sea, I urge the Minister to give particular priority to the Navy as a total of 16 per cent of European waters is now within its remit.  In an effort to combat the illegal importation of drugs the Navy should be given powers of arrest.  I call on the Minister to publish the report and to give greater priority to the Navy in the overall scheme of things.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dukes is a friend of the bookies, not the horses.  I welcome the Minister's initiative in this regard and hope that more people, such as his fellow Corkman, Noel C. Duggan, will consider leasing horses to the Army.  I compliment Noel C. Duggan on leasing a horse to the Army and hope that trend continues.  From the time of Colonel Gerry O'Dwyer to Colonel Ringrose today we have been very proud of our Army Equitation School. It has been one of the biggest selling points of the Irish horse abroad.  There were many great Irish horses, such as Loch an Easpuig and Rockbarton. Today many of our great horses are not identifiable as being Irish because their names are changed by their new owners abroad.  I hope the Minister adheres to his commitment in regard to the Army Equitation School.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that Deputy Dukes announced the Minister's policy tonight. The Deputy wants to close every barracks, regardless of the social consequences. I am not ashamed of being parochial on this matter.  I will not tolerate the closure of Kickham Barracks, Clonmel, the only military barracks in County Tipperary.  I represent not only the military personnel of that barracks but their wives and families and support its social and the commercial aspects. Deputy Dukes outlined what the Army and public believe the Minister will do, namely, close barracks all over the country.  What the Minister is saying is <Col N="712" /> that he will not do this immediately, but following the next general election that is what will happen.  That is the interpretation of what the Minister is saying and it is causing great uncertainty in the Army.  People wishing to leave the Army are considering staying on for another year or so to avail of the package when it comes.  The uncertainty is also preventing young people from enlisting because they do not know if the barracks to which they will be assigned will be open in a few years' time.  They are fearful of being sent to a barracks outside their area.  The tradition of localised Army may vanish causing much uncertainty among its personnel.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to review the situation as the Army is vital to the social and economic life of many towns, particularly those that have been hard hit by unemployment, factory closures&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Before the debate was adjourned I was referring to the right to life of the unborn which is protected by the Constitution. This should not allow assistance to be given in aborting the unborn child.  The people have been consulted and they have been unequivocal in their attitude. They have consistently said no, that they do not want abortion to be made legal through this back door method.</P>
      <P>The medical profession is in a dilemma.  When treating a pregnant woman a medical doctor has a duty to care for his two patients.  In enacting legislation under which a doctor may assist in ending the life of one of his patients we are corrupting the noble practice of medicine.  Abortion is not necessary in treating any condition during pregnancy.  By allowing doctors to assist patients in procuring an abortion we are providing a cloak of respectability and fostering an abortion culture. If this legislation is passed women will have easier access to abortion clinics. There will also be an increase in the number of pregnancies terminated.  For that reason, even at this late stage, I call on the Minister to withdraw this obnoxious legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Last Wednesday the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party discussed this issue for four and a half hours.  Differing views were expressed. This fact has not been acknowledged by the media and the party has been attacked not only by journalists but also by cartoonists, as can be seen in one of the newspapers today.</P>
      <P>It is important to record that Fianna Fáil was not committed either to this Bill or, indeed, a more liberal version. Many Deputies, and Ministers of State, particularly Deputy O'Dea who was Minister of State at the Department of Health up to 15 December, have so stated.  Fianna Fáil is now being accused of blatant hypocrisy but what is more hypocritical is that while in the Constitution we say the unborn child is protected we are providing names, addresses and telephone numbers of abortion clinics under this legislation. That is not non-directive counselling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the trauma experienced by a woman with an unplanned pregnancy the position of doctors is difficult under this legislation in that they do not have an opt-out clause.  Doctors I met in recent days expressed concern about the doctor-patient relationship in the future. In fact, the very ethos of that relationship is changed by the Bill.  When a doctor is caring for a pregnant woman he has two patients, the mother and the unborn baby, and he has a duty to care for both.  Many doctors are concerned they could be sued under this Bill in the event of serious post-abortion side effects or the death of a pregnant woman. <Col N="717" /> The Bill should be withdrawn until the High Court rules on the application by the Dublin Well Woman Centre to have an injunction lifted.  The Government did not rush any legislation on the divorce referendum because it was awaiting the decision on the Judicial Separation Act, 1989.  The Government should defer this Bill also.</P>
    <P>In 1992 the people voted for information and for the best counselling available.  I am concerned that if this legislation is passed, which I believe it will, we will be accused of being hypocrites because we are not providing the names and addresses of clinics here while giving the names and addresses of abortion clinics outside the State.  The Fianna Fáil Party is totally opposed to the provision of legal abortion here.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement in regard to funding for CURA, Life, Cherish and other support agencies.  I also welcome his comprehensive family planning proposals in which the health boards have a role to play.</P>
    <P>Many of our second level schools have introduced sex education in an integrated way through religious instruction and biology classes.  The provision of more resources for education and counselling should be a priority in this Bill because more than 4,000 Irish women obtain abortions outside the country.</P>
    <P>In the 1983 referendum there was a 4:1 majority in favour of the proposal not to permit abortions here.  I do not believe the wishes of those people are being respected.  In order to respect their wishes there should be another referendum, which is what every local authority in the country has sought. Members of this House, and of the Seanad, who are members of local authorities have voted in favour of holding a referendum.</P>
    <P>The Minister could have achieved consensus on this issue if he had deferred the Bill.  Fianna Fáil is not aware of any reason for rushing through this legislation.  What we are having is a restricted debate in which Deputies are being allowed just a few minutes to <Col N="718" /> express their views.  I realise this is an issue that can divide people but that is not unique to Ireland or to any other country.  Although there are members in my party who hold different views from mine, I welcome the opportunity to make my contribution to the debate.</P>

      <P>I do not intend going into some of the weightier aspects of the rights and wrongs of the legislation because they have been dealt with extensively.  I agree with the expressions of regret by Deputy Kitt that, as we reach the conclusion of Second Stage, the debate is being curtailed and Members are only being allowed four or five minutes to make their contributions.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to what I believe is the unfair treatment of my party in the media since it began debating this subject last Wednesday.  That was the first time the detail of the Bill was made available to the parliamentary party. Nobody is denying that the previous Government had a Bill in preparation and that my colleagues in Cabinet intended bringing it forward.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil parliamentary party considered it incredible that the media could be of the opinion that not all of the 40 per cent who opposed the referendum on the provision of information held those views sincerely.</P>
      <P>A number of my colleagues dealt with the substantive issue.  The debate that has ensued since the Minister circulated the Bill merely goes around the substantive issue rather than dealing with what the people voted on in the referenda in 1992.  Some Bill should lead to us having a much better and caring society than we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate is not about a black and white issue.  I welcome the Bishops' statement this evening because it is conciliatory in its objective.  They have a moral right to speak to their flock and they rightly say that we, as legislators, have a difficult task in dealing with this matter.  There are very distinct differences of opinion on this issue, one of the <Col N="719" /> most contentious in the world.  Countries that permit abortions are now trying to roll back on that and some serious problems have developed as a result.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil point out that a substantial number of people opposed the provision of information referendum in 1992.  I presume the majority of those reporting on this debate were part of the 60 per cent who favoured the provision of information.  However, the lectures of some of my colleagues who expressed an alternative view were unbalanced and inaccurate.</P>
    <P>In the House, and around the country, people hold different views on how this matter should be addressed.  We are being criticised for opposing in principle the concept of the Bill.  My party will table amendments which we hope the Minister will accept.  They are intended to improve the Bill and show some compassion.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the provision of the best advice, medically and otherwise, to pregnant women.  Women go to their medical counsellor to seek his or her guidance, advice and support in a time of crisis.  We must provide every facility and service to those women to ensure they have a better choice and I have no doubt the Bill will be greatly improved by our amendments.</P>
    <P>There has been much hypocrisy in the lobbying that has taken place on this issue and a complete ignoring of the need for services, facilities and back-up support for young unmarried mothers.  I have experienced that lack in my constituency on the question of accommodation. I do not see much support for those who, having kept their babies, are in need of assistance.  The additional funding provided for support services in the Bill is a step in the right direction. Fewer babies are put up for adoption although many families want to adopt a baby.  With better services, counselling and guidance one would hope that progress will be made in that area.  It is overdue and will be very welcome.  I <Col N="720" /> support the concept of this legislation, I hope it will be amended tomorrow.</P>

      <P>I express my deep appreciation to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health, the Government Chief Whip and the Attorney General for the time they afforded me in explaining the Government position as well as listening to my difficulties in not being able to accept the Government's position on this Bill.  I mean that sincerely and my actions tonight will in no way interfere with my relationship with these men.  In fact, I sense that it will probably bring us closer.</P>
      <P>For many years I have expressed publicly my anti-abortion views which are well known.  On one special occasion, when Dr. Garret FitzGerald was Taoiseach, at a Fine Gael Party meeting I am on record as having said to him that I disagreed fundamentally and strenuously with any matter of public morality being debated in the Dáil Chamber, or going to the country on a party political issue.  This is not the proper place to settle issues like this.  None of us was elected to the House with skills or knowledge to deal with abortion.  That was not the mission that brought us in here and we are not equipped to take the right decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am now on the Government benches, yet if it had not been for an article in the press before Christmas I could have been addressing the House from the Opposition benches and many colleagues would be taking the same line as I am.  In those circumstances the Fianna Fáil Party, many of whose Deputies can now oppose this Bill, would have been on this side of the House forcing their majority on the opposition, of which I would have been a member. <Col N="721" /> You do not solve problems like the abortion issue by using majorities in Government over an Opposition; that is not the way it is to be done.  I have been long enough here to realise that and I have been around the track many times in the last 15 or 16 years since abortion became an issue in public debate.  Thank god that He has given me enough sense to recognise what is right to do and what is wrong.</P>
    <P>I have come to the conclusion that the whole abortion issue centres on emotion and that everything attached to it is emotive.  Politicians will score points off one another when they appear on television and when the matter goes into the public domain and the constituencies, the Deputy will tell his party's supporters what is his party line on this issue.  Soon we will be talking about anything and everything except the issue to be debated.</P>
    <P>If there had been time I would have implored the Taoiseach and his Cabinet Ministers not to rush into this but to give people like me an opportunity to come to terms with our difficulties with the Bill.  I am sure that if common sense prevailed they would have responded. We are all looking for a solution to this problem but it will not be resolved in this House.</P>
    <P>Any person who believes that this Bill will resolve the abortion issue is living in a fool's paradise.  it is fraught with dangers.  I have a problem in accepting the advice of the Attorney General and the former Attorney General to the Government.  It is a legal argument and I have consulted legal opinion on it from men that I have known all my public life in the city of Dublin.  There is another equally valid argument, however, and there will probably be two or three more, so the only way that the Attorney General's advice to the Government can be proven is by the Supreme Court adjudicating on it.  Until then it is purely an opinion and, unfortunately for me on an occasion like this, it is an opinion that I cannot accept because he is defining the result of the referendum as having stated clearly that <Col N="722" /> people are entitled to abortion information because of a decision of the people in the 1992 referendum.</P>
    <P>I will read the wording: &ldquo;This subsection shall not limit freedom to obtain or make available in the State, subject to such conditions as may be laid down by law, information relating to services lawfully available in another state&rdquo;.  I wonder if the people had been asked to vote on &ldquo;information made available on abortion in another state&rdquo; what the result would have been.  That section is ambiguous.  Any solicitor or lawyer will tell you that it can be interpreted any way you want.  Unfortunately, I disagree with the Attorney General on his interpretation.</P>
    <P>On the right to travel, the people voted on the wording &ldquo;this section shall not limit freedom to travel between this State and another state&rdquo;.  Who would vote against that?  It would mean that we could not go on foreign holidays, to the United States or Britain, and that I could not go across the Border to Northern Ireland.  It would be stupid for people to vote against that but if that section had read &ldquo;this section shall not limit freedom to travel between this State and another state for an abortion&rdquo; we would have got a different answer.</P>
    <P>The reason I am making this point is that most of us acknowledge that abortion is anathema to the people.  Nobody wants abortion but giving a doctor permission to give a name, telephone number and address of an abortion clinic in a foreign state is abortion by the back door.  I am not a right wing politician, I am just Mr. average.  I consider myself to be closer to the Labour Party than most Deputies in the Fine Gael ranks.  I have very strong views on abortion and I cannot allow myself to support a Bill which gives a doctor or anyone else that type of authority or power.</P>
    <P>On the question of information, the wording does not say &ldquo;information on abortion&rdquo; but &ldquo;information for services lawfully available in any other state&rdquo;. Euthanasia is available in Sweden so does this mean that someone here can go to the court and seek information on <Col N="723" /> euthanasia?  Will the doctors have to give it?  Who will give this information to the doctors?  The Department of Health?  Members of Fianna Fáil have asked if there is a fatal mistake, who will be responsible.  The Minister, his Department or the doctor who gave the information?  Prostitution is legally in many states.  Does it mean that people can go into a Garda station and ask for drugs which are legally available in Holland? If a garda says he cannot provide that information will someone say that under the Constitution he is obliged to give it.  The whole thing is ambiguous.  It is weak law.</P>
    <P>Let us try to figure out how we found ourselves here.  I live in a Border constituency and cannot help noticing that since 1980 the tension that the abortion debate has generated in the South does not exist in the North.  Why?  It is the same law, the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act, introduced in Westminster by English people &mdash; very few of them Catholic if we want to make that point although it is not very relevant to my argument.</P>
    <P>The law which prohibits abortion here dates back to the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861.  There was no talk about abortion until about 1980 when a group of people decided that somehow, somewhere, some time, some person would challenge the law in the Supreme Court and have it declared unconstitutional and every hospital in the country would then act as an abortion clinic. Most of us knew that was simply nonsense, that it would never happen.</P>
    <P>These people, for their own reasons &mdash; I do not doubt their integrity and good intentions &mdash; created an emotion which engulfed the Fianna Fáil Party. They persuaded that party and indeed the former leader of Fine Gael, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, into agreeing to a set of words to be included in the Constitution which would prohibit abortion. The story is that Dr. FitzGerald brought it to Mr. Peter Sutherland, the then Attorney General, who saw the mistakes and said it would not make good <Col N="724" /> law.  The argument then arose as to the strongest wording that could be adopted.</P>
    <P>We were called abortionists although we were arguing for the strongest law to prevent abortion.  Fianna Fáil jumped on the bandwagon for political gain. The amendment was put to the people and the weakest wording was adopted. This was claimed as a great victory by the pro-life organisation and by Fianna Fáil.  Nothing would have been done were it not for the unfortunate development known as the X case when the family involved won the hearts of everybody in the country.  That case was taken to the Supreme Court which gave a unanimous verdict in favour of the young girl leaving the State to have an abortion.  I am informed by legal opinion that, while there was a unanimous verdict, the conclusions of the judges involved were contradictory. This led to another referendum on the right to travel and to information.  Both of those items which were adopted by the people will prove to be as weak as their decision to support the wording of the 1983 amendment.  It was wrong of the Supreme Court judges to make their decision at such an emotional time immediately after the X case.</P>
    <P>This is an emotional subject.  I appeal to all parties in the House to stop trying to resolve the abortion issue here because it is not an issue on which we can win.  One difference between the North and the Republic is that in the North there is no constitution and therefore no tension although the same law applies in the North.  There is nothing to threaten it such as a written Constitution. That is what makes the law here weak.  I wonder will I hear Martin Smyth make anti-abortion speeches in the North.  From speaking to people in the Protestant community in the North I know they are as anti-abortion as we are.</P>
    <P>It has been stated in the media that I have reacted under pressure from groups such as the pro-life campaign, but that is not the case.  I received a number of calls from people whom I <Col N="725" /> suspect are members of that organisation, and to those who spoke to me in a mild, moderate, inoffensive tone, I replied in similar manner; to those who were aggressive, I was aggressive.  In the early part of 1970 when tension was high in Northern Ireland I made anti-violence speeches opposing the IRA and the violence they perpetrated on the Protestant community in the North. Night after night a great number of people paraded outside my house but did not intimidate me.  I stuck to my guns because I believed in what I was doing.  Similarly, I am taking a stance tonight because I believe in what I am doing.</P>
    <P>I would like to speak for much longer on this subject but the time limit prevents me from doing so.  The Bill has been rushed through the House.  Two weeks notice of the Bill and 20 minutes in the House to speak on it is insufficient. The Fianna Fáil Party is in disarray on this issue and members of the Progressive Democrats have been given a free vote, which is a very wise decision.  The three Government parties are constrained by a three-line whip, otherwise a greater number of Deputies on these benches would have expressed their views.</P>
    <P>Donegal went against the tide in the referendum on this matter: 16,936 people voted in favour of the amendment while 41,162 voted against it.  My mandate in this House is to represent the people who sent me here.  They voted against abortion.  I too would vote aginst it tonight, but it would not be relevant and would serve no purpose.  For that reason I shall abstain from the vote.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Harte for sharing his time with me.  A referendum was held in 1992 and the people decided to remove the prohibition on travel and the provision of information on abortion services abroad.  There is now no restriction on the provision of information on abortion services available in other states &mdash;<Col N="726" /> this not only refers to details of where such services are available but places no restriction on referral to such services.</P>
      <P>This Bill seeks to regulate and restrict where, when and in what form information on abortion services in other states can be provided to Irish women. The Bill makes it a criminal offence for a medical doctor or any other person to refer a woman to an abortion clinic.  I do not understand the argument that it liberalises the existing position; it clearly does not do so.  Information will be restricted; it is not now restricted. Referral will be a crime; it is not now a crime.  Advocating abortion as an option will be forbidden; that is not now the case.  The Bill therefore is the minimum required to put into legislative effect the decision of the people in the referendum of 1992.  I am disappointed a more generous interpretation of the people's decision is not being enacted.  It is nonsense that a doctor or counsellor, having advised a woman of all the other options to pregnancy termination available to her, is criminalised if they advise the patient as to the best facility for the service she is determined to have.  It is a serious intrusion by the State in the special doctor-patient relationship.</P>
      <P>Much has been said inside and outside this House on this issue and the word &ldquo;hypocrisy&rdquo; has been used regularly. We all recognise that up to 5,000 Irish women travel to Britain each year to have abortions and do so without the benefit of prior or post abortion counselling. Perhaps the provisions of this Bill, which will enhance the level of counselling, will result in a reduction in that number.  A sizeable number of Irish women will continue to opt for pregnancy termination &mdash; the figures stands at 10 per cent.  Is it not hypocrisy of the highest level that we simply and knowingly export the problem and refuse to allow such services to be provided at home?  That surely is an Irish solution to an Irish problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Attorney General, we are told, has advised the Government that a Bill of this type <Col N="727" /> which did not permit giving names and addresses of abortion clinics outside the State would be unconstitutional.  The logical implication of that advice in general terms is that it is now lawful to provide that information.  This Bill, therefore, does not make it lawful for the first time to provide such information, as the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution already did that.</P>
      <P>The most that can be said of this Bill is that it acknowledges or redeclares what is, in any event, the law.  If there were no such Bill, the Attorney General would, in the light of his advice, to the Government, be bound to go to court to uphold the right of women to receive names and addresses and if necessary to support the position of such women in any court proceedings taken against them on this matter.  This Bill does not give women any new rights nor does it amount to even a modest advance in their position.  It is, on the contrary, at best a deeply demeaning and begrudging acknowledgment of women's rights in modern Ireland as decided already by the people.</P>
      <P>If this Bill were simply an acknowledgment of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution I would have no objection to it in principle, but it is much more than that.  It couples that acknowledgment with a series of criminally sanctioned prohibitions which demean the intelligence of women, bring the law into disrepute, interfere with legitimate freedom of speech, subvert the position of the Irish media and invade the proper privacy, confidentiality and trust which characterises the relationship between patients, women patients in particular, and their doctors. In every respect this is a shamefaced and shameful Bill.  It will, as time goes by, head the list of contemptible and embarrassing Irish statutes.  Just as the collective idiocy which led to Irishmen and women requiring a doctor's prescription to buy condoms, it is being suggested that this Bill is a politically expedient measure and a compromise.  I reject that description of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="728" /> Some Members have argued with sincerity that the principle of the Bill is right but that it needs amendment. What is the principle of this Bill?  I can quote extensively from Government speakers and I do not have to elaborate that this Bill does everything it possibly can to prevent the Fourteenth Amendment from having any real meaning, short of taking away from women the right to know the names and addresses of abortion clinics in England.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 to 12 create a series of entirely new offences that strike at the heart of a liberal and democratic State. Section 3 makes it a criminal offence for anyone to import publicly what is termed &ldquo;Act information&rdquo; unless the information is truthful and objective and is not accompanied by &ldquo;any advocacy or promotion of the termination of pregnancy&rdquo;.  Section 3 will necessarily make many British newspaper articles, magazines, radio and television programmes incapable of lawful publication or retransmission in this State.  It will also, as currently drafted, arguably criminalise any Irish author or broadcaster who participates in or contributes to such publications as they will be seen as &ldquo;procuring the publication&rdquo; of &ldquo;Act information&rdquo; in breach of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I reject the effort of the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, and the Government to reintroduce mass censorship, not merely of the print and broadcast media, but also of the basic right to freedom of speech.  I reject as wholly fanciful the notion that any woman would attend at a public meeting to gather &ldquo;Act information&rdquo; on her own pregnancy and since the section permits unlimited advocacy of abortion and transmission of &ldquo;Act information&rdquo; in private and by people to whom section 5 does not apply, the section is clearly no protection for the unborn but a case of creating a nauseating false facade of public morality.</P>
    <P>The only section with which I am in sympathy is section 4 which deals with unsolicited propaganda and billboard advertising.  Section 5 clearly applies to medical doctors.  It proposes to prohibit <Col N="729" /> and criminalise any doctor who, in the circumstances of the girl in the X case, advises that girl or her family that she should have an abortion.  The section makes no exception of the circumstances recognised in the decision of the Supreme Court in the X case where it was found that a woman has a clear constitutional right to have a pregnancy terminated within or outside the State where &ldquo;there was a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother&rdquo;.  The Supreme Court held in that case that such a risk was not confined to a risk of immediate or inevitable death.  In those limited cases it would be the right, if not the duty, of any doctor to give a woman his or her professional advice one way or another as to whether she would have an abortion.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how the Attorney General, for whom I have great respect, can possibly advise the Government that the right of a woman to have her pregnancy terminated in the circumstances suggested by the Supreme Court decision in the X case is vindicated by a law which prohibits her trusted advisers from recommending such a course or advocating it on good medical grounds.  Nor can I see how in those circumstances section 8 (1) can possibly be constitutional.</P>
    <P>The failure of this Bill to take on board the rights of women as found by the Supreme Court in the X case probably stems from the fact that it was in gestation when the substantive issue legislation was also being contemplated. Whatever the reason, the deep constitutional flaw here is that there is no provision for a woman in the circumstances of the girl in the X case and this Bill prohibits her doctor from giving her advice which he is now lawfully entitled to give her.  In that context this Bill is flawed, holed beneath the waterline and will be found, if it is referred to the Supreme Court, on that basis alone to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been represented by Government Ministers and speakers as being mandated by the Fourteenth <Col N="730" /> Amendment.  The Fourteenth Amendment does not oblige this State to enact a Bill of this type with the draconian criminal penalties and the clampdown on ordinary democratic behaviour, freedom of expression and ordinary relationships between doctors and patients.  It is false to claim that it does. I have come to the conclusion that the Bill is unconstitutional because of the damage it does to the doctor-patient relationship.  It is inconsistent with the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg in the &ldquo;Open Door&rdquo; case.  Section 6 is inconsistent with the judgment of the European Court of justice in the Grogan case.</P>
    <P>If section 5 and 8 infringe the Constitution on the grounds set out in the X case, sections 6 and 7 offend the Treaty of Rome and section 3 offends the European Convention on Human Rights, this is a very worthy monument to the Minister's respect for the Constitution and the rule of law.  It is an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  The Minister has a sad legacy.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the media have focused on the intricacies of the sham battle between the Minister and the pro-life lobby without any regard to what the Bill implies for a liberal and demoractic State, for the constitutional rights of women, as decided by the Supreme Court, for free speech and for the media.  Where is the ever vocal NUJ now?  Where are the champions of civil liberties?  Where are the civil rights organisations which speak out so frequently on other matters?  This Bill should have been opposed by all those bodies.</P>
    <P>I was attracted by the argument of the late professor John kelly in 1983 that the Eighth Amendment should be accepted on the basis that, while unnecessary, its defeat could lead Ireland in the wrong direction.  Now I am totaly guided by the maxim &ldquo;once bitten, twice shy&rdquo;.  This Bill, if passed will come back to haunt us and it will not fade away and gather dust on the shelf.  Prosecutions will be brought <Col N="731" /> under its provisions, magazines will be banned under it and programmes will be taken off air because of it.  There will be disputes in the courts about it, doctors will be referred to the Medical Council because of it and will be subject to harassment by people trying to gather evidence to discredit and disgrace them. That is what this Bill is all about.  Anyone who thinks that by passing this Bill all the problems will fade away should remember what happened at the time of the Eighth Amendment.  Those of us who thought that the issue had gone away were rudely awakened to reality when the Bill came back to haunt us and we discovered that it had become a charter for a small self-appointed group of moral policemen to harass those in society with whom they strongly disagreed. This Bill is also a charter for that and we should not cod ourselves because that is what it will be in the last analysis.</P>
    <P>I have come to the general conclusion that the majority of people want to steer a humane and cautious middle course between the extreme proposition that, on the one hand, a fertilised ovum is a human being with full and equal rights or, on the other hand, that an unborn child, no matter how close to full term, is disposable at the option of the mother.  I completely reject the notion that any female is obliged to carry a pregnancy to full term where conception was based on rape, incest or sexual abuse of a child.  As Deputy McCreevy said, many Deputies, if concerned with members of their own families, would take a different view from the hectoring moralising to which they have been subject from a small self-elected minority.</P>
    <P>I also reject the notion that any woman who faces a real and substantial risk to her life should not be free to receive proper medical advice and full medical assistance to avert that threat. The prohibition in section 8 on doctors taking active steps to ensure the safety of their women patients is unconstitutional. Contraception should be made widely available.  The present high rate <Col N="732" /> of abortion among Irish women reflects inadequate access to proper contraception rather than any differnce in moral outlook.  I completely reject the suggestion of some of the pro-life movement which would ban the use of the morning after pill on the grounds that it would murder a cell or a handful of cells.</P>
    <P>The travel and information amendments were accepted by the majority of the people with clear knowledge of what was involved.  I cannot accept the suggestion that those who urged a no vote in 1992, as the pro-life campaign did on the Fourteenth Amendment and other amendments, were misled in any way.  The then Minister for Health acknowledged on television that names and addresses would be furnished as a consequence of the Fourteenth Amendment. The pro-life movement opposed the amendment in November 1992 because it would make lawful the provision of what is termed in the Bill &ldquo;Act information&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I mention these matters to illustrate that there are many complex and subtle aspects of the abortion issue which cannot be reduced to simplistic formulae. The people understand these complexities far more deeply and profoundly than some of the self-appointed experts and moralising pundits.</P>
    <P>In the light of these opinions and of the fundamental wrong which this Bill, if enacted, would constitute I am opposed to it in principle.  It casts shame on the House because it betokens a sense of collective dishonesty on our behalf.  It achieves nothing of substance for women except ignominy for those asked to acquiesce in the passage of this Bill.  Since it achieves nothing new we would be better off without it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the irony of voting with those whose views are in many, though not all, cases radicallly opposed to my own but since I cannot identify any significant principle of the Bill with which I can agree and since I disagree in principle with nearly all of it, bar section 4, on constitutional, legal and moral grounds I feel obliged in conscience to oppose it.</P>

      <P>I acknowledge that the vast majority of Deputies, including the Minister for Health and his Minister of State, are against the killing of the unborn.  I also acknowledge that under the terms of the Fourteenth Amendment to the 1937 Constitution there is a constitutional inperative whereby the House must legislate on the provision of information.  Where we part company is on what the information should consist of and the manner in which it should be imparted.</P>
      <P>I take issue with those who have implied or stated expressly that Fianna Fáil did not have the right to make a decision on this matter.  Last autumn Fianna Fáil decided that prior to the Cabinet agreeing to it the party would discuss the terms of the information Bill.  It is history now but nonetheless, it is important to point out that no such Bill came before Government while Fianna Fáil was in power.  At no stage did the Fianna Fáil Party consider an information Bill.</P>
      <P>A great analyst once said of a democrat's position: &ldquo;I do not agree with what you are saying but I would die to defend your right to say it&rdquo;.  I would remind Government backbenchers and others that the test of any democracy is whether it allows opinions to be expressed.  There was a democratic meeting of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party and in an exercise in transparency, openness and accountability, to use those much abused words, the party decided by a majority that it was opposed in principle to this Bill.  Let no one run away with the idea that the party did that to gain political advantage or that it was done for the sake of opportunism.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  Conflicting and opposing views were expressed.  There was no diktat.  It was a democratic decision made by a democratic party and I ask people to accept that in all honesty and sincerity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="734" /> The Minister made much play of the decision of the European Court of Human Rights.  The court's judgment was delivered on 29 October 1992, a week after the information amendment Bill was debated in the Dáil and long after the proposal was first mooted in the aftermath of the X case.  It cannot be argued that any consideration arising from the judgment formed any part of the public presentation of the information in question in the preceding months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Such considerations are irrelevant to the Minister's task of regulating the provision of information in the light of the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Even if it was the hope or intention of some of the advocates of that amendment that such assistance would be rendered lawful, nowhere was such an intention made explicit, certainly not in the Government's booklet explaining the basis upon which voters were invited to support the amendment.  It is unacceptable for the Minister to argue that he has no option but to render such assistance lawful &mdash; assistance inherently in conflict with existing provisions in the Constitution.</P>
      <P>The amendment provides for the regulation by law of the information to be provided and it is incumbent on the Minister to have regard to the requirement of a harmonious interpretation of the Constitution.  In a Supreme Court judgment in 1982 Mr. Justice Henchy said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any single constitutional right to power is but a component in an ensemble of interconnected and interrelating provisions which must be brought into play as part of a larger composition and which must be given such an interpretation as will fit it to an harmonious interpretation with the general constitutional order and <Col N="735" /> modulation.  It may be said of a Constitution more than any other legal instrument that &ldquo;the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Not only is the Minister not obliged to but he may not interpret the concept of information, neutral in itself, in a way in which would entertain an intolerable contradiction in the law, namely that while affecting to protect the unborn child against abortion it should be lawful to assist in the procuring of that abortion as long as it takes place outside the State.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered also there was little or no debate on the information issue, it having been represented largely as if it were a matter of removing undesirable censorship.  Let us remind ourselves that there was a general election on the same day as the referenda, which dominated public debate.  Such debate as did take place on the abortion issue, subsequent to the calling of the general election and to the publication of the Government's booklet for the guidance of voters, was largley confined to the so-called substantive issue of abortion itself, on which there was already considerable confusion and misunderstanding. The public was left to rely largely on that booklet for an explanation of what was intended.  If by &ldquo;information&rdquo; was meant abortion assistance provided for no other purpose but to facilitate the destruction of human life, that was nowhere stated, even by implication.</P>
    <P>The European Convention on Human Rights is not part of Irish law and cannot override the Irish Constitution. I do not believe any Irish person would accept that any external legislative or judicial body should have the authority to limit in any way the extent to which we may protect the lives of unborn Irish children.  Everyone knows &mdash; and we have been reminded repeatedly over the past few years &mdash; that Europe has no interest in our abortion laws, that these must be and are entirely a matter for the Irish people alone to <Col N="736" /> decide.  The judgments of the European Court on Human Rights against a member state are not legally binding, and certainly not in this instance.  They are not part of Irish domestic law, despite the fact that the Minister tried to pretend otherwise, nor can the principles they support become part of Irish law if those principles conflict with the Irish Constitution.</P>
    <P>We have stated repeatedly over the past week or so that the Government should await the outcome of the High Court case.  The Minister says the Attorney General advises that the Bill must allow the giving of the names and addresses of abortion clinics.  I remind the Minister that this is the very point at issue in the case of Dublin Well Woman Centre versus the Attorney General already initiated in the High Court.  Mr. Justice Costello heard an application from SPUC to become involved in the action because the Attorney General was not opposing the Well Woman application.  Mr. Justice Costello agreed to allow SPUC argue the case, with the right of appeal to the Supreme Court, because of the clash of interests involved and &ldquo;the fact that the issues raised were of considerable national importance&rdquo;.  No matter what may be anybody else's view, the High Court considered there was a serious point to be argued.  Even if the present Attorney General is following Mr. Whelehan's opinion, the fact remains that the High Court has decided that the argument against the constitutionality of the giving of names and addresses is not frivolous or absolutely without foundation.</P>
    <P>There is no question of there being a constitutional right to have an abortion abroad.  The unborn child's constitutional right to life is not geographically limited and it would be a wrong interpretation to read into the travel amendment a right to have an abortion outside the State.  The effect of that amendment simply was to remove the power of injunction under Article 40.3.3 to prevent someone from travelling abroad; it did not establish a right to have an abortion in England, nor did it <Col N="737" /> cancel the unborn child's constitutional right to life.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons the only sensible course the Minister and Government can take is to delay further consideration of this Bill pending the decision of the courts on the very point that is disputed.  After all, that is what was adopted as the correct procedure by the Government in relation to introducing legislation allowing for a referendum to be held on the issue of divorce.  The Government decided it would not legislate pending the decision of the Supreme Court on the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act of 1989.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I thank all Members who contributed to this debate.  Their contributions ranged from the profound to the bizarre, from the compassionate to the uncaring, but everybody is entitled to their views.  Even though I had occasion to doubt the sincerity of some Members, at least I agree they reflected opinion in this country in the diversity of their views.  It is my hope also that the introduction of this Bill has not caused too much grief to colleagues on all sides of the House because I understand there was a lot of representation and much lobbying on the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was a very difficult Bill to draft, having to follow a difficult, narrow path between competing constitutional rights.  We are all aware of the constitutional position since the 1983 amendment was passed and the explicit right to life of the unborn was enshrined in the Constitution.  The equal right to life of the mother has also been enshrined in the Constitution but, since 1992, those two rights can be vindicated only in a manner which does not violate freedom to travel or access to information which all citizens enjoy.  That brought about circumstances in which there are many competing constitutional rights, rendering it difficult to draft legislation without bumping into one or other of <Col N="738" /> those competing rights.  Nonetheless I believe I have done so in the Bill presented to the House.</P>
    <P>Many Members have suggested amendments.  Amendments to the Bill will be equally difficult to draft because of the competing constitutional rights and the amount of case law that has accumulated already, but as a number of amendments have been tabled already and others will be I will consider them on their merits.  If they are appropriate to the Bill and go to its improvement, I will accept them, subject to whatever drafting changes the Attorney General's office considers necessary.</P>
    <P>One amendment, familiarly known as the conscience opt-out clause, has caused a lot of debate and concern within the House.  There is nothing whatsoever in the Bill which compels anybody to give information about abortion &mdash; that is implicit in everything said in the Bill &mdash; but if, for presentational reasons or reasons of easier understanding, such an amendment is considered to be necessary on Committee Stage, I should like to hear Members' views.  I have no rooted objection to its inclusion in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Some colleagues have suggested that the Bill is unconstitutional.  Among those, Deputy Alan Shatter made a very strong case.  I have been advised that the Bill is constitutional &mdash; I would not have presented it on any other basis &mdash; but I should like to tease out the arguments made by Deputy Shatter on Committee Stage.  He has great expertise on all aspects of family law and his views are most welcome.  Deputy Shatter, among others, suggested that the Bill should be referred by the President to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution.  That is entirely a matter for the President but I am very much aware of the reassurance the general public derives from the provisions of Article 26.</P>
    <P>We shall be voting on the Second Stage of this Bill at 10 o'clock this evening.  As every Members knows, the vote on Second Stage asks whether one agrees or <Col N="739" /> disagrees with the principle of a Bill.  Having listened to this debate, I fail to understand how anybody can vote against the principle of regulating the manner in which information may be provided in accordance with the wishes of the people expressed by a 60:40 majority in 1992. The text of that amendment itself requires us to legislate.  The heads of the Bill were prepared, by and large, by the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats coalition Government.  Substantial work was carried out on it by my predecessor, Deputy Brendan Howlin, in the Fianna Fáil/Labour coalition Government and the present Fine Gael/Labour/ Democratic Left coalition unanimously agreed its introduction.  All parties in this House had a hand in this Bill; all parties in Government agreed the principle of this Bill.  I cannot understand how they would disagree with that principle on the floor of the House this evening.</P>
    <P>Despite that, Fianna Fáil has advanced three grounds for opposing the principle of this Bill.  First, they have said the Bill would allow persons to supply names and addresses of abortion clinics and hospitals to pregnant women, and they disagree in principle with that proposal.  That is not so.  There is no reference to names and addresses in the Bill.  That is a constitutional right since the people voted on the relevant amendment in 1992 and both the present Attorney General and his immediate predecessor have vouched for that.  Fianna Fáil has now dropped this argument and indicated that it will not seek to amend the Bill in this way but rather oppose it, on principle, on different grounds.  They say the Bill was badly handled, rushed through, giving them no chance to consider its provisions. I challenge that contention. What is being said is not true.</P>
    <P>I would point out that paragraph 29 of A Government of Renewal specified that the legislation would be introduced as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; is as soon as I have it ready, get it through Government to introduce <Col N="740" /> it to the House and have agreement on it with our partners in Government.  On the Order of Business on 7 February, the Leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy Harney, asked the Taoiseach when the Bill would be introduced and he told her quite bluntly that it was imminent.  I know that other Deputies, including Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, were not here that morning and may not have heard that.  An assurance was given in this House on 7 February and Deputies who were listening would have known that in the normal course of parliamentary language we were within a few weeks of the publication of the Bill.  The Cabinet agreed it at the first available Cabinet meeting on 21 February and it was published on 23 February.  I postponed its publication for a day so that it would not clash with the publication of the Framework Document.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has read the detailed guide issued with this Bill would know it was not a rushed job.  As well as an explanatory memorandum every Deputy was issued with a detailed guide, the most detailed one ever issued with a Bill.  An agreement to take Second Stage last Thursday was reached following consultation with Deputies Ahern and Harney.  The introduction of the Bill was not rushed.</P>
    <P>Deputies across the House have decided now that they will oppose Second Stage on the grounds of a court case pending.  That case commenced nine years ago and is now before the High Court.  We know the contending parties, that in all likelihood the case will be appealed to the Supreme Court and will certainly be before the courts for another two years.  Other cases may arise also on associated issues and which may result in litigation.  Are we to duck, dodge, weave and bob for a generation before we carry out our constitutional obligations?  There is no guarantee that the court will deal with this issue, it may simply raise the injunction.  That was the advice of the then Attorney General, Mr. Whelehan, when he advised the Government that in effect there was no <Col N="741" /> case.  What are we waiting for?  A complex judgment may be handed down. Many Deputies appear to act as if a judgment in this case will give us the heads of a Bill.  They should look at the judgment in the X case and ask how you put that into the heads of a Bill if you are waiting for the Supreme Court to give them the heads on which they can easily legislate.</P>
    <P>None of the three grounds put forward by Fianna Fáil in opposing this Bill stands up as a matter of principle on examination of the facts.  It is blindingly obvious that there can be no objection in principle to this Bill by any party in this House, but there can be from people outside the House who advocated a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote because that was &mdash; and is &mdash; their principled position. However, that is not the position of the parties here because everybody participated in one way or another in preparing this legislation.  However, if Fianna Fáil still intends, as appears to be the case, to vote against the principle of this Bill, so be it.</P>
    <P>I would like to put another principle before the House tonight.  Members are elected to legislate for all the people without fear or favour in accordance with the Constitution and should not be inhibited from doing their duty by forces outside this House who seek to intimidate us.  I call on all Deputies by their vote to reject the intimidation of TDs, attempted by Youth Defence and <Col N="742" /> other fringe groups.  I call on all Deputies by their acclamation for this Bill tonight to reject the pressure put on them by various interlocking organisations, both overt and covert, which constitute the pro-life movement.  I call on all Deputies to reject the intrusion into our proceedings by a High Court judge who in a piece of ludicrous hyperbole sought to involve us in the guilt of the new holocaust.  I call on all Deputies tonight to reject those who would reach back into the mists of history and try to pressure us with the ghostly weapons of bell, book and candle.  That has not been done since the War of Independence when people like Deputy Deasy's father were excommunicated by the bishop of Cork.</P>
    <P>I call on Fianna Fáil to stand for the primacy of Dáil Éireann.  I call on Deputies on all sides to ensure that the word goes forth from this House that this Dáil, with Seanad Éireann, in accordance with the provision of the Constitution, makes the laws by which the people live their lives.  That is the principle and I want the Bill to be passed by acclamation.</P>

      <P>In recent weeks there has been a procession of members of the Government to south Galway but, unfortunately, they did not bring any gifts with them.  Last week the frustration of the people who live in the areas which have been flooded spilt over onto the national airwaves.  I am asking the Minister to provide the type of assistance which would have been provided if this flooding had occurred in Dunboyne, Ballymun or Tralee.  If the flooding had occurred in those areas we would have seen the great spirit of generosity the Government professes to have.</P>
      <P>The Government does not seem to be taking this problem seriously because it occurred in Counties Galway and Clare. The affected districts of the two counties should be declared disaster areas and the efforts of State and other agencies, including the Army should be co-ordinated in a proper way.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry seems to be involved in one aspect and is not interested in any other aspect while the Department of the Environment says this matter is the responsibility of the local authority and that the Office of Public Works also has a responsibility.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, said on a local radio programme that he would make a case to the European Commission on behalf of the people of south Galway and the Government.  Yet shortly afterwards on the same station one of his colleagues who has extensive experience in the European Parliament and has had dealings with the Commission and its agencies said he did not know where his colleague was going because no such aid or compensation was available from the European Union.  This type of passing the buck is not a good enough response to the people of the area.  The Government should stand up and be counted on this issue and provide assistance for these people who are suffering.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It concerns me that the response from Government has been negative.  There is no indication that it intends taking <Col N="747" /> action apart from providing the £2 million for agriculture.  I welcome that allocation and hope it will be adequate.  The serious damage to property, houses and roads must be addressed urgently.</P>
    <P>The grant for national roads in my county is approximately half that of last year.  I was appalled to discover today that the level of funding for county and regional roads is £3.8 million compared with £5.1 million last year.  Even without the recent appalling weather conditions, such a reduction in funding would have created great difficulties.  In the context of appalling weather conditions, we are facing a serious disaster and I join my colleagues in calling on the Government to face up to it honestly and honourably and provide for those who are suffering.</P>

      <P>I endorse what my two colleagues have said.  There is a serious crisis in the west.  To put the matter in context, on 27 January last people from Ballinasloe had to vacate their houses and have not been able to return to them.  People in Dunmore, Curragh West and Williamstown have had to leave their houses, rent accommodation and move and sell stock.  The same position prevails in Clonfert, Meelick and Eyrecourt in south east Galway.  There are major problems with the rivers Suck and Punkellin and in other parts of the county and constituency.  We are asking the Government to act immediately to co-ordinate all the activities.  We are calling on the Minister, Deputy Higgins, to ensure there is proper co-ordination and that the State agencies are directed to act in a positive manner.  In particular, we are calling on the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to pay all livestock grants immediately, to waive compliance regulations and allow farmers sell their stocks because of the difficulties in moving them and the cost and shortage of fodder.</P>

      <P>The problem associated with the recent flooding countrywide, caused primarily by the excessively high rainfall over a prolonged period, has been the subject of many debates in both Houses of the Oireachtas in the last few weeks.  In all of these both I, and my predecessor Deputy Hogan, have endeavoured to provide a positive response and have outlined in detail the specific measures being taken by the Government to meet the needs of those most seriously affected.</P>
      <P>I take this opportunity to restate the position and to update Deputies on developments in the interventing period.</P>
      <P>On the suggestion that certain parts of Counties Galway and Clare should be declared disaster areas, I have serious doubts as to the merits of such action or the terms under which it might be taken. While it might have the short term effect of stressing the need for immediate remedial or compensatory measures, this could well be outweighed by long term adverse effects, such as depreciation in property values and a negative impact on tourism in the region.  It is my view, and one shared by many, that it would be more prudent to initiate the implementation of a remedial works scheme aimed at minimising the risk of a recurrence of the problem, especially when we consider the severe hardship suffered by many house owners in particular.  I intend to do this.</P>
      <P>In this connection I assure the House that I am very familiar with the problems in Counties Galway and Clare. Indeed it was a priority of mine to visit the areas to apprise myself of the position first hand.  The unique geology of the south Galway area particularly makes the solution of the problem especially difficult.</P>

    <P>Two studies have already been carried out, one by the Geological Survey <Col N="749" /> of Ireland following the extensive flooding which occurred in 1990 and another by the Office of Public Works following the 1994 floods.  Neither of the reports subsequently produced reached definitive conclusions as to the exact cause or causes of the drainage problems, but both concluded that they could not be easily or economically remedied.</P>
    <P>Further detailed surveys are required to determine the regime of the groundwater in the region and in consequence the precise causes of the flooding.  By now Deputies will be aware that my office published today an advertisement in the national press of its immediate intention to commission a study to accurately define the extent, nature and causes of flooding, identify recommended technical and/or non technical solutions, identify the ecological and environmental consequences of recommended solutions, and indicate costs and benefits.  Consultants interested in undertaking the study have been invited to submit proposals to the Office of Public Works.  This survey, a prerequisite of any scheme of works, will be undertaken with all haste.</P>
    <P>It is also intended to put a number of other commissions in place to design flood defence schemes to protect other areas where serious problems have occurred.</P>
    <P>To meet the expense involved, I am happy to note the Government has decided to provide a Supplementary Estimate for the Office of Public Works later this year.  All the schemes will commence in 1995.</P>
    <P>The Government also approved the heads of a Bill to amend the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 and has directed that it be given priority for drafting. That Bill will be introduced in the Seanad at the earliest possible opportunity and will be enacted into law as soon as possible thereafter.  It will enable the Office of Public Works to undertake schemes to relieve localised flooding and meet fully the requirements of all who spoke on this matter in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>Of the other issues listed in the <Col N="750" /> motion Deputies may rest assured that the relevant State and public service agancies will be available at all times to lend assistance and provide their expertise as required.  A one-stop-shop co-ordination all the services will be established in Gort before the end of this week.</P>
    <P>In this connection the Government has directed that my office be the lead agency in dealing with the widespread flooding problems and has instructed it to prepare a full report for deliberation next week.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works it is my responsibility, one which I do not take lightly, to chair the interdepartmental committee set up by Government to co-ordinate its response to the recent emergencies.  This committee was convened for the first time yesterday when I was able to receive submissions from the many departmental officials present.  We are now merging the various statements made with a view to formulating a co-ordinated response plan in the event that the recent widespread problems recur.  I will pursue the matter further early next week.</P>
    <P>On the need to provide special aid to affected people, I can only reiterate the measures already taken.  The Government's immediate response was made in the context of the 1995 budget whereby a special compensation package was devised to compensate farmers for loss of fodder and livestock.  A fund of £2 million was established for this package and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry announced that payments will be made quickly.  I am assured there is no basis for fears expressed that the scheme is too narrowly focused, to the extent that only a few may benefit; the guidelines are fairly wide ranging.  An additional allocation of £4 million was made for the repair of county roads.</P>
    <P>Existing measures include the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which enables health boards to respond to exceptional or urgent needs including those arising from flooding.  However, as there have been very few applications <Col N="751" /> for assistance to date, I have requested the Minister for Social Welfare to consider the possibility of publicising the scheme more widely, especially in the Western Health Board area which covers the area in question.  Advertisements in this regard will be broadcast shortly on Galway Bay Radio.</P>
    <P>I am travelling to Brussels tomorrow to present Ireland's case for assistance from the special EU fund for victims of flooding.  It is intended that any funds secured will be distributed by the Irish Red Cross Society.  Such funding is being channelled through the society in other member states.  The Irish Red Cross Society has a proven ability to distribute such funds successfully, having done so on a number of occasions, most recently in 1993.</P>
    <P>I am also endeavouring to seek funding for the long-term resolution of the flooding and drainage problems which occur all too frequently in Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  It is an understatement to say we are disappointed with the allocation for non-national roads.  We expected an effective response from the Department to the opening of roads in the Border region as part of the peace process, some of which have been closed for 20 years.  In 1984 the total allocation from the Department of the Environment was £3,687,000 made up of discretionary EU co-funding, money under the local improvement scheme and money for specified cross-Border roads.  This year it was reduced by £64,150.  Included in the allocation is £1,100,000 of INTERREG funding.  We were told by EU officials in Brussels <Col N="752" /> that that money would be additional to the funding given to the area, but when one takes into account that this is for specified cross-Border roads approved by the Department, the allocation is substantially reduced.  In addition the EU co-financed £450,000 which is specified for two roads in the county.  The funding will be in excess of £1.5 million. We have only 50 per cent of our funding for county and regional roads.  Some counties, far removed from the Border, received substantial funding under INTERREG, something we asked the Department not to proceed with as in other years.</P>
      <P>As a member of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body, I was vicechairman of a subcommittee which carried out a study of cross-Border transport, trade and, more recently INTERREG.  We put the case for additional funding for Border roads to Commissioner Bruce Millan who assured us that any money granted would be additional.  In this case it is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Leonard, for the opportunity of contributing and fully endorse his remarks.  The very serious infrastructural deficiencies in the Border counties are well documented.  I do not need to tell the House again about the totally inadequate roads network in towns like Cavan and Monaghan.  In the past few months, particularly since the cessation of violence in Northern Ireland, a new urgency has been attached to the need to remedy the serious infrastructural deficiencies in the Border region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government Ministers and the European Union have committed themselves to provide additional funding, apart from national Exchequer funding.  Over this period we have been consistently told that funding from the INTERREG II programme and the Delors package would be additional to normal funding. In response to questioning by Deputies Leonard, O'Hanlon and myself the Minister for Finance stated on 28 February: &ldquo;It is my intention to ensure that <Col N="753" /> the moneys will be additional&rdquo;.  To our extreme disappointment we learned this morning that at the first opportunity to honour its commitment the Government substantially reduced the allocation for regional and county roads to Cavan County Council and to Monaghan and used the new funding from INTERREG II in part substitution for the inexcusable cutback in the national Exchequer contribution.</P>
    <P>The 1994 allocation to Cavan County Council was £4.641 million.  The 1995 allocation is £4.085 million, a decrease of almost £600,000.  Those figures cloak the reality because, within the latter figure is £1.3 million of INTERREG funding. In effect, the people of Cavan are suffering a decrease of almost £1.9 million for regional and county roads in the allocation made by the national Exchequer this year.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to urgently review these allocations and give effect to the many promises made that there would be a peace dividend for the people of the Border areas, that the serious infrastructural deficiencies would be remedied and that the necessary inward investment would be made possible by upgrading the roads network and improving other infrastructures. The Minister in his recent decision neglected the Border areas and I appeal to the Minister of State to convey to the Minister our extreme disappointment and urgent request for further funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this issue and welcome this opportunity to address the House on this important source of funding for non-national roads and to clarify the basis for the allocations the Minister has just announced for non-national roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to place the issue of the 1995 road grant allocations in proper context.  The overall allocation of almost <Col N="754" /> £103 million is indicative of the Government's major commitment to non-national roads.  While the provision is marginally less than the 1994 provision of £107 million, the resources provided in that year were significantly boosted by a once-off allocation from the receipts of the tax amnesty.  When this exceptional allocation of £15 million is excluded, the 1995 grants are up on the underlying 1994 provision by 12 per cent and by an even higher amount on the allocation for any previous year.</P>
    <P>The resources available to the Minister have been allocated to local authorities under two categories of grants, first, as discretionary or block grants &mdash; the overall provision for these grants is £60.568 million &mdash; and, secondly, as specific grants for improvement works which are important for employment and economic activity.  The total provision for the latter is £42.33 million in 1995 made up of £34.33 million under the EU co-financed scheme of specific grants introduced last year and £8 million under the INTERREG II Community initiative for Border and certain maritime areas.</P>
    <P>The major portion of the provision available in 1995 for allocation to county councils as discretionary grants &mdash; almost £46 million out of nearly £51 million &mdash; has been allocated on a <i>pro rata</i> mileage basis with the exception of the three Dublin county councils which received somewhat higher allocations because of traffic volumes, wear and tear, management needs etc., in their areas.  This approach is consistent with the method used to determine road grant allocations in previous years.</P>
    <P>The balance of the discretionary grants provision for county councils, i.e. £5 million in 1995, was reserved for the purpose of making supplementary allocations to a number of councils in counties in which the condition of roads is particularly poor.  The Minister determined the amount of the grant allocation to the councils concerned having <Col N="755" /> regard to the situation in each county. This practice is also consistent with the approach adopted by his predecessors.</P>
    <P>Urban authorities received the remaining £8 million available as discretionary grants with individual allocations determined on the basis of population size.</P>
    <P>The framework programme pertaining to the Border areas element of INTERREG II was approved recently by the European Commission and funding of £6 million is being provided this year to eligible county councils.  Details of the programme will be sent shortly to the councils concerned and they will be invited to submit road improvement projects meeting the criteria of the grants scheme.  The Minister has sought to facilitate the councils concerned in drawing up their proposals for funding under INTERREG II by including indicative allocations under this heading in the 1995 non-national road grants he has notified to them.</P>
    <P>Allocations totalling £5.7 million have been made to the six front line Border counties of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo and the remaining £300,000 has been shared equally between Longford, Meath and Roscommon county councils which qualify for limited funding under the programme.  Payment of these indicative grants is conditional on each council putting forward sufficient qualifying projects so as to be in a position to expend its allocation in the current year.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances there are no grounds for allegations that councils concerned have not received their due entitlements under this Community initiative.</P>
    <P>I expect that some councils will have hoped to receive higher allocations than they did, particularly in view of the new source of funding afforded by the INTERREG programme.  These expectations would have been unrealistic in <Col N="756" /> the case of many of the councils concerned because of factors such as the fact that funding available for non-national roads in 1994 was boosted by the once-off injection of £15 million from tax amnesty receipts which is not available for the current year and the inclusion of special allocations totalling £500,000 in the 1994 grants in connection with road works associated with the Shannon-Erne Waterway which was opened to cruisers last year.  The need for similar funding does not arise in 1995.</P>
    <P>Councils qualifying for INTERREG assistance received allocations totalling £1.1 million in 1994 for pilot schemes intended to promote community involvement, in money or kind, on road works in their areas.  These grants were identified as being over and above the normal grants for the councils concerned. The pilot scheme concept, which was initiated in 1992, now has a proven track record and in the circumstances the practice of giving special grants for pilot works to a small number of councils has been discontinued.</P>
    <P>Councils in Border areas were told in 1994 that their EU co-financed specific grant allocations took special account of the absence of INTERREG funding in that year and, in the circumstances, allocations under that grant scheme were higher than would obtain once the INTERREG programme was approved.</P>
    <P>In the counties work on the reopening of cross-Border roads was completed or substantially completed in 1994 with the result that grant allocations for this purpose are not required or can be reduced this year.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the House will agree that the benefits of INTERREG funding have been channelled to the areas entitled to such support.</P>

      <P>When the Minister of State was on this side of the House he complained vociferously when the relevant Minister of State was not present to reply.  I am now making the same point.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter in response to serious and growing public concern about a spate of violent crimes involving the use of firearms.  What steps does the Government propose to take to stem this tide?  A number of legislative measures are urgently needed.  What is the Government's current policy on bail?  For how long is it going to hide behind the Law Reform Commission on this subject?  Does the Government have a policy on the right to silence? There is widespread concern among senior ranks of the Garda Síochána and the legal profession that the right to silence will have to be modified to enable the forces of law and order to tackle organised crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On operational matters, is it the intention of the Minister for Justice to reconstitute the special squad that was disbanded in the 1980s?  Members of the Garda Síochána have told me on a number of occasions that this is essential if they are to tackle organised crime. What does the Minister propose to do about the policy on tenure of office <Col N="758" /> which has been introduced in the Garda Síochána under which members of the force are transferred into and out of the detective branch like Lanigan's Ball? Such a policy was introduced in the United Kingdom ten years ago but has since been reversed as it proved to be a disaster.  Yet, senior management within the Garda Síochána have decided, lemming like, to introduce this crazy policy which is having a devastating effect in the detection of crime.</P>
    <P>There is a crisis of morale within the Garda Síochána and a crisis of confidence among the public, who have never had such a poor perception of the effectiveness of the Garda at any time in our history.  The detection rate has dropped alarmingly from 47.7 per cent in 1973 to just under 33 per cent at present and continues to decrease.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister reverse her decision announced recently to implement the money laundering provisions of the 1994 Criminal Justice Act as and from 2 May next?  We pointed out several weeks ago, following the robbery in Dublin in which £2.8 million was taken, that if these provisions were not implemented immediately the perpetrators of that crime would be able to launder the proceeds.  I presume they have now done this.  Unless these provisions are implemented immediately the perpetrators of the recent violent crimes will also be able to launder the proceeds with impunity.  This would be in no one's interest except that of the criminals.  I do not know the reason for the delay.  In the next few days the Minister should implement these necessary provisions to make it easier to detect these criminals and prevent them from laundering their ill-gotten gains.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my absolute abhorrence of the use of firearms in a number of incidents in Dublin recently. The best wishes of the entire House will be with those who were shot and their families.  The Garda will do all within its power to bring those responsible to justice.</P>
      <P>Crime is always unacceptable but the use of firearms in the commission of crime is especially reprehensible and must be deplored in the strongest manner. No civilised society can allow the rule of the gun to replace the rule of law.  While violent crimes may only be a small percentage of overall crime, I am not in any way complacent about the situation. With the Minister for Justice, I am determined that all possible measures be taken to deal with armed crime.  To this end, in 1995 the Minister is providing the largest allocation ever made to the Garda to ensure that it has the necessary resources to deal with this and other types of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I caution the Deputy regarding his view that the incidents add up to a serious escalation of crime involving the use of firearms.  While we cannot afford in any way to be complacent about armed crime and the crime problem in general, we must at all times be careful to set out, correctly and precisely, the <Col N="760" /> extent of the problem.  In 1993 there were 723 armed robberies and aggravated burglaries in which firearms were used.  However, in 1994, this figure had declined to 582 &mdash; a reduction of nearly 20 per cent.  This significant decrease in armed crime is a measure of the resolve of the Garda to deal effectively with this most serious of problems.</P>
    <P>With regard to the implementation of the anti-money laundering measures contained in the 1994 Criminal Justice Act, I am happy to be in a position to inform the Deputy that the Minister has recently made a commencement order to bring sections 32 and 57 of the Act into operation on 2 May next.  These sections require banks and other financial bodies to carry out identification checks to prevent money laundering and to report to the Garda Síochána where they suspect that laundering is taking place in relation to their business. They supplement other provisions of the 1994 Act, in particular, the money laundering offence and the power to confiscate criminal proceeds and to obtain restraint orders to seize and freeze suspected criminal assets which came into force on 14 November 1994.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Act was enacted on 30 June 1994.  Detailed administrative guidelines for the implementation of the anti-laundering provisions have been in preparation by a steering committee which was established in April 1994.  The guidelines are being finalised and the thousands of employees who will operate sections 32 and 57 of the 1994 Act are due to receive appropriate training.  Accordingly, 2 May was chosen, following consultation with the relevant parties, as the operative date of the sections to ensure they will be introduced effectively and comprehensively from the very beginning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment and I <Col N="761" /> appreciate the Minister of State taking the time to reply.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware of the recent incident in Waterford city involving a young boy, Ian Swan.  I do not intend using the five minutes available to me to go into the details of that incident which are well known.  No society, and certainly not my community of Waterford city and county, would tolerate such an act being perpetrated at any level.  The child in the case referred to was exceptionally lucky to escape with his life.  That incident does not represent the wholesome activity and involvement of that community in the many issues relating to the well-being of their area. One or two incidents of this nature can depict a picture of an area that simply does not exist.</P>
      <P>I want to be circumspect in dealing with the general matters that are coming to a head because the vast majority of people living in the Ballybeg area of Waterford are actively involved within their community.  I am thinking of St. Saviour's, the hurling and football club, the soccer club, other community developments within the area and the community project operated under ADM. The community puts enormous effort into the well-being of the area but, for some time, there has been a growth of sinister activities within that area perpetrated by a few people.  While those acts are certainly intolerable by any standards, we must now deal with them. I commend the gardaí who have been involved in this area for some time.  The Minister will be aware there is a high level of unemployment and social disadvantage that is obviously compounding the problems in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to raise the issue of the need to locate a Garda substation in that general area.  I was astonished to find out that the number of gardaí based in Waterford, the fifth city of the country, is the second lowest ratio of gardaí per head of population in Waterford city. The gardaí themselves are aware of that also.  The area to which I am referring is the Ballybeg, Lisduggan, Larchville and Lismore Park which has a population of <Col N="762" /> 16,000.  I hope the Department of Justice will respond to my request by locating a new Garda substation in that area.</P>
    <P>There is only one other substation in the city which happens to be in the area in which I live.  It is an old substation but one can see the fruits of the Garda involvement in the local community. They live in the community and are aware of everything that is going on. The people of Ballybeg and that general area have consistently requested me and other public representatives to raise the issue of a Garda presence in the area. Surely a population of 16,000 warrants a local Garda station.</P>
    <P>The provision for the new Garda substation should not come out of existing resources.  The gardaí in Waterford are stretched to the absolute limit.  There is only one garda permanently involved in the neighbourhood watch scheme in that area, he does a tremendous job, but it is like trying to keep the tide back with a pitchfork &mdash; because of the resources currently available.</P>
    <P>We need additional resources, more gardaí in general in the city but, specifically, a Garda substation to be constructed in that area as a matter of urgency with proper resources available to it in terms of manpower and all the other facilities required to run a first class professional facility that is deserved by the people of that area.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will convey to the Minister, who I accept cannot be here this evening, my views on this matter.  I have been circumspect this evening but I would be happy to outline many cases in more detail for the Minister if so required.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter which has caused concern not only in Waterford but throughout the country and which made very bad reading in our newspapers.</P>
      <P>As a parent I would like to begin by expressing grave concern at the very serious alleged assaults which took place on 7 February 1995 and on 7 March 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="763" /> I understand from the Garda authorities that a Garda investigation into the incident on 7 February 1995 is nearly completed and a file will be forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions in the near future.</P>
    <P>The alleged assault which took place yesterday is being investigated by the Garda with a view to a file being forwarded to the DPP.</P>
    <P>However, in so far as the general issue of bullying is concerned, parents should have no hesitation in reporting such matters to the Garda where they feel that is the appropriate action.  The criminal law is there to protect all members of society, including school children.  I can assure the House that all complaints with regard to breaches of the criminal law will be vigorously investigated by the Garda and appropriate action taken.  I welcome the Deputy's commendation of the gardaí in the area.</P>
    <P>The Ballybeg area of Waterford is policed by the gardaí at Waterford station.  The present strength at Waterford station is 115, as compared to 112 <Col N="764" /> last December.  A community garda has been assigned to the area since mid-1993, while another community garda has been assigned to the nearby Lisdug-gan-Larchville-Lismore area.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that the present policing arrangements are adequate to meet the needs of the area. However, the position will be kept under review and any changes considered necessary will be made.  In that context, the comments made by the Deputy this evening will be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>There are no plans to establish a Garda substation in the south-west area of Waterford city.  In fact, such a move could impact negatively on the policing arrangements for the area as gardaí would have to be diverted from police duties on the streets to perform administrative tasks at the station.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  He can be assured that the Department will closely monitor the situation.</P>

      <P>At the end of January, I had a meeting with heads of Government Departments and offices in relation to the strategic management initiative.  As the Deputy will be aware a co-ordinating group of Secretaries oversees and facilitates the implementation of the strategic management initiative and reports to Government on any changes, including legislative changes, necessary to enable individual Secretaries to manage more efficiently and effectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that this group has held a number of meetings with heads of Government Departments and offices in relation to plans and strategies within individual Departments and in relation to any service-wide reform measures.  I expect that these discussions will continue over the coming months as the process is brought forward in Departments. It is the intention that there will <Col N="543" /> be widespread consultation in relation to any reform measures which emerge from that process.</P>
    <P>I know that the ultimate success of this important initiative is dependent on a co-operative approach by all the parties involved.  I believe that working together in a positive way we can achieve the real potential of the Civil Service.  The role of Minister of State Deputy Avril Doyle, is an important one in this context.  I have asked her to consult with interested parties in relation to the SMI and, in particular, to make arrangements to keep Opposition parties fully informed of developments.</P>

      <P>Early last year concerns were expressed in the media about the accuracy of official statistics for trade and economic growth, and in particular for exports.  The previous Government in response, established a interdepartmental group in July 1994, to examine the matter.  The report of that group is expected shortly and we must await its consideration by Government before determining what action, if any, may be necessary.</P>
      <P>As regards the validity of official statistics, particularly relating to GNP and GDP, I am satisfied that the figures for economic growth published by the Central Statistics Office are accurate. These statistics are compiled in strict conformity with international methodology and they represent the best available estimates.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>In its recent report, &ldquo;New Approaches to Rural Development&rdquo; the National Economic and Social Council sets out its belief that a unified, location based approach to service provisions in rural ereas should be actively explored.  In response to the NESC report, I have responsibility for overseeing the implementation of a pilot programme to see how best a range of public and essential services can be secured and delivered in remote rural areas.  My intention is to test on a pilot basis a more integrated approach to service delivery and thus to stimulate an innovative approach to the provision of these services at local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first step in establishing the pilot programme will involve consultation with the relevant bodies concerned. Consultations will be undertaken with the relevant Government Departments represented on the Interdepartmental Policy Committee on Local Development. There will also be consultations with many organisations in the public and voluntary sectors and at local community level.  In order to ensure the widest possible involvement of local communities in this process, a number of seminars are to be held at local venues in the western region to discuss the <Col N="547" /> issues involved and to agree a programme of action.  These seminars will be held before the end of May and they will be widely advertised.  It is through this process of consultation that a small number of suitable sites for pilot programmes will be identified.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>In reply to Questions Nos. 9, 57, 61 and 64 on 2 February 1995, I told the House that the Government had authorised the drafting of a Constitution Amendment Bill to provide for the election by emigrants of three members of Seanad Éireann.  If the Bill is approved by the people at a referendum, ordinary legislation would be necessary to govern voting by emigrants at Seanad elections.  Proposal for such legislation will be announced well in advance of the referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At Seanad university elections, an extension of the franchise to graduates of third level institutions could be effected by ordinary legislation, without further constitutional change.  A resolution adopted by the Upper House on 2 November 1994 called for the introduction of such legislation.  This is an important issue in its own right and worthy of careful examination.  It will be <Col N="548" /> considered by the Government in due course.</P>

      <P>It is a general principle of Government policy to promote balanced regional development.  The National Development Plan, 1994 to 1999, and the Operational Programmes under the Community Support Framework all aim to give effect to this policy.  The ongoing decentralisaton of Government Offices is another facet of the policy.</P>
      <P>The policy agreement, A Government of Renewal, includes two specific provisions which should contribute towards balanced regional development. The first of these is the commitment to expand the role of regional authorities to include the preparation of regional development strategies which would take account of the strengths and opportunities of each region and include appropriate objectives for each region. The second is the proposal to draw up a national land use policy plan to provide guidelines for both national policy decisions and planning authorities in relation to the location of agricultural, industrial, forestry, aquacultural and tourism developments.  I would also draw attention to the decision to appoint a Minister of State with special responsibility for co-ordinating the Government's commitment to western development and rural renewal.</P>
      <P>In the last analysis, settlement decisions are largely matters of personal choice.  However, implementation of the Government's policy on balanced regional development, with an improved dispersal of services, should offer people a greater choice of location and have a beneficial impact on settlement patterns.</P>

      <P>The most recent statistics available to my Department in relation to waste recycling relate to 1993 and indicate an overall recycling rate of 7.4 per cent in relation to the combined household and commercial waste streams. The recycling rates for individual materials within this combined municipal waste stream were: paper, 19 per cent; glass, 21 per cent; plastic, negligible; metals, 24 per cent; textiles, 14 per cent.</P>
      <P>The strategy document &ldquo;Recycling for Ireland&rdquo; which was published in July 1994 set an overall target of diverting from landfill some 20 per cent of household and commercial waste by 1999. The 1999 target for packing waste is a minimum recovery rate of 30 per cent for this overall waste stream.  This is based on a recovery rate of 55 per cent for glass and a recovery rate of 25 per cent for each of the other packaging materials (paper, plastics, metal).</P>
      <P>The achievement of these targets is being pursued in a number of ways including the preparation of comprehensive legislation on waste management, the provision of support for investment in waste recovery facilities, and the work of the IBEC Task Force on recycling.</P>

      <P>Directive 85/337/EEC on Environmental Impact Assessment has been transposed into Irish law for all relevant categories of development, including peat extraction.  The implementing Regulations subject peat extraction to planning permission and Environmental Impact Assessment requirements where the area involved is 50 hectares or more. Large scale projects likely to have significant effects on the environment are now, therefore, subject to planning control.</P>
      <P>The planning system is just one instrument in nature conservation policy, primary responsibility for which rests with my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  I understand that proposals to put Natural Heritage Areas on a statutory footing are being developed by my colleague, and that work is in progress also on the preparation of measures to transpose Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and wild flora and fauna into national law.  These developments will be of major significance for peatland conservation.</P>

      <P>A lengthy and comprehensive review of the national road system was brought to a conclusion with the making of the Roads Act, 1993 (Declaration of National Roads) Order, 1994 on 14 July 1994.  The traffic requirements of Border areas were among a wide range of issues considered during that review.  I do not therefore propose to make any major changes in the national road network in the immediate future.  Traffic patterns in Border areas will continue to be monitored so as to identify any long term changes, arising from the cease-fires and the reopening of cross-Border roads, which might have implications for the classification system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>Each local authority is responsible, as the housing authority for its area, for the planning, initiation and construction of housing and serviced caravan parks for travelling people assessed as in need of such accommodation and unable to provide it from their own resources.  My Department's responsibility is to provide the funding required by the authorities for the provision of such accommodation and a general advisory and supervisory service to ensure that technical standards and cost control procedures are observed.</P>
      <P>A separate financial allocation is provided to local authorities for the construction of serviced caravan parks for travelling people and the authorities have been informed over the years that additional resources would be provided, in any year, where needed for the construction of such parks.  The original annual provisions in each of the last four years were exceeded.  The 1995 provision has been increased to £4.5 million which also includes provision for the construction of new group housing schemes for travelling people.  This approach has been taken in the light of the interim report of the task force on the travelling community which recommended that a specific capital allocation, separate from the general housing construction allocation, be made for the construction of group housing schemes for travelling people.  I will sympathetically consider any further recommendations relating to accommodation which may be included in the final report, which I understand will be finalised by the task force later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities were advised in September 1994 that they should initiate proposals for serviced caravan parks, where they are required having regard to the latest assessment of need, for <Col N="561" /> inclusion in their 1995 housing programme. When notifying the authorities of their new housing &ldquo;starts&rdquo;/ acquisitions for 1995 on 23 February last, I requested from them details of the serviced caravan parks and new group housing schemes they propose to start this year.</P>
    <P>Apart from serviced caravan parks and group housing schemes, members of the travelling community are allocated local authority houses and they, like others, should benefit from the increasing number of dwellings now becoming available for letting due to the expansion of the local authority house building programme since 1993.</P>

      <P>To relieve the workload on the Molesworth Street Passport Office and to facilitate the public, temporary passport offices were established at three locations in the Dublin suburbs in the period May to August, 1994.  Since then a number of developments have helped to ease the pressures on the Molesworth Street Office.  There has been a significant increase in the staff of the Office.  The Passport Office in Cork is being enlarged and upgraded and will soon provide a full passport service for people in Munster.  I am also currently <Col N="564" /> looking at other ways of improving the passport service to the public and hope to be in a position to announce details of a new service very shortly.</P>
      <P>In the light of these developments, I am satisfied that the Passport Office in Molesworth Street will be in a position to provide a good service to the public throughout this Summer without the need for suburban offices.</P>

      <P>The funding is available to voluntary bodies through the Department of Foreign Affairs Vote, and the Vote for International Co-operation, under a number of headings as follows:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Development Co-operation</i>
      </P>
      <P>A large number of voluntary bodies receive assistance for development projects and emergency relief work in developing countries under subheads C and E of the Vote for International Co-operation. They include developmental non-governmental organisations such as Concern, Trócaire and Goal, missionary orders carrying out relief and developmental work and, on occasion, indigenous NGOs in developing countries. Assistance is also given to emergency relief projects carried out by international voluntary bodies, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross.  The details of all of these grants are published annually in the Department's Annual Report on Official Development Assistance, copies of which are available in the Dáil Library &mdash; the latest available report is the 1993 report and the relevant Annexes are 3, 11, 12(d), 14, 17 and 20.  The 1994 report is currently being prepared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="565" />
      <i>North-South and Anglo-Irish Co-operation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Funds are available under subhead F of the Vote for Foreign Affairs to encourage North-South and Anglo-Irish co-operation.  This is achieved by assisting organisations involved in reconciliation work and in efforts to create better understanding between people in both parts of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain.</P>
    <P>Grants of £115,000 and £240,587 were made from the subhead in 1993 and 1994 respectively.  The following voluntary organisations were assisted in 1993: Anglo-Irish Encounter; Co-operation North; Between; The Irish School of Ecumenics; Northern Ireland Children's Holiday Scheme; and Children's Community Holidays.  These organisations were also assisted in 1994 and funding was in addition made available to the Glencree Reconciliation Centre; and the Warrington Project.</P>
    <P>The allocation for subhead F for 1995 is £311,000, including grants to the Glencree Reconciliation Centre and Cultures of Ireland, which were provided for in this year's budget.  In the context of this year's allocation, I will be deciding shortly on the individual allocations to be made to a number of organisations which are currently making a valuable contribution to North-South and Anglo-Irish co-operation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Irish Immigrant Groups in the U.S.</i>
    </P>
    <P>Funds are available under subhead C of the Department's Vote to assist Irish immigration advice and welfare centres in the United States.  In this regard, grants of £150,000 were made in 1993 and again in 1994.  Details of the recipients of grants in 1993 and 1994 and the individual amounts they received were given by me on 22 March 1994 and 19 October 1994 respectively, in response to questions from Deputy McGinley.  A sum of £150,000 has again been set aside in 1995 for distribution to welfare advice groups in the US working with Irish emigrants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="566" />
      <i>Cultural Relations with Other Countries</i>
    </P>
    <P>The sum of £213,000 was available under subhead G of the Department's Vote for 1993 for the promotion of Irish culture abroad.  The allocation was increased to £400,000 in 1994 and has been maintained at that level for 1995. Individuals and groups, including those of a voluntary nature, may apply for funding for suitable projects under this heading to the cultural section of the Department.  In 1993 some 217 grants were made available and this rose to 326 in 1994.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Contributions to Bodies in Ireland for the Furtherance of International Relations</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Irish Council for the European Movement (ICEM) and the Irish United Nations Association (IUNA) received a grant of £5,000 each in 1993 and again in 1994 under subhead E of the Department's Vote.  Having remained static at £10,000 for a number of years, the allocation to the subhead has been increased to £14,000 in the 1995 Estimates.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The provision of speech therapy services in the North-Eastern Health Board area is a matter for that board in the first instance.  Additional funding of £1.5 million was provided in 1993 and a similar additional sum in 1994 for the development of services for people with physical disabilities, including speech therapy.  With its share of this additional funding, the North-Eastern Health Board approved a total of four additional speech therapists.  Furthermore, the board is holding discussions with the Department of Education about the establishment of special classes for children with speech and language disorders in the Cavan-Monaghan and Louth-Meath catchment areas.</P>
      <P>This year, a further £2 million is being provided for the development of physical disability services.  The North-Eastern Health Board will be giving consideration to making further improvements in its speech therapy services from its allocation of this additional funding, taking account of other service needs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The report, The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly stressed the need to develop a range of services for people with dementia, including alzheimer disease, and their families.  The report was adopted as official Government policy towards the elderly.  Between 1990 and 1994 an additional £21 million was made available to the health services to implement key recommendations for the report, including the strengthening of home and community support for people with dementia and their families.  The investment by boards in additional community nursing, day care, respite services and nursing home places has increased the support available to sufferers of alzheimer disease and their carers.  The care of those with dementia is clearly emerging as a priority for many boards, a development which I fully support.  This year, an additional £7.5 million is being made available to improve further health and welfare services for the elderly and their carers.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board provides a range of services for alzheimer patients and their carers including general practitioner and public health nurse services. The Community Care Programme also provides, either directly or through voluntary agencies, day services, including home support, home helps and meals on wheels.  The general hospital services provide respite and continuing care services in their facilities for the elderly and in nursing homes for elderly patients assessed as suitable for such placement under the provisions of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assessment beds are available in St. Vincent's, Fairview, and St. James's Hospital while there are respite beds located in James Connolly Memorial Hospital and St. Patrick's Hospital.  Day hospital places are also available in these three locations.  Funding has been made available to provide a similar range of services in Community Care <Col N="570" /> Areas 1 and 2 by the health board in conjunction with St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park, and the Hospitaller Order of St. John of God.  The specialist units for the elderly mentally infirm already in existence at Vergemount and Tivoli Road.  Dún Laoghaire will be an integral part of this service.  I might add that the Tallaght Hospital, which is under construction, will include six beds for a psychiatry of old age service.</P>
    <P>In the board's remaining catchment areas, the above mentioned services are provided by general psychiatrists who use beds for assessment and continuing care as appropriate.  The Eastern Health Board also provides a grant to the Alzheimer Society of Ireland towards the respite and day care services provided by them.</P>
    <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, which commenced on 1 September 1993 widens the options available to those caring for relatives with dementia.  Under the Act, health boards may pay a subvention towards the cost of care in a nursing home of a person who needs that care and who does not have the resources to pay that cost. Almost £15 million will be available this year to fund subventions under the Act.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 85, 86 and 87 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Medicinal products included in the <Col N="571" /> general medical services &mdash; GMS &mdash; scheme must conform to certain published criteria.  A key criteria is that the product must be the subject of a current product authorisation granted by the Minister for Health.  The granting of such an authorisation indicates that the National Drugs Advisory Board is satisfied as to the quality, safety and efficacy of the product concerned.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to the drug referred to by the Deputy is that it has not yet received such an authorisation. In the circumstances, therefore, its inclusion on the GMS scheme cannot be considered until such time as an application for a product authorisation has been made and granted.</P>
    <P>As the product does not have a product authorisation, and cannot, therefore, be marketed on the Irish market there is no commercial price available.  Usage will vary from patient to patient, however, I understand from some of the companies concerned that the ingredients cost of the drug for a single patient could vary from £800 &mdash; £1,500 per month.</P>

      <Quest>in view of the case of a person (details supplied), his views on whether it would be more practicable to transfer patients to other hospitals in the area if the hospital on call is experiencing difficulties in dealing with all emergency patients, particularly during the winter months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East)</NameTxt>
      <P>The accident and emergency departments of the six major hospitals in Dublin operate a 24 hour service.  Because of the nature of the work, it is not possible to predict the workload of hospital accident and emergency departments at any particular time.  Accordingly, delays do occur from time to time, particularly during the <Col N="572" /> winter when there has tended to be an increase in the number of patients presenting at accident and emergency units for treatment.  At all times, however, priority is accorded to those patients most in need of immediate medical attention.</P>
      <P>In addition, periodic increases in the number of patients requiring admission to hospital results in patients having to be placed in temporary accommodation, pending the availability of more appropriate facilities.  I am informed that in this particular case the patient was placed on a standard accident and emergency trolley.  I can assure the Deputy that every effort is made to keep this practice to a minimum.</P>
      <P>The arrangements whereby hospitals were &ldquo;on call&rdquo; on a rota basis finished on 31 December 1991 when all six major Dublin hospitals were given the necessary resources to provide a 24 hour accident and emergency service.  Generally, the six accident and emergency hospitals in Dublin can cater for the number of people who present for treatment. However, one of the principal causes of delay in placing patients in the most appropriate type of accommodation has been the shortage of suitable facilities for elderly patients who are no longer in need of acute hospital care. The shortage of more appropriate facilities results in elderly patients having to remain in acute hospitals longer than necessary, consequently reducing the number of beds available for admissions through accident and emergency departments.</P>
      <P>As an immediate response to this problem, I have recently provided £850,000 to the Eastern Health Board to provide additional alternative accommodation for patients in acute hospitals, who no longer require acute care.  Placing such patients in accommodation more appropriate to their needs eases the pressure on the acute hospitals and reduces the delays in admitting patients to hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The management of the accident and emergency service in the Dublin area is <Col N="573" /> carried out under the auspices of a steering committee which includes representatives of the six accident and emergency hospitals and is chaired by the Eastern Health Board.  This committee follows closely the operation of the accident and emergency service and provides a means to facilitate co-operation between the hospitals involved in the accident and emergency service to ensure the smooth operation of the service.</P>
    <P>These co-operative arrangements include provisions whereby hospitals experiencing an increase in accident and emergency activity can seek to have ambulances diverted to other hospitals for a period of time, allowing the hospital to deal with those patients already at the accident and emergency department.  This arrangement which operates under the supervision of the chief ambulance officer, Eastern Health Board, provides a mechanism whereby attendances at accident and emergency departments can be managed in a manner which takes account of the workload in individual hospitals.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to the accident and emergency departments is monitored by my Department on an ongoing basis and I would like to assure the Deputy of my continuing concern that the accident and emergency hospitals in Dublin are enabled to respond effectively to the demands placed upon them.  I will continue to monitor the situation with a view to taking further action if required.</P>

    <P>The Deputy will recall that the figures for the years 1987 and 1988 reflect the then Government's policy to seek significant reductions in Exchequer spending, resulting in a substantial diminution in funds available to this Department. The period 1990 to 1992 takes account of special provisions including expenditure on national pay agreements, the catch-up process on elements deferred in previous years, and a phased reinvestment in certain service areas.</P>
    <P>The 1995 level of non-capital expenditure determined for the hospital is £15.980 million.  This level of expenditure will allow the hospital to continue to provide its full range of services.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Child Care Act, 1991, provides a statutory obligation on health boards to provide a range of child care and family support services for children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.</P>
      <P>In the case of children who are homeless, health boards are obliged to make all reasonable efforts to provide appropriate hostel, residential or family placement for them.  My Department has made it clear to health boards that the placement of children in bed and breakfast accommodation is not an acceptable response to the problem of youth homelessness. If, in cases of emergency, there is no alternative to the placement of a homeless child in this type of accommodation, my Department has advised health boards that immediate steps should be taken to secure an appropriate hostel, residential or family placement for the child.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the abstraction of detailed information in regard to each voluntary body grant-aided under these subheads during the years 1993 and 1994 would require considerable diversion of the already limited resources available to my Department. I should also point out that a significant amount of the information requested by the Deputy in regard to 1993 is already available in the Appropriation Accounts for that year and the 1994 Accounts will be available in due course.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy wishes to obtain information relating to grants for any specific voluntary body, I will, of course, be glad to assist in any way I can.</P>

      <P>I do not propose, at this stage, to provide for the use of speed limits of less than 30 mph which is the standard built-up area limit.  International experience has confirmed that such lower limits, applied in isolation, do not have any significant impact on vehicle speeds. Accordingly, where road authorities wish to restrict vehicles to a speed lower than 30 mph, they should first utilise appropriate traffic claming measures under section 38 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994.  The use of lower speed limits can be further considered in the light of experience with the use of such measures.</P>

      <P>The provision of a swimming pool built to my Department's guideline specification can cost up to £2 million, approximately.  The overall cost of a particular pool depends on such factors as land acquisition and development costs; the design of the facility and pool size; the type and scale of ancillary facilities that may be provided; and the level of consultancy and other fees that may be incurred.  Other factors are the competitiveness of tenders, and trends in building costs when the project goes to construction.  These factors can vary considerably from project to project.</P>

      <P>Excluding assistance provided through schemes administered by local authorities, my Department has provided grant assistance since 1993 to voluntary bodies engaged in the following activities: (a) housing research and other housing related activities; (b) group water schemes; (c) promotion of environmental awareness; and (d) cave and mountain rescue.</P>
      <P>In addition, certain miscellaneous bodies, such as the Dublin Civic Trust and the Waterford Civic Trust, have been assisted on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  Some £2.8 million was expended in 1993 and £2.7 million in 1994.  I expect that about £3.5 million will be expended in 1995 by my Department in grants to voluntary bodies.</P>

      <P>My Department has not yet received a proposal from County Dublin Vocational Education Committee regarding the development of playing fields.  When a proposal is received it will be considered on its merits having regard to all the circumstances. However, the provision of playing facilities is the responsibility of the school authorities and the cost of providing such facilities has to be met from the schools own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="596" /> Due to present demands on the available capital resources, for some time priority has been given to the provision of essential teaching spaces.  As a result it is not possible in present circumstances to grant-aid the provision of playing pitch facilities at existing schools without such facilities.</P>

      <P>Assistance is provided by my Department to all schools towards the provision of the school books for necessitous pupils.  Schools designated as disadvantaged are specifically targeted under the schemes concerned.</P>
      <P>In 1994, in the case of primary schools designated as disadvantaged, I provided funding over and above the basic grants to encourage such schools to establish book rental and loan schemes.  The intention was that the schools could use the funding as seed capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year, I have increased the provision for book grants for needy pupils at primary level by 26 per cent to £2.46 million.  The increase will be used to <Col N="597" /> further encourage the establishment and maintenance of rental and loan schemes with a bias in favour of primary schools designated as disadvantaged. Additionally, a sum of £65,000 from the disadvantaged fund will be allocated for this purpose.</P>
    <P>At second level in 1994, I provided £391,000 to 86 schools designated as disadvantaged for the purpose of setting up rental schemes, where such schemes did not operate previously.</P>
    <P>The provision for the overall scheme for necessitous pupils has been increased by 31 per cent to £4.2 million this year.</P>

      <P>The exemptions referred to in paragraph 64 of the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, arise under the Statutory Instruments Act, 1947.  In cases where a statutory instrument or a class of instruments are of local or personal application the provisions in the Act requiring widespread publication and circulation need not be complied with if the Attorney General so directs.</P>
      <P>There are very few circumstances where such exemptions apply in my Department.  The attached schedule sets out four instances which give an indication of the issues covered.  In the time available to research the matter I cannot guarantee that these are the only instances where exemptions arose, but this appears to be the case and no such exemptions have been sought or granted for many years.</P>

      <P>Exemptions granted under section 2 (3) and (4) of the Statutory Instruments Act, 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The following exemptions from the provisions of the Act have been made: (i) Regulations made under section 53 of the Vocational Education Act, 1930 relating to grants made to vocational education committees from moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  This was a class exemption made on 5 March 1948; (ii) Instruments made under the Intermediate Education (Ireland) Acts, 1878-1924 <Col N="602" /> relating to the annual rules and programme for secondary schools.  This was a class exemption made on 28 May 1948; (iii) Regulations made under section 110 (2) of the Children Act, 1908 relating to the expenses incurred in detaining children and young persons in places of detention.  This was a class exemption made on 25 May 1948; and (iv) Orders made under section 10 of the School Attendance Act, 1926 as amended by section 89 of the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930 relating to the time and mode of appointment of members of school attendance committees.  This was a class exemption made on 25 February 1949.</P>

      <P>All prisoners who are found to be drug dependent have immediate access to medical services skilled in managing problems with drugs.  In addition they have access to a full range of psychiatric and psychology services within the prison system and they may receive outside hospital treatment as required.  Community-based agencies who are involved with the treatment of drug addiction problems also regularly visit the prisons to counsel offenders.  Offenders who show the necessary commitment to rehabilitation, and do not appear to pose a threat to the community, may be considered for release to attend community-based drug treatment centres, and where appropriate they are supervised by the Probation and Welfare Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The departmental policy document &ldquo;The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan&rdquo; contains in Chapter 13 a discussion of the drug problem.  It indicates that it is planned, through the medium of the Departmental steering Committee which is in place to implement the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Communicable Diseases in Prisons to establish how best to manage the problems of both access to drugs and the treatment/ rehabilitation of drug-addicted offenders.  In this context the question of providing extended maintenance programmes to <Col N="604" /> prisoners along the lines now being followed by community-based treatment agencies is currently under active consideration.</P>

      <Quest>in view of the Statute of Limitations, if his Department can claim back six years alleged overpayment of pension; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa) Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal legal provision governing overpayments of pensions and other social welfare benefits <Col N="607" /> are to be found in sections 248 to 250 and Part VIII of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993.  These lay down strict statutory criteria for the creation of social welfare overpayments and for the recovery of the amounts which have been overpaid.  Section 280 deals specifically with the situation arising on the distribution of assets of a deceased pensioner of the Department.</P>
      <P>The Statute of Limitations does not remove or limit the overpayment or the Department's obligation to claim its recovery in full.  The question as to whether the recovery or debt for overpayment, in whole or in part, may be statute barred depends on the circumstances of the case having regard to equity and any mitigating circumstances which may exist.  The period of limitation in the statute does not in any event begin to run in cases involving fraud or fraudulent concealment until the fraud has been discovered.</P>
      <P>The factors relating to the striking of an overpayment and its recovery vary depending on the nature and circumstances of the case.  The practice of the Department has been to fulfil its obligation to seek recovery of overpayments due but to take a sympathetic attitude towards recovery of amounts overpaid particularly where the overpayment arose through no fault of the person concerned.</P>
      <P>The 1993 Social Welfare Act at section 282 provided for the first time for the drawing up of a code of practice under which legally due overpayments may in certain circumstances be deferred, suspended, reduced or cancelled. The drawing up of the code is at an advanced stage at present and it is hoped to make the necessary regulations introducing the code in the near future.  The draft regulations will, in the normal course, be examined from a legal point of view and the question of the interaction with the Statute of Limitations will be considered in this context.</P>

      <P>The official text of the judgment of the High Court in what amounted to two test cases arising from the delay in implementing the 1979 Equal Treatment Directive was made available on 10 February last.  That decision of the High Court is being examined by my Department in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>The programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, outlines this Government's commitment to pay the legally determined entitlements of married women to social welfare equality payments.  In keeping with this commitment, I am preparing proposals in the context of the court's decision.  In the meantime, the Government has already provided £60 million as a first step in meeting our obligations.</P>

      <P>The charter I referred to in my reply to the Deputy on 14 February last was in effect the Department's mission statement and values which were articulated in the context of the Civil Service wide strategic management initiative begun by the previous Government.  Arrangements are being made to send a copy of those documents to the Deputy.  The process arising from <Col N="609" /> the initiative is an ongoing one however and the statements are being reviewed in the light of the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal.</i>  When the present review has been completed.  I hope to be in a position to publish a strategy document for the Department which has yet to be developed from the basic work already undertaken.</P>

      <P>Details of all such grants paid under the various schemes operated by the Department in 1993 were placed in the Oireachtas Library on 4 March 1994.  I have now arranged for details of the grants in respect of 1994 to be likewise placed in the Library for the information of members.</P>

      <Quest>the advice, if any, he would give to farmers using large amounts of black plastic to bale silage and who wish to dispose of the plastic in as benign a way as possible; and the advice, if any, he has on methods by which the quantity of plastic used in conventional farming can be minimised.</Quest>

      <P>: A study carried out under the STRIDE Operational Programme for Ireland 1991-93 into the feasibility of recycling plastic sheeting used in the agricultural sector established that the heavy contamination of such material when used in agriculture mitigates against successful recycling. The study concluded that under current economic conditions (i.e. poor market outlets, variation of degree of contamination and high waste collection costs), polyethylene film recycling is not economically viable.</P>
      <P>My advice to farmers is to collect and store all plastic and reuse as much of this sheeting as possible.  Plastic film used to bale silage cannot be reused and should be disposed of in approved land fill sites.  In this regard, participants in the rural environment protection (PEPS) operated by my Department are required to dispose of all un-usable plastic in this manner.</P>
