    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this important Bill.  During my 14 years as a Deputy only a handful of Bills dealing with children have passed through the House and we have much further to go <Col N="1899" /> in ensuring that children are adequately protected.</P>
      <P>The critical issue at the heart of this Bill is the right to make public details of cases.  I am glad that the Bill deals directly with this issue as publicity is vital in this area.  Some speakers were concerned about the nature of reporting, that it was intrusive and seemed to be obsessed with details which might not be central to a case. Until such time as we deal in a mature way with this problem and put in place a full range of services which will respond to the needs of children it is important for these cases to be reported.  These cases remind us of the need to ensure that priority is given to child care, prevention of abuse, parenting skills and services for the abused and abuser.  There must be reporting of cases until such time as all these issues are fully dealt with.</P>
      <P>The ISPCC has been to the forefront in bringing about changes in attitudes and leading campaigns for action on children.  As legislators we could hardly do better than take on board the recommendations in its document &ldquo;Towards a National Child Abuse Prevention Strategy&rdquo; which was launched by the Minister of State.  This document contains a comprehensive set of recommendations on incest, sexual abuse, neglect and psychical abuse.  While most practitioners in the field are involved in the delivery of services the ISPCC has taken to itself a policy development role.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the debate on the Child Care Act those of us who wanted the State to go further called for the establishment of a national child care authority which would monitor the implementation of the Act and ensure that services were developed and the issue was not forgotten about when it was no longer centre stage.  The failure to set up such a body has led to a major gap in this area and there is no consistency in the way health boards carry out their functions.  I do not think any health board could say its child care services are on a par with those provided by hospitals.  Community <Col N="1900" /> care was regarded as the Cinderella service in terms of funding &mdash; it has received greater priority recently &mdash; but child care is even lower down the scale. This is why we only legislate in critical cases such as those which have led to this legislation.  It is essential to set up a child care authority which would carry out reviews and monitor the system on an annual basis.  The ISPCC recommends the appointment of an ombudsman for children.  While I would prefer an authority the ombudsman could carry out similar functions.  It is important to monitor how Departments implement legislation and to ensure that resources are allocated to the areas most in need.</P>
    <P>In its report the ISPCC suggests that legislation offers the possibility for preventing child abuse.  This Bill is important in that context but more legislation is needed.  It also says that legislation can be used to bring about a change in public attitude and institutional practices.  The Select Committee on Social Affairs has begun consideration of elements of the Law Reform Commission's report on children. These relate to outdated and outmoded practices which in theory still exist in our law, for example, the right to whip young male offenders.  It states that society should be moving towards the introduction of a total ban on the physical punishment of children.  Children alone do not have the absolute right guaranteed to every other person under the Constitution to their full bodily integrity.  Their right to full bodily integrity is qualified by parents and those acting in their place by using justifiable chastisement in their care and education.  This right, based on legal precedents, can be justified from the age of one.  Infants of that age can understand physical chastisement.  The Law Reform Commission and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children are strongly of the view that we should be moving towards banning that.</P>
    <P>As long as we have double think in our society where we suggest it is right <Col N="1901" /> to do to children something which if done between two adults would create an offence and lead to a court case, we create a grey area in which parents and other carers of children operate. Occasionally they stray into the areas of abuse.</P>
    <P>Legislation can be used to bring about a change in institutional practice.  I hope I will live to see that legislation introduced in this Chamber.  We in the Select Committee on Social Affairs will do some work on it in conjunction with the Minister of State and the Minister for Justice, both of whom would have an interest in these broad areas.</P>
    <P>Where this ban operates in other countries, including a number of northern European countries, the impact has been significant, the level of abuse generally and of physical punishment of children has dropped.  Also there has not been a rush of court cases as some people fear.  Only one minor case has been taken in Sweden.  Many of the fears which people have about the State interfering with families do not materialise. We should send out a clear message to parents that there must be better ways of dealing with their children.</P>
    <P>It is important to debate these issues at every opportunity.  This Bill is important because it ensures that the issues relating to one of the most horrific areas of abuse, child sexual abuse within their own family, will remain in the public eye and will be reported on. I hope that will be a stronger voice than I can be towards ensuring that we have further legislation and more resources and that this problem is not forgotten about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This is important legislation and I have no difficulty in supporting it.  I wish to avail of the opportunity to take up a point made by Deputy Flaherty, that of abuse within the family.  I am not satisfied that the guidelines laid down for health boards in regard to the investigation of sexual abuse within the family are as watertight as they might be.  We are all interested in ensuring protection for the child or <Col N="1902" /> the children involved.  There is another dimension to it that we must also have regard to, protection for the innocent parents who may be involved and who may be accused in the wrong.  Parent protection is equally important.</P>
      <P>There have been examples of parents who have been accused by errant children of wrongdoing, incest that did not occur.  This came to my attention over the past 12 months arising from two cases with which I became familiar.  In one case a school attended by the child made a report to the Garda Síochána that there could be possible parental interference.  The child was mildly retarded.  The parents were understandably shocked.  An investigation was carried out by the social worker and the Garda Síochána.  Those parents were left for nine months without knowing the results of the inquiry and endured enormous stress and trauma during that time.  At the end of the nine months it has been established that there was no case to be answered.</P>
      <P>In the past two months I had a case where a 16 year-old made an accusation against her father of sexual interference. The mother believed there was no truth in the accusation and has had a nervous breakdown.  The father is held in odium among the public because the errant child indicated to the neighbours that he had interfered sexually with her.  At the end of a six months period we find there is no basis for the accusation.</P>
      <P>In setting down guidelines it is important to have regard to the fact that there must be written in the safeguarding of the good name of the parents.  I was not happy with the procedures put in place in the investigations carried out in both of those cases.  If they are indicative of the type of investigations being carried out by health boards and the Garda Síochána they are not satisfactory and I ask the Minister to examine them carefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The parents in the second case have told me their name has been impugned, that they had been treated shabbily by the health board and badly treated by the Garda Síochána.  They asked about <Col N="1903" /> their legal standing and whether they could take a case for being wrongfully pursued and hounded to the point where one of them had a nervous breakdown. While we must root out incest and sex abuse within the family equally we must be extremely careful when taking up such cases that we take full cognisance of the circumstances on both sides before getting into the full investigation.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of the Garda complaints and that the number has increased annually.  The same must not occur in regard to sexual assault or incest within the family.  I ask the Minister to examine the guidelines critically. I gather that in the Southern Health Board region there are loose arrangements rather than strict guidelines in regard to any investigation into such matters.  National guidelines which would be strict and fair should be put in place to protect the good name of everybody involved.</P>

      <P>I have listened with great interest to the contributions of Deputies O'Donoghue, O'Donnell, Frances Fitzgerald, McGahon, O'Dea, Flaherty and Batt O'Keeffe.  A number of very real and important concerns have been expressed in the course of this debate on the general subject of sexual abuse and, in particular, child sex abuse.  These are obviously concerns which I share.  As Minister of State with special responsibility in this area I would be as anxious as any member of the general public that the most effective arrangements should be in place to ensure that such abuse is prevented and where it takes place is dealt with in a manner which reflects the seriousness of the harm it has caused to children who are the most vulnerable members of our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to address the problems which have emerged from the rulings of the Central Criminal Court in an incest case.  One of the effects of these rulings is that persons with a <Col N="1904" /> genuine interest in the welfare of children cannot be informed of the outcome of criminal proceedings where incest charges are brought against a person who has sexually abused a child who is a close family relative.  The Bill closes the gap created by the rulings and puts it beyond doubt that information on incest convictions cannot be denied to bodies with responsibility for child welfare.</P>
    <P>In addition, provision has been made to allow the press attend incest hearings and report on the proceedings subject of necessity to restrictions on the disclosure of information that could lead to the identification of the victim or family involved.  This will help to make the public aware of the extent of sexual abuse and make it clear that such conduct cannot in any circumstances be tolerated.</P>
    <P>The Minister acted quickly to bring this legislation forward so that children could not be put at risk as a result of the rulings of the Central Criminal Court. She is fully aware that wider issues arise in this area.  These are important questions which she has promised to address. She has given a firm commitment that shortly after this Bill is enacted she will publish a discussion paper on the subject. This will be circulated to individuals and bodies with expertise in dealing with the problems of sexual offending. The consultation process will be carried out with a tight deadline and the Minister will bring forward proposals for such legislative changes as may be required in this area with the minimum of delay.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also indicated that she will approach any amendments Members may put forward with an open mind.  Both she and I gave similar assurances in the Seanad; she was as good as her word then and she will be as good as her word now.  In that context, there is an urgent need to resolve the problems which have arisen as a result of the Central Criminal Court rulings.  The more general issues will be covered in the discussion paper which will be circulated without delay.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1905" /> I would like to refer briefly to the contributions made to the debate.  I thank Deputy O'Donoghue for expressing support for the Bill.  I regret that to some extent at least he seemed to be more intent on making political points, unsuccessfully, rather than some of the other points that he might have addressed, but that is politics.  He raised the question of extending the scope of the Bill to cover the offence of unlawful carnal knowledge.  A number of other Deputies, including Deputy O'Donnell, also raised this question.  Deputy O'Donoghue said he would table an amendment for this purpose.  I will bring this matter to the attention of the Minister and deal with it in due course.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell raised a wide range of issues many of which go beyond the scope of the Bill.  I have taken a particular note of the points she raised and will inform the Minister that the Deputy is concerned that the restrictions that apply when asking questions about the previous sexual history of a rape complainant should also operate in incest cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald stressed the need to protect children from sexual abuse.  This is an area in which the Deputy has been active for many years. I am happy to be in a position to acknowledge the work she has undertaken in that regard and thank her for her kind comments about my participation. I noted with great interest the points she made about the rights of families versus the rights of individual members of the family.  This is a sensitive matter which is of concern to us all.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahon highlighted the way in which cases involving sexual offences are reported in the media.  This is a topic on which many people hold different opinions.  The Minister will seek views on the type of reporting arrangements which should apply in these cases in her forthcoming discussion paper.  The Deputy will not be surprised to learn that I disagree with him on certain other suggestions he made.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1906" /> Deputy O'Dea referred to the problems which confront the victims of sexual abuse.  This must be a matter of concern to us all.  The Deputy raised the possibility of tabling amendments in this respect but I am not sure if it would be appropriate that such general issues should be dealt with in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flaherty referred to the importance of reporting proceedings in which persons are charged with sexual offences.  Where abuse takes place it must not be swept under the carpet. People must be made aware of the extent of the problem and how cases are dealt with.  The Deputy had some interesting remarks to make about the extent to which we are coming to terms with the painful realities of child sexual abuse.  I welcome her offer of co-operation on behalf of the Select Committee on Social Affairs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Batt O'Keeffe said that it was a matter of regret that the guidelines were not as tight as they might be.  He referred in particular to the interests of innocent parents.  I am well aware of the problem in this regard.  The guidelines must be interpreted with great sensitivity. When I published the most recent guidelines drawn up between the Garda Síochána and the health boards, much emphasis was placed on the need for sensitivity.  There is a great responsibility on all those engaged in this field to find the proper balance.  This is not always easy.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate which has been both useful and informative.  I appreciate the support expressed for the Bill from all sides of the House and I look forward to its enactment at an early date.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  I am pleased to present this Bill in the House today.  Members will recall that the issue of localised flooding came to public prominence earlier this year when the country was in the midst of a major flooding crisis.  On a nightly basis we saw and heard on our television screens and in the other media organs, tragic scenes and stories of people whose homes were flooded, or cut off from their neighbours, farmers who were struggling to look after their livestock and small businesses in jeopardy as a result of the floods.  It was abundantly clear in the light of that crisis that a sensible programme of drainage and flood relief works was essential.</P>
      <P>During the course of a special debate on the matter in this House earlier in the year the then Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, gave a commitment to pursue with the Government the early introduction of legislation along the lines of proposals which had been prepared by the Commissioners of Public Works some time previously to permit the commissioners to undertake such a programme of works to prevent or alleviate problems of localised flooding.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance were approached about the matter and despite the many pressures of Government business they were both very sympathetic to the plight of the flooding victims and the Government, on their recommendation, agreed to pursue a range of actions including the early processing of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am happy, therefore, just a few months later, to be in a position to bring <Col N="1908" /> the Bill, which has already been debated and passed by the Seanad, before this House.  Although it is relatively short and I hope uncontroversial, the House will appreciate on reading it that there was a considerable amount of administrative, legal and technical research to be done in the course of drafting.  The speed with which such important and substantial legislation was drafted is remarkable and I express my appreciation to all concerned, as did my predecessor before me, in particular to the parliamentary draftsman's office for their efforts.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to amend and extend the powers to execute works of drainage and flood relief conferred on the Commissioners of Public Works by the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  It is the second such Bill introduced this year, the first having been introduced in the Seanad by Senator Daly in February last.  The Government's opposition to Senator Daly's Bill at the time was based primarily on the facts that it did not address entirely the issues involved and that the Government intended to introduce a Bill as soon as possible.  As promised at the time, the Government's Bill was also introduced in the Seanad first and I am fully aware that it was due in no small measure to the united approach of Members on both sides of that House that the Bill passed all Stages with speed and efficiency.</P>
    <P>Like my predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Jim Higgins, during the Second Stage of the Bill in the Seanad recently, I, too, would like to acknowledge that the heads of the Bill approved by this Government, and which form the basis of the Bill now before this House, were substantially the same as those prepared by the former Minister of State, Deputy Noel Dempsey.  This proved to be of no little benefit in expediting the introduction of this amending legislation.</P>
    <P>Before going on to discuss the provisions of the new Bill in depth I take this opportunity to reflect briefly on the current legislative position and the circumstances which brought about the necessity for change.  Much has already <Col N="1909" /> been said in earlier debates, particularly this year, in both Houses of the Oireachtas on the flooding problems and I expect much more to be said here during the current debate.  I will comment more specifically on some of the problems during my response.  In the meantime, a brief summation of the national drainage programme as it stands would, be of benefit at this stage.</P>
    <P>The main statutory provision for the execution of drainage works in the State at present is the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  This Act provides that when the Commissioners of Public Works &ldquo;are of opinion that the execution of arterial drainage works is expedient in respect of any catchment area for the purpose of preventing or substantially reducing the periodical flooding of lands in that area or of improving by drainage lands in the said area it shall be lawful for the Commissioners to prepare a scheme for the execution of such works&rdquo;.  This provision has always been interpreted as conferring power on the commissioners to prepare and undertake drainage schemes only in cases where a flooding problem encompasses the entire catchment of a river usually involving an area of several thousand hectares.</P>
    <P>The 1945 Act gave effect to the recommendations of the Browne Commission of 1938-40, among which was the establishment of a central drainage authority based in the Office of Public Works, which would thenceforth be responsible for the execution and maintenance of arterial drainage on a catchment basis.  Its enactment some 50 years ago was an attempt to update and consolidate existing drainage legislation which consisted of many statutes dating back for more than a century.  Under these various earlier enactments drainage works were carried out on a piecemeal basis often without regard to conditions elsewhere in river catchments, or indeed the effects of such works on conditions in other areas.  This was no longer considered to be an effective or adequate means of dealing with Ireland's drainage problems.</P>
    <P>The extent of the progress made <Col N="1910" /> under the national drainage programme established following the passing of the 1945 Act is worthy of note.  So far, more than 40 drainage and embankment schemes have been undertaken, involving works to some 7,300 miles of channels and embankments and conferring benefit on more than 650,000 acres of land previously damaged through flooding or waterlogging.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the arguments that have been put forward that progress was not what it might have been or indeed envisaged when the programme was set up.  However, I have no doubt that it demonstrates conclusively the commitment of successive Governments and the Commissioners of Public Works to the resolution of the problems which have persisted.  Arterial drainage, as we have known it to date, would not be undertaken without a thorough study of conditions throughout a river basin including tributaries, large and small.  It requires a lengthy preparatory process involving the collection of hydrometric data over many years to establish the flow regimes of rivers.  It requires detailed engineering and valuation surveys of lands and watercourses often again over many years and the design and formal exhibition of schemes so that those affected may comment on the proposals.</P>
    <P>In recent years too we have become much more conscious of our environment so that many modifications to both design and work practices have evolved.  Care must be taken to minimise or avoid damage to wildlife, fisheries and the landscape among other things.  Comprehensive fishery rehabilitation programmes are undertaken. Spoil is buried and the land rehabilitated rather than heaped on river banks as had been the practice, and areas of scientific interest are, where possible, excluded from schemes at the planning stage.</P>
    <P>With the passing of EU Directive 85/337 for the assessment of the effects of certain projects on the environment, it has become obligatory on the Commissioners of Public Works to carry out <Col N="1911" /> detailed environmental impact assessments of drainage schemes and to publish the reports as part of the scheme exhibition documents.  Article 16 of the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations, 1989, made by the Minister for the Environment, incorporated the provisions of the EU Directive into national legislation by amending the relevant sections, i.e. sections 4 and 5, of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.</P>
    <P>Not least, arterial drainage requires a huge investment and commitment of resources.  In the last 50 years a total of £640 million in current terms has been spent on the construction and maintenance of the works undertaken to date. In the 1980s substantial EU grants were made available for the work.  It is essential, therefore, that drainage schemes satisfy accepted economic criteria as must all projects involving large scale investment.  In this connection in the 1970s detailed cost benefit analysis was introduced and has been applied to all schemes considered since.</P>
    <P>The increased awareness of our environment in recent years as well as changing emphasis on land use, the diminishing returns on the high capital investment required for arterial drainage and current EU policy which is aimed at reducing production in many areas, has greatly reduced the prospect of formulating economically or environmentally acceptable catchment schemes. In the processing of future schemes, regard must be had to all these factors. Various options for drainage or flood relief schemes will have to be considered and must be subjected to detailed analysis.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the provisions of the Arterial Drainage (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1995.  The Bill proposes to amend the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, to provide the powers necessary to enable the Commissioners of Public Works to undertake drainage schemes for the relief of localised flooding from rivers and other watercourses in addition to their existing powers to <Col N="1912" /> undertake arterial drainage schemes in entire river catchments.  It will, however, be a requirement that any scheme to relieve localised flooding must have regard to the possible effects of the proposed works throughout the entire river basin including environmental impacts. Thus such schemes will not be inconsistent with the strong recommendation in the report of the Browne Drainage Commission 1938-40 that &ldquo;all future arterial drainage operations should be conducted on the basis of comprehensive schemes embracing entire catchments and not otherwise&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Flooding in localised areas, particularly in urban centres, has always been a problem.  Incidents of such flooding are widespread and are not confined to any single area of the country.  There are also many rural areas where flooding is known to be particularly acute.  The Commissioners of Public Works have been unable to undertake schemes to overcome the difficulties in these areas because the existing legislation limits them to the catchment approach.  Catchment drainage schemes by their nature involve doing work in very large areas where because of the present situation in agriculture the benefit is often marginal and is, therefore, outweighed by the costs.  To that extent, unfortunately, it is often the case that the overall scheme becomes uneconomic even where the benefits that would result from the scheme works in urban or other local problem areas may far exceed the cost of doing works in those areas.  The fact that catchment schemes typically cost many millions of pounds while a scheme targeted at a specific problem area could be done for much less and would be more effective in that specific area, is also relevant.</P>
    <P>Flooding, particularly when it affects residential areas, can cause severe hardship and disruption.</P>
    <P>Residents in areas which are subject to regular flooding live in continual fear of damage to their property and in extreme cases being cut off entirely from their neighbours, supplies and services at times of heavy rainfall.  There is <Col N="1913" /> a constant fear of the threat to life and loss of business or livelihood.  Residents in such areas, in some cases as we have come to realise, cannot even insure against the losses arising from flooding because of its frequency.  This flooding is not a new phenomenon, and the Office of Public Works has faced pressure for many years to undertake drainage schemes in river catchments which would have the effect of relieving flooding in urban areas.  The existence of a priority list for the execution of arterial drainage schemes, combined with the fact that works were in progress on higher priority schemes, served to offer hope to those lower down in the list. Because of the difficulty in designing economically viable catchment schemes, because of current EU policy of discouraging the production of some agricultural products, many areas are now left without hope.  While catchment schemes may become viable again in the future the time has come to make the necessary changes to the legislative provisions to enable localised flood relief schemes to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, an existing legislative provision, the Local Authorities (Works) Act, 1949, which does provide a basis for the execution of localised works in certain circumstances.  It does not, however, impose any requirement to have regard to the effect of works undertaken elsewhere in the catchment or provide for maintenance of completed works and while it might have been in 1949 it is not now considered to be a satisfactory legislative basis on which to undertake the type of flood relief schemes which it is considered will be required in the future.  In many cases too river catchments cross administrative boundaries, a fact which in itself supports the argument for a central drainage authority as currently exists in the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>While I am sure that many other issues will be brought to the fore during this debate, I would like now to deal in general terms with the provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated the primary <Col N="1914" /> purpose of the Bill is to extend the powers of the Commissioners of Public Works to undertake drainage works as provided in the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the 1945 Act as amended by the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations, 1989, outlines the circumstances under which a scheme may be prepared in respect of a catchment area and details the matters to be included in the body of a scheme.  Section 3 of this Bill proposes to amend this provision by extending it to include any watercourse or any part of a watercourse, thus permitting the preparation and execution of works in respect of more restricted areas, particularly urban and other areas, where flooding causes significant hardship but where it is not possible to design economically viable catchment schemes.</P>
    <P>Under section 4 of the Bill it will also be incumbent on the commissioners, in deciding the nature and extent of the works to be done for the relief of localised flooding, to have regard to the effects of any such works on conditions elsewhere.  In this connection, I am sure you will agree, it will be necessary to establish that the benefits accruing from the works undertaken in one area will not be greatly outweighed by the adverse effects they might have elsewhere. It might not always be possible to guarantee that changes in the flow characteristics of a river arising from works will not result in the worsening of conditions elsewhere along its course.  It is, however, the intention to ensure that any unavoidable adverse impacts are taken into account before an order confirming a drainage scheme is made.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, an existing provision in the 1945 Act for the payment of compensation for loss or damage suffered by reason of any interference during construction works.  It will, therefore, be possible to compensate anyone who suffers damage during works undertaken in pursuit of the wider public interest.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill deals with the <Col N="1915" /> publication and exhibition of localised drainage or flood relief schemes.  Under the provisions of the 1945 Act the commissioners are obliged to allow local authorities a period of three months within which to submit their observations to them in relation to catchment drainage schemes and for the commissioners to place such schemes on public exhibition for a period of one month.</P>
    <P>In view of the urgent nature in many cases of schemes for localised relief, and their more local extent, it is considered that periods of one month and 14 days, respectively, should suffice.  It is not intended to amend those provisions of the 1945 Act as they relate to the large catchment schemes or indeed to amend the other provisions in that Act which deal with consultation with other Government Departments.  With regard to the latter I refer to the provisions of sections 7 and 10 of the 1945 Act which include, among other matters, that the commissioners take whatever precautions the Minister for the Marine may consider adequate for the protection and avoidance of injury to fisheries during the course of works and in consequence of such works.</P>
    <P>In drafting the Bill we have also endeavoured to avail of the opportunity to make a small number of technical amendments to deal with shortcomings which have been identified in the existing legislation over the years.</P>
    <P>It is the intention to provide a clear, legal basis to enable the Commissioners of Public Works, in certain circumstances, to make agreements with third parties whereby such parties would bear all or part of the cost of executing or maintaining arterial drainage works. This is done in section 6.  An example of the type of circumstance which might arise would be a situation where a private individual, local authority or other body wished to have drainage work carried out by the commissioners and, while the commissioners might consider such works to be worthwhile, they would be unable to undertake <Col N="1916" /> them due to lack of funds.  The works could nevertheless, proceed if a third party was willing to meet the shortfall in the funding.  In this connection I am in agreement with the views that the cost of any drainage works undertaken and paid for out of public funds should be fully justified by the benefits whether social or economic, or a combination of the two, accruing from their execution. A provision whereby funding could be provided from other sources should help dispel the fears of those who might otherwise be excluded or get a low priority rating.</P>
    <P>I am aware that concern has been expressed that section 6 as drafted simply deals with a situation whereby a financial agreement and only such can be entered into and does not adequately cover other situations which might arise such as agreements for the preparation or execution of works.  I believe that this concern is not well founded as there are already enabling powers under section 43 of the Principal Act whereby the commissioners may enter into agreements or contracts with others for the execution of works.  Section 43 of the 1945 Act, when read in conjunction with the new provisions proposed by section 6 of this Bill, should meet the different requirements which might arise.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 7 are necessary to limit the burden of maintenance work for which the commissioners will be responsible.  The cost of maintenance will be payable from Exchequer funds. The 1945 Act provides that where the commissioners do work in an existing drainage district as part of a catchment drainage scheme the district ceases to exist and the commissioners become responsible for maintenance of the river and its tributaries.  While this is not unreasonable in the context of catchment drainage schemes it would involve a substantial burden on the commissioners if it was allowed to apply to schemes for localised flooding.  Consequently, the commissioners will not be responsible for the maintenance of the entire district but will be responsible for the work they carry out.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1917" /> It is necessary too to cater for the situation which arises from time to time where, because of the development of land subsequent to the confirmation or completion of a drainage scheme, it is considered expedient to undertake drainage works even where such works may have been considered unjustifiable when the original drainage scheme was confirmed or executed.</P>
    <P>There are many circumstances where works which were once regarded as unjustifiable might be considered necessary on later reappraisal of circumstances. These would include situations where the development of roads, housing or industrial estates result in significant additional quantities of surface water being discharged into rivers and watercourses.  This in turn results in flooding which needs to be prevented or alleviated by further drainage works or increased flood protection.</P>
    <P>There are also examples of situations where drainage works to prevent or alleviate flooding of undeveloped lands which were considered unjustified in the course of a drainage scheme may become essential where the land has been subsequently developed for housing, industries, etc.  These situations are provided for in section 8.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 10 are designed to deal with the situations which arise from time to time whereby modifications are made by landowners and others to channels and embankments which are maintainable by the commissioners.  Circumstances vary from place to place.  In some the modifications may be allowed stand but there is doubt as to the commissioners right to continue with the maintenance of the altered situation.  In others, restoration may be necessary, and prompt action required, to ensure the effective functioning of the particular drainage works, especially where there is a substantial risk of flooding. These by implication involve costs and an adequate mechanism must be provided to enable such costs to be recovered. The existing provisions do not adequately cater for the differing situations which might arise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1918" /> The 1945 Act empowers the commissioners to compulsorily acquire any land for the purposes of a drainage scheme.  However, it does not set out a detailed procedure to be followed by the commissioners in cases of compulsory acquisition, for example, for publication of acquisition notices, or service of notices on affected owners.</P>
    <P>It is intended to correct this defect by providing that the Land Acts will apply to compulsory purchase under the 1945 Act and otherwise by setting out in detail the procedure to be followed.  The Land Acts, which comprise many statutes enacted over a long period, provide a mechanism for the compulsory acquisition or interference with lands for undertakings of a public nature such as those envisaged by the arterial drainage legislation.</P>
    <P>While the compulsory purchase powers already contained in the existing legislation are rarely exercised, it is felt nevertheless that the defect in the 1945 Act should be corrected.  It is simple enough, with the extended powers of the commissioners, to envisage a situation, such as an urban flood relief scheme, where such powers might now have to be exercised.</P>
    <P>The existing provisions relating to determination of the nature and extent of compensation to be paid to persons from whom land or rights have been acquired, or whose land has been severed from other lands, or access thereto, or been otherwise injuriously affected, have also been found to be inadequate and it is intended also to provide definitive procedures for the future.  These matters are dealt with in sections 11 and 12.</P>
    <P>During the course of the debate on Senator Daly's Bill, the provision in that Bill whereby local authorities would in future be obliged to publish annually their reports on the maintenance by them of drainage districts constituted by Acts prior to 1945, was referred to.  A similar provision is being made in section 13 of the current Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 14 is simply aimed at updating the long outdated penalties prescribed <Col N="1919" /> in 1945 for offences under various provisions of the existing legislation.  While I am advised that the Minister for Justice is currently preparing proposals for a general updating of fines and penalties, it is proposed to avail of the present opportunity to cater for offences under various headings in the current drainage legislation in order to deter offenders.  It should be appreciated that the maximum penalties under the existing legislation are as low as £10, plus £1 per day thereafter for anyone found guilty of a particular offence.</P>
    <P>The amendments now being introduced will by definition have implications for various other provisions of the 1945 Act, many of which are actually being repealed.  This matter is dealt with in section 15.  One particular aspect of this section requires elucidation.  I refer to the requirement in section 37 of the 1945 Act that the cost of arterial drainage maintenance be recouped from county councils.</P>
    <P>When the 1945 Act was drawn up it was envisaged that the capital cost of drainage construction works would be borne by the Exchequer, but that the subsequent maintenance of completed schemes, though borne by the Exchequer in the first instance, be recovered from the county councils in whose jurisdiction they lay.  The councils in turn levied a drainage rate to meet the cost.  This remained the position until 1986 when the Government decided, rightly so, as both the domestic and agricultural rates had long been abolished, that in future such costs would be borne entirely by the Exchequer.  No costs have been recovered from county councils since.  The new provisions give statutory effect to the decisions already taken.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, the prime aim of this Bill is to provide a mechanism whereby limited schemes for the purpose of providing relief from localised flooding can be undertaken.  It is not the intention that the prospect of undertaking further major schemes at <Col N="1920" /> some time in the future should be abandoned. The possibility of seeking EU funding for such schemes on the basis that they might permit acceptable levels of agricultural output and increased income to be achieved in a more environmentally friendly fashion, for example, by reducing fertiliser inputs, is currently being examined by the Commissioners of Public Works.  Other similar opportunities may occur in the future.</P>
    <P>Schemes for the relief of localised flooding will be undertaken by the engineering services division of the Office of Public Works.  The division which comprises administrative and professional staff has responsibility for the current arterial drainage construction and maintenance programme and inland waterways.  The workload on arterial drainage construction has been reducing due to the reducing number of schemes in progress.  On the other hand, the drainage maintenance workload has been increasing as completed schemes have to be maintained.</P>
    <P>The inland waterways programme is expanding steadily particularly since the transfer of the Grand and Royal Canals and Barrow Navigation to the Office of Public Works in 1986 and with the re-opening of the Shannon-Erne waterway in 1994.  This expansion of engineering services seems likely to continue in coming years, particularly with the introduction of these new measures for flood relief.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, may I again reiterate my thanks and appreciation to all who have so far been engaged in the process of preparing this Bill.  I look forward with enthusiasm to the co-operation of this House in ensuring its speedy enactment.</P>

      <P>The main statutory provisions for the execution of drainage in the State is the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  I am sure Members on all sides of the House accept the necessity for updating the provisions of that Act.</P>
      <P>The previous Administration, aware of the need for changes in the 1945 Act, under Deputy Dempsey, the then Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, had the heads of a Bill prepared which were substantially the same as the heads of the Bill which form the basis of this Bill.  In February last Senator Daly introduced an Arterial Drainage Bill in Private Members' Time in the Seanad in the light of the grave flooding problems throughout the country, because of the lethargy of the Government in introducing necessary legislation.</P>
      <P>Recent changes in agricultural practices and road and housing developments have caused localised flooding which did not occur at the time of the enactment of the 1945 Act, the provisions of which are not adequate to fight the problems we face today. Increased localised flooding is causing widespread hardship, inconvenience and cost to urban and rural communities and under the 1945 Act, the Commissioners of Public Works are powerless to deal with such difficulties effectively, speedily and efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, which will amend the 1945 Act, is primarily aimed at enabling the commissioners to undertake works to prevent or relieve localised flooding, including flooding in urban and residential areas.  While I welcome the Bill, deficiencies in the legislation will inhibit the Commissioners of Public Works from responding speedily to drainage problems that arise more frequently nowadays.  Under the Bill schemes can be initiated to relieve flooding in urban and residential areas and it is a vast improvement on the provisions on the 1945 Act whereby only schemes relating to flooding problems encompassing the entire catchment area of a river, involving thousands of hectares, could be initiated.  However, initiation of such <Col N="1922" /> schemes could take a considerable length of time and delay essential and urgent works being undertaken.  Will the Minister examine the possibility of extending the authority of the commissioners to undertake works without the necessity to initiate a scheme in extenuating and emergency circumstances?</P>
    <P>I accept the necessity to prepare schemes in most cases, but unless the Minister takes the power to authorise works without the preparation of a scheme, the commissioners may find themselves in the same position they are in now and, in times of emergencies, unduly handicapped in taking necessary action to deal with such emergencies.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider this suggestion because this power is essential and will allow for necessary remedial works to be carried out in time, thereby preventing major crises from developing.  As the old saying goes, &ldquo;A stitch in time saves nine&rdquo;.  It is important also that in the preparation of schemes, the Minister for the Marine and the Environmental Protection Agency be consulted where there may be a risk to fisheries or damage to the environment.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 3 which amends section 4 of the 1945 Act but there is no reference in this section to coastal and tidal areas and estuaries.  There have been many complaints regarding culverts and embankments in estuaries which are in need of attention and where the responsibility for such works is not clear.  These should be included in section 3.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of new works and the existing maintenance provisions are a major cause of difficulty.  The establishment of responsibility for maintenance and the undertaking of maintenance works must be clearly identified.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provisions in section 5 which apply to schemes.  These will ensure that necessary action is taken but the Minister should have the power to authorise action without the necessity of a scheme.  Section 6 is a welcome provision which will ensure that works <Col N="1923" /> which are not of a high priority will be undertaken.  This policy is in operation in the Roads Department where local people are allowed to carry out work under direction from the county councils. Works that would not be done in a lifetime are now being carried out by people in their own areas.</P>
    <P>Compensation for land acquisition and the problem of transfer and vesting of lands are dealt with effectively in sections 10, 11 and 12.  These provisions will correct defects in the 1945 Act. However, the Government has failed to address the problem of compensation for families who have suffered severe losses due to flooding.  These include losses to livestock, personal property and homes.  A provision allowing compensation to be paid for these losses should be included in the Bill.  A commission should be set up to deal with claims of individuals.  Such a commission could be made up of two commissioners from the Office of Public Works, an officer to be nominated by the Minister, a county manager and a representative from the General Council of County Councils.  It could review the claims of individuals for losses due to flooding, examine the causes and effects of flooding and make an annual report in that regard.  It is important that the objectives in the Bill be achieved and that actions taken be under constant review.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a welcome improvement on the 1945 Act.  If the Minister includes the suggestions I made regarding compensation, the establishment of a review committee and the carrying out of a emergency works without the necessity of a scheme, it would enable the commissioners to deal more effectively with the problems faced by many local communities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, and wish him well in his new position.  I sincerely regret his regarding to this office from a senior Cabinet post because I feel it was <Col N="1924" /> unnecessary.  The Minister of State is a man of outstanding integrity and his expertise, professionalism and ability will be of vital assistance in his dealings with the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>No Government has done more damage to any State agency than this Government has done to the Office of Public Works in the way its authority has been diminished by expedient amendment to Bills in this House which take no account of the tremendous contribution the Office of Public Works has made in this and the previous century. It is ironic that Minister of State Coveney is taking this Bill in the House today when, all things being equal, he should be performing a different function on behalf of the Office of Public Works at another location.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I was honoured to serve in Government, working in six different Departments, over a period of eight years.  For two of those terms I had responsibility for the Office of Public Works; from 1987 to 1989 and from 1991 to 1993.  It is important to put the historical context of arterial drainage on the record of the House.  The Arterial Drainage Act, which was passed in 1945, contributed immensely to the economic development of many parts of this country. Land which was lying fallow, wet and derelict was used for full production which helped to sustain the livelihoods of farmers in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is ironic that Minister Coveney, in a Coalition Government involving Fine Gael, Labour and the reborn Democratic Left, is introducing this Bill in the House because in 1986, for the first time in the history of the State, the then Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government interfered with the priority rating of rivers and the time schedule for draining. That Government took a decision to transfer a river in Munster to the top of the priority list and a river in Galway to a lower position on the list.  The same Government cancelled the farm modernisation scheme in 1986.  Up to that time, since joining the European Community in 1973, the EC was funding and underpinning arterial drainage here <Col N="1925" /> through the farm modernisation scheme.  But as a result of the decision by the then Government to terminate future arterial drainage, my party, on coming to office in 1987, inherited an expenditure which was out of all proportion to GNP and GDP.  We had to deal also with the effects of decisions that had been taken in 1986.  We had no option but to continue with the work in progress but we were unable to proceed with additional drainage works on rivers.</P>
    <P>I had long discussions at that time with the Commissioners of Public Works and the record of my utterances and parliamentary responses show that I initiated moves to amend the 1985 Drainage Act and bring forward this type of Bill so that we could proceed with localised drainage works in different parts of the country.  I was transferred to another Department, just as Deputy Coveney was, and that work went into abeyance.  The Office of Public Works operates under financial constraints and could not carry out new works until such time as existing works were almost completed.  I am delighted that as a result of the tremendous efforts of Senator Brendan Daly in particular, the Government has responded by introducing this Bill and I compliment the Minister for being present for its passage through the Dáil.  In particular I pay tribute to the experienced high quality staff in the Office of Public Works who helped to put this Bill together with the agreement of other Departments, as it will ensure that localised drainage works can be carried out in future.</P>
    <P>We were generous in Government in dealing with arterial drainage.  Members will remember that, heretofore, local authorities had to make an annual contribution for arterial drainage maintenance in their county and that created major difficulties for local authorities. When the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds was Minister for Finance a decision was taken to alleviate and change that and have the Vote of the Office of Public Works carry those <Col N="1926" /> maintenance charges.  I believe it is time to look at the situation again because if local works are to be done, it is vital that the Office of Public Works has the flexibility, as the premier State agency with the expertise and professionalism particularly in hydro management to be able to respond when there is serious flooding in any part of the country.  If the Office of Public Works is given that flexibility and the appropriate funding to deal with localised flooding in emergencies it can execute works to alleviate it and it is incumbent on the local authorities who benefit from those works to carry the maintenance charges thereafter. I am not referring to major catchment areas but to work to alleviate local flooding in urban or rural areas.  The Office of Public Works would carry out such small scale works and, thereafter, rather than having it carry the cost of constantly observing, monitoring, managing and carrying out appropriate remedial works, the local authority would maintain it as it has the staff and equipment to carry out that work.  I believe this is the road we should be going.</P>
    <P>County Galway, the second largest county, is affected by flooding from its many rivers.  However, only two catchments have been drained since 1945, the Corrib-Clare catchment that serves the mid and north Galway region which was drained many years ago and has been a major success.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will get his opportunity to speak.  I salute the late Michael Donlon, a distinguished man who originally joined our party but did not make it through our party convention process and decided to stand and eventually made it under a new banner.  He was succeeded by his son John, who is a personal friend of mine &mdash; I acknowledge the contribution of the former Deputy Michael Donlon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drainage of the Corrib-Clare river brought tremendous benefit to the <Col N="1927" /> county, improved the livelihoods of many farmers and alleviated the risk of flooding in small towns and villages in the area.  However, as a result of a political row in the northern part of the country, work in Curragh West, on the periphery of the parish of Dunmore and which adjoins Williamstown was not executed even though it had been planned.</P>
    <P>There has been serious consistent flooding in Corrowest during the years. In January 1995 it was seriously flooded and the same applied in 1994 and 1990. Indeed, as far back as 1954 it was flooded.  The situation is still chronic and in the intervening years there was constant annual flooding but not as bad as in the years I mentioned.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Higgins, visited the area and commitments given have yet to be honoured. Things are so bad that people have had to vacate their houses, and farms are completely flooded.  Animals have had to be moved.  People will not have the use of their farms or houses until next month.  It is vital that remedial works are carried out immediately to link with the Corrib-Clare catchment so that in future there will be no further imposition on the people who live in this wonderful rural area.  I hope a firm commitment that this work will be done will be given.  Further south, between Tuam and Headford, where our MEP Mr. Mark Killalea lives, there is tremendous flooding in Belclare and major local works are vital.  Flooding has occured over the years and farms have been isolated. A number of homes were isolated but because of local council work a new road was laid in co-operation with the Land Commission and an alternative route to people's homes was constructed. That has not solved the problem because of the incessant rains of 1994-95.  It is vital that the problem is rectified.</P>
    <P>Gort was affected most by the flooding. On the weekend of 27-31 January the town was flooded and traffic had to <Col N="1928" /> be diverted.  North of Gort, in Glenbrack six houses were flooded and the waters receded only recently.  Four of those houses can never be occupied again.  I have had discussions with the Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, on this matter and he gave me certain commitments on acquisition and compensation and relocation of these people.  I recommend that those houses be acquired by the State, the people compensated and given the opportunity to rebuild new houses in a new location.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that the Minister of State is here because it is vital for rural renewal to people in the area to create an environment where people can make a livelihood and not be driven out of it.  There are a few Clare people living in the Gort area who have been affected and I hope the Minister will take a personal interest in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay special tribute to my colleagues in west Galway, Senator Frank Fahey who lives in Gort, has done Trojan work as well as Deputies Geoghegan-Quinn and Ó Cuív, the local councillors Michael Cunningham and Michael Fahey and in particular Deputy Pádraic McCormack who has given tremendous time and attention to this problem.  Gort and its hinterland, Glenbrack, Coole, Ballinderry right down to Kinvara and Ardrahan have all been affected.  Some of the best lands where there is a tradition of growing cereals and beet &mdash; and we are a severely handicapped disadvantaged area &mdash; have been flooded. It is vital that immediate work is carried out in this area and that compensation is paid.  Even today I have had letters from people telling me that they have not yet been paid the compensation promised.  There is a huge number of claims but it is vital they are paid. People as well as animals have had to be relocated, although some animals <Col N="1929" /> were lost due to flooding.  On the weekend of 27-31 January people in Ballinasloe town had to relocate and it is only in the past few weeks they have returned to their homes.</P>
    <P>It is vital that attention is paid to the river Suck and, as a previous Minister of State at the Office of Public works, I was pleased to have brought forward the Shannon Navigation (No. 2) Act.  As a result of that legislation it was possible to carry out works on 50 per cent of the river Suck, and the removal of rocks ensured a flow of water into the Shannon. It is vital that works are carried out in the area around Ashfield Drive on the north western part of Ballinasloe town, and improvements made on the Bunowen River so that flooding will not recur.  The Suck was to be drained under an arterial drainage programme in the past, but it was never reached and may not be now.  This famous fishing and navigation river flows into the Shannon at the eastern boundary of my constituency and has a major effect on flooding in south east Galway.  I ask the Minister and the Office of Public Works, in co-operation with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, to have the south eastern part of County Galway bordering the Shannon down to the Suck at Ballinasloe declared a special extra-sensitive area under the ESA programme of the European Union.  This is vital because every year farmers in this area are the victims of flooding, loss of stock and forage and are unable to cut hay in summer, only to graze it.  Many small farmers in this area urgently require assistance on a permanent basis and if there is a relevant scheme in Europe we have a duty to utilise it to support our people, retain and sustain them and give them a livelihood they richly deserve.</P>
    <P>On the same weekend, Loughrea was seriously flooded, particularly the area of Coscorrig to the south eastern part of the town not far from the lake where roads were blocked, houses flooded and people had to leave their homes.  I pay tribute to the county council which has <Col N="1930" /> works under preparation to assist them. However, the Office of Public Works should examine the situation and formulate a localised scheme to ensure that this area is not again subject to flooding.</P>
    <P>No other State agency has made a wider contribution than the Office of Public Works.  Its activities include river drainage, the construction of schemes under the arterial drainage programme of 1945 and navigation programmes. Fianna Fáil in the past proposed the abolition of drainage districts because, under an old British Act, members and trustees of drainage boards were personally liable to ensure that flooding did not occur and to compensate those affected if it did.  This Act removes further responsibilities from them.  The drainage boards should be abolished and the Office of Public Works given full responsibility in co-operation with local authorities because there would be no point in burdening the Office of Public Works with the responsibility when it would be imprudent and impractical for it to become involved in certain drainage districts.  The time has come to review problems of drainage in co-operation with local authorities and the Department of the Environment, and to put a stop to passing the buck whereby one State agency lays the responsibility on another.  The Office of Public Works should be given the right to decide whether the Department, an urban district council or a local county council is responsible.  No other State Department has the expertise to manage our waterways and drainage problems.  The way forward is for the Government to give the Office of Public Works the necessary powers to transfer responsibility to the agencies or bodies it thinks should carry it.  It is unfair that farms and houses in a particular area are flooded; one man in Fohena, County Galway, lost 57 sheep in one fell swoop because of flooding in a usually dry area.  I visited that area last Sunday and it is still flooded.  It is impossible for people to carry on their business.  Farmers had to bear huge extra costs in regard to providing and transporting artificial feed <Col N="1931" /> for their stock because their own silage and hay was destroyed by the flooding.</P>
    <P>At the moment people have to apply to the local county council, the health board, the Department of the Environment, the Department of Agriculture and the Office of Public Works and each of those agencies disclaimed responsibility, saying another agency was responsible.  The Office of Public Works is responsible in the area of drainage, it is not a compensating Department, except under the 1945 Drainage Act, under which commercial companies have drawn down huge amounts of money from the State because the water was dirty.  If the Office of Public Works is charged, on behalf of the taxpayer, with making a contribution to improving the infrastructure of waterways, it is conferring benefits on local people, properties and companies and it should not be possible for those people to draw down millions of pounds in compensation to the detriment of the taxpayer and other parts of the country.  I believe in localised drainage and there should be no need for environmental impact studies.  In the case of a small localised scheme there should be no need for compensation. Work should be executed and the responsibility for maintenance thereafter given to the local authority.</P>
    <P>One area of my own constituency, mid and south Galway, is bedevilled by consistent flooding by the Dunkellin River.  I am happy to be here today to speak on this Bill because on 28 January I traversed the Athenry-Loughrea Road on three occasions, at 8 a.m., 12 noon and 6 p.m.  There was no sign to indicate that a particular part of that road was flooded.  I was, therefore, lucky to come out of a serious flood with my life although I lost a new car.  That is how serious the situation in our area is.  The Dunkellin River has bedevilled the livelihoods of people in the east, mid and south Galway areas for the past century.  Although it was second on the list in 1986 for drainage, it is now fourth. Heretofore the priorities for drainage <Col N="1932" /> were decided by the commissioners who made a recommendation, whereupon the Minister decided when to allocate the money, and a programme went forward. Works that were instituted by Mark Killilea, Minister at the time, and others have not been carried out.  Certain localised works should be carried out now.  I welcome the section of the Bill that allows local groups to execute works in co-operation with the Office of Public Works and other agencies.</P>

However, Woodford, Portumna, Ballycrinane and Ballyshrule, are still subject to flooding. A recent plan for improvement works included diverting the river.  There is an area about 800 metres long for which the Office of Public Works is not responsible because the course of the river was altered.</P>
      <P>I expect works will be carried out in the Ballyshrule area.  I welcome the Bill and hope that the commitments given by previous Ministers, Deputies Jim and Michael Higgins, will be honoured. Hopefully there will not be localised flooding in 1996.  Houses, land and stock are expensive to repair and replace.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister every success in office and acknowledge the immense contribution made by the commissioners and the excellent staff in the Office of Public Works.  I hope they will be allowed to proceed with their many plans which will benefit the nation.</P>

      <P>There was a by-election in my county in 1964 when Fianna Fáil was in Government.  The main issue was drainage of the River Shannon.  That was the shibboleth.  It was an issue in all elections and was used by Fianna Fáil with great success.  The then Taoiseach, now deceased, thrust his first into the air with great emotion at a public meeting in Castlerea and said: &ldquo;If it is the last thing I do I will drain the River Shannon&rdquo;. He is dead and there have been many Taoisigh since then but not a bucket of water was taken from the Shannon.  So much for political promises. Fianna Fáil has a disgraceful record as far as promises are concerned.  For over 50 years they promised they would drain the Shannon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is the Government's response to the problem which arose this year.  Local flooding has been a problem for many years but no State agency was responsible for dealing with it.  The Office of Public works only deal with drainage and flooding on a catchment basis.  Local authorities have a limited role but have insufficient funds to enable them carry out works worth talking about.  I am a member of the River Suck joint drainage board.  Drainage boards are maintenance boards with limited financial resources.  Their main source of finance come from local authorities within the catchment area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1934" /> Between 1 December and 1 March, 26 inches of rain fell in the west, far in excess of the average rainfall for the period.  According to the meteorological office, the normal rainfall during that period is 14 inches and for a year it is 19 inches.  The flooding created terrible problems in south Galway and other areas such as Roscommon, in Bushfield, Brackloon and around Athlone.  Some people were isolated in their homes and others had to leave their homes and lands.  They were in a desperate plight and looked to Government agencies for assistance.  The Government came to their rescue and introduced this Bill.</P>
    <P>In 1990 there were severe floods especially in the area of the Shannon Basin.  I attended public meetings in Athlone and south Roscommon.  There was tremendous misery and loss as a result of that flood.  I tabled questions to the then Minister, Deputy Treacy, asking what the Government intended to do.  It did not do anything.  At a public meeting someone said to Deputy O'Rourke who was then a Minister: &ldquo;When you were in Opposition you said much could be done about drainage in your area&rdquo;.  Her response was: &ldquo;That was then, this is now&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are grateful to the Government for bringing in this imaginative legislation which is tailored to meet the need.  The Bill proposes to deal with localised flooding.  It is much slower to carry out arterial drainage works in a catchment than it is in a local area.  It usually takes years to survey catchments. Deputy Treacy tried to denigrate the Minister, Deputy Higgins.  He promised that as long as it was feasible to remedy localised flooding through the provisions of the Bill it will be remedied. The Government will keep that promise.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to listen to Deputy Treacy talk about what happened in 1986 and how certain catchments were moved up and down the priority list. That is the first I heard of it.  He forgot to mention that in 1988 the Minister for Agriculture, then Deputy O'Kennedy, agreed at the farm talks in Brussels to <Col N="1935" /> the abolition of EC aid for field drainage in Ireland.  Field grants for drainage were available until 1980.  After the mid1970s most of the funding for this work came from the EU.  Funding was also available under the western drainage scheme, an 80 per cent funded scheme, which operated from the late 1970s until the 1980s.  In 1988, at the EC farm talks, the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture agreed to the abolition of all assistance for field drainage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and would like to put forward some suggestions which might improve it.  There is no provision which allows for direct co-operation with the drainage boards.  I am a member of the joint drainage board governing the River Suck, one of the longest rivers in the country.  Like other drainage boards, it is funded by the local authority or authorities which have land in the catchment area of the river.  I regret that these drainage boards which have acquired an enormous amount of experience and expertise in drainage and which carry out maintenance and flood relief works on an annual basis have been excluded from the Bill.  The Office of Public Works should endeavour to avail of the experience of all the official bodies involved in drainage.  It would be more efficient for the flood relief works on the River Suck catchment to be carried out by the joint drainage board and for the design work to be carried out by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>Drainage boards should be given adequate resources with which to carry out this work.  In this year's Estimates a sum of £2.517 million, an increase of 7 per cent on last year's figure of £2.345 million has been provided for arterial drainage works.  While I welcome the increase it is totally inadequate in terms of the amount of work which needs to be carried out.  The amount provided under the heading &ldquo;drainage maintenance by the Office of Public Works&rdquo; is £5.250 million, an increase of 1 per cent on the figure for last year.  While in previous years funding for construction and <Col N="1936" /> ongoing works accounted for most of the drainage budget, nevertheless this level of funding is inadequate to deal with the problem.  The Office of Public Works should be able to carry out the necessary maintenance works on rivers and streams every four or five years. However, because it can only carry out this work every ten years the problem is almost as bad as when it initially cleared the channels.</P>
    <P>We live in the era of the great environmental debate about wetlands, waterways etc.  Much of this debate is uninformed and it has led to a resistance to drainage works.  We need to keep drainage systems open if we want to prevent environmental damage caused by waterlogging, flooding and excessive weed growth in river beds.  No reference in made to this in the great environmental debate and this, in turn, is reflected in the funding provided for this work in the Estimates.  We must take on that aspect of the great environmental debate which tells that we should not carry out any drainage works.  It is crucial that adequate funding is provided for the implementation of the provisions of this Bill.  I hope other agencies will be invited to carry out drainage works and that they will be given sufficient funding.</P>
    <P>I am fortunate to represent a constituency where an arterial drainage works scheme is in progress in the Boyle river catchment.  This scheme, which was originally called the Boyle-Bonnet drainage scheme, was introduced in the 1982 budget by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy John Bruton.  This is the only arterial drainage scheme which has been commenced since 1982.  During the preparation of its Estimates last November the previous Government proposed to terminate the scheme this year.  That decision is reflected in the Estimates under which the Government is operating.  It is unacceptable that this scheme should be terminated two years before it is due to finish.  Under the 1945 Act there is an obligation to ensure that all catchment drainage schemes undertaken are properly completed and I call <Col N="1937" /> on the Minister to ensure that this work is finished.  If the scheme is terminated many of the 73 employees face redundancy. The spirit of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> is that no Government employees should be made redundant against their will.  I would not mind if the work was completed but I object to the scheme being terminated now.  If the Minister does not take serious note of what I am saying he will face strong resistance from the farming community whose land was seriously flooded last winter and for whom this scheme is vital.  One could not anger farmers more than by telling them that a drainage scheme which would resolve the problem of flooding on their land is to be terminated.  I do not believe the nonsense being circulated within the Office of Public Works that it is not cost efficient.  Naturally people who want to terminate such schemes will make those arguments but I do not accept them.</P>
    <P>Environmental damage is not involved.  Any work being done has positive economic benefits in terms of jobs for the area and in terms of land improvement.  There are still thousands of people who depend on small farming. There are thousands of hardy souls who will not be forced out by economic handship.  They will endure a certain amount of hardship and low income to live in these parts of the world.  We should do nothing to increase the pressure on them to leave.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Foxe.  This new legislation to combat persistent flooding is welcome.  Both physical and financial relief of hardship is necessary.  The Bill extends and amends the powers to execute works of drainage and flood relief outlined by the 1945 Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The former Minister with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Jim Higgins, in the Seanad was much more generous than the previous speaker on the Government benches in putting on record the amount of work done in preparing such legislation by the former Minister of State, Deputy Noel <Col N="1938" /> Dempsey.  Deputy Higgins stated in the Seanad that the work by Deputy Noel Dempsey on this issue was of considerable benefit in expediting the introduction of this legislation.  I am pleased there is at least one generous Member on the Government benches who is prepared to give credit where credit is due.</P>
    <P>Now there is much greater emphasis on the environment and care must be taken to minimise or avoid damage to wildlife, fisheries and landscape.  It is unfair to blame environmentalists for holding up work.  It is up to Members on all sides to ensure that legislation is brought in to deal with these problems fairly, effectively and honestly.  I hope this legislation will lead to that type of approach and enable specific problem areas to be addressed and localised flooding relief schemes to be undertaken.</P>
    <P>Section 3 will allow for the preparation and execution of work in respect of restricted areas, particularly urban areas.  The Minister will be aware that the town of Ennis suffered badly during the recent flooding; both residential and business properties were badly affected.  This leads to financial and psychological hardship.  There are difficulties for those not insured and for those who have been insured.  People are wondering whether they will be in a position to obtain insurance in the future and whether they will be able to pay what is most likely to be an increased premium.</P>
    <P>In regard to issues of compensation, there is much concern as to whether enough money will be allocated to the Red Cross for distribution to compensate for flood damage where there has been no insurance.  Already, individuals in County Clare have had to pay sums of £280 for assessment of damage to be eligible to apply for compensation.  One person in Sixmilebridge had to pay experts £550 to apply.  Is this money refundable?  Such a situation is ludicrous.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned a number of times in the House the hardship caused by the flooding in Ennis to both business and <Col N="1939" /> private houses, Loughville, Sixmilebridge, Newmarket-on-Fergus and all over north Clare.  We have been promised by the Government that compensation will be forthcoming.  Why the delay?</P>
    <P>Although Clare County Council made its submission to the Department of the Environment there is still no news of plans to rebuild the bank along the river Fergus to prevent further flooding to Fergus Park, yet we are only talking about 180 meters of river bank. The people affected by the flooding in Fergus Park are extremely concerned about their position.  They have had to undergo tremendous hardship.  Hardship is a word that conjures up all sorts of difficulties which people face.  One cannot emphasise or exaggerate the difficulties which many people throughout County Clare have suffered during the past few months due to flooding.  It is all very well for Ministers to visit the area &mdash; we welcome such interest and concern &mdash; but we would prefer some practical evidence of their concern in terms of financial help in the short term and legislation in the long term.  I am pleased to contribute to this debate today because we see that legislation is beginning to move forward.</P>
    <P>I hope the Office of Public Works will examine areas where the development of roads, housing or industrial estates has increased the discharge of surface waters into rivers and watercourses. This has caused serious problems in many areas, not least in Loughville, Ennis, County Clare.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision where a third party wishes to deal with the flooding problem but perhaps the Office of Public Works was not in a position to fund the project.  The third party could, according to this Bill, meet the shortfall of funding.  While this would address the immediate problem I hope the Minister or his successors would not use this as an opt out clause, thereby reneging on their responsibility to deal with such situations through the Office of Public Works.  The onus is on the Minister <Col N="1940" /> because obviously the buck stops with him.  I do not wish to see any further delays.  I add my voice to the comments made earlier by my colleague, Deputy Noel Treacy, regarding the tremendous work which the Office of Public Works has done and continues to do on behalf of the people.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed about the potential for delays in the preparation of schemes to relieve flooding and the need to deal with emergency cases.  All of us whose constituencies were badly affected in December and January know the need to be able to deal with such problems immediately. There has been a number of emergency cases.  Clare County Council did its utmost to deal with the problem but obviously greater help will be needed from State agencies, through legislation, to deal with those matters immediately and effectively.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of coastal and flooding near Kilrush, County Clare and that such areas have been badly affected.  There seems to be a reluctance by the State to have the damage repaired.  Will the Minister state categorically who has the overriding responsibility in such cases?  Some Members will be aware that there is a tendency in such matters to pass the buck.</P>
    <P>What does the Minister propose to do about the flash flooding in the Clonlara area of the River Shannon?  Will he elaborate on section 10 which deals with these matters when replying to the debate.  I share the fear, given the derisory sum of £2 million for this year, that little work will be done in 1995 on arterial drainage.  It is all very well to welcome such legislation but we all know there is little point in doing so unless substantial funding is available to back up such legislation.  Does the Minister intend to provide the necessary funds to county councils for maintenance works?</P>
    <P>I wish this Bill well but we all know that the real test of any Bill is its implementation, following which we will assess its real value.  For the sake of <Col N="1941" /> those in County Clare and elsewhere whose property was flooded on more than one occasion I sincerely hope that this Bill will have positive and immediate results.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. Foxe Mr. Foxe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy de Valera for sharing her time with me and offer my congratulations to the new Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Coveney, on his appointment.  I also wish the Minister of State, Deputy Carey well.  He had his hands full during the spring but I am sure that this did not present an insurmountable obstacle.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  While it is easy to be critical we must recognise the good work done by the Office of Public Works, particularly since the mid-1940s. Since then 7,300 miles of drain have been opened servicing 650,000 acres of land.  Given that the average farm size is 40 acreas one can imagine the number of farms and households which have benefited as a result.  At present day values the commissioners have spent £640 million in carrying out this work. This is not to be sneezed at.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to put a mechanism in place under which the Office of Public Works may devise schemes to prevent or relieve localised flooding.  This should not mean that larger schemes will not be introduced in the future.  We should think carefully about this matter and provide for the introduction of such schemes in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are becoming greener by the month, in terms of agricultural practices. At present food is being produced with the aid of fertilisers.  As time proceeds there will be a dramatic reduction in the volume used, meaning that more land will be required to produce food. While major drainage schemes are not the order of the day in a few year's time the trend may be reversed.  In this context 50 per cent to 60 per cent of the world's population go to bed hungry.  In addition, 20 million children died from starvation last year.  Despite this food production in this and other countries is limited.  If this trend is reversed there <Col N="1942" /> will be a dramatic increase in demand for land.  I foresee this happening.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of welcome provisions.  The local authorities will be requested to conduct an annual review of drainage works within their areas, which is desirable.  In certain counties maintenance works on local rivers have not been carried out in recent years.  Prior to 1988 the Commissioner of Public Works footed the bill in carrying out works but recouped maintenance costs from local authorities. This trend should not be reversed as many local authorities do not have the price of a stamp.  The Minster of State would not be able to do much for the people of Gort with the money available to local authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 9 (3) (a) states that if relevant works are modified, relocated or altered in any way by a person, with or without the consent of the commissioners, the commissioners may reinstate those works to their original condition before such modification.  If the commissioners give their consent why would they need to reinstate the works concerned to their original condition before such modification?  This appears to be a contradiction.</P>
    <P>I hope that the local schemes devised for the Shannon basin, as far north as Boyle in County Roscommon, will continue to relieve flooding and provide some comfort for the people living in those areas.  During the spring there were floods in areas which have traditionally suffered from flooding.  The problem on this occasion was that it was much more severe than in previous years.  In addition, areas where flooding had never occurred were unexpectedly submerged.  The areas most affected included Gort in south Galway, Ennis, County Clare and parts of County Roscommon. When the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Higgins, visited County Roscommon he gave his word that he would try to secure funding.  However, he did not meet with much success when he went to Europe for this purpose.  The sum secured was inadequate.  Since then, because of certain happenings <Col N="1943" /> here, there has been some lateral movement and the Minister of State has moved on.  I wish him well.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and wish all associated with it the best of luck.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack" hpid="Mr. McCormack Mr. McCormack">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is necessary to allow the Office of Public Works to become involved in relief drainage works.  The traditional responsibility of the Office of Public Works related only to arterial drainage work.  I acknowledge the good work of the Office of Public Works who, under the 1945 Act, carried out many useful drainage schemes, particularly the Corrib and Clare drainage scheme in my county.  That work was very useful and to this day reaps benefit for County Galway.</P>
      <P>The recent flooding crisis in Galway, particularly in the Gort and south Galway area, could not be tackled under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  This Bill provides for the Office of Public Works to become involved in relief drainage work and other work that will relieve hardship for people badly affected by flooding.  The crisis in south Galway and the publicity it received nationally and internationally probably speeded up the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister of State with responsibility for western development, Deputy Carey, and the new Minister with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Coveney.  He has taken over a very demanding and important position and will be a very busy man.  I compliment his predecessor, Deputy Jim Higgins, for the great work he did in producing this legislation and steering it through the Dáil.  At a public meeting in Gort in February he gave an assurance that this legislation would be before the Dáil by the end of May.  Despite everything that happened since and that he is no longer in that Ministry, the deadline was missed by only one day, which is a great record for a Minister.  Deputy Higgins did more in the five months as Minister of State at the Department of Finance <Col N="1944" /> than previous Ministers did in eight years &mdash; I heard some of the previous Ministers speaking on this Bill earlier, but I will not comment further on that. Deputy Higgins approached his job enthusiastically and as a result of his efforts we are debating this Bill.</P>
    <P>There was serious flooding in Gort and the south Galway area this year. This problem has existed for a number of years and is steadily getting worse, this being the worst year.  The flooding starts near Peterswell outside Loughrea where the rain water from the Slieve Aughty and Roxboro hills rushes down into the valley flooding Grannagh, Blackrock, Loughwadda, Skeahana and Drumore.  It forms a basin there and goes underground at Ballylea and on to Coole Lake.  The water from Loughcuttra and Gort also flows into Coole which causes an overflow at Coole Lake.  The underground system from Coole Lake to Kinvara simply cannot take the water.  The overflow of Coole Lake has been the major cause of flooding in the south Galway area, in Killomoran, Ballinasteagh, Tierneavan and Glenbrack housing development outside Gort.</P>
    <P>There was flooding in other locations in south Galway which are not connected to Coole, such as Kiltiernan, Rashane, Roo and Tarmon, and the flooding at Tarmon has not receded since.  It should be understood that we are not talking about flash flooding in the south Galway area but flooding that occurs in January and lasts until May.</P>
    <P>There has been very severe flooding of houses in this area.  I have seen the pain and anguish on the faces of people affected.  One man moved his wife and family from their flooded house at Grannagh to his mother's house, but within three to four weeks her house was also flooded even though she lived on higher ground.  That man's house was under five to six feet of water, and that remained the case for six to eight weeks. Six or seven houses in that area have been abandoned and will not be occupied again until a permanent solution is found to the problem.  How can one <Col N="1945" /> expect people to restore their houses after the destruction and devastation caused by flooding in the knowledge that the problem may recur next January? These people, some of them in Glenbrack and other isolated areas, will not go back to their houses.</P>
    <P>Many reasons have been advanced for the severity of the problem in south Galway such as the change in forestry patterns on the hills around Loughrea, Kilchreest and the Slieve Aughty mountains, changing farming patterns, with the reclamation of much land in the area in the last ten or 15 years, the filling of swallow holes and heavier rainfall. Whatever the cause, the problem got progressively worse.  In 1990 the flooding was the worst in living memory and the people thought they would never again witness such flooding. However, in 1991 flooding recurred, with the worst flooding ever occurring this year.</P>
    <P>This Bill will also allow immediate steps to be taken to alleviate some of the problem.  It will allow the Office of Public Works to open up and clean out swallow holes, but that may not solve the problem.  Eventually the water will have to be drained to the sea, which is an achieveable objective.  Under the 1945 Act that could not be done but this Bill will make it possible to carry out that work which is already at planning stage.  Consultants are being interviewed this week for the job.</P>
    <P>While county councils respond to the problem of flooding, they can only do so much.  They carried out very good emergency work in south Galway this year in removing people from isolated areas whose houses were flooded and roads cut off.  County councils are responsible for keeping roads clear and they often respond by allocating money for the raising of roads.  This matter was first brought to my attention in 1990 when flooding was very bad on the Turloughmore-Athenry road at Coolarne. The county council allocated £35,000 towards raising the roads in that area.  I met one of the council engineers around the time who told me that the road <Col N="1946" /> which was flooded is 17 feet over the Clare river, one and a half miles away.</P>
    <P>In co-operation with the council a local committee succeeded in draining the road to the Clare river.  With the county council I was successful in having the money which was allocated for the raising of roads transferred to the drainage scheme, and that alleviated the problem.  The problem had existed for hundreds of years but was solved in a couple of months.  The road has been clear since, with the exception of one location on which flooding occurs for a short period, but that can be solved also. I am a firm believer that the solution to many of these problems lies in drainage rather than other remedial works.  In many cases the raising of roads leads to further problems because the road acts as a dam and holds back water from its natural course to a drainage outlet.  This brings me back to the south Galway scheme and the drainage works carried out there.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting at the height of the crisis in Kiltiernan in south Galway, a village on the main road between Galway and Gort. The main road, local houses and the national school were flooded and in the village at Caheradoo road access to nine houses was cut off by floods of nine to ten feet.  People had access to their houses through five or six fields half a mile from the main road, but on the Sunday I visited the area, that access was also cut off due to flooding. Out of that frustration the local people decided they were not prepared to tolerate the position any longer.  They did not have access to their houses in 1990 when the flood water was two feet less than until 15 May this year.  Those people initiated a drainage scheme to drain the flood water.  They thought it would be a simple matter to drain it as far as Fingall Lake, but that did not solve the problem.  Eventually they had to drain the water to Ballindereen and the sea at Killeenaran.  They brought the water a distance of five and a half miles from Kiltiernan national school and drained the water from the village of <Col N="1947" /> Caheradoo in 12 hours, which in 1990 has remained closed for 12 weeks. Those people encountered difficulties. Everybody told them the work they were carrying out was illegal, that they did not have any authority to do it and that it would harm the environment. The scheme was especially designed by Tobin Engineers, consultant engineers in Galway to ensure the environment would not be harmed and I challenge anybody who studies it to say otherwise. They will see that it did not have a harmful but a beneficial effect on the environment because it was designed to take only the surplus water away from the houses, the national school, five of six roads and a nursing home at Clough Ballymore near Ballindereen and the natural turloughs were restored to their normal level.</P>
    <P>If those types of schemes were allowed, they would greatly benefit the environment because wildlife in those natural turloughs and lakes nest and feed on high reeds at the lake edges. This year, because those lakes and turloughs were flooded for several hundred yards, and miles in some cases, wildlife was driven out to hatch in farm ditches and on farm land.  The ducks on Caheradoo Lake did not successfully hatch this year because the eggs were taken by foxes.  Because of the scheme initiated in co-operation with local people wildlife will return to its natural environment next year, there will be no excess flood water and the natural turloughs will be restored to their normal level.  That is important.  As one who encouraged the local community to carry out that scheme I encountered great difficulty from people who told me such a scheme was illegal and would harm the environment.  I am as interested as anybody in protecting the environment and I will bow to nobody in that regard.</P>
    <P>The consultant engineers dealing with that scheme were also interested in protecting the environment and ensured that the road openings were of a certain <Col N="1948" /> height to facilitate the draining of surplus water.  It took five weeks to secure permission from Galway County Council for a road opening licence under that scheme for Ballindereen to allow the natural flow of the water to the sea at Killeenaran.  Galway County Council was very reluctant to grant that licence because of the dangers it might pose to the environment.  It is satisfied that no damage was caused and that it was an environmentally friendly scheme.  My colleague, Deputy Connor, referred to this matter and it will be the subject of a major debate before flood waters in south Galway and other areas are drained.  Is it not time that those interested in the environment met with people whose land and houses are flooded and who are unable to return to their homes this year?  This is a problem they must solve through co-operation.</P>
    <P>I warn the people of south Galway that even though the Government, the Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, and the new Minister, are making every effort to find a solution, they will encounter many obstacles.  Environmental impact studies, which are time consuming, will have to be carried out before flood waters are drained to the sea.  There is no easy solution to the problem.  I am not an engineer but a mere politician and I know it was not possible to drain the water from the road in Coolarne, which was 17 feet higher than a river a mile and a half away, except by digging the channel to the river.  It is not possible to drain the water in South Galway six miles from the overflow of Colle Lake in Killomoran to Kinvara except by digging a channel. It may not be necessary to dig a channel that distance, as proved to be the case in Kiltiernan-Ballindereen scheme when we had to dig only 500 yards to drain the water from one flooded area to a lake or a turlough which drained it over natural ground to Ballindereen.  We then had to dig an open trench a mile and a half through wetland to the sea at Killeenaran.  It will not be necessary to carry out any works that will damage the environment.  The <Col N="1949" /> draining of such flood waters is a major problem and it is time a public debate was held to discuss the dangers.</P>
    <P>I am in possession of correspondence between the wildlife section of the Office of Public Works and Galway County Council.  Some of the dangers posed by the scheme proposed to be carried out by the local community are frightening.  A paragraph of one letter states:</P>
    <P>Under the EU Habitats Directive, Ireland must protect Candidate SACs.  [That area is a candidate for SACs].  If we fail to do so the European Court may instruct the local authority responsible for the damage to reinstate the habitat at whatever cost.  There could also be a loss of European co-funding to the authority responsible.  Withholding of European funding need not be confined to projects in the &ldquo;conservation&rdquo; related field alone.</P>
    <P>The language used in that letter to the county council alarmed the county manager and luckily it did not arrive until he had granted the road opening licence and the flood water had been drained to the sea in Killeeraran and the houses were no longer flooded.  If that letter had arrived before the road opening licence was granted the nursing home in Clough Ballymore in which there were 35 elderly patients, to which a doctor did not have access, would be flooded still as would the nine houses in Caheradoo and Kiltiernan national school.</P>
    <P>That work was carried out with due regard to the environment.  Nobody deliberately sets out to damage the environment.  This problem must be addressed.  On 13 April I contacted the person who wrote that letter to Galway County Council.  I wrote him a friendly letter suggesting that all those involved should meet and discuss the matter, including officials and those affected. Similar to events in the recent past, I am disappointed I have not received a reply to that letter.  That is not the proper way to treat a public representative or a <Col N="1950" /> community in south Galway who are living in fear that such flooding will occur again in January.</P>
    <P>I sympathise with people who are not returning to their homes because they are afraid they will be flooded again. Their problems cannot be solved by next January because it is necessary to carry out environmental impact studies. It is also necessary to appoint a firm of consulting engineers to devise a solution to the problem, irrespective of the cost. There is no easy solution.  We must find a way of draining the flood water to the sea at Kinvara.  That will impact on the environment, but if it is not drained, the problem will be devastating for some people in south Galway.  I have walked over flooded lands in the past month where the water has only now receded. Those lands are black with nothing except dock weeds growing on them, the only weeds that survived the floods.</P>
    <P>I accept the compensation package was good.  Farmers who received compensation of £24 an acre, a modest sum, have to reseed their land, but they have suffered the loss of acreage under water until May and have lost silage for this year.  How will those people survive or face another winter in which similar problems may arise?  We should cut out the red tape and do the necessary work to solve the problems in south Galway.  I very much appreciate the praise Senator Fahey and Deputy Treacy directed at me for my work in the south Galway area; which I no longer represent because it has been transferred to east Galway.  However, that will not stop my efforts to resolve the problems in that area.  The problems in south Galway today may be the problems of west Galway tomorrow.  I will not rest easy until the problem is resolved.  I assure Senator Fahey and Deputy Treacy that I will not let down the people of that area.</P>

      <P>This legislation is long overdue and most welcome.  I pay tribute to my party colleague, Senator Daly, for introducing a Private Members' Bill in the Seanad which, in many respects, was superior to this Bill which amends the 1945 Act which was excellent legislation in its time, but has many shortcomings for dealing with present difficulties.  Deputy Michael Ahern referred to a number of provisions he believed required improvement.  He spoke in particular about the need to establish a review body and suggested a possible membership and functions for the body.  The Minister should consider that.</P>
      <P>Members are concerned about the legal competence of the Office of Public Works to undertake emergency works. Concern was expressed about the threat posed to individuals who carry out emergency works and this was borne out by Deputy McCormack's remarks about the efforts of local people to address the problems in the south Galway area.  Galway County Council showed no regard for those affected or respect for the public representative whose representations have not yet been responded to.  Deputy Ahern also made a strong case for the legislation to provide for compensation payments. This is a grave omission from the Bill and I hope the Minister will address it. While nationally relatively few people were affected by the flooding, the extent of the suffering was enormous.  Under the provisions of the Bill it should be possible for particular cases to be dealt with, as happened earlier this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter of concern is that no State body or local authority is ultimately responsible for particular problems. If one raises a matter with a county council, one may be advised to take it up with the Office of Public <Col N="1952" /> Works where one may be told the matter might be more appropriately dealt with by the Department of the Marine, and officials in that Department may refer one to the Department of the Environment.  This is very frustrating for public representatives and the individuals concerned and is not adequately addressed in the Bill.  While this may not be appropriate legislation to deal with the matter, it should be dealt with as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>An area which has been overlooked in discussions on flooding is the effect of coastal erosion and high tides.  The scenario I outlined frequently applies to those problems.  In the Leadmore West area of Kilrush substantial damage was done by high tides on two occasions this year.  People appreciate that they qualify for compensation under the flood relief agricultural scheme because of the damage caused by the encroachment of the sea but similar problems are likely to arise in the future.  While coastal erosion affects many areas, it is not always a major problem.  We frequently propose grandiose measures to address it and are put off by the cost of implementing them.  For example, the cost of dealing with such problems in the Kilkee areas was put at more than £100,000, but eventually a small group of farmers reconstructed a sluice at a low cost which substantially improved the position. Similar problems also arise in the Quilty and Belharbour areas, but there is reluctance to carry out the necessary works.</P>
    <P>Much of the work done under the provisions of this Bill will arise from last year's extensive flooding.  Because remedial works were prohibited under the 1945 Act, particular difficulties arose in the Sixmilebridge area of County Clare but they can be addressed under this legislation.  An undertaking has been given to carry out necessary sewerage works, funding for which has not yet been cleared by Europe.</P>
    <P>Many people in the north Clare area were also prevented from living in their homes for many weeks because of <Col N="1953" /> flooding.  This presented major difficulties for the families involved.  Now that the flooding has receded and the matter is no longer highlighted by the media, people are concerned that action will not be taken until similar difficulties arise next year.  That this legislation is on the Statute Book does not guarantee that action will be taken because action requires funding.  While it is intended to provide funding, there are many difficulties to be addressed.  Perhaps the Minister should consider sanctioning some of the works outlined by Deputy McCormack which would not cost a great deal of money and would be more effective than some of the grandiose schemes proposed.</P>
    <P>In the New Quay area of north Clare a national secondary road was closed for 12 weeks this year, seven or eight weeks last year and a minimum of four weeks over several years.  That is unacceptable and the matter should be addressed. Environmentalists are concerned about the means that might be adopted to undertake relief in that area.  I hope the National Roads Authority will ensure funding is provided to clear the road. The Minister outlined nine towns where special relief works are to commence immediately.  I was disappointed that Ennis, a large town where major damage was done, was excluded.  We need to examine on a regular basis areas where damage has occurred and where relatively little work would help to alleviate the suffering of the people involved.</P>
    <P>If I were to list all the areas of difficulty in my own constituency I would use all of the 20 minutes available to me but I want to accommodate my colleague, Deputy Mattie Brennan, who has problems in his area.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation and hope the Minister will consider the suggestions I made.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill. As the arterial drainage scheme is no longer in operation I welcome the new proposal being introduced.  The solution to the serious problem we are discussing in the House is a complex and costly <Col N="1954" /> one and the passing of this Bill will result in the spending of a great deal of money.  However, it is a step in the right direction.</P>
      <P>The Arrow and Owenmore rivers in County Sligo did not come under the arterial drainage scheme.  Perhaps I should not criticise but when Deputy Connaughton's party was in Government it suspended both the arterial drainage and the farm modernisation schemes.  When an application for funding was made to Europe, it was not forthcoming because the then Government said it was not interested in arterial drainage.</P>

      <P>That Fine Gael Coalition Government discontinued all cost benefit analysis in regard to arterial drainage.  For two years, the issue of arterial drainage was not on that Government's agenda.  It was not until the then Minister for Finance, Ray MacSharry, requested a cost benefit analysis and an environmental impact study of the Arrow and Owenmore rivers that action was taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that why they were done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Those studies were completed, but unfortunately no money was forthcoming from Europe for arterial drainage.  Ray MacSharry was one of our finest Ministers for Finance and he was also one of the best EC Commissioners for Agriculture.  We were fortunate to have such a man in Europe because, thanks to him, farmers in the Arrow and Owenmore catchment area receive regular cheques.  Members of this House who are farmers receive those cheques also, including myself. Despite what the Minister said in regard to a cost benefit analysis and an environmental impact study, they will not have to be carried out on the Arrow and Owenmore rivers because they <Col N="1955" /> have already been done.  If the necessary funding is made available, work can commence on those rivers immediately.</P>
      <P>In the Arrow and Owenmore catchment area, a total of 29,000 acres of land are flooded.  That land is often flooded for two or three weeks in the summer &mdash; it is not a problem that is confined to the winter.  Continuous floding occurs on that land when there is a heavy rainfall. This problem affects about 3,000 farmers, most of whom have farms of approximately 42 acres.  I recently received a letter from the Office of Public Works stating that if the draining of these rivers would improve the quality of farming in these areas, it would not object to that works.  Draining those rivers would greatly improve the quality of life of the farmers in that catchment area.  They have suffered greatly over the years and I hope, when this Bill is enacted, the Arrow and Owenmore rivers will be drained.</P>
      <P>I am familiar with the benefits of arterial drainage.  I have a 35-acre farm, part of which is on the banks of the River Moy.  The draining of the River Moy was of immense benefit to the people living in that catchment area.  I am sure all Members hope that the same results can be achieved when the Arrow and Owenmore Rivers are drained.</P>
      <P>The committee formed to demand arterial drainage works for the Owenmore and Arrow rivers has met the former Taoiseach and various Ministers, including Ministers for Finance. Recently its members met with the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Higgins, in Kennedy's Pub in Doocastle.  I was present at that meeting during which the Minister said he would favourably consider their request.  He was quite sincere and the committee members were happy with the outcome of the meeting. I know the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, will be sympathetic to their case also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Nealon accused me in this House of saying that money was being made available to drain the Arrow and <Col N="1956" /> Owenmore rivers.  The Deputy and I are the best of friends but I must correct him.  I received a letter from the present Minister for Finance confirming that his predecessor, Deputy Bertie Ahern, considered proposals to make money available for the draining of all rivers.</P>
    <P>More than anybody else, the people of Galway suffered greatly this winter from the effects of flooding, but people in other areas have suffered also.  I continually raised this matter with previous Ministers, including the then Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, Deputy Brendan Daly. I invited him to see the problems that existed in the Arrow and Owenmore river catchment area.  I raised the issue also with Deputy Noel Treacy when he was Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works.  He gave my request favourable consideration and I pay tribute to him for the work he did in that regard.  I pay tribute also to Deputy Noel Dempsey for the work he carried out in regard to this problem. When the then Minister of State at the Office of Public Works, Deputy Dempsey, left office the Bill was almost ready and it is welcome that it has been introduced so quickly.  This Bill is a step in the right direction for the people in the catchment areas of the Arrow and Owenmore Rivers.</P>

      <P>I join others in welcoming this Bill.  It gives hope and confidence to people, who through no fault of their own have to live through winter flooding, when ordinary everyday life becomes an absolute drudgery. No one should have to go through that torture.  Where it is possible to drain a river although there are situations where it is not possible to do so, the State has a responsibility to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everyone is aware of the flooding in Gort, because they saw on television <Col N="1957" /> what those people had to go through. However, they are not the only ones affected.  In the previous Fine Gael administration I was involved in the Department of Agriculture and I remember making a statement that drew a fair amount of criticism that the time had come to stop talking about draining the Shannon.  People through it was unusual that a Deputy from the west should say that.  I have always believed there are limits in a country with an economy of our size.  Of course, we have to manage the Shannon better. Where it is possible to drain, it should be drained.  Because we are an island country with low-lying areas we always had the problem of flooding and I suppose it is fair to say we always will.  Various attempts were made in recent times to manage the Shannon, this great tourism and fishing asset.  People throughout Europe and the world envy our majestic Shannon but we have not treated it with the respect it deserves.  I do not hear people saying that it is possible either from an engineering or financial point of view to drain it.  What does one do then?  Take the situation as it is and draw up plans to provide greater access to our wonderful waterway.  We have all seen what can &mdash; and has been &mdash; done in the Ballyconnell-Erne waterway.  I look forward to investment in the Shannon project but I do not think it will be in drainage.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable and fair to pay tribute to the Office of Public Works.  It has done a hugely expert job, it may have taken a long time but that was because of the on-off funding by various Governments down through the years. In my area we have seen the benefits of one of the bigger schemes, the Corrib catchment, and this made a tremendous difference to half the county.  Back in the early 1980s, after the last field drainage under the western drainage scheme, the European Community more or less said it would no longer give money to farmers to drain their land but finance them in a different way.  The EU provided incentives to grow an environmentally friendly crop rather than for <Col N="1958" /> drainage and provided incentives for investment in forestry.  It was felt that there would be a better return from forestry than from draining poor land that would revert to its previous state under most conditions.  There is a certain validity in that but as a farmer I have always believed that the only way a farmer could make a living was by the way he worked his land.  It is a pity that there is not some limited help for field drainage because it would give farmers an extra four or five acres.  That debate is over.</P>
    <P>If we do not have the resources to carry out large drainage schemes what happens in isolated areas which have not been drained because they were not part of a larger scheme?  When I was in Government I introduced a scheme modelled on the local improvement scheme for groups of farmers to come together and carry out drainage works with 50 per cent assistance from the State and 50 per cent local contribution. Several little jobs we carried out under that scheme.  The Bill provides for better designed programmes for the future draining of fragmented areas.  It is not confined to the west and even though the majority of Members who contributed come from the north and north-west people still think it only applies to the west.  Flooding is a problem in many countries.  My understanding is that if the land can be drained, in other words if there is an outfall, an opportunity will be given through the good offices of the Office of Public Works in conjunction with locals to alleviate the flooding.</P>
    <P>I will now touch on a number of aspects.  I have found as a public representative that it is possible to get great local co-operation but sometimes people &mdash; for reasons best known to themselves &mdash; decide to hold up a good scheme that will help them and their neighbours.  It is not in the common good that a person should be allowed to hold up progress for a frivolous reason. I am glad the Bill provides for the right to object.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with the decision to reduce the length of time plans must be <Col N="1959" /> on display to the public.  Under certain conditions, for example, where there is flooding, the notice need only be exhibited in public for 14 days.  I am glad that if compulsory acquisition must be resorted to it is possible under this Bill and people who want to hold up a good scheme for a frivolous reason will know they are on a loser from the beginning.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the former Minister, Deputy Jim Higgins, who did Trojan work in his couple of months in the Department.  We have now listed eight or nine places entitled to go to the design stage and the money has been provided.  These are schemes that will cost between £150,000 and £250,000 &mdash; small but extremely valuable projects that can be carried out locally.  I hope these eight or nine will be the forerunners of many such small groups.  I see no reason the Leader groups and others who work for the betterment of rural Ireland should not provide funding to help those projects.  Any scheme to help rural Ireland should be called into play when people are cut off from schools, hospitals, churches and shops, when their lifestyle is so curtailed that they become almost hermits.  I hope the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Office of Public Works and the county councils will see this as a joint effort and act accordingly.</P>
    <P>I am glad the situation in Gort is being addressed.  I recently attended a meeting of the IFA committee on drainage and it is clear that much work remains to be done.  The Gort area has set a headline for the rest of the country. Many of the views expressed in this Bill were implemented by Deputy McCormack and his committee.  This worked in Gort, and it will also work everywhere else.</P>
    <P>The people in the Williamstown and Curragh West area of Dunmore and Belclare have enormous problems.  We had occasion to visit the site in Williamstown, Dunmore at the height of the flooding to see a family marooned in the middle of a lake.  Raising roads is not the answer to the problem.  Where <Col N="1960" /> it is possible to pump the water out, we should do so.</P>
    <P>I am as true an environmentalist as exists in this House.  As a farmer I believe it is important to protect the environment and I have great respect for many of the sincere groups involved in environmental protection.  However, some have surpassed limits altogether and their activities bear no relationship to the hardships people must suffer. Some of the environmentalists who have spoken about arterial drainage should be put into the four houses in Gort where the level of water has reached the top windows, and I would like to see what kind of report they would write about the prospects of living in those houses in the future when the surplus water has been drained.</P>
    <P>I do not want to drain land that has been flooded for years.  I want to drain off the excess water so that people can live and go about their normal duties. Many of the turloughs, lakes, etc. are part of the environment and we want to retain them.  I have not met a farmer who wanted to drain a lake that was there since the day he was born, but he certainly does not want to see it extending in and around his house.  I commend the Bill to the House and sincerely hope this is the beginning of a new era of helping people to help themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, congratulate the Minister, Deputy Coveney, on introducing this Bill.  I congratulate him on his appointment and on his continuous generosity towards his predecessors, including Deputy Jim Higgins and other Ministers who were previously involved.</P>
      <P>In the past 50 years £640 million has been spent on arterial drainage.  Now, some 50 years later, that we are allowing partial drainage of catchments is a sign that we realise such expenditure in small areas cannot continue.</P>
      <P>The Erne catchment is a truly cross-Border problem which has been with us for generations.  I realise that under the EU regulations we cannot or should not consider arterial drainage as we know it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1961" /> However, it is obvious that the silt and the bushes and trees need to be cleared out of the channels of the tributaries of that river to avoid flooding of private houses, the destruction of roadways and to allow tourists to use the rivers for boating and fishing.</P>
    <P>In counties Monaghan and Cavan we have the Bunowen and Finn rivers which need to be cleaned up, and I hope this Bill will allow that to be done.  The peace initiative provides an opportunity to use some of the Border funds in that regard.  If this were done it would allow fishermen to use the banks and tourists and others interested in boating to navigate the rivers.  It would link all the tributaries to the main Erne, with the Ballyconnell Canal and, in turn, with the River Shannon.</P>
    <P>Many studies were carried out and vast amounts of money were spent.  We heard Deputy Brennan speak of cost analysis, etc.  There is no need to waste more money carrying out surveys of the Erne catchment area.  This Bill will enable the works to be carried out and will improve the area around Clones, Ballybay and Cootehill.  As there is drumlin soil in the area farmers use low lying areas, which are subject to flooding, for hay and silage.  While we do not wish to see lakes and bogs reclaimed farmers must be able to use low lying land without the fear of flooding.</P>
    <P>I know one house which until two years ago had not been flooded.  They raised the foundations by three feet to ensure they would not be flooded out in future.  Normal maintenance work on rivers and tributaries was not carried out.</P>
    <P>The arterial drainage of the River Blackwater was an excellent job.  Unfortunately too much money was spent on it and no work could be carried out on its many tributaries.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in complimenting the Minister, Deputy Conveney, for introducing the Bill and the Office of Public Works for all the work they have <Col N="1962" /> done both in the drainage and heritage areas.  It is an excellent body and I am never slow to praise it.</P>
      <P>I compliment the former Minister, Deputy Higgins, and other Ministers who held that office, in particular, Deputies Treacy, Dempsey, former Deputy Brady and Senator Daly.  He introduced a Bill into the Seanad and many of the points he made were taken on board by the Government.</P>
      <P>We must cut the red tape as far as drainage is concerned.  In section 4 of the Bill the Commissioners must have regard to the effect of localised drainage works throughout the catchment.  Local authorities must give their observations on the work to be carried out.  There is power under section 6 to agree with third parties to share the costs of a scheme.  The Minister should clarify the position as my original information was that the problem would be dealt with at local level.  However, it now appears that every scheme must be submitted to the Office of Public Works and the local authorities must be notified.  Other third parties may have to be contacted regarding costs.</P>
      <P>I welcome section 13 which requires a local authority to make available for public inspection the annual reports of the maintenance of drainage works for which they are responsible.  Local authorities have done tremendous work in this area over the years but funding had been a problem.</P>
      <P>We are talking about land drainage and that is preferable to raising the level of roads in areas where flooding occurs. In my parish there was an estimate of £35,000 for the repair of a certain stretch of road.  An excellent job was done on it.  It would have cost £40,000 to raise the level of part of the road.  When flooding recedes we quickly forget there was a problem.</P>
      <P>I visited Curragh Lough between Dunmore and Williamstown, with a number of my colleagues.  I received a letter from a resident of Curragh West in which she stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1963" /> My parents have not been able to attend the post office to collect their pensions.  My mother had to cancel an outpatient appointment at University College Hospital, Galway, because she was unable to make the hazardous journey across waterlogged fields and boundary fencing.  Both my parents have been unable to attend their doctor to collect medication which is vital to their health and well-being.  I am sure I need not preach to you about the effect this hardship is having upon their lives as normal, independent, old age citizens or, indeed, on mine as their carer.</P>
    <P>That is one of many letters I and my colleagues received and it spells out the difficult circumstances in which people found themselves in the early months of 1995.  I hope we do not forget that.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  Swallow holes will be identified and drained at local level. I was shocked to see how quickly rain could fall.  In one section of the road near Caltra the road flooded very quickly and caused problems for people, including one woman with four young children who were trapped in a car.</P>
    <P>Serious damage was caused to roads in County Galway.  The road grant was cut in 1995 by £600,000. Funding must be provided to repair the roads which were damaged.  The Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, is not responsible for local authority funding but he must raise this matter, which is clearly related to the drainage of land, with his colleagues.</P>
    <P>The South Galway Flood Victims Action Group in a submission to the Minister raised a number of very important points which should be addressed.  It referred to the need for these people to be given advice by loss assessors, solicitors, engineers and other professionals before they submit a claim for compensation.  I would like to know the status of this submission to the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Higgins, on 27 March.  I presume the Minister of State, <Col N="1964" /> Deputy Coveney, and the Government are dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>There are many groups involved, for example, householders who were insured, those who were not insured and people living in isolated areas whose homes were completely surrounded by water.</P>
    <P>Farmers who lost stock and income and had to leave their homes will also require professional advice.  The Air Corps and Galway County Council provided great assistance to the farming community in particular.  There is a need to clarify the position of householders, farmers and business people in those areas.  Many business people in the Gort area suffered losses as a result of damage to their stock and structural damage to their premises.  While the Government moved quickly to introduce this legislation following the publication of Senator Daly's Bill, I am not happy that there has been an adequate response to the proposal submitted by the South Galway Flood Victims Action Group.  I hope the Minister will address this point in his reply.</P>
    <P>Assistance must also be provided for people living in the Curragh West area between Williamstown and Dunmore, Belclare, the Lake View area of Moylough and Fohena.  The Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, visited some of those areas and we are awaiting his response.  The GSO has carried out a survey of the lake in Glenamaddy. Every year the road from Glenamaddy to Creggs is flooded, particularly at Christmas time, and on one occasion one could not even gain access to the local cemetery.  The Office of Public Works responded very quickly once it got the go ahead to proceed with the work.  However, I cannot understand why this work cannot proceed at local level when the Office of Public Works is cluttered with applications.  If public representatives ring the local office to inquire about the possibility of a bridge being built they are told that it can provide help and advice but the farmers must build the bridge.  If they ask about having a river deepened they are told <Col N="1965" /> that the scheme was completed years ago and it can only carry out routine maintenance.  The Corrib catchment has been of great benefit to County Galway but other rivers such as the Dunkeelin are causing serious flooding.  The roads in that area have been badly affected by this flooding and I hope that this matter will be dealt with as soon as possible after the enactment of the legislation.</P>
    <P>The recent flooding has alerted us to the problems caused by litter and dumping. If a road is flooded the local authority must first try to drain the water into the adjoining land and fields. However, it cannot do this if it is hampered by dumping.  I hope the Minister will reply to the question I have raised. The Office of Public Works is underfunded and I welcome the additional £1 million-£2 million being provided this year.  I presume extra staff will also be appointed.  I hope some of the bureaucracy will be done away with so that there will be action in those areas which have suffered from severe flooding in recent years.</P>

      <P>I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, on introducing this Bill, which is now being followed through by the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney.  It is interesting to note that this is only the second occasion on which we have dealt with arterial drainage.  Obviously, there have been dramatic changes since the 1945 Act was passed.  Excellent work was done by the Office of Public Works in the past.  It did tremendous work on the Maigue and Dee drainage schemes which benefited entire catchment areas. We had a specific difficulty with localised flooding and this Bill responds to that problem.</P>
      <P>The excessive rainfall, resulting in the recent flooding throughout the country, highlighted the necessity for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1966" /> Several speakers have referred to the flooding in Galway.  The people were touched by the scenes shown on televison and by the tragedies experienced by the people of Galway.  The problem was not confined to Galway although the focus was specifically on the Galway problems.</P>
    <P>We had problems in Limerick.  In Foynes there were acute problems.  Several of the residents were flooded on three separate occasions recently.  We are trying to respond to that problem by certain remedial works carried out by the county council.  The Maigue drainage scheme resulted in speeding up the flow of water which alleviates the problem.</P>
    <P>Because debris gathers under the bridge problems arise in Croom.  On several occasions the river overflowed, flooding six or seven houses.  This happened again recently.  I have raised the matter with the Minister of State and I hope the Office of Public Works will respond to the specific and localised difficulty there.  I understand the problem could be rectified by extending and raising an existing wall and would not involve the expenditure of large sums of money.  That would give much relief to the residents of Croom, who live near the bridge, on the busy road between Limerick and Cork.  I hope, following discussions I had with the Minister of State this work will be tackled as a priority in the near future by the Office of Public Works in Limerick.</P>
    <P>Where drainage works were carried out in a wide catchment area, there is a difficulty regarding smaller tributaries.  I could give specific examples which resulted from the success of previous schemes in my county.  Tributaries often create flooding difficulties for the residents in the area but as they were not included in the original catchment area the Office of Public Works is precluded from attending to them.  Frequently residents are trapped as the county council will not countenance doing work on such tributaries which they regard as an Office of Public Works problem.  I hope <Col N="1967" /> this Bill will provide for those types of difficulties.</P>
    <P>With regard to smaller schemes I hope a financial arrangement can be entered into between the Office of Public Works or the Government with county councils to enable those works to be carried out.  I am anxious to draw attention to specific examples I highlighted in the past, where people have encountered problems.</P>
    <P>In welcoming the Bill and in reflecting on works which have been done I wonder whether cognisance was given to fisheries and wildlife.  In recent years there has been an acute consciousness of those aspects of being environmentally friendly.  When the Office of Public Works respond to the problems of specific waterways it will have to be conscious of the environmental aspects.</P>
    <P>Members of local authorities are conscious of the problems caused to our road structure by flooding.  On this Bill I do not intend to elaborate on the condition of the county roads.  Certainly, we have a problem in regard to the flooding of those roads.  No specific funding is allocated to county councils for flooding type problems which occur occasionally. The Department of the Environment is not sensitive when a case for extra money is presented to rectify occasional flooding difficulties, many of which are caused by attendant drainage difficulties.</P>
    <P>I welcome the REPS scheme with its emphasis on minimising the use of fertilisers. The excessive use of fertiliser leads to leaching of nitrates into water-courses, the growth of weeds and siltation causing flooding.  I was interested to hear the previous speaker refer to the plastic sacks and other debris dumped into rivers.  It is unfortunate that people will resort to this.  I would have thought people would be conscious of the important role rivers play in tourism and every aspect of Irish life and would not resort to such dumping.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact, mentioned by a previous speaker, that the Bill is getting rid of layers of bureaucracy.  An <Col N="1968" /> interesting aspect of it is that if works are to be done by the Office of Public Works the county council will be required to display notice of these works for about a month and 14 days afterwards the works can commence.  In the past one could have to wait a considerable period before responding to a problem which might require urgent remedial action.  There are many laudable aspects of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I note the Opposition continued to ask when this Bill would be introduced. It is worth reflecting that it is over 50 years since the original Bill was enacted. While the previous Government had prepared the heads of the Bill it had seven years to respond to this problem which did not become acute overnight. It has existed for many years.</P>
    <P>I hope this Bill, when enacted, will respond to the needs and desires of most public representatives in the House and will respond to the problems and difficulties many people experience with flooding problems.  In any dealings I had with the Office of Public Works I have found it to be very responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, every success in his new portfolio.  He did a tremendous job as Minister for Defence and the Marine.  He is a person for whom I have great admiration.  I have no doubt he will soon be back to full Cabinet rank.</P>
      <P>What we are doing here is dismantling the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945. This Act made possible the drainage of some of the major river catchment areas throughout the country.  As we are about to do this it is only right to acknowledge the beneficial work done by the Office of Public Works under that Act.  Many a green acre is now carrying cattle instead of snipe because of the work done under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My first experience of the workings of this Act was a pleasant one as the dredging machines and the men in their wellingtons slowly worked their way up the Moy river from Ballina, through <Col N="1969" /> County Mayo, County Sligo, my neighbouring townlands, my own townland of Coolrecull in south Sligo to the streams that flowed through my father's land. The benefits can still be seen.  Unfortunately, the mounds of sand and rubble dredged from the river bed and left to deface the banks also remain.  That was the practice of the Office of Public Works at the time although I admit this changed in later years.</P>
    <P>My next experience of the workings of the Arterial Drainage Act was as a politician and not so pleasant.  When I was first elected to this House in 1981 my predecessor, Eugene Gilhawley, a distinguished Dáil Deputy for Sligo for many years who had just retired, handed me an extraordinary large file with the admonition: &ldquo;Try to do something about it.  I have been trying for all my public life and the job has still not been done&rdquo;.  The file related to the drainage of the Owenmore and Arrow.</P>
    <P>This was first raised in the House in 1927 and has been raised on a regular basis ever since by every Deputy who has had the honour to represent Sligo.  I have raised it on the Adjournment, by way of motion, question and interjection and in the budget debates even though I was not always in order in doing so.  The file handed to me by Eugene Gilhawley has grown alarmingly since.  Sadly, flooding continues to occur on the Owenmore and Arrow.</P>
    <P>This catchment area was placed in the queue in the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act.  Farmers whose land was flooded on a regular basis, not just in the winter but also in summer, waited and finally the Owenmore and Arrow reached the top of the queue.  What happened then? The arterial drainage scheme for entire catchment areas was abandoned by the previous Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Did that not occur in 1986?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill lifts the obligation on the Office of Public Works to devise schemes for entire catchment areas and enables smaller schemes to be <Col N="1970" /> introduced.  Strange as it may seem, I welcome the Bill for the simple reason that the worst flooding on the Owenmore and Arrow will be relieved.  This will enable the Office of Public Works to remove the blockages which are easily identifiable.</P>
      <P>During the past few months we have seen on television the damage caused by flood waters throughout the country. Sligo did not feature prominently on this occasion but the floods there were just as bad and as damaging as the floods in Carlow, Galway and along the Shannon.  We had our quota of swamped houses.  The reason Sligo did not feature was that, unfortunately, this was not news in Sligo.  Flooding occurs in the Owenmore and Arrow catchment area in the middle of summer each year, not just in exceptionally bad years.  A total of 29,000 acres of land and 3,000 farmers are affected, mostly small farmers with an average farm size of 42 acres.  To put the matter in context, the floods affect one-fifteenth of the entire land area of County Sligo and the losses each year are substantial.  On average the floods last 21 days.</P>
      <P>The Owenmore and Arrow drainage committee has been seeking action since 1942.  Despite the fact that we have failed to have the promised arterial drainage works carried out, I welcome the Bill which will enable the Office of Public Works to introduce localised flood relief measures rather than schemes for entire catchment areas. This limited activity could be of enormous benefit in freeing the flow of water and preventing the annual flooding on the Owenmore and Arrow.  This summer the land of farmers, including Paddy Joe Hannon, along the banks of those rivers and far removed from these areas will be flooded and their silage damaged.  This is inevitable and it happens each summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once this Bill has been passed and signed by the President, before the ink is dry, I give the Minister of State notice that I will be on his doorstep asking that the Owenmore and Arrow be given priority because of the severity of the <Col N="1971" /> flooding and because of the fact that this catchment area was next in line under the old Act.  This should also be done as a matter of convenience and economy given that the Office of Public Works is now completing works in the nearby Boyle catchment area and has fully equipped headquarters in Ballaghaderreen. The next logical step would be to move the dredgers into the Owenmore and Arrow catchment area.  All the survey and engineering work has been done and the main blockages have been identified.  The funding required to remove the first blockage would not be excessive.  I look forward to an allocation being made available for the Owenmore and Arrow catchment area at an early date for the reasons I have stated.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the work done in the Office of Public Works by the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Higgins, by Deputies Hogan, Dempsey and Treacy and many others before them.  Much work on the Bill was done before this Government entered office.  In a previous debate I gave a promise that the Minister of State who provided for the drainage of the Owenmore and Arrow would have this statue erected above high water level near Temple House Bridge.  I repeat that promise now to the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming the Bill I take the opportunity to thank the Minister of State for acknowledging the work I did when Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works.  I am delighted that it has been brought forward.  There is a great desire on all sides of the House that the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 should be amended to tackle the problems outlined by Deputies.  When I was Minister of State Deputies Nealon and Brennan ensured that the problem to which Deputy Nealon referred was raised at least once a week.</P>
      <P>This is a serious issue which affects practically every part of the country.  I am glad it is addressed in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 11, 17, 26, 29, 30, 50, 58 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>Last month, my Department sought proposals by way of public advertisement from suitably qualified consultants or other organisations for the carrying out of a major professional study on local government funding.  The proposals received are now being examined by my Department and, following interviews this week, I expect to be able to make an early announcement as to the firm or organisation to which the commission will be given.</P>
      <P>An outline of the proposed study, which is to be carried out in two stages, is contained in a Request for Proposals, copies of which are in the Oireachtas Library.  This document outlines issues to be considered in the first stage of the study which should be completed towards the end of this year.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to indicate the cost of the first stage until an appointment is made and terms are agreed.  Because the work to be undertaken in the second stage will be dependent on the results of the first stage, the overall cost cannot be fully determined at this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The existing system of local authority funding is based on a range of Exchequer grants, combined with a variety of local income sources; including <Col N="1974" /> service charges.  No basic change is envisaged in this system pending the outcome of the professional study.</P>
    <P>The law allows all local authorities to decide, at their absolute discretion whether to levy charges for services provided by them and the level of such charges.  This year's Finance Bill includes provision to implement the commitment in the policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> to introduce a special tax allowance for those who can show they have paid their service charges on time.  In addition, it is my intention shortly to introduce legislation to delimit the power of local authorities to disconnect domestic water supplies where service charges are unpaid.  Service charges will, of course, be further considered as part of the professional study on local authority funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister believe it was necessary to undertake what will probably be another costly survey of the options for local government financing?  I think the Minister will agree the options are limited and obvious.  It is a matter of having the political will to introduce one system or other and grasp the nettle.  Why delay further in studying the various options when we all know they are basically grants of a specific or block nature, property tax, commercial rates, income tax, poll tax, land tax and charges for services and goods?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is there need for another study that will last until the end of this year, putting the matter on the long finger again?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a range of options available.  I am anxious that, for the first time probably since the abolition of rates, local authority funding will be addressed in a realistic way.  That is one of my two priorities in the Department.  I am not trying to reinvent <Col N="1975" /> the wheel.  In the special study I am commissioning I have asked that all existing data be compiled in a comprehensive way and that best practice internationally be considered so that realistic proposals can be made which at the end of the day will be the subject of discussions, particularly with local authority members.  I want to build, in so far as possible, a consensus on the way forward for local authority funding.  If we address this issue in a forthright way in the next two years we can have an effective and meaningful tier of local government. It is my fear that if we do not do so in the immediate future local government will continue to limp along ineffectively and we will still have a very centralised administration system.  I am determined to make as much advance in as tight a timeframe as possible, consistent with making the right decision at the end of the day and building the broadest possible consensus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for his verbal commitment to address the problem and achieve the maximum consensus on it.  The Government has embarked on what can only be described as a disastrous policy in terms of the sole means of financing of local authorities, namely, service charges. The Minister intends to introduce legislation forbidding councils from asking people to discharge a properly constituted and legal debt by removing the one means they have of doing so.  In keeping with the Minister's commitment on local authority financing, will he consult with councillors before introducing the Bill?  Otherwise, it will be a disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Service charges are not the main source of funding for local authorities &mdash; some have no service charges &mdash; but it is at their absolute discretion whether such charges exist and the level of their existance.  Rate support grants remain an essential part of funding and a number of other grants-in-aid given by my Department <Col N="1976" /> to local authorities are also significant. For instance, in local authority social housing the provision has increased to 18 per cent this year, on road improvements and maintenance the provision has been increased to 5 per cent, on library services there has been an increase of 128 per cent this year over last year, on fire service grants there has been an increase of 13 per cent and on swimming pools there has been an increase of 54 per cent.  That indicates that in terms of existing structures I am committed to maintain local authorities. I accept that we need to look afresh at the whole funding mechanism for local authorities and that is why I am embarking on this process which, at the end of the day, will result in a White Paper and a debate on the issues.</P>
      <P>On the comment about the Bill which I propose to introduce, it is right and fair that people should not be deprived of an essential service such as water unless a very strict regime is followed, and I am setting out such a regime.  It will be open to local authorities to apply to the courts to have a supply cut off in cases where people are clearly in a position to pay but refuse to do so.  In all other cases, it would be improper for a local authority to cut off precipitously such an important supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Not many councillors, even of the Minister's party, will agree there has been a 5 per cent increase in road maintenance grants; the reality is much different.  Will the Minister consider introducing measures to improve the financial position of local authorities, to speed up payments from central Government to local authorities where they are due, to speed up payment from the National Roads Authority, ask the Department of Social Welfare to make up the amounts granted in waivers to local authorities, because that is its responsibility rather than that of local authorities, and to pay councils for agency services?  Will he consider these issues in the interim because most councils are in serious financial difficulty?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is merit in some of the points made by the Deputy.  When Minister for Health I was most anxious that we enforce a measure whereby debts due by one State agency to another would be met.  Part of the refunding package I put in place for health agencies and health boards made it a requirement, by regulation, that all invoiced accounts would be met within 30 days.  It is part of Government policy to ensure that is done throughout the public service.  I will do everything within my power to facilitate early payment of all moneys due by one agency to another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 9, 81 and 96 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is firmly committed to reversing trends towards poorer water quality in some of our important rivers and lakes.  The policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, undertook to tackle all sources of pollution of these important natural resources.</P>
      <P>Pending the publication of the Environmental Protection Agency Report for the period 1991 to 1994 this autumn, the latest national overview of water quality in Ireland is &ldquo;Water Quality in Ireland, 1987-1990&rdquo;, published by the Environmental Research Unit in 1992.  This report reviews data generated mainly by local authorities and the ERU and, <i>inter alia,</i> gives details of the extent of the pollution of surface waters and the trends, both long term and more recent.  A copy of this report is available in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      <P>The ERU report shows that the bulk of Irish inland waters remain unpolluted and suitable for the most sensitive uses such as game fishing, bathing and drinking. Serious pollution from industrial and other sources has decreased significantly over the past 20 years and now affects only 1 per cent of waters surveyed. Moderate pollution &mdash; mainly from eutrophication &mdash; has however increased and affects nearly 10 per cent of river channel.</P>
      <P>Control of water pollution is primarily a matter for the local authorities, using the comprehensive pollution control regime provided for in the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1977 and 1990.  My Department provides considerable investment funds to local authorities, with EU support, to deal with polluting inputs from urban waste water discharges.  The Operational Programme on Environmental Services 1994-99 envisages expenditure of the order of £600 million during that period on water and sewerage schemes, the bulk of which will be spent on sewage treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decline in water quality has occured over a long period of time and it will take some time to reverse the <Col N="1979" /> deterioration.  In addition to the measures already in place, I will be promoting an innovative approach to water quality management of selected lake catchments.  This will focus on the important environmental and economic resources represented by these lakes and on the sustainable management of these resources.  I intend to promote this approach by pilot projects at regional level.</P>
    <P>I should mention as a positive development that the number of fish kills recorded fell to 31 in 1994 &mdash; the lowest since detailed records were compiled in 1983.  I will appeal again to all involved in agriculture and the food industry to intensify their efforts and precautions so that fish kills and other accidental pollution of our rivers are minimised during the coming vulnerable summer months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister says that water quality has improved, Trevor Champ of the Central Fisheries Board says there has been a general deterioration in water quality and fish stocks, especially in the midlands, and that board is concerned about how matters are developing.  As agriculture is the largest polluter of our rivers, local authorities are next and industry a long way down the list &mdash; even though that is not the general perception &mdash; will the Minister agree that the decision of his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, to get rid of the CFP scheme is contrary to what the Minister is trying to achieve? Will he agree that the Minister, Deputy Yates, is taking a different direction from that being taken by the Minister's Department?</P>

      <P>Regarding the specific point of water quality, I am determined to ensure we have the tightest possible regime of water management and water quality.  We do not need to overstate the case.  I have given the latest empirical data available and I am not complacent simply because 1 per cent is a low figure in comparison with any other European figure.  We can and must do better, but we should not overstate the case.  The Environmental Protection Agency report is due to be published later this year, but the most recent data available on 13,000 kilometers of river channel surveyed reveals that 77.5 per cent is unpolluted, 12 per cent is slightly polluted, 9.5 per cent moderately polluted and 1 per cent seriously polluted.  If required, I will give the Deputy a breakdown of the sources of each of those forms of pollution.  We have a significant investment programme in our local authorities for dealing with sewage treatment to ensure that best efforts are made to reach the high European standards as quickly as possible.</P>

I would be greateful if he would supply a breakdown of the statistics he quoted.  Recent tests carried out and reported in a newspaper indicate that pollution of rivers is 110 times above the accepted guidelines in <Col N="1981" /> Kilkenny, 85 times in Tipperary and 65 times in County Meath.  I accept that the figures the Minister quoted read well, but in certain areas this is a serious problem.  A good deal of the pollution emanates from agriculture and the Government is approaching the problem from two different directions.</P>

      <P>I will be happy to answer those specific questions when we come to deal with them.  I was alarmed by the report to which the Deputy referred because it is not good data.  The research was carried out on small areas. I gave an interview to the journalist concerned. He referred to the pollution emanating from five or six houses in my constituency and extrapolated that was the norm for a county.  Even under the waste water directives we will not be required to provide tertiary treatment for every household.  It is a gross error to promote that type of treatment as gospel.  We have a very high standard of water management and water quality, the envy of many of our European colleagues. I know my predecessors in the Deputy's party will attest to that.  We are not complacent.  We need to do better. Our investment programme of £1.2 billion between now and the year 2005 will ensure that the best possible precautionary principles are used to minimise any other pollution.  However, we are depending on goodwill and vigilance on the part of every user of the natural environment, particularly farmers, to ensure that accidents such as the one yesterday to which the Deputy referred, a cause of deep concern to all of us, do not recur during the summer months.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to Question No. 54 on 8 March 1995, my Department is developing guidelines for environmental management throughout the public sector.  This process will include formulating plans which incorporate waste minimisation, green procurement and recycling, as well as energy conservation measures; the latter are already being promoted by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and the Irish Energy Centre.</P>
      <P>Section 30 of the Waste Bill, 1995 requires the Minister for the Environment to promulgate a programme with regard to the prevention, minimisation and recovery of waste arising from the performance by public authorities of their functions.  I intend to promulgate this statutorily-based programme as soon as possible after the enactment of the Bill.</P>

      <P>In the introduction to the recently published Waste Bill we are told that the essential purpose of that Bill is to prevent and reduce waste production. I refer to solid waste.

It is the policy of my Department, and that of my colleagues in Government, to be as generous as possible with information. Perhaps we could establish an E-mailing system and communicate electronically with the Deputy in the future, but I am sure most Members would prefer to be fully briefed on all Government decisions and policy matters. It is our ambition in the Department of the Environment to ensure that all such information is printed on recycled paper.

      <P>If the Minister and his Department do not introduce a code of practice for all Government Departments on this issue, they are in a poor position to demand that others such as householders, retailers, wholesalers and industry, cut back on their waste.  Does the Minister accept that not all of the circulars and documents we receive every day are essential?  Many are duplications of documents we already have.</P>

It is important that Deputies are kept informed in that way.</P>
      <P>If paper is produced from farmed trees and recycled after use, it does not cause any major difficulties.  We should not lose sight of the fact that communications are normal and important and in striking a balance I hope we do not run counter to the green strategy the Government is promoting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 22, 31, 39, 53, 69 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>The National Development Plan 1994-99 sets out guidelines on the tolling of national roads similar to those adopted by successive Governments since 1985.  The guidelines provide that and funding obtained from tolls would be regarded as additional to the planned State investment and used to accelerate the development of the national road network; there would be public competition for each private toll franchise and for the construction of each toll road; all toll roads would be designed, constructed, maintained and operated to agreed standards normally applicable to national roads; all toll roads would be public roads in the ownership of local authorities and subject to normal traffic management and other legislative controls; any private toll franchise would be limited to an agreed period of years and would revert to the National Roads Authority at the end of that period; and private investment should generally meet at least 20 per cent of the capital cost of the toll road, with the exact level being determined by negotiations in each case.</P>
      <P>While the plan anticipated that up to £100 million might be raised through tolling of national roads, it left it to the National Roads Authority to conduct a review of the actual scope for tolling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll by-laws, and to enter into toll agreements with private investors is vested in the National Roads Authority under Part V of the Roads Act, 1993.  Local authorities have similar powers in relation to the tolling of non-national roads.  The initiatives as to which roads, if any, should be subject to tolls rests with the NRA or the local authority, as appropriate. My only functions relate to the approval or otherwise of toll schemes, <Col N="1986" /> by-laws and agreements made by the NRA or local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify if the National Roads Authority has the power to put tolls on existing roads on which large amounts of Irish and European taxpayers' money has already been expended?  Has the Minister handed over to the National Roads Authority the power to impose such a tax on people who have already contributed by way of PAYE and motor tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not hand over such power to anybody, but in 1993 the Oireachtas legislated, under the National Roads Authority Act, to give to the National Road Authority the power to make proposals regarding a tolling scheme, the acceptance or rejection of which would ultimately fall to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Minister's position on the levying of tolls?  I am concerned in particular with the downstream crossing of the Lee in Cork about which Cork Corporation made a submission to the National Roads Authority. While legislation was enacted under a Minister from my party, greater local authority input is necessary in final decision-making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the view of my predecessor, Deputy Smith, that where possible funding should be generated from tolling to augment and accelerate the extensive investment from the State and the European Union in our national roads system.  If major roadworks can be advanced through such a system, the matter should be considered.</P>
      <P>It has always been envisaged that the down-stream crossing of the Lee would be subject to a toll and I understand in due course such proposals will be advanced.  I was very impressed by the National Roads Network in Cork and I understand from the National Roads Authority that one-quarter of total expenditure on national roads this year will be expended in Cork.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed the Minister does not have plans in this regard.  I had hoped she would announce a new house improvement grants scheme.  The scheme introduced some years ago may have been too generous because a large outstanding bill remained when it was cancelled.  Many pre-war houses throughout the country are in need of substantial improvement and their owners must be encouraged and assisted in doing that.  We have all heard stories about people making improvements to their holiday homes, for example, but we could establish a scheme geared towards the refurbishment of houses that are used as main residences.  Is there any hope that such a scheme will be established next year?  With regard to making the best possible use of existing private houses, in my constituency approximately 5,000 houses were added to the housing stock in 1990.  Housing density is continually decreasing.  Many roads service only 50 houses and the majority are three and four bedroomed houses in which only <Col N="1988" /> one person lives.  Will the Minister agree it is in all our interests to make maximum use of the housing stock?</P>

      <P>In regard to the home improvement grant, I am surprised at the Deputy because I made it clear on a number of occasions that the Government does not have any intention to introduce such a scheme.  As the Deputy is aware, the previous scheme was immensely costly both in terms of funding and in relation to its effectiveness, and it was abolished under a Fianna Fáil Government.  That scheme was not appropriately targeted to obtain the necessary result, which is generally recognised.  We are keeping the matter under review but there are not plans to reintroduce a similar scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1989" /> We would all like to see more effective use of the private housing stock but it is for the owners of houses to determine what they will do.  There should be no element of corecion in regard to people who may want to remain in their homes.  The question of stamp duty is not within my area of responsibility; the Deputy will have to table a question to another Minister in that regard.  We must recognise that the State does not have any control over the private housing sector when it comes to individuals deciding how they wish to occupy their houses and to what capacity.</P>

In some of the towns and villages along the western seaboard, local authorities are building new houses while older houses are becoming derelict because of the deaths of their owners, families moving, etc.  The houses being built by the local authorities on the outskirts of these towns are inferior.  Will the Minister give consideration to a proposal allowing local authorities to buy and refurbish older houses?

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I tabled this question because residents living in the vicinity of two Cork hospitals, the University Hospital and St. Finbarr's, were required to mount a vociferous campaign to force the closure of the two incinerators servicing these hospitals which were below acceptable environmental standards and injurious to personal and public health. The local authority and the health board did not make any meaningful response to this demand until they were dragged screaming to the table of accountability in the face of public campaigns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A body such as the Environmental Protection Agency should be responsible for the transport and disposal of all hospital waste.  What is the Minister's opinion on incineration in urban areas <Col N="1992" /> as the method of disposal of hospital waste?  Low level radioactive materials are transported from one hospital to another through the city of Cork and are buried in the grounds of St. Finbarr's Hospital.  I have raised this with the registry and the various bodies as it is totally unacceptable that this should happen.  Even though we are told it is non-threatening low grade radiation, the reality is that low grade radioactive materials are being transported through the city.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I took a direct interest in this matter when I was Minister for Health. During my time I initiated a health service waste policy.  The Minister has proposed a health care waste management strategy which envisages four waste treatment centres and suggests employing new technologies involving non-incineration methods for the disposal of such waste.  Use of the best technologies would involve shredding and disinfecting by microwave, something I pushed in Cork when I was Minsiter for Health.  The implementation of this plan for four waste treatment centres would phase out incineration right across the country.  In this context low grade nuclear contaminated waste is clothing worn at X rays and very low grade contaminated products and I do not think we should be alarmist about it.  I do not foresee State aid being made available for a toxic waste incinerator and, as far as I am concerned, that is off the agenda.  I will require best technologies to be used by the generators of such waste to dispose of waste on site. A residual amount, currently about one-third of total hazardous waste, is exported and that will remain an option.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept it is not in the best interest of the public that radioactive material, no matter how non-threatening, should be dumped in a highly residential urban area and transported through areas of large populations? Ideally the dumps for such material should be located in remote <Col N="1993" /> areas where children would not be playing near it.</P>

      <P>I am loath to comment on a particular issue of which I have no notice.  However, I will ask my office to make contact with the Department of Health to voice the concerns of the Deputy.  In general policy terms I want the highest environmental standards applied to every landfill site.  The waste Bill I published in the past couple of weeks will give legislative effect to that imperative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's response but it is very costly to put various waste management strategies in place.  In this year alone it will cost the Southern Health Board £600,000 to microwave the waste from the regional hospital.  If you apply that across the country the total cost is in the region of £10 million.  Obviously the Minister envisaged that this development would involve an extra cost but has he put funding in place to alleviate the cashflow difficulties that will ensue from such a policy?  There are two different types of waste, general hospital waste and what is loosely termed toxic waste. In Cork the toxic waste falls within the guidelines but there is major public concern about this waste being transported through the city.  I think this requires the Minister's immediate attention and I ask him to ensure that an effort is made to find a more suitable location to dispose of this waste?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister's specific intention that incineration would not be permitted as a means of disposal of hospital waste when it comes to licensing in October of this year?  He mentioned that this would apply to hospitals with more than 200 acute beds but does he accept that smaller hospitals with fewer beds are very short of finance to upgrade waste management equipment and will continue to incinerate in a hazardous manner.  Does the Minister intend to introduce licensing for the smaller hospitals having put the licences for the larger hospitals in place?  Can he indicate how soon after October this might happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three elements to the strategy: (1) Under the existing legislative framework, the Environment Protection Act, the operable date for hospitals with more than 200 beds is October this year.  (2) In parallel with that I envisage that by October we will be well advanced in enacting the waste Bill and when it is enacted I will bring in regulations to require all waste to be licensed under the Environmental Protection Agency.  (3) Depending on which of the two legislative measures are in place at the time I will determine whether the Environmental Protection Act should be enforced to broaden the remit to include all hospitals or the new <Col N="1995" /> waste Bill will then be in place to deal effectively with that contingency.  In the meanwhile there is a Department of Health waste management strategy with the personal imprimatur of the Minister for Health.  I outlined that the strategy is to have designated management systems using the best available technology, excluding incineration.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's remarks.  There is a proposal to take all the hospital waste in the Leinster area and burn it in the middle of Ringsend.  Dublin Corporation refused permission for this proposal and it is now before An Bord Pleanála. Obviously a private company would not be putting all this money into the venture unless it had got assurances from various hospitals that it will process their waste.  Will the Department of the Environment and the Department of Health submit an appeal to An Bord Pleanála?  There is huge concern locally that all this waste will be burned within a ten mile radius of one million people and within a three mile radius of 300,000 people, which seems to fly in the face of the policies of the Ministers for the Environment and Health.</P>

      <P>If it is the Minister's policy that the waste should not be disposed of by incineration he should make that known to An Bord Pleanála because it would be influenced by such a policy decision.  The microwaving technique is now being used for waste treatment in hospitals, Is the Minister satisfied that it is safe and reduces risk to a minimum?</P>

      <P>Not only would it be improper but I am statutorily barred from making comments on an appeal to be decided by a statutory agency, An <Col N="1996" /> Bord Pleanála.  The general policy statement relates to the Department's policy on hospital waste.  There is no definitive bar on incineration as a method for dealing with general waste, and each of these will have to be discussed on their own merits when any proposal is finalised.  For the information of Deputies, incineration is a very commonly used method of waste management in some of the more environmentally sensitive countries.  In cities like Copenhagen or Vienna incineration is the main method of disposing of domestic waste.  I want best international practice and the highest environmental standards.  We will deal with proposals as they arise and drive the recycling strategy in tandem with the Waste Bill strategy.  I am precluded from making any other comment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 36, 61, 66, 67 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>The administration of the control of farm pollution scheme is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Assessment of the environmental implications of any changes in the scheme is also a matter, in the first instance, for that Minister.  My colleague has fully explained the reasons for the suspension of the scheme, the steps being taken to minimise the impact on REPS participants, and the arrangements made to cater for other cases having priority in environmental terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am of course concerned to ensure that appropriate support continues to be available for investment in farm pollution control.  My Department has <Col N="1998" /> accordingly participated in a consultative group which has made recommendations to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry on the future management of the scheme.  An announcement on this matter has recently been made by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has blamed him and his former Government colleagues for the situation in which he now finds himself? Does the Minister believe, as I do, that there is a conflict between his Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry?  Will the Minister accept now that farmers have at long last accepted that they particularly must play a role in the control of pollution and have done so in substantial measure, the response of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and of the collective Cabinet was to suspend the scheme?  Does the Minister further accept that the fish kill on seven miles of river is the result of inadequate protection and that there is now a further danger of similar kills with consequent damage to tourism and the economy?  What does the Department of the Environment propose to do to protect the environment?</P>

      <P>I am surprised at Deputy Byrne's disparagement of farmers.  It is not accurate to say they have &ldquo;at long last&rdquo; recognised their responsibilities. Farmers have been generally responsive <Col N="1999" /> to the aids that have been in place for some time.</P>
      <P>So far under REPS, over 30,000 farmers have been granted aid for pollution control works at a cost of £200 million. The control of farmyard pollution is the second biggest State programme of investment in environmental infrastructure, exceeded in size only by the water and sewage programme.  Already we have expended £200 million and many more millions of pounds will be expended as the programme advances. It is a signal of the goodwill and the environmental awareness of farmers that the volume of applications is now so great.  I hope it will be possible for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to move expeditiously and ensure, with sideways movement of resources within his Department &mdash; to use his words &mdash; that there are no recurrences of yesterday's very sad affair when a burst embankment caused a pollution spill into an important fish river resulting in large fish kills.  The summer season is beginning and I use the occasion to ask farmers in particular to be vigilant in regard to any possible source of pollution to ensure that our rivers remain pristine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I happen to be a farmer, as the Minister knows, and I agree that we were slow to accept our role in the control of pollution.  Now that we have come around to the proper way of thinking, the Government should respond to the demand for funds.  However, Government's response has been to suspend the control of farmyard pollution scheme and this, perhaps, was the cause of the recent fish kill.  I am concerned that there will be more such kills because of the decision to suspend the scheme.  It seems that the Minister, Deputy Yates, has failed miserably at the Cabinet table to obtain moneys that are available to every other Minister at the drop of a hat.  The Minister for Social Welfare obtained £210 million at one stroke of a pen.</P>

As to my own responsibilities, there are no implications for my Department in that change.  Local authorities continue to undertake their statutory pollution control functions as before.

Is the Minister aware of the many farmers who qualified under REPS but are hamstrung by the suspension of the pollution control scheme? Will he consider the damage to the mountainside caused by overgrazing as <Col N="2001" /> a result of the need for farmers to capitalise on headage payments to remain in business?  Could he argue at Cabinet for schemes such as the control of the farmyard pollution scheme which assist farmers to maintain a good quality environment?</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the environment should not be compartmentalised or confined to one Department. The Government is committed in its programme for Government to ensuring that responsibility for it is taken across the board.  The suspension of the scheme illustrates that it is not so.  Will the Minister use his position to argue the case for the reintroduction of this scheme and for its funding?  It is too important to leave to one Minister.  If the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is unable to secure the necessary funds, surely a group of Ministers could come together and make a case to secure them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The long standing policy of the Government dates back to a desision taken on 24 February 1978 which states that every Minister, including the Minister for the Environment, will be responsible in respect of his or her Department and any agency, public authority or semi-State body for which he is the appropriate Minister, for ensuring that the environmental effects and implications of policies, programmes and projects undertaken by his Department and such agencies shall be fully considered before decisions are taken and that such decisions shall take <Col N="2002" /> due account of the environmental considerations including national environmental policy.</P>
      <P>Every Minister is responsible for taking account of the environmental impact of any policy decision taken within his or her Department.  One of the key policy issues in the programme for Government is the national sustainable development strategy on which work is well under way.  It will involve links with all Departments but particularly five &mdash; Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Enterpise and Employment, Transport, Energy and Communications, Tourism and Trade and Environment.  Once the policy is supported and adopted by Government it will be driven by a Cabinet sub-committee of those Ministers. Environmental policy is a cornerstone of general Government policy and will be supported by my Cabinet colleagues.</P>

    <P>The general question of forestry and planning will fall to be considered in the context of the sustainable development strategy which I am preparing and, more specifically, in the development of a national land use policy plan which the policy agreement A Government of Renewal also proposes.  This will provide guidelines for both national policy decisions and planning authorities in relation to the location of agricultural, industrial, forestry, aquaculture and tourism developments.</P>
    <P>I am, however, satisfied that the thresholds for EIA and planning permission must be reduced substantially and the matter is the subject of discussions between my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  On completion of these discussions, I propose to make appropriate amendments in the existing regulations which govern the matter.</P>

      <P>The management, maintenance and improvement of its rented dwellings is the responsibility of the local authority.  Where an authority has identified problems calling for emergency attention, such as a fire hazard, remedial action should be taken without delay by the authority and funded from either its existing allocation under the remedial works scheme for designated estates or from its own resources.</P>
      <P>Over £30 million, including £3.8 million this year, has been allocated so far to Cork Corporation under the remedial works scheme for the refurbishment and improvement of its dwellings.  The funds provided for this scheme in the 1995 public capital programme have been allocated in full and while it is not possible to increase the allocation to Cork Corporation it should be possible for it to find the resources to enable it carry out the emergency measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with the reply.  I put down the question because recently there were a series of fires in the complex and there are no emergency exits.  The fire officer has virtually condemned the complex.  Will the Minister allocate £2.7 million out of the budget for social housing before lives are lost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very concerned about the fires which occurred in the flats.  I visited the area and saw the evidence. I am conscious of the need to undertake the work and I am glad the corporation has proposals for emergency measures.  These flats were built in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  It is within the remit of Cork Corporation either through its own resources or under the remedial works scheme to allocate funding to undertake the emergency measures needed.  I will not put obstacles in its way.  As the Deputy is aware, allocations for the housing programme and the remedial works scheme were made some time ago.  I expect Cork Corporation is in a position to <Col N="2005" /> ensure the emergency measures can be provided as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a member of Cork Corporation.  We have received a final warning.  This is a matter of life and death.  Families with children live upstairs in these flats.  Irrespective of who was responsible in the past we must address this problem immediately.  It is not feasible to suggest that the corporation is in a position to provide £2.7 million out of its own resources.  The financial plight of Cork Corporation is well known within the Department.  We have a shortfall of £2 million.  Application was made under the remedial works scheme for rebricking, providing sanitary and bathroom facilities in old housing and so on.  The only way open to the corporation to raise funding is by way of loan.  If Cork Corporation can raise £500,000 or £1 million, will the Minister match it with an emergency payment so that this problem can be dealt with immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully accept the Deputy's concern about this matter.  All of us agree that this is a very serious problem.  The resources already allocated to Cork Corporation are considerable &mdash; £3.8 million under the remedial works scheme and £7 million under the housing programme.  The immediate emergency measures outlined by Cork Corporation amount to £140,000, and I expect that funding of this could be accommodated.  I will be as flexible as possible in regard to any arrangements which can be made by the corporation to fund works which will ensure fire safety.  Cork Corporation has already shown a certain flair and imagination in its refurbishment programmes and it has used various sources for carrying out these works.  It is capable of ensuring that this work is carried out.  Having seen the problem at first hand, this work must be tackled and I believe the resources and capability are there to ensure that at least the emergency measures are carried out.  If this requires a rearrangement under the remedial <Col N="2006" /> works scheme and the corporation wishes to pursue this, I will be as open as possible.</P>

      <P>When the Minister visited the flats, which are a death trap, she gave great hope to the residents. The remarks made by her today are a cop out; she is not following through on the hope she gave to those residents. There is no point in telling us about the flair of the corporation in managing to get its house in order when it requires an allocation of £140,000 from her Department for the emergency measures.  This is not a large amount, given the threat to the lives of these young couples and their families.  These people expect the Minister to allocate this funding and she should have the flair to find it within her Department.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should be very clear about what he is saying and ensure that any comments about this matter are totally accurate.  On the emergency measures, there has been an increase in the housing allocation for Cork Corporation this year.  This is due to the major commitment by the Government to ensure that a proper housing programme is in place.  Cork Corporation has the capability of ensuring those emergency measures are carried out.  If there are any difficulties in regard to the transfer of money I will ensure that no unnecessary obstacles are put in the way.  I have visited the flat complex and I take very seriously what happened and could happen in Cork. There is an onus on all of us to be totally accurate and clear about needs to be done and what can be done in order to protect the residents of these flats.</P>

      <P>There have been three or four major fires in these flats in recent times and it is thanks to the fire brigade that nobody lost their life.  The £150,000 our housing manager has said we may be able to raise through various means will only fund the installation of an intercom system and the painting of doors with a fire resistent material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2007" /> There are no fire escapes in these flats and these are required as a minimum measure.  We had an emergency housing meeting last Monday and we will have another meeting next Tuesday.  We need to be totally clear on what we can do in terms of existing resources or funding raised by way of a loan.  If we are able to secure a loan, will the Minister match it with funding?  The programme will cost £2.7 million and it may be possible to set a two year time limit for its implementation though loan arrangements etc.  The housing manager should know the position so that he can put forward clear proposals at the meeting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The authority should take remedial action without delay.  The emergency measures include an intercom system, the replacement of the wooden ESB fuse boxes with steel boxes and the strengthening and replacement of doors.  Cork Corporation has come forward with a proposal and I welcome that.  It is important to have an emergency strategy in place to protect these people.  Full refurbishment works would take some time and in the meantime residents would not feel safe in their homes.  Cork Corporation has outlined the emergency measures which need to be taken and I do not think it will have any difficulty in carrying these out quickly, and if there is any difficulty I will look at the obstacles.  The corporation has adequate resources to meet these emergency requirements.  A remedial works programme is being carried out and obviously all the requirements, including fire safety, will be met. In the meantime the emergency measures must go ahead.</P>

      <P>The immediate emergency measures will not be much good if there is a major fire in this flat complex. I am not being alarmist when I say that.  An intercom system will not be of much use to these people if their flats are on fire.  The Minister referred to the <Col N="2008" /> housing allocation for Cork Corporation and I would point out that the funding for the remedial works scheme was reduced by £710,000 this year.  Will she restore that £710,000 to the corporation so that it can begin the very necessary works and not merely tinker around at the edges through the installation of an intercom system etc?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's suggestion for a special publicity campaign relating to properly adjusted headlights was brought to the attention of the National Safety Council which is responsible for promoting road safety awareness.  I understand from the council that, because of competing demands on their funds for other essential safety promotion issues, it was not possible for them to promote a special campaign on vehicle lighting.  It is, of course, a matter for the council to decide, in the context of its overall programme, whether and when such a campaign should be pursued, but I will again have the matter drawn to its attention.</P>
      <P>The Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963 to 1994, set down the requirements for lighting on all motor vehicles, including a requirement that dipped headlamps be so constructed and fitted as to be incapable of dazzling other road users.  I would regard non-compliance with the requirements as a serious matter.  Enforcement is a matter for the Garda Síochána whose reports indicate that 11,543 prosecutions were initiated for various motor vehicle lighting offences in 1993; there were 7,256 convictions in the same year for such offences.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> It is clear that Cork has more power than any other county in this Dáil.  I first tabled that question in 1989.  I have asked on four different occasions, excluding today, whether badly adjusted headlamps would be regarded as a serious problem.  There is a different way of life altogether in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2011" /> Many of these people live in cities and towns where improperly focused lights on oncoming motor vehicles mean nothing.  I ask the Minister to tell the National Safety Council that after five years it is time it realised that people in rural areas travelling on narrow roads frequently meet cars with defective headlights.  This must be one of the most serious difficulties encountered by rural motorists on whose behalf I speak.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I had welcomed the Bill.  I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment. When this Government was formed I welcomed him to the Ministry of Defence.  I wish him well in his new post.  It is a Department he will enjoy and find very rewarding.  I thank the <Col N="2063" /> Minister for his kind remarks and his reference to the fact that I had brought a major portion of this Bill through the Office of Public Works.</P>
      <P>I wish to pay tribute to the Office of Public Works for the very valuable work it has done over many years on arterial drainage since 1945.  It has made a tremendous difference economically to many areas.  It was in my constituency that the last major arterial drainage scheme &mdash; the Boyne drainage scheme &mdash; took place.  The criticisms of the Boyne drainage scheme underline something to which the Minister referred in the course of his remarks when introducing the Bill: the changes in attitudes and circumstances which have taken place.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works was a drainage authority and probably destroyed salmon and trout fishing along stretches of the River Boyne.  At the time nothing was thought of that but with the benefit of hindsight people criticise the Office of Public Works.  Its main task was to do a good arterial drainage job, to restore land and ensure it became economically viable.  The fact that the fisheries element was seriously affected was not a consideration.  I have no doubt, with its record, that the Office of Public Works which has responsibility for wildlife, heritage and so on would have adopted a different approach.  I pay tribute to the commissioners and the local staff on the Boyne drainage scheme for their efforts to rehabilitate for fishery purposes the River Boyne and the other rivers in its catchment area.  It has done tremendous work over recent years.  I wish to praise the Office of Public Works which has committed large sums of money to that rehabilitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1945 Act resulted from the Browne Commission which advocated a catchment area approach to arterial drainage.  There were sound logical reasons for adopting that approach.  It is obvious where various drainage schemes were carried out on a piece-meal basis by local authorities and other <Col N="2064" /> groups.  In many cases they did more harm than good and while some problems were solved other more serious ones were created.  The recommendations of the Browne Commission resulted in the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  For a number of reasons, some of which have outlined, I believe the day of the large arterial drainage scheme has gone.  These include the sufficiency of food, particularly in the European Union; the economic return demanded by the European Union before it will allow money to be expended on schemes such as this &mdash; and strong environmental reasons.  For these reasons and because of the need to relieve localised flooding &mdash; the reason most often cited &mdash; the Arterial Drainage Act should be amended.</P>
    <P>Localised flooding presents a serious problem.  Each of us can cite examples in our own constituencies. The list circulated at the time the Bill was published includes Duleek in my constituency where flooding occurs frequently.  One housing estate has been flooded on a number of occasions causing major problems for the residents, including damage to property.  It is also a health hazard.  Residents find that the value of their properties has fallen and that it is difficult to sell them.  They also find it impossible to obtain insurance.</P>
    <P>Not only is this Bill necessary, it should be enacted as a matter or urgency.  I pay tribute to the Minister of State and his immediate predecessors for exerting pressure to have it expedited and brought before the House.  I did not check the file but I issued instructions that the office should make inquiries on a fortnightly basis to the Department of Finance to discover the reason for the delay in introducing the Bill.  I venture to guess that a number of officials in that Department were not happy at the prospect that a Bill such as this would be introduced.  I am glad that it was rescued from the bowels of the Department in Merrion Street.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise an ancilliary matter. Under the 1949 Act local authorities <Col N="2065" /> have the power to relieve localised flooding and I am glad this is not being interfered with.  However, power and money are two different things.  I do not know of any local authority which has carried out works under that Act and it is highly unlikely, because of financial constraints, that any of them will.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister of State consider inserting a provision to allow local authorities to commision the Office of Public Works which has the necessary expertise and equipment to carry out works on an agency basis to relieve localised flooding?  In this context, 89 or 90 locations, where localised flooding presents a problem, were included on the list circulated when the Bill was published. It will take some time to go through it.  The Minister of State will find &mdash; £2 million is being made available initially &mdash; that a substantial number of local authorities would be willing to commission the Office of Public Works to carry out works on an agency basis if it was allowed to do so.  This would make the scheme viable for both the Office of Public Works and local authorities.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 8 of the Bill which provides for further development following the completion of a drainage scheme.  There are works that should be undertaken to relieve localised flooding but which cannot be carried out as they were not included in the initial scheme. Under this section the Minister will have the power to review the position. This will be welcomed by those who are suffering because their areas were not included in the scheme first time around.</P>
    <P>Under section 13 local authorities will be obliged to publish an annual report on maintenance works in drainage districts. That will be a slim volume as the number of schemes involving drainage work is small.  Nevertheless, this is a good provision and will draw attention to the work, or lack of it, being carried out in a particular area under the Bill.</P>
    <P>The process leading to the publication of this Bill was speeded up because of the problems experienced in various <Col N="2066" /> parts of the country, particularly Galway. I am not sure, however, if we will be able to solve the underlying problem with this Bill.  Deputy Kitt and others put forward various theories on the cause of the flooding but, in so far as it will help to relieve localised flooding, I welcome the Bill.  It will perform another useful function: it will help to retain expertise within the Office of Public Works.  It will also help the many thousands of householders who have experienced problems, because the Office of Public Works could not previously undertake this work.  I welcome the Bill and assure the Minister of our co-operation in expediting it through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment and wish him every success in the Department of Finance.  I compliment the former Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, on his preparatory work on this legislation.  I also compliment the Office of Public Works officials, particularly the engineering branch, for their valuable work over many years on our waterways.  I compliment them on their part in the restoration of the Ballyconnell-Ballinamore canal, which is not directly related to this Bill but the Minister referred to it earlier.  That was an amazing engineering feat.  It is an extremely successful project linking the two major waterways in the country, namely, the Erne and the Shannon, and providing a new cruiser waterway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ballyconnell-Ballinamore canal is 62.7 kilometres in length.  The canal runs through Leitrim and Cavan and along the Cavan-Fermanagh border to upper Lough Erne.  The Shannon system, comprising 300 kilometres of navigable waterway, is linked to the Grand Canal and the Barrow system which comprises 250 kilometres.  The Erne navigation comprises 150 kilometres. The linking of these two great waterways provides a single navigable system of more than 750 kilometres of varied cruising water.  Compliment must be paid to all the officials who devised and <Col N="2067" /> implemented the plan to restore the canal and to the Fianna Fáil Government for making the positive decision to proceed with its restoration.  In carrying out the restoration work the Office of Public Works and ESB International had due regard to the need to protect the wildlife, fisheries and the general environment.</P>
    <P>For some time the Office of Public Works has been working to advance the Erne navigation project &mdash; I discussed this matter with previous Ministers on a number of occasions &mdash; which basically concerns the River Erne southwards from Belturbet to Killykeen and Killeshandra and onto Louth Gowna.  Preliminary engineering work has been carried out on this project.  I was very disappointed to receive replies from the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht that this project is not proceeding with the speed with which it should.  It has been relegated in the priority listing.  I appeal to the Minister of State to have this matter reviewed and ensure that this cross-Border project is funded, particularly at a time when we are talking about North-South co-operation and when funding is being made available specifically to strengthen the economy of the Border counties that suffered so much for 25 years.  This project must be moved forward, and Department officials have been very anxious to progress it.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely ludicrous that the inland waterways are now the responsibility of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  Those responsibilities should have been left with the professionals and the very expert staff in the Office of Public Works who have shown their commitment to our inland waterways systems over many years.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to thank the former Minister of State, Deputy Dempsey, and the officials in the Office of Public Works for the very substantial funding of £400,000 provided towards additional mooring facilities on the River Erne at Belturbet.  I was glad that <Col N="2068" /> work commenced on that project last October and hopefully it will be possible to have these necessary facilities provided before the summer is out.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about the flooding that occurs on a regular basis in the basin of the Erne river, particularly in the areas of County Cavan such as Lough Gowna, Loughduff, Drumkilly, Lacken, Wateraughey, Crossdoney, Killeshandra, Butlersbridge, Milltown and Belturbet.  Agriculture within the Erne catchment is limited to a marked degree by poor drainage, which, particularly in the southern sector of the Erne catchment, is very well exemplified by the statistic that 57 per cent of farms in County Cavan are located on wet drumlin soil.</P>
    <P>The Erne catchment varies in width from 8 kilometres in the north-west to 65 kilometres along its most southern part.  Within the northern part of the catchment the Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture undertook statutory improvement schemes on most of the main tributaries and indeed on many of the secondary streams to the Erne between 1950 and 1975.  The Office of Public Works designed the drainage scheme in 1970.  If that work had been carried out it would have benefited an area of 100 square kilometres, representing about 7 per cent of the section of the Erne located in the Republic.  In that part of County Cavan arterial drainage is essential to improve conditions for the farming community.</P>
    <P>The Erne catchment is the fourth largest catchment in Ireland after the Rivers Shannon, Barrow and Ban. Unlike the other major river systems, the Erne has only minimal coastal frontage. The area within the Erne catchment falls under the jurisdiction of seven local authorities, namely, Cavan, Leitrim, Longford, Monaghan and Donegal county councils, Omagh District Council and Fermanagh District Council.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that no specific provision was made to have works carried out at an early date in Longford, Leitrim and particularly Cavan, areas <Col N="2069" /> that suffered immeasurably, particularly from an agricultural and social point of view, due to severe flooding in the River Erne basin.</P>
    <P>I am glad this Bill has been introduced. It is long overdue and will allow the necessary works to be carried out. Much work was done in an area of County Fermanagh that is literally down the road from my home area, and as a result the agricultural economy has benefited substantially.  I hope the Minister will give favourable consideration to the carrying out of work in the areas of County Cavan to which I referred.  Once again I wish him every success in the Department.  I compliment the officials with whom I have had dealings over the years for their great work, interest and commitment to our arterial drainage systems and inland waterways.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney) Avril Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their kind good wishes to me, which I appreciate, and also for their interesting and positive contributions to this debate.  I assure them that in the implementation of development proposals under this legislation careful consideration will be given to what has been said.  It is obvious from all that has been said here today and during the debate in the Seanad, that we are at one in our efforts to deal with serious problems arising from the flooding which continues to occur and which, if anything, has become more persistent in recent years, certainly in 1995.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the Bill, as drafted, meets the current needs of the Commissioners of Public Work to deal with these problems in a positive way, and are adequate to deal with the various suggestions made by Members.  No doubt more will be said on the subject when we deal with the details of the Bill on Committee Stage.  The introduction of this Bill to make the necessary changes to the existing drainage legislation is perhaps the single most important item in our battle against the floods, but it is not the only issue which has held our attention in recent months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2070" /> I will refer to the response by the Government to the immediate problems of those individuals who suffered most during the recent floods, particularly in the west.  As series of actions has been taken and I am glad to be in a position to place the Government's response on the record.  On 7 February 1995 the Government established an inter-departmental committee chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance to co-ordinate a response to the effects of bad weather.  Through that committee a national response plan to the effects of bad weather in the event of future occurences is being prepared. The Government also decided in principle at its meeting on 14 March to make funds available for the relief of hardship and distress for victims of severe flooding.  It is the intention to channel the funds through the Irish Red Cross Society.  An assessment of the extent and scale of the funding required is currently in hand.</P>
    <P>Through my predecessor the Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, a sum of 325,000 ECUs humanitarian aid was made available from the EU Commission for the relief of such distress in Ireland.  These funds will also be disbursed by the Irish Red Cross Society which has received over 300 claims for assistance to date.  These are currently being assessed.  Great credit is due to the Minister of State, Deputy Higgins for his pursuit of his goal to find a proper solution to the problems and to give help where it is most needed.</P>
    <P>I have heard criticism from certain sources of the decision to use the Red Cross as the conduit through which funds are being channelled.  I am satisfied this was the proper course to follow as, apart from anything else, it minimises the bureaucracy involved.  It has worked successfully both here in the past and throughout the European Union.</P>
    <P>The Government has made available a £2 million compensation fund to cover agricultural losses of stock and fodder arising from the bad weather and payments to date under this scheme have <Col N="2071" /> been made to over 500 farmers.  A sum of £50,000 has been allocated to Galway County Council for the repair of roads and a further sum of £4 million has been made available for the repair of county roads countrywide.</P>
    <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, operated by the health boards on behalf of the Department of Social Welfare, has provision to cater for urgent and emergency situations such as arise in times of severe flooding.</P>
    <P>Approval was given to the commissioning by the Office of Public Works of a special multi-disciplinary investigation into the causes of flooding in the south Galway area which will recommend remedies to the problems. Thirty-one submissions have been made by consultants interested in carrying out the study and it is expected a commission will be in place shortly.  This is a complex issue and, apart from dealing with the problem of flooding, complex geological and environmental issues must be dealt with.  The suggestion in some quarters that it only necessitates clearing some swallow holes is a grave over-simplification of a complex problem. It is not reasonable to expect that instant solutions will emerge from this legislation, but we are determined to get to the bottom of the problem and to devise solutions which will benefit the people.  It has been possible to carry out one scheme for the relief of flooding in County Galway and design work for further flood affected areas has been initiated.</P>
    <P>An emergency co-ordination centre or one stop shop has been established in Gort, County Galway since March last, staffed by representatives of the Western Health Board, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Galway County Council, the Irish Red Cross Society and the Office of Public Works. Some 500 callers have been assisted in relation to claims for compensation, rehousing and humanitarian aid.</P>
    <P>In my previous ministry Army vehicles were deployed to transport school children to and from schools and <Col N="2072" /> to provide other assistance as required in the south Galway area.  The Army Air Corps using helicopters has carried out over 200 cargo sorties transporting almost 100 tons of fodder, fuel, foodstuff and medicines.  That was done under the direction of the Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, who co-ordinated all the State agencies' involvement in the emergency measures.</P>
    <P>The Government decided to provide for a Supplementary Estimate this year to enable specified drainage works to go ahead.  These will be commenced after the enactment of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies will agree that the extent of all these measures reflect the Government's commitment to the resolution of the plight of all those affected. However, the physical remedying of the causes of the problem must now commence and that will take some time.</P>
    <P>With the enactment of the current Bill we will be in a position to commence work on the ground in selected areas.  In this connection I have noted with interest the representations made here today and in the Seanad earlier in respect of the many areas which have suffered most.  I can assure the House that in drawing up future programmes of work all of these will be considered and taken into account.  However, so that some physical progress can be made, in the immediate future it has been reasonably decided to concentrate on a number of areas.  The Commissioners of Public Works are at present undertaking the necessary surveys, data collection and design work in these areas under their existing powers and with the goodwill of the landowners onto whose land they had to go.  It is, however, essential that they be given the powers proposed before any substantial work can commence.</P>
    <P>As Deputies would assume, the criteria used in selecting the priority areas were the severity of flooding and the availability of most of the necessary data, for example, where flow measuring devices have been installed for a period of years or where previous studies had been made.  In Galway there are <Col N="2073" /> a number of areas where the hardship is particularly obvious.  Much has already been said on the proposal for the study of the south Galway area.  For the town of Gort, it has been possible to identify some possible solutions and these are being examined.  At Belclare near Tuam excavation to lower the level of the existing flooding has already been undertaken successfully, while a scheme for the Williamstown area is also being considered.  This, like the South Galway region, is a highly sensitive area and detailed examination of the likely impact of works on the environment is being undertaken in advance.</P>
    <P>Consulting engineers have been appointed to design a flood relief scheme for Carlow while in Kilkenny designs prepared by consultants engaged by the local authority are being examined.  Designs for schemes for the Cappamore, Newport and Sixmilebridge areas of counties Limerick, Tipperary and Clare are well advanced and the necessary data is being collated at Duleek, County Meath and consultants will be appointed shortly.  Options for flood relief in Dunmanway, County Cork will be assessed shortly also by consultants.</P>
    <P>The areas involved are geographically widespread and it is hoped to commence work in most of them during this year.</P>
    <P>I return now to the Bill itself.  The House will note that no provision has been made for payment of compensation to people who may have suffered loss or damage through flooding.  It is not considered appropriate to make such a provision for a number of reasons which I will outline briefly and I point out also that the heads of the Bill which we inherited from the Opposition did not contain any such provision.</P>
    <P>It would be normal and reasonable to expect that people and businesses would insure against loss due to exceptional events such as flooding and it would be entirely inappropriate for the State on behalf of the taxpayer to say we will assume that responsibility.  Furthermore, there is a duty on people to take <Col N="2074" /> reasonable precautions to protect their property from damage.  I know there are some areas where it may be difficult, and indeed impossible to reinsure property damaged by regular flooding, but I must emphasise that the objective of this Bill is to provide for the removal or alleviation of the risk.</P>
    <P>The Government has shown by its response to the most recent flooding incidents that the State has the capacity to provide assistance in monetary and practical terms when and where it is most needed.  The House will be aware of the many measures that have been implemented already and the Government has promised to establish a further humanitarian aid fund, the nature and extent of the need for which is currently being examined.</P>
    <P>A statutory scheme would be extremely difficult to frame and would probably be too rigid and inflexible and risk excluding some deserving cases which can be assisted far more satisfactorily under the existing regime.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dempsey asked if the Office of Public Works, on an agency basis and at the request of a local authority, can undertake works to alleviate local flooding. It can do so and this Bill will assist it in that regard.  A number of Deputies spoke about the need to make provision for compensation to individuals affected by flooding.  I have already dealt with that matter.  Deputy Kitt inquired about the claims from the South Galway Flood Victims Action Group.  Claims from people in all areas are being examined and the South Galway victims' submissions is being taken into account in that examination.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies expressed the wish that the Office of Public Works would have power in limited circumstances to undertake works without the need to initiate a scheme.  This possibility was carefully considered in the Office of Public Works in preparing the heads of the Bill and during the debate in the Seanad, where the matter was also raised.  It was decided on balance not to include such a provision, we are talking about a response to emergency <Col N="2075" /> cases.  We believe that in the case of schemes not already under Office of Public Works maintenance, local authorities are in a much better position to anticipate problems and to move quickly to resolve them.  They have ample power under the Local Authorities Works Act, 1949, to take such action.  I assure the House that if either practical or technical assistance from the Office of Public Works is required to support such action from a local authority, it will be given.</P>
    <P>There is close co-operation between the Office of Public Works, local authorities and district drainage boards as well as interested groups and individuals and I will encourage the continuation and strengthening of that co-operation.</P>
    <P>Deputies Kitt and Treacy mentioned the position in Belclare and Williamstown. I am pleased that work to reduce the level of flooding at Belclare has been completed.  Williamstown is one of the areas on which sufficient data is available to enable design to commence and arrangements to start the design shortly are in hand.</P>
    <P>Many speakers referred to the environment. There is a statutory requirement to undertake an environmental impact assessment as part of the design of a drainage scheme.  I agree with speakers who expressed the view that a balance must be struck between the various interests in this context and I am confident that satisfactory schemes can be undertaken while at the same time protecting the environment.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to the importance of providing adequate funding to back up the provisions of the Bill. This is essential and I assure the House <Col N="2076" /> that the Government intends to provide a reasonable level of funding, but, as funding is not inexhaustible, it would be impossible to carry out all works at the same time.  Deputy Smith expressed disappointment at the fact that there was no commitment to specific works in his area.  In addition to the areas already announced, the Office of Public Works will compile a national priority programme and the areas he mentioned will be carefully considered in that context.</P>
    <P>In the light of what has been said, I look forward with confidence to the continued support of the House in seeing through the remaining Stages of the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrangements at local level, which may involve the community employment programme, are primarily a matter for each individual Tidy Towns committee. However, my Department's information booklet on the competition draws committees' attention to the <Col N="2015" /> potential assistance the programme can give to their efforts.  Indeed, committees have for a number of years made extensive use of community employment and other FÁS employment programmes; this reflects the fact that the kinds of projects which may be availed of under these programmes are particularly suitable to the activities of Tidy Towns committees.  I understand that some 30 per cent of those engaged under the community employment programme are engaged on various environmental improvement projects sponsored by local authorities or by voluntary and community groups, including Tidy Towns committees.</P>

    <P>I am satisfied that the Environmental Protection Agency is being adequately <Col N="2016" /> funded and I have no immediate plans to increase its funding in 1995.  The total Estimates provision of £5.12 million for the current year, including current and capital spending, represents an increase of 16 per cent over the 1994 outturn. This reflects the continuing build up of the Environmental Protection Agency organisation and its administration of the environmental monitoring, research and development sub-programme of the Environmental Services Operational Programme, 1994-99.  In addition to its Exchequer grant, the agency has substantial income from its integrated licensing function, which is self-financing, and from services provided to local authorities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 47 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Total Irish carbon dioxide emissions in each of the years 1990 to 1993 were as follows: 1990, 30.7 million tonnes; 1991, 31.3 million tonnes; 1992, 30.9 million tonnes; 1993, 31.9 million tonnes.  Data for 1994 is not yet available.  The 4 per cent increase in emissions since 1990 is somewhat lower than had been anticipated. This comparatively small increase at a time of strong economic growth is explained by the increasing energy efficiency of the Irish economy and a shift in national fuel mix from carbon intensive fuels, such as coal and peat, to less carbon intensive fuels such as oil and gas.  The Government will <Col N="2017" /> continue to promote its strategy for carbon dioxide abatement.</P>
    <P>OECD figures indicate that for 1992 Irish emissions of CO 2 per unit, $1,000, of GDP stood at 1.24 compared to OECD and EU averages of 0.96 and 0.98 respectively.  The ratio of energy consumption of GDP is similar in Ireland to the EU average.  These comparisons reflect the fact that Ireland derives a greater proportion of its energy requirements from carbon based fuels and does not use nuclear energy. It will however be the objective to reduce the ratio of Irish CO 2 emissions to GDP.</P>

      <P>The allocation of local authority accommodation is a matter for the individual housing authorities having regard to the requirements of sections 9 and 11 of the Housing Act, 1988.</P>
      <P>In making a housing assessment, a housing authority may, to such extent, if any, as the authority consider appropriate, include housing needs arising from the requirements of persons who are residing outside the functional area of the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each housing authority is required to make a scheme of priorities for letting their dwellings to persons who were included in the last assessment of need undertaken by the authority, or <Col N="2020" /> accepted for inclusion in the next assessment. The purpose of a scheme of letting priorities is to provide a means for determining the order of priority to be afforded, in the letting of dwellings, to persons accepted as entitled to local authority housing.</P>
    <P>Guidelines issued on 15 March 1989 to local authorities informed them that a minimum residency requirement, which may have been included in a scheme of priorities under section 60 of the Housing Act, 1966, as a basis for determining a person's eligibility for local authority housing, was not appropriate for inclusion in a scheme of letting priorities under section 11.  Local authorities were advised that they should include in a scheme for letting priorities only those conditions which relate to the determination of priority and not those relating to establishing, in the first instance, a person's eligibility for local authority housing.</P>

      <P>National standards for urban waste water discharges are prescribed by the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992 (Urban Waste Water Treatment) Regulations, 1994.  The implications of these Regulations for the planning, design and operation of sewage treatment facilities were communicated by my Department to local authorities earlier this year.  Enforcement of the standards is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with the EU Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (91/271/EEC), the Regulations specify <Col N="2021" /> different timescales for the upgrading of treatment facilities, according to size of population discharge and the quality of receiving waters.  An implementation programme to give effect to these requirements has recently been submitted by my Department to the European Commission.  Copies of the programme are in the Oireachtas Library.  The programme involves a continuation and expansion of the major investment already being made in improved treatment systems; such investment already accounts for some 70 per cent of the overall water and sewerage programme.</P>
    <P>The newspaper report referred to in the question related in many cases to small sewage discharges to which the specific standards mentioned in the newspaper report do not apply.  As required by the EU Directive, priority is given in the Irish implementation programme to the treatment of major polluting discharges.  The total estimated cost of meeting the Directive's requirements is £1.2 billion.</P>

      <P>My Department commissioned a major consultancy study on future sewage sludge management in Ireland in prospect of the greater volumes of sludge which will arise from increased secondary treatment of sewage. This strategy study was circulated to local authorities, together with advice from my Department, in June 1994. Local authorities have been requested to review the design of all wastewater treatment plants and to modify these designs where necessary to take account of various technical recommendations contained in the sludge strategy study.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2022" /> My Department has also requested local authorities to prepare detailed sludge management plans which are consistent with the principle of reuse and recycling incorporated in the EU Directive on Urban Waste Water Treatment. While landfill is not ruled out as an acceptable method of sludge disposal, alternative management approaches such as land application for agricultural purposes, forestry, land reclamation and the restoration of peat bogs will also be pursued.</P>
    <P>A sludge management pilot project is at present under way in Killarney.  This project involves the the investigation of optimum sludge treatment technology and the design and construction of a sludge centre to treat sludge produced at the Killarney waste water treatment plant.  The results of this pilot project which are expected to be available by the end of 1995 will be of assistance with other treatment plants.</P>
    <P>The proposed EU Landfill Directive, on which the Environment Council agreed a common position in June 1994, provides that a landfill site for non-hazardous waste may be used for the disposal of non-hazardous sludges which are compatible with the leachate management procedures adopted in relation to that site.</P>

      <P>The Government's plans in relation to social housing are set out in detail in the policy document <i>Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead</i>.  This was published on 2 May 1995 and a copy was supplied to each Deputy on the same day.  The document indicates that, on the basis of current policies and resources, all the social housing programmes taken together will cater for the housing needs of over 9,500 households in 1995 and 10,000 in 1996, compared to just over 6,100 in 1992.</P>

      <P>Under the essential repairs grants scheme, a local authority may pay a grant up to the full approved cost of the repairs but subject to a maximum which is adjusted in line with the house building cost index; the maximum currently stands at £5,049.  An authority may recoup half of their expenditure on such grants from my Department, up to a limit of £900 in any one case.  This limit was increased from £600 in respect of works commenced on or after 1 March 1993.  There are, at present, no proposals to further increase it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 80 together.</P>
      <P>The Waste Bill, 1995 includes general and specific provisions in relation to almost all types of waste, including blood, sludge and agricultural waste. Section 32 of the Bill, for example, proposes a general duty of care requiring all holders of waste to avoid causing environmental pollution.  Section 39 provides that all significant waste recovery and disposal activities will be subject to licensing by the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 51 provides for alternative, special controls in relation to the recovery, but not the disposal, of certain wastes, including sludges from local authority water and sewage treatment plants, blood of animal or poultry origin <Col N="2025" /> and certain non-hazardous agricultural wastes.  The recovery of these wastes will not be subject to normal licensing controls.  The Bill would enable the Minister, however, to make regulations to prohibit, limit or control such recovery activities.</P>

      <P>All funding to local authorities for EU assisted road and water-waste water projects is provided from the Exchequer.

    <P>In the area covered by the Dublin Transportation Initiative, my Department provides special grants for traffic management projects, including the dishing of footpaths and other measures designed to assist mobility impaired and disabled people.  In other areas, such <Col N="2033" /> works on local roads may be financed, in whole or in part, from the discretionary block grants paid annually by my Department to road authorities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 99 together.</P>
      <P>Following the success of the pilot schemes which operated in certain counties in the period 1992-1994, all local authorities have been asked to seek to involve local communities in contributing, whether in money or in kind, towards the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads in their areas.  Local authorities may reserve a portion of their 1995 discretionary grant allocations for projects attracting community support and in this way enhance the return from public investment in these roads.  The practice of providing specific grants to certain county councils for pilot schemes to promote and evaluate the scope for community involvement has been discontinued now that the initial experimental phase has been successfully concluded.</P>
      <P>In relation to the general question of grants for non-national roads in 1995, I refer to the reply to Question No. 19 on 27 April 1995.</P>

      <P>It is not feasible to determine the Irish manufacture content for all furniture items procured by the Office of Public Works.  Given the nature, range and diversity of the products involved, Irish manufacture content can vary depending on such factors as availability of items, components and material involved and economies of scale in the context of the Irish market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is estimated that about 80 per cent of the furniture supplied to Government Departments and Offices by the Office of Public Works is Irish-made in the broad sense of this term <Col N="2035" /> with the remainder from other European Union countries mainly through Irish suppliers.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer's tax affairs for 1989-90 to 1992-93 were reviewed in 1993 resulting in an overpayment of £193.66.  This was repaid to him on 26 August, 1993.  The taxpayer was again notified in writing of the position when he called to the tax office <Col N="2046" /> recently.  There is no further refund due in respect of these years.  A PAYE balancing statement issued on 9 May last for the year 1994/95 but no refund arose.  A review for 1993/94 is being dealt with at present and the taxpayer will be notified of the outcome shortly.</P>

      <P>Proposals for special relief from BIK tax on company cars for genuine sales representatives have been made from time to time.  It has not been possible to introduce such a relief.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the type of restricted relief proposed by the Deputy would require that a suitable definition of a &ldquo;genuine sales representative&rdquo; be devised.  It has not been possible to devise such a definition to restrict a special relief to that group.  It could be open to court challenge on grounds of discrimination by other workers who represent employers generally.</P>
      <P>The yield from BIK on cars is approximately £65 million per annum. Any special relief for sales representatives would lead to additional claims for special relief from other groups and could have serious implications for the yield from the tax.  It is difficult to be precise about the actual cost but I am satisfied that it would be significant.</P>
      <P>Any lost in yield from BIK would have to be made up by additional taxation in other areas or be matched by reduced expenditure.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to answer Questions Nos. 88, 89 and 90 together.</P>
      <P>My Department deals with a large volume of parliamentary questions and it is not possible to isolate the cost of dealing with individual questions.  The information requested in the parliamentary question on 16 May 1995 was of a general nature and was supplied.  The parliamentary question on 25 May 1995 requested more specific information which was sought from the health board concerned and supplied.</P>
      <P>I am advised by the Western Health Board that tests carried out on water samples from the Ballycroy scheme involve chemical and bacteriological testing and the scientific criterion of contamination used is the presence of coliforms in the water samples.</P>
      <P>The results of the tests on the Ballycroy group water scheme carried out in 1991 and 1992 by the Western Health Board were forwarded to the County Council and to the trustees of the scheme.  The board recommended treatment of the water to ensure a safe supply.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 92, 102 and 105 together.</P>
      <P>Minibus drivers and bus drivers must, under Directive 80/1263/EEC and the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations, 1989 to 1994, hold a valid driving licence for category D or D1, as appropriate.  Directive 91/439/EEC will replace the current directive with effect from 1 July 1996 but will require no specific amendments in relation to driving licences for minibuses or buses.</P>
      <P>The law on the fitting and wearing of seat belts generally is contained in the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations, 1963 to 1993.  My Department has published a leaflet containing guidance on the regulations but this does not, of course, purport to be a legal interpretation of the law.  I am sending a copy of this leaflet to Deputy Fitzgerald.</P>
      <P>Buses and coaches in use in this country are generally built outside Ireland and our capacity to influence bus design and construction is therefore limited.  In addition, national regulations imposing unique bus construction requirements could be deemed to be a barrier to the movement of vehicles within the EU internal market.  I understand, however, that the EU Commission will shortly make formal proposals for a Type Approval Directive requiring the fitting of anchorages and seat belts in all seats in all new coaches capable of exceeding 60 mph, and in all new minibuses. Ireland's support for such a requirement has been conveyed to the Commission.</P>

      <P>In January 1993, Kerry County Council had put a proposal to my Department for alternative accommodation for its motor taxation office.  At that time, a building adjacent to the council headquarters and suitable for conversion to accommodate the motor taxation office was due to become available. The Department did not accept at the time the need for alternative accommodation; the existing office was regarded as generally satisfactory and considerable funds had been provided for it by the Department over the years.</P>
      <P>My Department is now considering a proposal submitted in January 1995 by the county council for the provision of accommodation in a new building to be erected near the county council headquarters in Tralee.  This consideration must have due regard to the level of commitments and competing demands on the motor taxation recoupment budget nationally.  A decision will be made as soon as possible and notified to the council.</P>

      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency has given information and advice to Cavan County Council, following a request in April 1994 by the then Minister for the Environment to the agency under section 56 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.  The information and advice related to the performance by the County Council of its functions under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, 1977 and 1990, for the control of water pollution with respect to the Lough Sheelin catchment, and was first transmitted by the agency to the county council in November 1994. A copy of the Environmental Protection Agency report involved was sent to my Department by the agency at that time on a courtesy basis and I understand that copies are available, on request, from the agency.  Action arising from the Environmental Protection Agency <Col N="2055" /> information and advice is a matter for Cavan County Council.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency has written separately to my Department concerning the financing of phosphorous removal facilities at Ballyjamesduff which the agency views as requiring high priority in the context of improving water quality in Lough Sheelin. This project has already been proposed by my Department for Cohesion Fund financing as part of the application for the Lough Ree catchment submitted to the European Commission in December 1994.</P>
      <P>My Department has no record of having been sent a copy of the Greenpeace report referred to in the question, although it has obtained the report independently. As regards the claims in that report about dangers to Granard drinking water, while my Department is not the authority responsible for quality monitoring, I understand that Longford County Council has undertaken monitoring of the water supply for the substances. (THMs) referred to in the report.  The results obtained were well within the current maximum admissible concentration of 100 rug/1 set out in the European Communities (Quality of Water Intended for Human Consumption) Regulations, 1988.</P>

      <Quest>the views, if any, she has on the proposed increases in fees for post-graduate and doctoral degree courses; the further views, if any, she has on the fact that the proposed increase of 40 per cent is eight to ten times the rate of inflation; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The level of fees for post-graduate courses is a matter for the colleges themselves to decide.</P>
      <P>In the case of the recently announced increases by University College Dublin I understand that the overall average increase in post-graduate fees is 12 per cent.  The average increase in Ph.D. fees is just over 23 per cent.  Some 60 per cent of Ph.D. students are in receipt of grant-aid or fee concessions.  In the Science area, which will see an increase of about 38 per cent in Ph.D. fees, only a minority will be paying full fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally speaking, post-graduate course fees are below the level of undergraduate fees.  I understand that the application of the fee increases will still <Col N="2059" /> leave post-graduate fees, on average, lower than undergraduate fees.</P>
