      <P>Before the commencement of business proper this morning I am obliged to deal with a matter of gross disorder which occurred during the Adjournment Debate last evening when Deputy Liam Lawlor defied the Chair and refused to withdraw from the Chamber on having been <Col N="1554" /> directed to do so.  This necessitated the adjournment of the House and the abandonment of certain matters fixed for the Adjournment Debate.</P>
      <P>I would have sought the Deputy's suspension last evening but for the fact that, under Standing Order 20 (3), there cannot be any division during an Adjournment Debate.  Consequently, I am availing of the first opportunity to deal with this matter.</P>
      <P>I call on the Tánaiste to name Deputy Lawlor.</P>

I was told I would not get in last night and I certainly will not get in today.  What arrangements have been made for the Committee Stage of the Waste Bill?

      <P>Section 1, the definition section, refers to the Social Welfare Act, 1994.  That Act contains the general provisions, but the rates of benefit in that Act are not the rates recently introduced in the 1995 Act which are devalued rates.  Between mid-May 1994 and mid-May 1995 there was an increase in the consumer price index of 2.8 per cent.  This means that the 2.5 per cent increase given under the 1995 Act is, effectively, 20p below the rate of inflation.  In addition, economists have predicted in the last few days that inflation will increase to 3.3 per cent over this year and, in that event, pensions like the survivor's pension will be effectively devalued by 55p.  This leaves a question over the rates that are to apply.  The consumer price index is officially at 2.8 per cent while the rate to be applied under the 1995 Act is 2.5 per cent, and economists predict an increase in the consumer price index to 3.3 per cent.  The Bill relates to the Social Welfare Act, 1994, and the Principal Act means the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993.  Will the Minister tell us if the applicable rates are the devalued rates that are the result of the Government's cutbacks in old age pensions, unemployment benefits and invalidity pensions?</P>

      <P>Section 1 provides for the definitions necessary for the purposes of the Bill.  I commend and congratulate Deputy Woods on using this opportunity to make a political point in regard to the rates of social welfare which have nothing to do with this Bill which seeks to extend rights to people in the event of divorce that they currently have in relation to social welfare.  The Deputy knows from his long experience as a <Col N="1564" /> Minister for Social Welfare that the figure on which inflation is based for the year at budget time is the average figure for the full year, not a figure at midyear. The Departments of Social Welfare and Finance are confident that over the full year our prediction of 2.5 per cent will be accurate and the value of what we have provided for in the budget will be delivered.  I emphasise as well that despite Fianna Fáil propaganda on the rates, the fact that the general increases are being paid six weeks earlier than they were paid last year is ignored.</P>

      <P>The definitions in section 1 are vague.  There is no definition of cohabitation.  I would like the Minister to give a definition of cohabitation which is an increasing feature of Irish society.  We are told by the Minister that this Bill is all about clarity.  If there is clarity in not defining cohabitation, I would like to know about it.</P>
      <P>The Minister has put the costings of this Bill for the first five years at £1 million, and at £2 million in ten years.  The fact that the Minister is paying less than inflation, while refusing to accept that this constitutes a cut, throws some light on the reasons the costings in regard to this legislation are as low as £1 million in five years or £200,000 per annum.  It is an unrealistic figure and I do not accept it.  What is the definition of &ldquo;cohabitation&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>I am concerned about the figure of £1 million.  What rate of inflation was used by the Department in assessing the cost?  The figures do not stand up to examination.  It is important to raise this issue as the public are interested in it and will need to know that the figure is realistic.  Anyone with a passing interest in the Bill will see that these figures are not correct.  People received the increase in their payments this week and it was little over £1.  They cannot believe the Minister gave an increase of 2.5 per cent.  Fianna Fáil is raising the issue because everyone in the street is talking about it.</P>

I regret that Fianna Fáil Deputies seem more intent on making cheap political points about social welfare rates than dealing with the detail of this important Bill which guarantees rights to those who will obtain a divorce.</P>
      <P>The concept of cohabitation is not unknown in the social welfare code but it is not easy to define.  It is a condition of entitlement for a number of social welfare payments, for example, lone parent's allowance, deserted wife's benefit, widow's contributory pension and so on.  The incidence of people being disqualified from receiving payment on grounds of cohabitation is rare, for example, only 114 people were disqualified in 1994.  They were mainly unmarried parents in receipt of lone parent's allowance.  To date this year 40 people have been disqualified.  It is not a new concept but has been part and parcel of the social welfare code for some years.</P>

      <P>I am appalled that despite providing evidence to show that the Fianna Fáil statements are wrong, time after time Deputies repeat them.  That is pure propaganda and it does not address the issues under the Bill.  Deputy Woods said the increase was the lowest in 30 years.  That is not true.  The increases he gave some years ago were lower than the rate of inflation.  I put this information on the record before and it is disingenuous of Deputy Woods, a former Minister for Social Welfare, to repeatedly put on record statements he knows are untrue. I do not intend to reiterate what I said about rates and so on.  This important Bill guarantees rights to those who become divorced.  That is what we should deal with and not the spurious arguments Fianna Fáil attempts to raise.</P>

      <P>There is no definition of &ldquo;cohabitation&rdquo; in the Bill.

      <P>I will deal first with the question of widows and widowers. Almost 93,000 people are in receipt of survivor's pension.  Widowers became eligible for pensions from 28 October 1994.  There are over 5,000 widowers receiving pensions.  In 1994 the expenditure on survivor's pension amounted to £306 million and the post-budget estimate of expenditure for 1995 is £341 million.  I dealt with the projected numbers for take up in relation to divorce by way of a question in the Dáil a week ago.  If I recall correctly there are 55,000 separated people according to the CSO.</P>

      <P>These are the statistics on which the projection is based.  It is assumed that 75 per cent might avail of divorce, that 50 per cent of those might remarry and that 80 per cent of women would outlive their former spouses.  Those are the assumptions underlying the cost which I have indicated to the Deputy for the five years.  The cost will reach about £1 million in the fifth year and increase to about £2 million in the tenth year.  I have made the point repeatedly that it is impossible to be accurate in relation to assumptions of this kind.  It is debatable whether three quarters of those who are separated will seek divorce and whether 50 per cent of those who are divorced will subsequently remarry.  It is actuarially true that 80 per cent of women survive their spouses.  We have to wait and see how divorce actually operates in practice before we can give specific and absolutely accurate figures. My own feeling is that less than 75 per cent of separated people will seek divorce. I do not know whether the 50 per cent who are divorced will subsequently remarry but it seems a reasonable assumption.  By and large it is a workable figure.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister review the figures he has just given the House? In his contribution he referred to assumptions but he could not give accurate numbers regarding the group of people who will be affected by the section.  He referred to a figure of 55,000 people being separated but that figure is based on the 1991 census of population. The Minister will agree that 55,000 is not a proper number on which to base assumptions in 1995.  The one thing the Minister is concerned about is to remove any sense of threat.  I urge him to review the figures he has quoted with a view to accepting that if in 1991 there were 55,000 separated people there is more than likely an increase in that number in 1995.  In 1996 he will have to introduce the necessary package to meet this demand.  In his Second Stage speech he said the cost is likely to rise to £1 million over the next five years.  If the Minister did his sums correctly he would find that his figures are way out. There is a concern over the financial aspects associated with the Bill.  The Minister, who mentioned the figure of £1 million, should recognise that in excess of 70,000 fall into this category in 1995.

      <P>It is; that is the reason the Bill has been introduced. The Deputy has to bear two points in mind.  We are working on the assumption that 75 per cent of those who are separated, be it 55,000 or 75,000, will opt for divorce, that 50 per cent of these may remarry and that 80 per cent of women will survive their husbands.  If we assume that the figure is 75,000 we would still be talking about an extremely low figure, thousands rather than millions of pounds.</P>
      <P>It is wrong of the Deputy to imply that this Bill poses a threat.  It guarantees rights: it guarantees that a person who is currently separated and opts for divorce, if and when it is introduced, will still qualify for a widow's or widower's pension if their former spouse dies or even remarries.  The greatest proportion or bulk of the cost will arise in connection with survivor's, widower's and widow's pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference in the figures is at most thousands, not millions, of pounds. In the context of total expenditure in the Department of Social Welfare, which is in excess of £4 billion and total support for lone parents, deserted wives, widows and widowers which is in excess of £600 million, it is unwise to raise fears that costs under this Bill will be unsustainable because, clearly, this will not be the case.  Costs will amount to £1 million over a period of five years: perhaps, £100,000 in the first year, £150,000 in the second year and so on. We are, therefore, talking about small incremental increases even though in <Col N="1574" /> the first five years we will have to deal with a backlog.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Instead of working on assumptions we should be more realistic and pragmatic and recognise that the true numbers who fall into this category are much higher.  There is, therefore, a need for the Minister to review the figures and provide clarification.  Instead of depending on the figure of 55,000 produced in 1991 the general public would prefer him to work on more accurate figures.</P>
      <P>The Minister estimates that total costs will amount to £1 million over a period of five years.  To avoid misinterpretations I urge him to show how this sum will be adequate.  If we were to provide a breakdown we would be talking about pence, not pounds.  What is the inflation rate likely to be over this period?</P>
      <P>The increase of 2.5 per cent has been the subject of much discussion recently. My party leader raised the issue this morning.  The headline &ldquo;Keep your £1.80&rdquo; was carried recently in one of the newspapers.  Last Thursday when it was paid old age pensioners were disgusted given that the inflation rate is 2.8 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>The same applies to every one of the 250,000 pensioners who received the <Col N="1575" /> miserable increase of 2.5 per cent.

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In the region of 90 per cent of the total cost will arise under this section, primarily because people will still qualify for a widow's pension or, in some cases, a widower's pension even where their former spouse remarries.  Deputies are confusing the cost of implementing the Bill with the cost arising from a marriage breakdown generally.  The Department of Social Welfare already provides funding in terms of marriage breakdown &mdash; for example, lone parent's allowance and deserted wife's benefit.  What we are talking about here is primarily guaranteeing income and the extension of a <Col N="1576" /> person's right to widow's and widower's pension &mdash; there are other factors involved also &mdash; in circumstances where a former spouse has remarried but, the person claiming has not remarried and is not cohabiting.  There will be circumstances where people will get divorced at a relatively early age and the right of a widow's pension will not arise for perhaps five, ten, 20 or 30 years.  It is a gradual accumulation of costs that arises, not an immediate cost.</P>
      <P>About 75 per cent of those who separate will apply for divorce.  If they do not apply for divorce they will not be affected in terms of social welfare, but if they apply and are successful their rights to social welfare are guaranteed. That is the objective of the Bill.  I do not understand why there is so much concern about the fact that we have estimated the cost.  It is not possible to be precise because we are dealing in many circumstances with the unknown, in terms of the numbers who will divorce following separation, the numbers who will subsequently remarry and the numbers who will survive their former spouses.  We do not know how many people will remarry &mdash; for example, where a couple divorce both spouses may remarry.  It cannot be automatically assumed that one spouse will forever be dependent on the other for their rights in terms of widow's or widower's pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some people outside this House are disappointed that the costs in terms of social welfare are not much higher because they had hoped to use it as a stick to beat the proposed referendum. I am sure that is not the case with Deputies opposite: I know they are seeking this information to reassure people that the amount of money that will be spent on widow's and widower's pensions and support for deserted wive's and lone parents will be minimal &mdash; £1 million over a period of five years. Even if that figure is 50 per cent off target we are talking about only £1.5 million over a five year period.  It is important to get the message across that we are talking about insignificant sums <Col N="1577" /> of money to guarantee people's rights in terms of social welfare in the event of divorce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important Bill as it clears the way for people to make decisions in regard to the divorce referendum.  The introduction to the Bill states that it provides for the necessary changes in the social welfare code to ensure that no spouse will be disadvantaged in terms of social welfare entitlements as a result of his or her legal status being changed from married, separated or deserted to divorced. In this section the Minister is providing for former spouses who are widows and widowers.  The position of the first spouse is guaranteed and there need be no fear about loss of social welfare rights or entitlements.  This section provides that regardless of the number of times a spouse remarries, the initial spouse will maintain the rights he or she would have had in the first instance.  In that respect this is important legislation in the context of the referendum.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies asked about the costings, and it is important that they be fully teased out.  I accept it is difficult to calculate the amount involved but the cost will be much less than people generally expect.  The question arises with longer term costs, for example, in ten or 15 years.  As the Minister said, even if the figure is 50 per cent off target it will be a relatively small amount of money in social welfare terms, yet it guarantees the initial rights of the first spouse.  It is important that the Minister outlines the longer term costs as that issue will be raised.  Deputy Callely asked what system has been used in calculating the costings and this issue will receive much attention outside this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential that this section is in place before the referendum.  The Minister may be somewhat annoyed with us because we are reflecting the views of people outside the House when we talk about the rates for the survivor's pension which effectively is being <Col N="1578" /> devalued.  That raises the question of whether the Minister will introduce a Social Welfare (No. 3) Bill later in the year if the rate of inflation significantly exceeds that anticipated.  It would have been safer if the Government had given at least a 3 per cent increase as that rate would have ensured that benefits accruing to widows and widowers would be higher than the rate of inflation at budget time and its anticipated level.  As far as I am aware that is what has been done in the past.</P>
    <P>The outturn at the end of the year is a different matter.  Things may happen during the year which result in a higher inflation rate than predicated at budget time.  We argue that the Government increased the survivor's pension by 2.5 per cent, the lower rate of inflation predicated at budget time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Our major difference with the Minister is that we know from Government statistics that what we were told at budget time is incorrect.  In mid May a 2.8 per cent inflation rate was recorded.  The food element is that rate is 3.1 per cent, an aspect that greatly affects elderly people and those trying to manage on the survivor's pension. The Minister will have to face up to the fact that he took a decision we believe is wrong.  He said he was increasing the survivor's pension by paying the six weeks in advance.  The pensioners were surprised at the small amount of a lump sum they received and now they are back on the basic rate which is totally inadequate as it is not in <Col N="1579" /> line with the rate of inflation.  It is unfortunate that the Minister and the Government chose to cut back in this area in a good year when money was available.</P>
      <P>We query the manner in which inflation is considered in the Minister's calculations.  Calculations should be made in a manner that ensures we have the best possible estimate, particularly in terms of the next ten years.  We will be happy if the Minister can assure us that it will be a reasonable cost so that we can be confident that what we are doing is not only right as it is protecting the rights of the first spouse, but it can be well contained in the costings.</P>
      <P>We also believe that the manner in which the rates are being treated this year is wrong.  As Deputy Wallace said, people throughout the country have found that they are getting very low increases at a time when inflation is demanding more in terms of outgoings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am becoming increasingly concerned by the Minister's comments on the Bill, particularly this section.  He said 90 per cent of the cost arises under the section.  In reply to Deputy Callely he said we are discussing four year old statistics from the Central Statistics Office in terms of the 55,000 people who were separated four years ago.  The Minister said that it cannot be assumed that a former spouse will not remarry and he has obviously taken that into account in the minimal cost he is applying to the Bill.  However, it cannot be assumed that a former spouse will remarry.  That relates to an earlier point regarding the words &ldquo;a party&rdquo;.  The more we debate the section the more I am concerned about those words. Deputy Keogh suggested that the words &ldquo;a party&rdquo; should read &ldquo;parties to marriages&rdquo;. This matter is all the more important if the Minister agrees that it cannot be assumed that a former spouse will remarry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a man divorces his former spouse and remarries and his spouse does not remarry, I presume she will be entitled <Col N="1580" /> to a survivor's pension.  If her former spouse divorces his second spouse and remarries, his second spouse may not remarry.  In that context the words &ldquo;a party&rdquo; does not describe that man's first and second spouses.  It is essential then to change the term &ldquo;a party&rdquo; to &ldquo;parties to marriages that have been dissolved&rdquo; otherwise we are assuming that one or both of those people will remarry and we cannot make that assumption.  We must assume there is a strong possibility that both those women will not remarry and both will be entitled to a survivor's pension.  On that basis it appears essential that the term &ldquo;a party&rdquo; should be changed to &ldquo;parties to marriages that have been dissolved&rdquo; to ensure we recognise both situations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this section has been interesting because it has teased out the issue.  When replying to the earlier part of the debate the Minister was at pains to point out that the question of costing here is minimal and indicated that it would still be minimal if they are 50 per cent out.  It is important to be clear about the costings. As the Minister rightly said we are not referring to a major proportion of the social welfare budget, but it is important in the context of the divorce debate to be as precise as possible regarding costings. It is valid to raise queries about statistics and to raise the matter of remarriage.  As Deputy Wallace said, we must recognise that people may divorce more than once and in this regard to a great extent we are into the realm of speculation.  Where possible it is essential to tie down costings and to be as exact as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Minister to reconsider the use of the term &ldquo;party&rdquo; on Report Stage.  If the bulk of the costings are to be expended on the provisions of this section, the Minister must be as precise as possible and use the best available statistics.  If costings are based on old figures, people will not be reassured. Are the costings based on the rates of increase this year or is there provision for a further increase next year?  Having <Col N="1581" /> regard to the criticism levelled at the Minister about this year's increases, how valid are the costings he has indicated?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>If I gave an estimated figure for separations, I would be accused of not using CSO statistics. Even though they are 1991 CSO statistics, I used them because of their validity. We can extrapolate from that and try to argue that a certain number of people are currently separated, but even if the figure is 50 per cent more than we indicated, we are not talking about a great deal of money.  I am not critical of Deputies for raising the question of costings, but Fianna Fáil Deputies have used this debate to score cheap political points about this year's budget figures. This is far too serious an issue to become embroiled in that type of debate and argy bargy across the floor.</P>
      <P>In regard to the capacity of the State, through taxpayers and the social insurance fund, to support pensioners and widows in the future, the estimated costings indicate that the burden will be extremely limited.  I must again draw attention to the fact that we are already supporting a significant number of separated people through deserted wife's benefit and lone parent's allowance.  A married person whose spouse dies is entitled to a contributory or non-contributory widow's or widower's pension. The Bill extends that provision to a divorced person on the death of a spouse. If one of the spouses remarries the other may then qualify for a contributory or non-contibutory pension.  We are talking about a relatively low cost in the context of the global expenditure of the Department.  We currently spend £630 million on payments to widows, widowers, deserted wives and lone parents and the estimated cost under this section will be approximately £1 million in the first five years.  People who are separated or become separated or divorced should not be concerned about losing their social welfare entitlements. This Bill guarantees that right and the cost involved will be minimal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1582" /> Deputies Wallace and Keogh stated that line nine of section 3 should refer to the plural, but I do not consider that necessary.  Part III of the Interpretation Act, 1937 states:</P>
    <P>The following provisions shall apply and have effect in relation to the construction of every Act of the Oireachtas and of every instrument made wholly or partly under any such Act, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) Singular and plural.  Every word importing the singular shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as if it also imported the plural, and every word importing the plural shall, unless the contrary intention appears, be construed as if it also imported the singular;</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Deputies' concerns are groundless.  In any case, in practice the married couple would have divorced and the spouse would qualify for a widow's or widower's pension because they were married.  The right to such a pension under current social welfare legislation is not being interfered with. This Bill guarantees that if one of the spouses remarries, in the event of the death of the first spouse, the second spouse would also qualify for a widow's or widower's pension.  We are adding another right and providing for a multiple widow's or widower's pension based on either contributions or means. The Interpretation Act, 1937 clarifies the concerns the Deputies expressed about this matter being referred to in the singular.  There is no genuine cause for concern in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not concerned about the second spouse, I am concerned about cases involving a third spouse.  The Bill provides for an existing or former spouse, but does not provide for a previous former spouse and this is where the plural is important.</P>

      <P>It may be clarified in this way, the section does not <Col N="1583" /> attempt to limit its application to one, two, three, four or five; it says &ldquo;a party to a marriage&rdquo; and does not impose any limitation on its application.  If a person had married and then divorced, in the event of death their former spouse would qualify for a widow's or widower's pension as the case may be.  If that person had married a second time the surviving spouse would be &ldquo;a party to a marriage&rdquo; and, therefore, would qualify.  Even after the death of a person who had married for the third time nonetheless a valid marriage would exist and the surviving spouse would be deemed to have been &ldquo;a party to a marriage&rdquo;. Therefore, the Deputy's fear in this respect is groundless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be happy to accept the advice of the parliamentary draftsman on this when the difficulty to which I referred is catered for.</P>
      <P>In explaining this provision the Minister reverted to the 90 per cent of the £1 million to be applied to the provisions of this section.  In doing so he referred to the question posed by Deputy Keogh, to the effect that many of the people for whom he is costing under the provisions of this section are already in receipt of a deserted wife's or lone parent's allowance.  I do not know if that is facing reality.  We must learn from the experiences of other countries, such as the United Kingdom and the United States of America where divorce was introduced when one is led to the definitive conclusion that marriages may not remain intact after the successful passage of a referendum on divorce. This means one must allow for an increased incidence of marital breakdown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his thinking on funding the provisions of this Bill the Minister is assuming that all these women are at present in receipt of a deserted wife's or lone parent's allowance, that, therefore, he need worry only about surviving spouses and that 90 per cent only of the relevant cost relates to this section.  That concerns me because, in his costings, the <Col N="1584" /> Minister does not appear to have allowed for reality if a referendum on divorce is passed.  Is the Minister saying that 90 per cent of the costing relates to those widows, that he is at present of the opinion that the topping-up of the deserted wife's allowance and lone parent's allowance will be minimal, assuming that such applicants' marriages would already have broken down before the introduction of divorce here? The Minister appears to say that 10 per cent only of the £1 million relates to deserted wives, lone parents and all the other categories but that does not withstand such analysis.</P>
    <P>It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify that because he said that the bulk of the £1 million costing over the next five years will relate to a survivor's pension under this section and, when responding further, said that in his estimation the bulk of the cost would be 90 per cent.  If 90 per cent of £1 million relates to the provisions of this section then the remaining 10 per cent over those same years must relate to the remaining sections.  I assume that is the point the Minister was making.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>My general point, which relates as much to the overall debate on divorce as to this Bill, although it is pertinent to it, is that it would be a mistake to look merely to the United Kingdom and United States of America to see how divorce and marital breakdown developed there and predict that that is what will happen here.  When one examined the opposition in other European countries with a similar religious background or ethos to ours, which is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, the trends are not similar to those in the United Kingdom and USA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my understanding that when divorce was introduced in Spain, there was a huge backlog of separated couples &mdash; as there was no divorce when General Franco ran the country on behalf of the Roman Caholic Church &mdash; but on the cessation of his dictatorship the <Col N="1585" /> Spanish Government introduced divorce legislation, when there was a huge take-up by couples who had separated. It is also my understanding that there has been a tapering off in the rate of divorce there in recent years.</P>
    <P>The point I am making is that it is a mistake to examine statistics in relation to the United Kingdom and USA only because, in the case of divorce, one is dealing as much with peoples' religious convictions as with marital problems. Therefore, it would be a mistake to extrapolate United Kingdom and USA statistics and compare them with the situation here because I do not believe they are comparable.</P>
    <P>That was why I made the point earlier on the assumptions we are making of the numbers of people likely to divorce here following separation, who are likely to remarry and the numbers who will survive their husbands.  There is a question mark over the numbers likely to remarry given our religious ethos &mdash; I may be wrong &mdash; but I am doubtful that the incidence will be as high as in the figures complied for Members.  I wanted to make the point before dealing with the substantive issue of cost.</P>
    <P>The Census of Population 1991, volume 2, indicated that the number of married persons in Ireland had increased by 2 per cent in the five years between 1986 and 1991 and, in the same period, the number of separated persons increased by 48,000 to 55,143.  We should bear in mind that that figure comprises individuals, not separated couples &mdash; one must presume that would represent approximately 27,000 couples.  Of those persons categorised as separated in 1991 43 per cent were deserted, 24 per cent were living apart informally, 11 per cent had had annulments and 20 per cent were legally separated. One third only of those living apart from their spouses had been either legally separated, divorced or had had their marriages annulled.</P>
    <P>I have a table which gives a breakdown of separated population by gender in the years between 1986 and 1991 showing that most of the increases in <Col N="1586" /> the numbers of separated persons between 1986 and 1991 took place within the deserted and legally separated categories.  This table also shows that there were in excess of 50 per cent more separated females than separated males both in 1986 and 1991.  For example, there were 2,584 deserted males in 1986 and 6,781 in 1991.  There were 9,038 deserted females in 1986 and 16,904 in 1991.  I do not know if the Deputy wants all the statistics but the number of marriages annulled for males in 1986 was 443 and 449 in 1991.  The figure for females is 540 in 1986 and 722 in 1991.  The number of males legally separated is 3,229 in 1986 and 5,178 in 1991.  The number of females legally separated in 1986 is 3,888 and in 1991 it is 5,974.  In regard to others separated, the figure for males for 1986 is 6,090 and 5,787 in 1991.  For females the figure is 6,972 for 1986 and 7,195 for 1991.  In the category of persons divorced in another country, the figure for males is 2,222 for 1986 and 3,105 for 1991.  The figure for females is 2,169 in 1986 and 2,998 in 1991.  Over one-third of separated persons were aged between 34 and 44 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try to get a copy of the figures for the Deputy.  A further quarter of separated persons were in the age group of 45 to 54 years. There were 21,350 separated males and 33,793 separated females equivalent to 3.1 per cent and 4.8 per cent respectively of the corresponding total of married males and females, excluding widowed persons.  Presumably a large proportion of the separated people not accounted for are domiciled abroad.  In the same period, the marriage rate per thousand of the population had dropped from 5.2 to 4.8 per cent while the proportion of births outside marriage had risen steadily and now accounts for 18 per cent of all births.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the take up of, say, widows' entitlements, we must take into <Col N="1587" /> account the extent to which women will increasingly become part of the labour force and qualify in their own right for various entitlements.  As Deputy Woods admits, it is extremely difficult to be precise about the figures.  We cannot be absolutely certain of the costs in five or ten years time but we have indicated what we see as the most likely cost over the next five and ten years.  Even if our estimates of the numbers currently separated are out by 50 per cent, we are still only talking about the difference between £1 million and £1.5 million in year five.  In the global context of our total costs, we are only talking about 0.02 per cent of the total social welfare expenditure this year.  The Deputy will see that is not a burden which the taxpayer, Deputies in this House or people outside it who may be separated and who may be concerned that their former spouse might divorce them, will have to sustain.  Because of the negligible cost involved, there is no question but that the State will be able to sustain the costs involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree this will not be a burden on the State.  I want to refer to the specifics of the figures the Minister has given us because the more we tease them out, the more concerned I become about them.  I want to do a simple sum for the Minister and I would like him to tell me if he agrees with it. The Minister told us that £1 million would be made available over five years, 90 per cent of which would go towards the survivors' pensions.  Therefore, 10 per cent will go towards the lone parent's and deserted wife's benefit. Obviously, 10 per cent of £1 million is £100,000.  If one were to divide £100,000 by five, the figure is £20,000 per annum.  A lone parent with one child receives approximately £70 per week.  In regard to that £20,000, we are talking about providing additional benefit for four people at most, or five people if there is a child involved, per annum.  Is it correct to say that if divorce was introduced here, we are only talking <Col N="1588" /> about an additional four or five people per annum in terms of lone parent's and deserted wife's benefit?  The figures do not stand up.  If a person is receiving approximately £100 per week, that amounts to £5,200 per year.  Multiply that by four and the figure is £20,000 but the Minister is saying it will cost £100,000 over five years.  The Minister stated that 90 per cent of the £100,000 over five years will go towards the survivors' pensions, therefore, 10 per cent will go towards the other areas.  When we get down to the nuts and bolts of the argument and the fact that we are talking about a person in receipt of £70 or £100 per week, it is obvious that the Minister's figures do not stand up.  The Minister said there would not be any burden on the State, and none of us want that, but we have to be realistic because if we are not realistic in this House, the public will not be slow to give us their assessment of the costs involved.  We must try to be fair in this regard but it is wrong of the Minister to say the cost on the State will be negligible.  Can the Minister give me any assistance in regard to the figures?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been following this debate both within the Chamber and from my office and there are certain aspects of it about which I am concerned. It is legitimate for the Opposition to look for costings of any proposal, particularly a social welfare proposal, but one cannot have one's cake and eat it.  In 1986, I recall Deputy Woods, who is participating vigorously in this morning's debate, warning people not to vote for divorce because they would lose their social welfare rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members cannot validly criticise the Minister now extending social welfare rights which will protect divorced spouses.  Whereas Members are entitled to raise financial queries, it is becoming something of a camouflage in the debate on this section.  In the context of the principal issues the legislation seeks to deal with, the Bill should have preceded the 1986 divorce referendum and should <Col N="1589" /> have been passed ten years ago.  If that legislation had been on the Statute Book, unfounded fears would not have been created at that time.  It was suggested then that if the referendum was successful deserted wives would have voted away their social welfare rights. This Bill seeks to protect those rights.</P>
    <P>Much of the discussion on the Bill is based on the fact that it is supposed to lay the foundation to protect people's social welfare rights in the event that the divorce referendum will be successful. However, the Bill does more than that, it fills a lacuna that should have been filled many years ago.  It seeks to ensure if someone gets divorced outside this State and we recognise that divorce in this State, the person's social welfare rights will be protected.  Implicit in a number of sections is the recognition not simply of the validity of a divorce granted in this State but the recognition of a foreign decree of divorce.  The Minister gave statistics on the numbers of people in this country who are parties to foreign decrees of divorce.  This raises two problems.  Even if the divorce referendum was not imminent, this legislation would be necessary to protect the position of the deserted wife whose husband sets up domicile in the United Kingdom, divorces her there and whose divorce we recognise.  Under our social welfare legislation that wife ceases to be a spouse and can be disentitled from a variety of allowances and benefits that she would otherwise obtain if she had remained a spouse.  In the context of deserted wife's allowance and benefits, that has been a difficulty for some years. We have tried to overcome some of those difficulties administratively in dealing with deserted wife's allowance and benefits but not in the context of widow's pension and other areas.</P>
    <P>Recently there was a very lengthy and tortuous court case in the High Court in which there was a 99 page judgment on whether a person was entitled to a widow's pension.  It arose because the Department in its wisdom decided not to recognise the divorce decree granted in England.  In this case following a <Col N="1590" /> decree of divorce granted in England, the woman remarried and lived in Ireland with her second husband.  When he died the Department refused to recognise the validity of her divorce and second marriage.  She then had to involve herself in extremely expensive and lengthy High Court proceedings to assert her right to the widow's pension. Ultimately she was successful.  This is already a problem we have not properly addressed.  What is needed in this Bill is a simple procedure when the Department of Social Welfare cannot work out whether to recognise a foreign divorce whereby it seeks judicial clarification that does not involve the State and an old age pensioner or a deserted spouse in lengthy and costly litigation.  When the adoption board runs into similar difficulties it can state a case to the High Court &mdash; a simple and inexpensive procedure &mdash; to clarify a legal issue to determine a matter of eligibility.</P>
    <P>There is a need to amend this legislation to provide where a dispute arises as to the recognition or validity of a divorce, that the Department of Social Welfare can state a case to the High Court for a determination as to whether a divorce is recognised and remarriage is recognised.  Those who are aware of how the court works would know that a case stated is a very simple procedure and someone can respond to it in a matter of weeks rather than months or years.  It is not a lengthy or expensive High Court procedure and it should be part of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the principle of this Bill, but I want to see it work logically. Let us suppose in the case to which I just referred things had happened the other way round and the wife had died after this legislation had come into force, and let us assume she had made a number of relevant social welfare contributions and that her first husband in England had not remarried.  Have we addressed the issue of the extra territorial effect of the Bill?  Could we have created a situation where, say, a couple, couples, who did not contribute to the <Col N="1591" /> social welfare system, who were originally domiciled in a foreign state, who obtained their divorce there and one of whom returns and marries someone in this State and establishes residence here, can, on the death of a spouse, claim a widow or widower's pension, occupational payment or any other payments that arise by way of this legislation? The extra territorial issue has a relevance to costings to some extent. We are not talking about large numbers but in addressing an issue that must be addressed I do not believe we should create that type of anomaly.  If this aspect has not been considered I ask the Minister to consider it before Report Stage.</P>
    <P>My next point is probably more relevant to another aspect of matters here. We are trying to provide for equality between husbands and wives in the context of entitlement to widow's or widower's pension when a spouse dies.  I fail to understand why, in the context of deserted wife's benefit, we continue to discriminate against deserted husbands, particularly those taking care of young children.  The Minister gave us a statistic that there were 6,000 deserted husbands in this State in 1991.  The figure has probably increased now.  In my experience in my work in the area of marriage breakdown, there are more husbands in situations of marriage breakdown who have custody of and are caring for children than there were during the 1980s. There is a distinct shift in that area. Where the social insurance contributions have been paid, a deserted wife with two children and a deserted husband with two children should be treated equally under our social welfare code.  There is no reason to provide a benefit to the wife, which I acknowledge should be paid, and not provide it to the husband whose eligibility criteria have been complied with and who is operating as a single parent, often trying to run a home and hold down a job at the same time in order to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>The discrimination within our social <Col N="1592" /> welfare code in this area is contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights and will ultimately be so found. We have already faced major difficulty in regard to social welfare arrears arising out of what happened between 1986 and 1988.  In that, Sir, I should declare an interest, because it was my own law firm that brought the Cotter and McDermott case which sought to ensure that husbands and wives were treated equally under the social welfare code and which, through the judicial system, ensured change in that area.  I sounded a warning in this House many years ago about that issue but no one took me seriously.  I am raising it today.  I am saying that in all equity and humanity, leaving aside legal rights, all children left in the care of a deserted parent, whether husband or wife, have the same needs. The single parent, whether husband or wife, incurs the same expense in running a home when taking care of children. There is no reason to continue to maintain a discrimination against husbands within our legal system, particularly in the run up to a divorce referendum.</P>
    <P>It was politically correct in the early 1980s to favour wives, and there are many organisations seeking to redress the inequality in our laws relating to wives.  We have inbuilt inequalities arising out of that period which detrimentally impact on men, on husbands, and on families constituted of husband and children where the husband has been deserted.  I appeal to the Minister not to miss this opportunity to correct this issue.  If he does not he is creating an injustice, but he is also laying the foundation for another social welfare problem of arrears that some future Government will have to confront as a result of judgments emerging out of Europe if not out of our own Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>There was a judgement in this area at some stage in the High Court &mdash; and I declare my interest &mdash; which found against the husband.  However, from my personal knowledge of that case, it is one that should have been appealed and, I believe, would have produced a different decision if not at Supreme <Col N="1593" /> Court level then at a higher level, had the matter been taken further.  It could not be done because the husband who had the burden of looking after his children died before the High Court delivered its initial judgment in those proceedings. In all justice and equity and in the context of this legislation, in preparing the ground for the divorce referendum let us recognise the reality of the problems of marriage breakdown for all families whether composed of mothers and children or fathers and children, and let us provide for true equality.  If we fail to do this, we are sowing the seeds of further problems and financial burdens for this State in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with the points raised by Deputy Shatter let me finally deal with the issue of costs and the confusion that has arisen about the estimates we have made.  We are not arguing that £1 million is the cost of marital breakdown or the support that would be required for people who are deserted or separated.  We are already providing funds under various schemes for situations of marital breakdown. What we are providing for here is the additional costs of providing for a second widow's or widower's pension in circumstances where a former spouse has remarried and dies and both surviving spouses, the former spouse and the existing spouse, qualify for a pension on a contributory or non-contributory basis &mdash; a non-contributory pension would obviously be means-tested.  Bearing that in mind, we are already providing certain supports under the existing provisions of the social welfare code.  These supports are provided primarily through the lone parent's allowance and deserted wife's benefit and allowance schemes.  It is important to realise that under the existing provisions a man or woman who is separated from their spouse can qualify for survivor's pension on the death of their spouse.  The fact of divorce does not impinge on that if neither remarries, even though they may have been separated for many years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1594" /> This Bill ensures that a divorced person whose former spouse dies will not lose entitlement to a survivor's pension. This does not give rise to any additional cost as the person would have qualified for pension in any event if they had not become divorced.  Some additional costs will arise, however, on the death of a divorced person who remarries and where his or her spouse and former spouse qualify for a pension.  The Bill also provides that a deserted wife may continue to be regarded as deserted for the purposes of the deserted wife's benefit and allowance schemes.  These provisions will not give rise to any additional costs as under the present arrangements divorce in itself does not affect entitlement to these payments.  It was considered necessary, however, to include explicit provision in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Similarly a divorced person can qualify for lone parent's allowance under the present arrangements.  They can do so on the basis of being an unmarried parent, but under the provisions of the Bill they will be recognised under the social welfare code as a divorced person.  It is simply a question of recognising them as belonging to one category rather than another.</P>
    <P>The Bill will also enable a divorced person on low pay who is supporting his or her former spouse to qualify for family income supplement.  In practice, however, it is extremely unlikely that a person on low pay would be in a position financially to maintain two households. The former household would, in any event, qualify for support if its income is below a certain level.  It will be evident, therefore, that for these reasons the additional costs arising from this Bill will be relatively low.  Hence the estimated costs of £1 million by year five following the introduction of divorce and about £2 million by year ten. While £1 million is a substantial sum it must be put into perspective in terms of representing 2 per cent of overall social welfare expenditure, which this year will amount to £4.2 billion.  That is after five years.  The costs are insignificant and it <Col N="1595" /> is important to distinguish between providing for social welfare benefits in circumstances of divorce and the cost to the State in social welfare terms of marital breakdown.  The grey area is trying to predict the rate of marital breakdown. Whether cases of marital breakdown will end in divorce is a matter of judgment.  I have expressed my reservations on that.  Additional costs will only arise in cases of divorce and will be primarily related to survivor's pension and widower's pension.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter raised the issue of deserted husbands.  The principal involved in the case he referred to was a personal friend of mine.  Although he died in the meantime I was very sad when the judgment found against him.  I will introduce a social welfare (No. 3) Bill in the autumn to provide for a unified lone parent's allowance.  It will apply to all parents, male or female, and will relate to the number of children the parent is caring for and to the parent's financial circumstances.  That Bill will eliminate the distinction between supporting deserted wives and deserted husbands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>That will not eliminate the distinction in relation to benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>It will provide for support to be given to a person caring for children whether the person is separated, divorced or deserted and will eliminate the concept of having to prove desertion in order to qualify.  It will be necessary to show that one is living alone and supporting children.  Irrespective of whether one is male or female, one will qualify on that basis for social welfare support.</P>
      <P>As regards judicial determination of cases, at present the chief appeals officer can refer a question of law to the High Court.  I am not sure how often this is done but I am willing to look at the issue raised by the Deputy and consider whether it is necessary to include it in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I accept that we are talking about additional costs.  Where divorce becomes available there will be an increase in marital breakdown, but it is difficult to determine the rate of increase.  The Minister and the Department assume that if the referendum on divorce is passed the only extra cost in terms of deserted wife's allowance and lone parent's allowance will be £20,000 per annum.  He only expects four or five people to be caught in the second payment. I do not understand how the Minister estimates that the number will be so low.  I am concerned that the Department's figures are way off the mark.  I wish that what the Minister said about the country's religious ethos were true and that divorce would have no effect on marriages, but we must be practical and realistic.  Divorce will affect the rate of marital breakdown.  It is not realistic for us, in the cosiness of the Dáil Chamber, to say it will cost £20,000 per annum and that only four or five people will be involved.  I need to be satisfied on this point.  I am sure I represent many others who ask the same question.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <P>The figures given by the Central Statistics Office indicate that there is significant marital breakdown in this State.  A significant number of unmarried people are in relationships. There is a decline in the marriage rate and an increase in the number of children born to unmarried parents. There is a significant change in family structures in Irish society.  It is a mistake to presume that the introduction of divorce will result in increased marital <Col N="1597" /> breakdown.  The availability of an option to end a marriage does not encourage people to end it.  Marriages end for many reasons &mdash; the love in a marriage might die, one of the partners might be so violent that it is necessary to end the marriage, men and women are deserted by their spouses, people obtain foreign divorces, etc.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is arguing that I am ignoring the fact that divorce will lead to an increase in marital breakdown.  I do not accept that thesis.  If we were the first country to introduce divorce the case could be proven one way or the other but we have not had divorce in this State since 1937 when the Constitution was introduced &mdash; we had divorce before then &mdash; and we have still had marital breakdown.  Over the past 20 years or so the State has supported people who have found themselves in those circumstances.</P>
      <P>I want to give an example to support the point I am making.  The number of recipients of deserted wife's benefit increased from 5,165 in 1985 to 13,662 in 1994.  There are probably thousands of people whose marriages have broken down who do not come within the social welfare net and these figures relate only to the number on the books of the Department of Social Welfare.  There has been a very significant increase in the level of marriage breakdown since 1985 and it would be a mistake to argue that the legal procedure for regularising desertions and separations will cause marriage breakdown.  This is not a logical argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section seeks to preserve the right to a pension of a person whose former spouse remarried and subsequently died and of the second spouse.  The Department of Social Welfare estimates that this additional support or guarantee will cost £1 million in the fifth year and £2 million in the tenth year.  I have already set out the basis on which that estimate has been constructed.  It is based on the CSO 1991 figure of 55,000 separated people and the assumption that 75 per cent of those may seek a divorce, that approximately 50 per cent <Col N="1598" /> of divorced people will remarry and that 80 per cent of the women involved will survive their spouses.  These assumptions are reasonable and even if they are 50 per cent off and there are 75,000 separated people one is talking about the difference between £1 million and £1.5 million in year five: one is still talking of thousands of pounds, not millions of pounds.  As a proportion of the total Social Welfare Estimate, this is still a tiny fraction.  I presume the Deputies are mainly concerned about our capacity to support widows.  There is no reason to worry about our capacity to support them because the indications are that the cost of what we are proposing is minimal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that we are mainly concerned about the capacity of the Department to support these people.  Our main concern is that we are debating a Bill which proposes many changes in advance of a referendum on a very important issue.  At the time of the 1986 referendum people were not satisfied that the legislation was clear or that all the necessary legislation would be put in place after the referendum.  As the Minister for Equality and Law Reform has said, the legislation must be clear so that people know what they are voting for.  It is in this context that I have raised these questions.  If the legislation is not clear people will not be happy and may vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; in the referendum.</P>
      <P>I accept the points made by the Minister but divorce will lead to a change in culture.  When young people of 18 years get married in Ireland they know that marriage is for life.  I would like to think that there will be no increase in the number of marriage breakdowns after the introduction of divorce.  However, if the referendum is passed young people whose marriages are not working out will know they can get a divorce.  If we are realistic we must accept that this change in culture will lead to more than four or five extra cases of marriage breakdown per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Women and children cannot be left <Col N="1599" /> without support and we will have to find some way of paying for these changes. My main concern as a Deputy is to ensure that we enact legislation which will stand up so that we are in a position to say we have investigated the matters thoroughly and the Minister and his Department have given us realistic figures. In terms of lone parents and deserted wives, if divorce is introduced people will not accept that we are talking about an extra four or five cases per annum.</P>

      <P>It is unhelpful of Deputy Wallace to continually refer to only four or five cases per annum.  I have never used that figure.  It is a figure that Deputy Wallace has constructed out of a misunderstanding of how the legislation will work and about the fact that we are already providing for people who are deserted or separated and who cannot support themselves or who because of contributions by themselves or their former spouse we are obliged to provide support.  The idea of four or five new cases per year is a figment of Deputy Wallace's imagination and has no bearing in reality.  I have already indicated that the number of recipients of deserted wife's benefit has increased from 5,165 in 1985 to 13,662 in 1994. There is no point in explaining this if nobody on the Opposition is listening.</P>

      <P>That is half the battle.  The costs of marital breakdown are already being met by the State and the social insurance fund under existing provisions of the social welfare code. These supports are provided primarily through lone parent's allowance and deserted wife's benefit and allowance schemes.  These benefits &mdash; lone parent's allowance schemes and deserted wife's benefit and so on &mdash; will be paid and will become due regardless of whether there is divorce.  We are talking about the additional costs that arise in relation to claimants whose spouse divorced, died or deserted or were in receipt of a family income supplement.</P>

      <P>The primary cost arises in relation to survivor's pensions because we are already providing for lone parent's and deserted wife's allowances in the social welfare code.  In the normal course on a year on year basis the Department of Social Welfare, in tandem with the Department of Finance, will predict for the coming year how many lone parent's or deserted wife's allowances will be paid that year. In the next few months I will examine how much we might expect to pay in deserted wife's allowances and when we introduce the unified lone parent's allowance, how many claimants we expect will come on to our books in 1996.  We have to make those estimates every year and we do so on the basis of the numbers of the previous years.  It is an annual projection, separate from this Bill and deals with the broad general support which the State provides to people rearing children on their own. The unified lone parent's allowance, when introduced, will go to a person regardless of whether they are divorced, separated, deserted or unmarried and rearing children.  They will receive this support from the Department of Social Welfare provided their means are within certain limits.</P>

      <Col N="1602" /> The question of the cost of this Bill does not arise in terms of the numbers of people who will become deserted or divorced but only in relation to where a person qualifies because their former spouse remarries.  It guarantees that the surviving spouse and the former spouse &mdash; if he or she survives them &mdash; will qualify for a widow's contributory or non-contributory pension.  That is where the bulk of the cost will arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>In January I was appointed chairperson of the Government committee on the commemoration of the Great Famine of 1798 replacing my predecessor, Deputy Tom Kitt.  Since then the committee and I have met over a dozen times and we have complied a varied and significant programme.</P>
      <P>Last month I announced that the Government is financing a major historical research project which is being undertaken by a number of eminent historians from both UCD and TCD.  The other parts of the programme are finalised and I intend to announce them shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1603" /> The Government's programme will include a number of co-funded projects. These will be in addition to the many welcome community and private initiatives being undertaken throughout the country and abroad.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for the work she has done on the committee.  Will she outline briefly the proposals she intends to announce shortly?  Will she consider building into the programme some of the better community activities throughout the country bearing in mind that Irish communities throughout the world have a tremendous interest in this matter?  I am sure the Minister of State has received far more correspondence than I have but it would be helpful if Members of the House could send to individuals and organisations who intend to travel to commemorate the Great Famine the official brochure rather than sketchy details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope to be in a position next week to announce the details of the Government's programme.  I will extend an invitation to Deputy Tom Kitt to join us on that occasion.  I hope he will then be in a position to brief the Deputy in detail on the specific projects to be included.</P>
      <P>The committee and the Government are conscious of the need for sensitivity in selecting commemorative events.  We must have respect for the dead in commemorating the most traumatic event in modern Irish history.  We will not spend money lavishly on any one event.  If money is to be spent it should be directed at those locations in the modern world where there is famine. The best way to commemorate those who died from starvation and those who had to leave our shores is to try to prevent famine in specific parts of the world.  This is the type of event for which the Government will provide sponsorship as part of the commemorative programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will also fund scholarships, <Col N="1604" /> research and education programmes to improve our knowledge of what happened in the poor law union areas which are well documented.  Ecumenical services and a wide variety of other events will also be held.  I will be delighted to let the Deputy have full details by the middle of next week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's comment that money will be provided to fund research and education programmes.  That is appropriate. We should not try to be subtle in commemorating the Great Famine, an important event in our history.  We should remind the modern world of what happened here 150 years ago.  That should not cause offence to anyone.  I would not like us to be too soft in selecting some of the events for inclusion in the programme.</P>
      <P>The Great Famine is commemorated in folklore and local history.  It has also been commemorated by walks and other events organised down through the years.  People from the United States and elsewhere have commemorated the Great Famine, sad though the event was, and want to commemorate it in their homeland.  We have an obligation to them to commemorate it so that the world is made aware of what happened during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with the Deputy.  I have not been and will not be soft in relation to the commemoration of the Great Famine and neither should the Deputy.  Perhaps he is taking a line from comments made in the media recently, particularly the British media, about how the Government may commemorate the Great Famine.  None of the commentators bothered to contact me.  I would have been delighted, as chairperson of the Government's committee, to discuss the matter with them. Given the level of interest I imagine I will be busy during the next few weeks explaining the programme.  I will be delighted to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No Government should or would attempt to sanitise the facts surrounding <Col N="1605" /> the Great Famine which had an enormous impact in the sense that, tragically, many people had to leave our shores during the period 1845-52.  For many years those who could not leave remained destitute as a result of poverty and hunger.  I suspect the Deputy would agree that it is the maturity and the security of the relationship between the two islands which allows us to face the facts honestly and openly.  That is what the peace process and the process of reconciliation is all about.  It is only by facing the trauma caused by this immense tragedy honestly and openly in seeking genuine understanding that we can heal some of the hurt caused throughout Irish history.</P>
    <P>Despite the pain and its complexity, we must not repress our history.  Too many problems during the years in the Anglo-Irish relationship have derived from mutual ignorance or selective versions of history.  The maturity of the relationship allows us to face the facts and tell the truth.  That is what the Government intends to do.  After all, the famine was not just an Irish event, it was just as much a British event.  Together we will face up to what happened and move forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled the question to provide support to the Minister of State in ensuring that what was written was correct.  I was not aware of what was to be included in the programme when I read some of the articles.  I urge the Minister of State to present the programme, which I will support, as quickly as possible.  There is a need to educate the British public about what happened here 150 years ago.  This would be helpful in terms of their view of the peace process.  The programme may also be of help to people on this island who are not aware of what happened.  I have no difficulty about giving people the hard facts of the last 25 or 75 years.  All these matters should be in the open.  I resent and reject the views of people who believe that we should be apologists for what happened and, as stated in three different articles, &ldquo;go soft on the issue&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1606" /> I express the support of this side of the House for the commemoration, which will not be a celebration because we have nothing to celebrate.  Our history is a treasure and we must use this opportunity to put it to the world because it will help in understanding famine and what famine can do to various parts of the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his supportive comments.  Since I became Minister of State four months ago a dozen or so full committee meetings and four or five sub-committee meetings have been completed and I hope to announce the programme of events early next week.  I wish to make it clear that the Government will start its programme of commemorative events in Fermanagh in late August this year to commemorate the outbreak of blight in the field.  The famine and blight were not a respecter of geography, and the northern part of this island, and indeed Scotland, were affected in the same way as the southern part.  I hope the Deputy and his colleagues will be in a position to join us for many of the events.  I think they will approve fully of the programme of commemorative events that will be outlined.</P>
      <P>On the interpretation by the media of a Government programme, ill-informed comments have been made because the media does not yet know what the Government programme is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree it was generally our colleagues in the British media who got it wrong, even though there have been many letters to editors and much interest in the media about the Government's intentions in this regard.  The media in Britain appears to be locked into what I would call a tired old revisionist debate, but that ended with <Col N="1607" /> the ceasefire.  In the last couple of years 50 books have been written about the famine and historical debate has been conducted in a most friendly manner between the two islands.  Let us put that behind us, look at the facts and tell the truth.  Nothing can be more helpful in the process of reconciliation than to face the facts openly, recognise both traditions and move forward from there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the issue I wished to raise, the all-Ireland aspect of the famine which predates partitioning of this island.  Will she outline the projects that have an all-Ireland aspect?  What negotiations has she had with officials on the other side of the Border in this respect?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be projects north of the Border as well as many south of the Border.  I have been in contact with officials at various levels about these projects.  The commemorative events will commence in Fermanagh on 28 or 29 August &mdash; I speak from the top of my head.  In conjunction with the local authorities we will hold a full day's events there to commemorate the outbreak of blight in the field.  I will be in a position next week to give further details on the matter.  It would not be in order for me to pre-empt the press release; otherwise there would be no point in holding a press conference.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>As a person who set up the committee I wish the Minister well. I believe she got it right on this occasion.  I always believed, as did those on the committee, that this issue should <Col N="1608" /> be handled sensitively and realistically. I appreciate that we should await next week's announcement, but will the Minister say when the programme of events will end?  Will she agree there is a tremendous opportunity for a role for schools, Communities on the ground and the Irish abroad?  As a former Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development, I believe there is a need to link this programme with the work of Irish aid workers in the developing world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>It will probably come as little surprise to the Deputy that all the points he made will be well met in the programme.  There will be a major schools project and there will be links with overseas aid workers and with scientific research overseas in terms of research on potato blight.  The Deputy will receive an invitation to the launch of the programme and I hope he will be in a position to join us on that occasion.</P>

    <P>Táim thar a bheith sásta leis an trí Chomhdháil a reachtáileadh cheana féin i Ros Comáin.  Sligeach agus Gaillimh.

Is é mo thuairim gur éirigh go geal leo agus bhain mise ach go háirithe agus gach duine a rinne freastal orthu tairbhe as an eolas agus as na tuairimí a scaipeadh ann.  Reachtáilfear an cheathrú seimineár i mBaile na hInse, Contae an Chláir, 24 Meitheamh.</P>
    <P>Bhí an seimineár a reachtáileadh le déanaí i nGaillimh dírithe go príomha ar na limisteír Ghaeltachta agus chuige sin cuireadh fógraí dátheangacha sna nuachtáin roimh ré.  Ina theannta sin, seoladh cuireadh, i nGaeilge, móide cur síos dátheangach amach chuig na rannpháirtithe.  Cuireadh foirm chlárúcháin amach i mBearla freisin inar ndearnadh tagairt don gcóras aistriúcháin a bheadh le fáil ag an seimineár.</P>
    <P>Is go hiomlán trí mhéan na Gaeilge a reachtáileadh an seimineár, cé gur tugadh oráid amháin trí Bhéarla toisc gur tháinig rannpháirtí amháin ón mBreatain Bheag.  Chuir an córas aistriúcháin go mór leis agus táim an-bhuíoch do Bhord na Gaeilge as an gcóras sin a chur ar fáil dúinn.  Murach an córas sin, ní bheadh deis ag rannpháirtithe nach raibh an Ghaeilge ar a dtoil acu páirt a ghlacadh san seimineár.</P>

      <P>As Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach I have responsibility for co-ordinating the Government's commitment to tackling the issues of western development and finding new and innovative ways of promoting rural renewal.  In that capacity, I have responsibility for a number of initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am responsible for overseeing the activities of the Western Development Partnership Board and for co-ordinating support for the implementation of the <Col N="1612" /> action plan currently in preparation by the board.</P>
    <P>In response to one of the recommendations of the recent report by the National Economic and Social Council entitled, <i>New Approaches to Rural Renewal,</i> I also have the task of overseeing the implementation of a pilot programme for the development of a more integrated approach to the delivery of services particularly in less populated rural areas and to see how this initiative could make a positive contribution to the process of rural renewal.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I recently hosted a number of seminars involving State, semi-State agencies, local development organisations and local community and voluntary groups with the aim of determining the nature and scope of this particular pilot programme.  It is intended that the pilot programme will have been identified and initiated by the autumn.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development, I am responsible for co-ordinating the responses of individual Departments in respect of their areas of particular responsibility on matters affecting the development and improvement of living conditions of our offshore island communities, for example, housing, roads, healthcare, power supply and transport services.  The committee's report is at an advanced stage of preparation.</P>
    <P>I will also be working closely with my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for local development, Deputy Gay Mitchell, with regard to the co-ordination of the work of development agencies and groups in relation to western counties.</P>

Will he outline the Government's policy on decentralisation and towards what new <Col N="1613" /> decentralisation programme on western development is the Government working? Will he accept that the people in Castlerea in County Roscommon are up in arms about the cancellation of the prison building project which generated great hope among the people in the west, one of the reasons it was decided to locate it there?  Will he agree that the Government has no real commitment to rural Ireland, especially to the west and Border counties, even though the Minister of State, a decent Member of the House, is doing his best?  The Government is only paying lip-service to it.  Will the Minister of State agree that if the by-election were taking place in Roscommon next week, the decision would not have been taken to cancel the prison project?  Will he accept that Fine Gael, the only Government party represented in Roscommon, has let the people of the west down once again?</P>

      <P>I appreciate Deputy Ahern is very conscious that a by-election is taking place in Wicklow and wants to make his point.  He is only doing his duty as Leader of his party. His ineptitude has resulted in him being in Opposition.  If he had a determined view on the west and progress here he would have made an attempt at least to visit Mayo to try to win the by-election there, but he failed to appear.  My opinion on the Deputy's view on by-elections and events is based on his performance to date.</P>

    <P>Regarding the west and the western development plan, I am certain that when the Deputy and the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, set up the Western Development Partnership Board they gave directions to those with responsibility for preparing the action plan that decentralisation should be a core issue.

I do not have a negative view of decentralisation as in many cases it has been worthwhile.  In regard to agency overlap, many people do not know where to go to get information. Deputy Nealon's suggestion of a one stop shop with shared overheads and full utilisation of EU funding is worth considering as it would make good sense for people to be able to obtain from one office the necessary information to promote a development. One of the great planks of the last Government was the enormous amount of money it got from the European Union and this Government intends getting the best value from that money.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications</askee>
      <Quest>if he will confirm the long standing decision to extend the DART to Greystones, County Wicklow; and the significance, if any, of the fact that the board of CIE did not specifically sanction the project.</Quest>
      <QRef>[11464/95]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The extension of the DART from Bray to Greystones is a key component of the Dublin Transportation Initiative and was included among the list of priority public transport projects for implementation by CIE under the National Development Plan and the Operational Programme for Transport covering the period 1994-99.  These projects include the Dublin light rail system, upgrading <Col N="1619" /> and extending the DART and other suburban rail services, integrated ticketing arrangements for public transport and the development of quality bus services.</P>
      <P>I should stress that CIE was a major participant in the DTI study which produced the total transport strategy for Dublin.  CIE played a particularly prominent role in helping to devise the public transport element I have just outlined, including the DART extensions. The board of CIE was kept fully informed by management of all these developments and, for example, received and noted a major presentation in May 1994 from CIE management on the DTI proposals including the DART extensions.  The subsequent detailed analysis of the Greystones project was done by CIE and approved by my Department.</P>
      <P>The CIE board at its meeting on 7 June 1995 discussed my announcement of the extension of the DART to Greystones and unanimously endorsed the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister confirming that, after his announcement, the CIE board discussed and approved it?  Is that what he is saying?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>We need to get this matter straight.  Obviously the Deputy is coming from some particular angle and seems to be playing two games.  On the one hand the Fianna Fáil candidate in the constituency of Wicklow, Senator Dick Roche, is claiming credit for the delivery of the DART extension to Greystones while, on the other hand, his party spokesman, Deputy Séamus Brennan, is publicly questioning the desirability of the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me make it quite clear.  The management of CIE was at the frontline and an essential element of the overall Dublin Transportation Initiative process, having been involved <Col N="1620" /> in the continuous discussions, negotiations and cost/benefit analysis conducted.</P>
      <P>In direct response to the Deputy's question I might cite paragraph 7 of a letter dated 19 June 1995 from the CIE group chief executive addressed to the Secretary of my Department which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>The CIE Board, at its meeting on 7 June, 1995, discussed the Minister's announcement of the extension of the DART to Greystones and unanimously endorsed the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>After the Minister's announcement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Brennan asked me to respond and I have just done so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>So the Minister made his announcement and the board of CIE unanimously endorsed it.  The reason I raise this query is that Fianna Fáil does support the extension of the DART to Greystones, for which I was involved in negotiating funds many years ago.  My query is whether that commitment can be relied on.  I was genuinely concerned when I understood the announcement had been made within the ambience of a by-election campaign, leading to the type of headline in this paper I am holding up about election promises.</P>

      <P>I was concerned about its being reannounced in that atmosphere.  Will the Minister say precisely where the relevant funding will emanate from for this extension, when the contracts will be signed for its commencement but, more specifically, the source of its funding?  I do not see any figure earmarked in the Estimates for the calendar year 1995.  Perhaps it has been included in the Structural Funds but neither can I identify any figure earmarked for this project within those funds.</P>

      <P>It is included in the National Development Plan and the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-99.  It was not announced in the atmosphere of a by-election campaign. Long before the by-election was called, indeed in the presence of the late Deputy Johnny Fox, I gave a commitment to this project on receiving a deputation from the Greystones area.  In other words, I did what successive Fianna Fáil Ministers, including Deputy Séamus Brennan, failed to do.  I took a decision and delivered.  I know that Deputy Brennan was incapable of taking decisions in his ministerial capacity. The reality is that his party colleagues in that constituency, including the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Joe Jacob, have complimented me on my decisive action.  The project will go ahead.  It is included in the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-99 and most of the funding is in place.  The total expenditure involved will be £8.5 million of which the vast proportion will come from the European Union Cohesion Fund and the balance, £1.3 million, from the internal resources of the CIE group who have taken account of the project in their planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no problem with the Minister's decisiveness but I want to pursue him on seeing the results on the ground.  Can he inform the House when the contracts will be signed, having told us that the funds will come from the Operational Programme for Transport and £1.3 million from CIE's own resources?  Will it be in the course of this year, 1996 or 1997?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm that the £8.5 million is comprised of power supply of £5.2 million, signalling works of £2.6 million, civil works of £0.6 million and works on the Redford station of <Col N="1622" /> £100,000.  There will be no Exchequer funding involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>Eight-five per cent of the funding is expected to come from the EU Cohesion Fund and no operational subsidy will be required on the basis of CIE's own projections.  Extra rolling stock will be incorporated separately into the DART system under the Operational Programme for Transport already referred to, leaving sufficient capacity within the system to enable services of the expected frequency to be operated.  With regard to the timescale, I should say that engineering, design and commissioning work has already commenced.  Work will be tendered out. Construction is expected to begin early in 1996 and will take approximately 20 months to complete.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The prices of comparable mobile phones in over-the-counter transactions are roughly equivalent here and in the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The UK market has several operators and wholesalers.  One of the ways in which they compete is by selling instruments at heavily subsidised prices to customers who agree to sign contracts <Col N="1623" /> for a number of years with one operator. The profits are then made from relatively high rentals and call charges. In fact, in many cases, rentals and call charges are cheaper here than in the UK.</P>
    <P>The advent of competition in our market will inevitably result in different options for consumers also.  Indeed, the whole thrust of my policy on mobile phones is through competition to achieve much wider penetration and ownership at affordable prices.  I do not envisage detailed regulation of prices here but the competitive approach to consumer prices is an important criterion in evaluating applications for the GSM licence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am astonished at the Minister's response to this question. He says there is no appreciable difference in the cost of mobile phones in the UK and here.  The survey in <i>The Sunday Times</i> indicated that a Motorola flip phone was £360 here and only £19 in the UK.  Is the Minister discounting that survey &mdash; presumably he has better information at his disposal?  Furthermore, will the Minister explain why Telecom Éireann may be asked by the European Commission to pay approximately £15 million because a second mobile phone licence is being given to the private sector?  Does that mean that the private sector auction figure will now increase from £20 million or £30 million to £40 million or £50 million?  In terms of the mobile phone service, are we now moving from a monopoly to a duopoly?  Where will Telecom get the £15 million to pay for this mobile phone licence?  I understood from the Minister during a previous Question Time that the Commission would not insist on Telecom paying this money.  It now transpires, however, that it is insisting on it and we seem to be heading towards a duopoly in terms of the provision of this service.  I understand the new operator will be given a 15 year exclusive licence and will pay £30 million or £40 million for the privilege.  That <Col N="1624" /> will not encourage competition, which we all want, but a cosy duopoly between two expensive providers of a service.</P>

      <P>The Ceann Comhairle confirmed my position and I want to be fair to all Deputies.  The Deputy asked why there was such a huge differential between the cost of certain mobile phones here and in the UK.  It is important to compare like with like. The Irish price is merely for the phone <Col N="1625" /> while the UK price includes a contractual commitment to use a particular service for a number of years.  The article to which the Deputy referred indicated also that charges are higher in Ireland. That is not correct.  The article failed to compare like with like.  The Irish market is primarily business based.  Business call rates are cheaper here than in the UK and I will forward, for the Deputy's information, details of those charges.  In fairness to Eircell and to Telecom, and to correct some of the unfair impressions given in the article, Eircell's growth last year was 45 per cent.  It appears that figure will be exceeded this year and applications for the Eircell service are 70 per cent higher than they were this time last year.  The article in question referred to the fact that there is public apathy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>European Union competition proposals in the transport, energy and communications sectors have, in <Col N="1627" /> general, been supported by my Department and where EU legislation has been adopted we have implemented the respective measures.</P>
      <P>In the case of transport, the competitive Single Market in air transport came into effect from 1 January 1993 and Irish national law has been amended, where necessary, to take full account of the conditions laid down.  European Union legislation in respect of land transport is also being complied with.</P>
      <P>Of particular interest to Ireland at present are proposals for liberalisation in the energy and telecommunications sectors.</P>
      <P>The energy sector draft Council directives concerning common rules for the internal market in electricity and gas are currently under discussion.  Ireland, represented by my Department, is involved in all the discussions.  Recent councils have established some basic principles in relation to the introduction of a single electricity market in Europe but agreement is still outstanding on a number of key issues.  We are endeavouring to influence the debate in regard to the special requirements of a small electricity system such as we have in Ireland.  In anticipation of liberalisation in the electricity sector, the Government has decided a number of measures to restructure the ESB for it to remain competitive and indeed prosper in a liberalised market.</P>
      <P>The draft Council directive on natural gas will be considered after the electricity directive has been agreed.  A consultation process is already under way by my Department with a number of relevant bodies to formulate a position for Ireland on the gas directive.  This matter is being handled directly by Minister of State Stagg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The thrust of EU competition proposals for the telecommunications sector is to put in place legal instruments which will support the development of efficient competition within a transparent regulatory framework.  This includes the establishment of a national regulatory authority to manage the <Col N="1628" /> licensing function and to arbitrate, where necessary, between market players. My Department has commissioned international consultants, Andersen Management International, to advise on the appropriate institutional arrangements and powers of the regulatory authority.  Further EU proposals will emerge from the council resolution on the implementation of the future regulatory framework for telecommunications adopted at the Telecommunications Council on 13 June 1995.  My Department will contribute to the development of the necessary instruments at Community level and will ensure that the necessary arrangements are made for transposition to Irish law.</P>
    <P>European Union proposals for liberalisation of the postal sector are expected to be circulated shortly to member states.  Against that background I recently announced that I had requested the chairman of An Post to undertake a fundamental review of the postal services to be in a position to meet increasing competition which will arise from the EU Commission's emerging policies on postal liberalisation.</P>

In areas under active discussion in the Commission and Council we are participating and putting forward our point of view as a peripheral nation and having regard to the peculiarities and problems that affect Ireland more than any other nation.  As soon as agreement has been reached and our position has been acknowledged we will be in a <Col N="1629" /> position to prepare the necessary legislation and bring it forward at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Energy Council has for some time been discussing the introduction of a single electricity market in Europe.  The report referred to by the Deputy was prepared by the Commission on foot of a Council request of November 1994.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's question goes to the heart of the debate currently taking place in the Council.  Can a liberalised electricity market, permitting third party access to networks, co-exist with a more restricted approach which would rely on a single buyer of electricity?</P>
      <P>The Commission's analysis, most importantly from Ireland's point of view, examines the specific problems of opening the market in small electricity systems.</P>
      <P>The Commission has now put forward its report.  That report represents its views and it has not been considered by the Council, but I am disappointed with it because it concludes that there is no difference between small and large systems. That is a conclusion with which I cannot agree in terms of Ireland's interests.  I have made clear my opposition to the report's conclusion and I already raised the matter in Brussels.  I can assure my colleagues in the Oireachtas that I will vigorously pursue my opposition to the report at Council.</P>
      <P>Our opposition to the report's conclusion will be effective and I anticipate a successful outcome to the discussions at Council.  I hope the directive, when finally agreed, will fully accommodate the special requirements of small systems such as Ireland's.</P>

      <P>I share the Minister's disappointment at the Commission's report.  What instructions has he given our officials at COREPER on the attitude they should take in negotiations with Commission officials in order to ensure that Ireland is not further disadvantaged in any future decisions?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>At the recent Council meeting I made a very strong case putting forward Ireland's point of view, which is fully supported by my officials dealing at Council and Commission levels. Small systems have specific needs and requirements and that was not taken into account in the report's conclusions. I have brought that matter successfully to the attention of the Commission. Agreements have been reached in respect of large systems and the position of small systems will now be examined closely.  I am convinced there are differences between the large and the small systems and on how competition can be introduced in each system. Measures that are appropriate for the introduction of competition in the larger continental systems are unsuitable in the context of the small isolated Irish system.</P>
      <P>The proposals in the report will not lead to the introduction of genuine competition in our electricity industry and they are incompatible with our concept of long term co-ordinated planning.  As Deputies know, the Irish system is extremely small compared with the larger systems in member states.  It serves an area of extremely low population density and by the year 2000 it will be almost entirely dependent on imported fuels.  It is not connected to any of the large systems in the European Union.  In addition it is required to support a developing economy which is classified as an objective 1 region of the Union.  Taking account of all those factors the appropriate system for Ireland is the one we have proposed and which I have endorsed and am vigorously pursuing, that is a centrally planned system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>What we have agreed, and the Government recently has made decisions in respect of this, is that there will be competition in the generation of electricity.  I discussed this on a number of occasions in the House and the Deputy is aware that the new peat fired power station will be constructed through open competition and the construction, operation and maintenance of the plant will be by an open tendering process.  That will bring competition into the generation side.  We are proposing also, as a compromise to the European Commission, that we will have competition on the supply side but it will be through the centrally planned system and will not allow for direct <Col N="1632" /> access by consumers to the power generating plant, which is what the Commission is looking for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister makes continuous references to the invitation of tenders for the peat fired stations as the introduction of competition would seem to tip the hat in the direction of competition, but will he open up the generation of electricity to all interested oil fired, gas fired and hydro suppliers or will he confine it to peat fired power stations?  He has only referred to the peat fired power stations, which are not economic when compared with the cost of producing a unit of electricity from a coal fired, oil fired or gas fired power station?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I can confirm to the Deputy that there will be competition for all future generation needs, including alternative energy sources, and that the ESB's monopoly on the retail side as a result of a recent Government decision will be ended with effect from 1 January 1998 for consumers with peak demand of one megawatt or greater. Suppliers, including the ESB's supply business, will purchase electricity from the power procurer and will compete for retail sales to all eligible consumers. Where supply competition takes place, independent suppliers will pay the same charges for the use of the ESB's transmission and distribution network as the ESB's supply business pay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the case.  The Poolbeg stations, phases two and three, are required to come on stream in the immediate future and will shortly be the subject of a Government decision.  It will take a number of years to put that capacity in place but even with that there would still be a requirement to expand the capacity of the network.

      <P>I understand the Deputy's question relates to proposals, including <Col N="1634" /> possible liberalisation of national postal services, contained in the EU green paper on the Development of the Single Market for Postal Services which was published in June 1992.</P>
      <P>It had been expected that the European Commission would bring forward proposals for liberalisation at the Telecommunications Council on 13 June 1995.  The Commission was not in a position to do so however but indicated that it hoped to do so before the end of July 1995.</P>
      <P>In the absence of the Commission's proposals it is not possible to assess the impact they may have on An Post.  The company is already subject to competition from modern technology such as electronic mail and facsimile, as well as from private sector operators.  I have recently asked the chairman of the company to review the role and method of operations of An Post, so that it will be in a position to respond to the challenges and opportunities which exist now and in the future for postal services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked what steps the Minister had taken at Commission level to influence the liberalisation.  I did so because there are 8,000 direct employees in An Post and 2,000 working on an agency basis, and the liberalisation suggested by the Commission would have a major impact on the numbers employed by An Post.  I am concerned about the Minister's gung-ho attitude to rationalisation in other sectors. I would have thought the Minister and his Department should voice strong objections to the Commission about the damage that will be caused to An Post by what is emanating from the Commission at this time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Union Green Paper was published this month. It envisaged major changes, including liberalisation of national postal monopolies which would lead to increased competition for An Post.  It was expected that 1994 would see the start of this process of liberalisation in the <Col N="1635" /> postal sector and that the European Union Commission would prepare necessary measures relating to definitions of the universal and reserved services, quality of intra-community service and technical standardisation.  Although informal drafts have been circulated, surreptitiously I might add, no final or formal draft has been published by the Commission.  All I can say clearly and definitively is that it will allow for competition, and the national monopolies that exist throughout the European Union will be challenged.  I am anxious to ensure that An Post is prepared to confront that challenge and take advantage of the opportunities that will arise from it.  I have already explained in detail the Irish position on this matter and we will closely monitor developments.</P>

      <P>I have outlined my position. I understand the Deputy's concerns which are uppermost in our minds.  The Deputy can be sure I will put the position of An Post and of Ireland very strongly.  The European Commission expected to present its proposals at the Telecommunications Council last May.  It is now expected to do so before the end of July 1995.  Until I see a draft or get an indication of what is proposeed, I do not wish to react.  It is not possible at this stage to assess the <Col N="1636" /> impact on An Post because the proposals have not been put forward. However, my views in regard to An Post are clear and I have communicated them to the chairman of An Post and have asked him to carry out a fundamental review of the company so that it will be better able to meet the increasing challenges and competition that will confront it in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>I find it extraordinary that the Minister should say he can make no presentation because he has seen nothing yet and at the same time say the report should have been presented in June but has been postponed until July.  There are indications as to what will be included in that final report.  It is, therefore, only reasonable for An Post and its workers to expect their Minister to cogently present their case in advace of the proposals and thereby influence them before the process is revealed.  I strongly urge the Minister at this late hour to become far more actively involved.  It is ironic that the EU is pouring money into rural development and renewal while at the same time we seem to be forgetting about the social aspect of An Post which will be decimated by what is about to emanate if we do not become actively involved in influencing the process.</P>

      <P>It is not a late hour.  I put forward the Irish point of view during preliminary discussions.  I do not accept that the postal service will be decimated. I have asked the chairman of An Post to conduct a fundamental review, the terms of reference of which will indicate where the challenge is coming from and how An Post can be strengthened to ensure it is better placed to take account of the new environment in which it will operate when decisions are taken at EU level.  I am very conscious of An Post's position and have advocated it during preliminary discussions. We will communicate our views to the EU through the permanent representative and my officials.  The Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, and I will be <Col N="1637" /> involved in discussions at ministerial level.  We are conscious of the needs of An Post in the market place and will put its view forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The terms of reference of the review which I have asked the chairman of An Post to carry out cover the suitability of existing structures and functions in terms of strategically responding to the challenges and opportunities which exist now and will exist in the future; the compatibility of the existing mix of functions with the priority exercise of its core role of providing a reliable, value for money and quality postal service to the business communities and households; the need to generate sufficient profit to fund the future requirements of An Post and provide a dividend to Government; whether its various programmes, financial controls, cash transit procedures and human relations functions are operated efficiently, effective and are sufficiently responsive to the needs of its consumers now and in the future; delays in the postal service, notwithstanding recovery measures and associated investment particularly in the Dublin mail centre and the failure to achieve expected monetary savings.  I expect the chairman will be in a position to report to me by the end of October.  At that stage we will have a proper evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of An Post and will be better able to evaluate the measures needed to ensure it is able to compete and maintain its dominant position in this country.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2a:</P>
      <P>In page 3, after line 33, to insert the following subsection: &ldquo;(3)  The contractor shall be required to formally consult with a forum which shall include representatives of Board Fáilte Éireann and of the trade.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage the Minister referred to the possibility of setting up a forum with which the contractor would be able to consult.  He properly said &mdash; we made the same point when we were in Government &mdash; that tourism is one of <Col N="1694" /> the most important industries in economic terms and that it will become more significant than agriculture in due course.  He also said that the number of tourists would exceed the number of people living in, I presume the Twenty-six Counties.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil policy group on tourism and trade is concerned about the appointment of a contractor. We accept that the Arthur D. Little report is a creature of the former Minister and we cannot cavil about it.  However, we also form our own opinions and some strong views were expressed about the need for a contractor.  My information is that the contractor may come from another country.  Under EU regulations the position has to be open to people living in member states.  It should be remembered that France and Britian are never slow in casting their eyes to the ground when dealing with issues like this and through some happy coincidence one of their own is inevitably appointed to this sort of position.  I am not suggesting that the Minister would think along these lines but he should strive within the proper application of the rules to ensure that the contractor comes from Ireland, either North or South.</P>
    <P>If the contractor comes from another country then it is even more important to set up a forum with which he or she can consult.  Such a forum should include representatives of Bord Fáilte and the tourism industry.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider accepting our amendment.  As I said, the establishment of such a forum is essential if the contractor comes from another country as he will not have the necessary knowledge of the industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Andrews has put very eloquently the case for the establishment of a forum.  Given the fundamental change proposed in the legislation it is very important to give the trade an input to the system during the early stages.  A case may be made for not including such a provision in this Bill but it is a vitally important safety <Col N="1695" /> net which will allow the trade to play an active role in this area.  The Bill enables Bord Fáilte to enter into a contract with a contractor on such terms and conditions as the board sees fit.  Up to now the board dealt directly with the trade and built up an experienced team which is well known in the trade.  As Deputy Andrews rightly said, whoever the new contractor is, and particularly if he is from outside the State and has not had experience of dealing with the trade in Ireland, there would be a grave need for an inclusive means for dialogue between the particular interests.  I agree with Deputy Andrews that the appropriate and fail-safe way to accommodate this would be by its inclusion in the Bill at this point or, perhaps, a case could be made for its insertion in section 3.  There is a strong case to be made for the inclusion of an amendment along these lines and I ask the Minister to consider going back to the parliamentary draftsman to see whether it is possible to include, if not these exact words, something similar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Andrews stated his case eloquently.  The amendment in the names of Deputy Andrews and Killeen refers to a point of principle which is obvious and necessary. However, it is not appropriate to have it enshrined in legislation.  Deputy Andrews referred to organisations or individuals who might be granted this responsibility.  No decision has been made on this matter.  We must deal with all tenders submitted whether from inside or outside the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested to note recently at a Council of Ministers' meeting in Luxembourg, that a trade survey carried out by IBEC revealed that up to 28 per cent of Irish firms had problems exporting to Germany and that 22 per cent had difficulty exporting to France. I recall the rumpus when a French company was outside this building doing some road works a number of years ago. I accept the principle that there has to be discussion with the industry about <Col N="1696" /> this important matter.  We have a tourism council which is representative of all shades of the tourist industry where these and other matters can be discussed. I also noted Deputy Andrew's comment on Second Stage in respect of people employed by Bord Fáilte who might choose to leave and possibly be considered for future employment.  No decision has yet been made on this matter.</P>
    <P>In respect of a point raised by Deputy Killeen, Bord Fáilte appoints the contractor. It would be unusual to have a requirement that the contractor consults the board on matters delegated to it. The contractor will be specifically asked by Bord Fáilte to maintain an ongoing dialogue with the industry.  The Irish Hotels Federation will continue to have a role in any appeals process for grading and classification.  In that context there will be no change in the procedures involved.  This means Bord Fáilte will continue to determine standards, set fees and will be involved in the final stages of an appeals process.  I accept the spirit and the principle of the Deputies' amendment and I assure them that in the contract to be drawn up between a contractor to be appointed and Bord Fáilte this case will be clearly made.  It is not appropriate to have it enshrined in legislation and for that reason I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made the point it would seem inappropriate that Bord Fáilte who would be effectively running the process ought to be on the forum.  Nevertheless if you accept the principle that such a forum should exist it would be extraordinary that the trade and the contractor should meet formally and that Bord Fáilte would not have a direct role, first, from the point of view of knowing what was happening and, second, from the point of view of the input to whatever regulations they sought to have included for consideration by the contractor.  I am delighted the Minister is accepting that the principle of this body must be put in place <Col N="1697" /> but I would be happier if it were included specifically in the legislation. When in place it must include, if it is to be effective, not only representatives of the trade but direct Bord Fáilte membership or input as well.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the principle of a forum in this case but I accept the principle of consultation with the industry in regard to the regulations and duties to be carried out by the contractor. I assure Deputies that that spirit will be included in any contract to be drawn up with whatever contractor is to be appointed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point we are making, and it is a reasonable one, is that the Minister's party has imposed on the Chamber and the body politic this wretched philosophy of political correctness &mdash; a philosophy with which I do not agree.  It is corrosive and diminishing to individuals who practise their profession of politics in a decent and generous way as do all politicans in the House.  On the basis that we are in this era of that wretched philosophy, particularly promulgated by the Minister's party, we cannot leave anything to chance.  The Minister generously said that he goes along with the spirit and principle of the amendment.  It is obvious and necessary and at the same time he makes the point that they will consult the industry through the tourism council and other tourist outlets.  In those circumstances I fail to accept the Minister's reasoning for non-acceptance of this amendment.  We believe it is a fundamental amendment and that it complies with the Minister's party's philosophy of openness and transparency which we are all meant to practise nowadays to the detriment of body politic because it flies in the face of the large majority of decent and good Members of both Houses.  The Minister will not be there forever and his successor will have to deal with this matter. This whole area is fraught with difficulty. For that reason only, I will have to press this amendment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Andrews referred on a number of occasions to political correctness.  It is appropriate that we do a good and effective job and that it is seen to be above board.  There is nothing wrong with writing into a contract, specifically, the regulations, duties and responsibilities that contractor will have to carry out and Deputies Andrews and Killeen need have no worries in that regard.  When a contractor is appointed their duties and responsibilities under the Bill will be made clear in writing.  I have paid tribute on a previous occasion to my predecessor, Deputy McCreevy, who requested for good reasons a consultancy report on this industry.  We have examined and accepted this recommendation.  Everything will be above board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see the need for this amendment which would lead to the establishment of another body to be known as a forum.  We already have a Tourism Council which represents all sectors of the industry.  It has a consultative role and since its establishment has played an important part in the development of tourism policy.  I compliment the previous Minister on its establishment.</P>
      <P>If this amendment were to be accepted the contractor to whom the board will delegate some of its functions would have two masters.  In his introductory remarks last week the Minister said that the board would reserve the right to review the operations of the contractor on an annual basis and there would be an appeals system for applicants who felt they had been unfairly treated by the contractor in deciding on applications for certification, grading or registration.  I will deal with the question of the appeals system when we reach the appropriate section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If another forum were established there would be a conflict of interest between it and the board.  There is general acceptance that the certification process has been conducted in a reasonably satisfactory way by Bord Fáilte up <Col N="1699" /> to now.  The purpose in transferring this duty from Bord Fáilte to an outside contractor is to allow the board to proceed with its core activity, namely, promoting Ireland as a quality tourist destination.</P>
    <P>I support the Minister.  I do not see the need for a forum as it would only confuse the issue.  We already have a Tourism Council to which the Minister and Bord Fáilte are willing to listen. This adequately meets the need for consultation. The tourism industry is unique in terms of the consultation process conducted at every level from the regional tourism organisations and the representative organisations in the different sectors to the Minister and the board itself. If another forum were established we would end up with an unnecessary quango.</P>

      <P>I do not want to be tedious but, on the question of a forum, the Tourism Council could fulfil this role.  There is nothing wrong with Deputy Molloy's suggestion.  I was not suggesting that we should create extra tiers or layers of bureaucracy &mdash; the fewer organisations the better.  There is no reason the contractor could not continue to consult with Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that the duties of the contractor will be enshrined in the contract and that in those circumstances there is no need to include them in the Bill.  It is necessary to do this.</P>
      <P>If it is appropriate for him to do so, will the Minister indicate how many tenders have been submitted?  Having spoken to a number of people involved in the industry I understand that a particular applicant is being considered but I accept the Minister's word that no one has yet been selected.  I must press the amendment although I do not want to be difficult.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy said the forum could be seen as an additional tier or layer and went on to refer to the Tourism Council.  I have no difficulty with that body fulfilling that role provided I receive an assurance that this matter will be dealt with.  As a matter of principle, it is important that those involved in the tourism industry are seen to have a central role to play.  They already play an important role in economic development.  The Tourism Council does not exercise the function that Deputy Andrews and I want it to exercise in relation to this matter.  I will be more than pleased if this is to be the case provided the Minister gives us an assurance that the duties and responsibilities of the contractor will be included at some stage.  It would be better if they were included in the legislation.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons Deputies have encountered a delay in obtaining the amendments is that the debate on Second Stage came to an abrupt end last week.  As a result many Members did not have an opportunity to contribute.  I did not have an opportunity to finish my own contribution but at least I knew what I wanted to say.  Members with a particular interest in this subject should have an opportunity to say what they want to say, to hear the views of other Members and to table amendments to ensure that this legislation will be of benefit to the industry.  As a matter of principle, those directly involved ought to be able to take part in a consultation process.  I would prefer if this were enshrined in the legislation.</P>

      <P>I share the view which has been expressed about the Tourism Council.  We have a very good relationship with the industry in general, which is perfectly entitled to raise matters of concern at the council.  It can also raise them directly with Bord Fáilte, the chairman and director general of which are members of the Tourism Council. There is a forum to discuss these matters, including the Arthur D. Little report.  The industry may bring to my attention, and to the attention of Bord <Col N="1701" /> Fáilte, whose chairman and director general are on the council any concerns it may have.  The Tourism Council, a very effective body, deals with serious matters and its vision of the tourism industry is followed through in so far as possible.  There is very good support within the existing structure and a full understanding that matters of concern may be raised with the council.  For that reason I ask the Deputies to withdraw their amendment.</P>

      <P>This section states that the board may exercise any of its powers and perform any of its functions under each provision mentioned in the Schedule and that it may enter into a contract with a contractor to carry out some of its functions.  The board will retain responsibility for the registration scheme, but there is some confusion in the industry about the role of the board and the contractor.  Perhaps the Minister will confirm that the registration of Fáilte.  It is not clear in section 8 what the role of the board will be or whether the contractor's opinion will be automatically the opinion of the board in all cases.  Will the Minister elaborate on the annual review process?  Is that matter provided for in existing regulations or will it be included in new regulations to be made under the Bill?  There is no reference to the appeals system in the Bill. Is it proposed to amend that system?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with this matter on Second Stage.  No changes are proposed in the appeals system.  The Bill provides for a contractor to have delegated to him certain works.  It will be the contractor's duty to receive applications for registration of a premises, to inspect the premises, to inform applicants that the premises are eligible for registration, to register premises on payment of the prescribed fee and to issue <Col N="1702" /> registration certificates.  If, following inspection of the premises, the contractor decides that the premises are not eligible for registration, he will inform the applicant that in the opinion of the board the premises are not eligible for registration and will allow 14 days within which an appeal may be made in writing by the applicant.  If no appeal is lodged within the given time the contractor will refuse the application.  If an appeal is made, Bord Fáilte will pursue the next stage of the process.  Bord Fáilte retains the final say in regard to registration, will prescribe the fee and set the criteria.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2)  A formal appeals procedure shall be put in place by order of the Minister and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If ever an amendment deserved to be accepted by the Minister, this is one. The explanatory memorandum to this Bill states, under the heading &ldquo;Background&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bord Fáilte will also retain responsibility for the operation of the final stages of the appeals mechanism provided for under the Tourist Traffic Acts, when applications for registration and renewal of registration are refused and in the case of cancellation of registration.  They will also be involved in the final stages of the appeals mechanism for grading of <Col N="1703" /> accommodation.  All other aspects of the inspection process will, in future, be undertaken by the third party contractor.</P>
    <P>We are proposing that a formal appeals procedure be put in place by order of the Minister and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is a glaring example of an unintentional omission on the part of the Minister.  When scrutinising this Bill we came to the conclusion, almost unanimously, that this procedure should be put in place by order of the Minister.  It will be a matter for the Minister to draft the order as he wishes.</P>
    <P>This comes back to the attitude that everything nowadays must be seen to be up-front and above board, as was generally the position in the past.  I make my point out of boredom with talk about transparency and openness and the other guff we hear nowadays.  We may as well put into practice what has been preached.  This amendment would give effect to a formal appeals procedure which shall be put in place by order of the Minister and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Nothing could be clearer, more concise, simpler or more lawful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister rightly outlined on Second Stage the procedures to be put in place and said that Bord Fáilte will retain a central role in controlling the appeals procedure.  He set out the terms under which an appeal will be received by the board.  That has operated well to date but, as Deputy Andrews said, there is a strong case for the Minister to publicly put in place this procedure.  He should seriously consider doing so particularly in the context of changes regarding contractors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the contributions of Deputies Andrews and Killeen.  The 1939 and 1952 Acts, and other tourism Acts, outline specifically the step-by-step procedure to be followed.  It is crystal clear <Col N="1704" /> and enshrined in law.  It is important to appreciate that no change is envisaged in respect of the existing appeals procedure because the system has worked very well to date.  Only a small number of claims, approximately ten, have been received annually and very few of those go through the entire process.</P>
      <P>The only change, if it could be classed as change, is that the contractor rather than Bord Fáilte will carry out the initial phase of the appeals procedure.  If Bord Fáilte needs to be involved in the final stages of an appeal, it would send one of its officials to complete a physical inspection of the premises under scrutiny. Based on that report, its board would make the final decision.  This matter is outlined step-by-step, enshrined in legislation and has been tried and proven over the years.  All that is involved here is that the contractor will carry out the initial stages of an appeals procedure and, as has been the case in the past, Bord Fáilte will retain the final say in the matter.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's point and agree that the scheme has been successful to date.  I thank him for letting us know that very few appeals have been made annually.  That is a great tribute to the trade and Bord Fáilte for the way they have handled matters.  Nevertheless, the point Deputy Andrews and I are making is that this legislation seeks to give new powers to the board regarding the appointment of a contractor.  We welcome that the Minister stated clearly that the same appeals procedure will be in place, but that is not clearly set out in this legislation. That is the nub of the difficulty. It is not clear that section 3 amends the 1939 Act and that it contains the appeals procedure outlined by the Minister.</P>

      <P>We have the relevant Acts regarding this and other matters before us and are fully aware of the requirements set out in legislative form. It appears we are now engaged effectively &mdash; and I use this term in the best sense as Bord Fáilte and its members have served this country well and have been transparent and open on all issues and the law may not improve matters &mdash; in the breaking up of Bord Fáilte.  We are not adopting an aggressive approach to its break-up or going in with our fists raised, but we are engaged in the fundamental reform of probably the most important arm of our tourism industry, Bord Fáilte.  We are aware that there exists in legislation all the necessary requirements regarding an appeals procedure. We are urging, as this legislation is so fundamental to the future livelihood of many thousands of people, that this appeals procedure be enshrined in the Bill.  We want a statement referring to it included.  That will not interfere with the existing legislation, but will encapsulate all those legislative provisions the Minister said exist in other Acts.</P>
      <P>For those reasons we insist on the Minister accepting the amendment.  We are not suggesting any wrongdoing on the part of Bord Fáilte.  Its contribution to this country has been immense.  We are not imputing that it has been or ever will be guilty of any wrongdoing.  We are proposing a reasonable and fundamental amendment to this shattering legislation as far as Bord Fáilte is concerned. The contractor is taking over the functions of people who have been made redundant out of choice.  That redundancy scheme was offered and those people offered themselves on that altar.</P>

      <P>One of the reasons good relationships exist between all sides of the industry is that this matter is clear to it.  The industry is well aware the legislation does not involve any procedural changes in this regard.  The procedures set out in existing legislation are crystal clear and for that reason the <Col N="1708" /> number of cases that go through the final process is very small.  It is not necessary to change the existing procedures because they have been well tried and tested over the years.</P>

      <P>The appeals mechanism is established under three of the references in the Schedule, sections 27 (3) (a) and (b) and 30 (4) (a) and (b) of the 1939 Act and section 32 (3) (a) and (b) of the 1952 Act.  The Minister has not satisfied me that the appeals mechanism would not be extended to include a contractor or an employee of a contractor if all enactments under the Schedule provide that &ldquo;the Board&rdquo; can also include the contractor. If the functions given to the board under the enactments I mentioned refer to the appeals mechanism, a reasonable reading of section 2 (2) would indicate that the contractor can also perform those functions.</P>

The remainder of an appeals procedure is covered under the 1939 and 1952 Acts and remains under the remit of Bord Fáilte.  Under this legislation we are merely giving a contractor the right to carry out an initial inspection of a premises. If deregistration is recommended, the process will be dealt with by Bord Fáilte.</P>

      <P>I too would like confirmation that the appeals procedure is seen to be a separate function, confined to Bord Fáilte, and that there is not any possibility that that function could be extended to a contractor or employee of the contractor.  The manner in which this Bill is structured allows for the devolving of the powers of Bord Fáilte in the matter of registration and grading of accommodation and so on to a contractor. It is being done in a type of <Col N="1710" /> omnibus fashion which would suggest the appeals procedure could be extended as well.</P>
      <P>The industry wants a clear demarcation line drawn between the role of Bord Fáilte and that of a contractor.  It is accepted that the function should be carried out by a contractor, but there is a desire within the trade that responsibility for the registration and gradings mechanism should rest with Bord Fáilte. It is the view of the industry that the opinion of the contractor should never be seen to displace the role of Bord Fáilte under section 8 which states:</P>
      <P>References to the opinion of the Board in sections 27 and 30 of the Principal Act and section 32 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, shall be construed as references to such opinion formed by the Board itself and not by the Board acting through or by any contractor or any employee of a contractor.</P>
      <P>There is merit in the concept of a separate appeals mechanism being written in the Bill, clearly establishing where the final responsibility for this registration and grading system lies and drawing a clear demarcation line between the role of the contractor and that of Bord Fáilte.  This would alleviate anxieties within the industry.</P>

      <P>I can give Deputy Molloy and others a categoric assurance that this is not and cannot be extended to the contractor in that the relevant subsections of section 27 of the 1939 Act are not included in the Schedule to this Bill. Therefore, it is quite specific and very clear that the final appeals procedure rests with Bord Fáilte, in law, and is not being transferred to the contractor.  This is why it has not been included in the Schedule to this Bill.  We have checked this out thoroughly.  I can give the House a categoric assurance that this cannot and will not happen in respect of whatever contractor may be appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard various Ministers give categoric assurances but <Col N="1711" /> we are writing, not interpreting, the legislation.  On many occasions the courts have interpreted legislation differently from the Minister who introduced it.  I have even heard Attorneys General give advice subsequently overturned by the Supreme Court.  One would not need to be too definitive or absolute; interpretation is what is important.  Lawyers within the industry have also examined this.  There is some concern out there.  Rather than the Minister dismissing the arguments advanced in the amendment tabled by Deputies Andrews and Killeen, it would be helpful if he were prepared to re-examine this to ensure that any doubts are eliminated or, in the event of such doubts proving to be well founded, he were prepared to introduce a new section clearly establishing the difference once and for all.  That implies that time would be needed between Committee and Report Stages.  There would not be some type of quick arrangement between the Whips coming to the end of the parliamentary session when there will always be a desire to rush legislation through in order to engage in other activities, by-election campaigns or whatever.  We have seen legislation rushed through before and later regretted because it had not been properly examined in the first place.</P>
      <P>Although the Minister may be quite happy in the advice he is getting that there are no grounds for such fear, he must dispel those concerns voiced on this side of the House and outside.  If the Minister can assure us that he will have the matter examined further, perhaps obtaining a further opinion from the Attorney General, that would be his best approach.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy is quite right to voice perfectly legitimate concerns. This is something about which I was concerned and I had it examined exhaustively.  The Deputy is also correct to say that I cannot interpret the legislation &mdash; that is a matter for the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the appeals procedure <Col N="1712" /> will remain within the remit of Bord Fáilte, as has been its right since the enactment of the 1939 Act, is very clear. The subsections of section 27 of that Act are applicable to Bord Fáilte.  It is clear that all that is being transferred to the contractor is the initial inspection procedure.  It is equally clear that the final arbitration in respect of decisions on this remains, as it should, with Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>When Deputy Andrews and I tabled this amendment we were under the impression that the procedure outlined in the Principal Act obtained but it was not absolutely clear to us that it continues to apply in the manner in which the Minister assures us it does. We allowed some leeway by providing the safety net of the procedure which would be put in place by order of the Minister being placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  In view of what the Minister has said and our discussion here it seems important that an even stronger provision be incorporated at this stage.  While accepting that the Minister is quite convinced that the 1939 and subsequent Acts, in so far as they relate to an appeals procedure, are not amended by this Bill, in addition to the fact that the Schedule does not include those subsections, the Bill taken as a whole could be open to the interpretation that the appeals procedure might well be delegated to a contractor on behalf of Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>The Minister should take account of the very strong arguments on the matter of clarity.  The trade has clearly developed good relations with Bord Fáilte and would wish Bord Fáilte to continue to have absolute, unfettered control of the appeals procedure.  I would be satisfied if it were perfectly clear in the Act that the sections outlined by the Minister continue to constitute the appeals procedure in relation to the current Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>To return to the proposition made by Deputies Molloy and Killeen, having regard to the principle <Col N="1713" /> of accountability, should Bord Fáilte &mdash; I ask this question rhetorically and there is nothing sinister or threatening in my language &mdash; be a judge in the causes of those it represents?  That is a fundamental principle and one to which we have given considerable thought.  I do not believe for one moment that Bord Fáilte transgresses the principles of natural justice but it is coming close to that.  In this legislation the Minister sets down the legal parameters within which this Act should be operated in the context of the contractor failing to renew registration, where it is refused, and in the case of the cancellation of registration. In those circumstances, is it reasonable that the same organisation which appoints the contractor should have the appeals mechanism within its remit?</P>
      <P>I want to be clear in what I am saying. Bord Fáilte has served this country well and will continue to do so but I believe now is the time for us to have courage in regard to this legislation.  There have been references to the 1939, 1952, 1957 and 1988 legislation which relate, in one way or another, to the tourism industry. The Schedule sets out the Tourist Act, 1939, right through to the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988, and for that reason we believe this amendment is appropriate.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that the order of the House provides for these amendments to be taken on Committee and Report Stages and that the Bill will conclude by 7 o'clock this evening.  That does not afford Deputy Molloy's party or mine an opportunity of asking the Minister to reconsider the amendment, as is the norm.  The way the business is being conducted now means that there is not any opportunity for reflection and that is not right for what we seek to achieve, namely, the intellectual advantage of good legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider the proposal put forward by Deputy Killeen and myself with a view to updating the legislation and setting down clearly what is required in the context of the effect of the fundamental judgment of the contractor on the livelihood of <Col N="1714" /> people operating in small towns and villages. This organisation will touch the very heart of communities if applications are refused or registrations cancelled. The appeals procedure should be taken out of the hands of Bord Fáilte and put into independent hands.  I do not intend to impute any wrongdoing or proposed wrongdoing to Bord Fáilte.  I am merely saying it is reasonable and proper that the appeals procedure is seen to be independent and function as an independent entity.  Under the proposal, the Minister can lay an order before the House which will take its place accordingly.</P>

      <P>If I had time, I would like to examine the question of consolidating all these Acts which have been in place since 1939.  I cannot do that now but I accept the point that legislation covering a period of 50 years should be consolidated.  However, these things do not happen overnight and what is involved here are the relevant changes to which legislative effect must be given in respect of Bord Fáilte.</P>
      <P>My understanding of the proposal originally put forward by Deputies Killeen and Andrews is that there should be a section relevant to the appeals process laid down separately in this legislation. Deputy Andrews said he would like this process to be removed from Bord Fáilte and put in separately under the Act.  However, the industry is well disposed towards having finality in this process retained by Bord Fáilte, it has been adamant in that regard and that is what is being done here.  The sections in respect of the final process of appeal are enshrined in law to Bord Fáilte and will remain so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister have a problem with the wording of the amendment put forward by the two Deputies <Col N="1715" /> which proposes that a formal appeals procedure should be put in place by order of the Minister and laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas?  It does not state that the Minister shall be the person to decide the appeals or that the appeals function be taken away from Bord Fáilte; it leaves it to the Minister to devise the appeals procedure in view of the fundamental change this Bill proposes in the area of registration, grading and classification.  What is the Minister's fundamental objection to this?</P>
      <P>It is interesting that the Minister regrets he has not sufficient time to consolidate all the tourist traffic Acts into one Act.  I suggest it is time for him to initiate such work within his Department to tidy up this whole area.  The industry is different now from what it was in 1939 when it was a small business employing few people and confined mainly to a small number of traditional seaside resorts and the city of Dublin.  It now extends across the country and is a major revenue earner for families living in the remotest parts.  It has a phenomenal influence on sustaining life in rural areas and there is no other industry identified by Government which can bring revenue to these areas to the same extent.  Tourism is now a major plank in the economy, sustaining tens of thousands of families throughout the year.  In his introductory speech the Minister said the industry was growing apace and one could see the day when it would surpass our major industry, agriculture, as a revenue earner.  Invisible exports earned through tourism are of special value to us because of the way the money filters down through the economy and it is important that the Houses of the Oireachtas should take it more seriously instead of introducing <i>ad hoc</i> changes.  Legislation should be updated and consolidated.  Initiatives taken in recent times by different Ministers have been beneficial and this particular move was initiated by the then Minister, Deputy McCreevy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great work has been done by the pioneers of tourism.  The late Erskine <Col N="1716" /> Childers was the first Minister to see the potential of this industry.  He travelled the length and breadth of the country advocating the merits of tourism as a means of bringing revenue into rural Ireland.  From those early days and the development of Bord Fáilte there has been tremendous expansion and dedication. The Minister may regret having said that he did not have time to undertake the rationalisation of the legislation and bring in a comprehensive Bill encompassing all the Acts from 1939 onwards.  If he has not initiated that type of work he should make a start as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>What objections has the Minister to the wording of the proposed amendment? The terms are very generous and leave it to the Minister to determine the procedures for the new appeals system. There is a requirement that he lay his Order before the Houses of the Oireachtas, a standard procedure much loved by many Ministers.  I suggest this would be helpful in the new environment in which the State is shedding functions that can be better undertaken by outside agencies.  That is the principle which my party has been advocating since its foundation and it stands four square behind it.  It is the way forward.</P>
    <P>In the past there was a need for State involvement to establish enterprise as it was not possible for private enterprise to do so because the money was not available.  We are maturing and strengthening and the State should not continue to cling to functions when there are others in the private sector who are willing to undertake them.  The sooner this example is followed in other State bodies the better.</P>
    <P>The guarantee to those in the industry that the changed situation will not effect any substantial change in the way the scheme operates is that a formal appeal structure will be established.  That is what is proposed in the amendment and it seems very reasonable.  The Minister is a reasonable man and I am surprised he cannot see his way to accepting it or else stating what is wrong with the <Col N="1717" /> wording.  It is being written into this Bill and that is the place to have it.  We should not have to search as far back as the 1939 Act to find the appeals mechanisms under the various Acts to see if things have changed or whether the board's role will be fully retained and that aspect will not be devolved to outside operators.  It is important that the formal appeals procedure is retained by Bord Fáilte when it is shedding the day to day work involved in visiting establishments and grading them in accordance with the classifications system.  I have been looking through the electorate grading critria for hotels and it is extraordinary that the State is involved as that function should have been devolved long ago.  Similar to planning cases where the State is the final arbiter it is appropriate that Bord Fáilte is clearly established as the final arbiter under the Bill where the day to day functions are being devolved to outside contractors.  Has the Minister some objection to the form of words used to achieve this objective?  If so, will he suggest an alternative or has he other reasons for objecting to it?</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy has made a number of relevant points.  The wording used by Deputies Andrews and Killeen in their amendment is fine in itself but is not necessary.  A well tried and proven step by step appeals process is set out and enshrined in law.  The system has worked very well to date and I do not propose to change it.  In any year a small number of cases will come up for scrutiny and of those a very small number will go through the whole process. The appeals procedure has already been laid before the House for a great number of years.  We have had discussions with the Tourism Council, the hotel industry and the members of Bord Fáilte.  Everybody associated with the industry understands it quite clearly.  The industry made the point very strongly to me that Bord Fáilte should retain finality and that is what is happening.  It is enshrined in law and the procedure is <Col N="1718" /> set out very clearly, step by step, and has been well proven over the years.</P>

      <P>I do not want to read the entire Act into the record, but section 27 is as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  Whenever an application is duly made to the Board for the registration of premises in a register, the Board shall cause such premises to be inspected by an officer of the Board.</P>
      <P>(2)  Whenever premises in respect of which an application was duly made to the Board for registration in a register have been inspected under sub-section (1) of this section and the Board is of opinion, that such premises are eligible for registration in such register, the Board shall inform the applicant that his premises will be registered in such register on payment to the Board of the appropriate prescribed fee.</P>
      <P>(3)  Whenever premises in respect of which an application was duly made to the Board for registration in a register have been inspected under sub-section (1) of this section and the board is of opinion that such premises are not eligible for registration in such register, the following provisions shall apply and have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the Board shall serve notice upon the applicant that the Board is of opinion that such premises are not eligible for registration in such register and that the applicant may, within fourteen days after service of such notice make written representations to the Board with a view to showing that such premises are eligible for such registration;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  if during the said fourteen days no such written representations are received by the Board, <Col N="1719" /> the Board shall refuse such application;</P>
    <P>(c)  if during the said fourteen days such written representations are received by the Board, the Board shall cause a second inspection of such premises to be made by a different officer of the Board;</P>
    <P>(d)  if the Board, notwithstanding such second inspection and having considered the written representations received as aforesaid, remains of opinion that such premises are not eligible for registration in such register, the Board shall refuse such application;</P>
    <P>(e)  if the Board, as a result of such second inspection and having considered the written representations received as aforesaid, becomes of opinion that such premises are eligible for registration in such register, the Board shall inform the applicant that his premises will be registered in such register on payment to the Board of the appropriate prescribed fee.</P>
    <P>(4)  An applicant for registration of premises in a register who has been informed by the Board that such premises will be registered in such register on payment to the Board of the appropriate prescribed fee may pay the said fee to the Board, and thereupon the Board shall register such premises in such register.</P>
    <P>(5)  References in this section to the opinion of the Board that premises are not eligible for registration in any register shall be construed as references to such opinion formed by the Board itself and not by the Board acting through or by any of its officers or servants.</P>
    <P>(6)  The fees prescribed for the purposes of this section may be so prescribed as to vary in amount according to the register in which the relevant premises are to be registered <Col N="1720" /> and according to any other matters which the Board thinks proper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 27 (3) (a) provides that if in the board's opinion the premises are not eligible for registration, it shall serve notice and the person can make written representations to the board.  Paragraph (b) provides that if no representations are received the board shall then refuse the application. Under the Bill that means the contractor shall refuse.  Thus the contractor is involved in the appeals mechanism in that if it is determined that the contractor refused an application and the applicant was invited to make written representations but did not do so within 14 days, the contractor can then decide to refuse the application.  Part of the appeals mechanism is being operated by the contractor under the section.  The position is not as clear as the Minister indicated earlier.</P>

      <P>The function of the initial inspection is being transferred to the contractor.  If the contractor decides the premises should not be registered he so informs the applicant and informs him of his right to appeal.  If the applicant does not appeal within the prescribed time the deregistration stands.  If the applicant submits an appeal within 14 days, Bord Fáilte will take the process from there.  The section of the Act dealing with the transfer of a function to the contractor relates only to the initial inspection, and if the contractor decides that the premises should not be registered he informs the applicant of that and of his right of appeal.</P>

      <P>I seek the guidance of the Chair on a matter that came to my notice just now.  I confess I had not adverted to the fact that the Report and Final Stages were to be taken this evening until Deputy Andrews mentioned it.  Is it possible at this stage to table an amendment for Report Stage with the agreement of the Minister? Arising from what the Minister has read, there is a real danger that what <Col N="1721" /> Deputy Molloy mentioned could happen. The Minister says the Schedule goes only as far as section 27 (3) (a) and (b).  That may well turn out to be the case, but it is a close one to call and on the basis of the case made on the Opposition benches, that if we could alter this and include what the Minister wants as much as we do in regard to the appeals procedure, we should take the opportunity to do so.  I appreciate that the Order of the House which was made today governs the actions of the Chair and ours.  However, I wonder if it is still possible to table an amendment with the agreement of the Minister.  The amendment tabled by Deputy Andrews and me was drawn up in view of the provisions of the 1939 Act, but has not succeeded in doing that we want or what the House would require.  However, I will press it as it stands unless there is a possibility of changing it and tabling a new amendment for Report Stage which would clarify matters.  There is a very great need for this because the appeals procedure as set out in section 27 (3) (c) to (e) and 27 (5) and (6) continues to apply.</P>
      <P>There is another argument which was illustrated by Deputy Andrews and which our amendment would have accommodated by giving the Minister even more power and widening the provisions of the appeals procedure.  I tend to the view that the old appeals procedure which appears to work well might be best, but I would be happy to agree to a new amendment, even one tabled by the Minister, on Report Stage. In section 8 a number of sections of the Principal Act are mentioned, as is the 1952 Act.  There is an almost compelling case for absolute clarity in the appeals procedure and the minimum required would be a statement that the provisions of the 1939 Act continue.  However, if possible, I would prefer a little more.</P>

      <P>The paragraphs of section 27 of the 1939 Act which are relevant to Bord Fáilte retaining its final and complete say in respect of the <Col N="1722" /> appeals process are not being transferred into the Schedule to this Act.  It could not be any clearer that the contractor is only involved in the initial process&mdash;the final say rests with the board. That already stands in law and will continue to stand.  This matter has been discussed by everybody concerned in the industry and they fully understand the position.  I would not attempt to enshrine in legislation something as fundamental as this if I was not satisfied as to its clarity.

      <P>An appeals mechanism established in 1939 is not adequate to deal with today's needs.  I fully support the transfer of this function to outside contractors.  When the 1939 Act was passed it was not envisaged that the appeals mechanism would operate in circumstances where the registration functions would be contracted out, possibly to people from outside the country. It is a welcome change as it is unnecessary for the State to carry out this function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industry has expressed concern and it is most unsatisfactory for the Government to bring in a guillotine motion to ram the measure through without allowing proper consideration of the points made.  I appeal to the Minister, who is a reasonable man, not to take Report and Final Stages now.  I know the House made an Order but many orders are altered by way of agreement.  The House has been suspended by agreement, to discuss aspects of Bills which were in dispute and hindering progress.  The unhappy atmosphere created by the Government's guillotine motion will not help resolve this matter.  The Minister indicated that <Col N="1724" /> the Order of the House states the Bill must pass at 7 o'clock irrespective of whether all sections or amendments have been debated.  Too often in the past that approach resulted in bad legislation necessitating amendment.  I ask the Minister to agree to take Committee Stage today and Report Stage tomorrow morning.</P>
    <P>Given the Minister's inadequate response we have a duty to do everything possible to improve the Bill and avoid the creation of pitfalls.  We will not be able to do this, as the Minister insists all Stages must be completed by 7 o'clock.  The matter can only be resolved if he puts down an amendment on Report Stage.  Unless the Minister points out the flaws in this amendment so that we can take account of them, a Report Stage amendment put down by us will meet the same fate as this one.</P>
    <P>It has been repeatedly pointed out that this important Bill should include a provision dealing with the new arrangements under the appeals procedure.  It may not have occurred to the Minister or his officials that this was necessary, they may have thought that this was adequately catered for under the Acts. However, this is not the view of Opposition spokespersons and I ask the Minister to defer Report Stage until tomorrow.</P>

Members on this side of the House will do everything possible to <Col N="1725" /> expedite matters so that this amendment is reached on Report Stage.

      <P>This is the third version of what the Deputies are seeking. Deputy Killeen wants to include an amendment which states that the appeals procedure in the Tourist Traffic Act, 1939, shall continue to apply.  For the past hour I have been saying that this is the case in law.  Deputy Andrews said the responsibility for the appeals procedure should be taken from Bord Fáilte and a separate provision included in the legislation.  To the best of my recollection, Deputy Killeen also said that the appeals procedure should be set out in the Bill.</P>
      <P>I was conscious that the scenario outlined by Deputy Molloy could occur and, having discussed the matter at considerable length, I am happy that the provisions governing the appeals process are adequate.

      <P>I move amendment No. 3b.</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The contractor shall be required to have a minimum of five years experience of the Irish industry at the appropriate level.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is fundamental to the Bill.  We have to be careful to keep <Col N="1729" /> within the rules and regulations of our membership of the European Union and that we recognise at all times our obligations as members of the Fifteen.  It is important that there be a requirement that the contractor should have experience of the industry which he is being called upon to operate under this Bill. The Minister and other Members will agree that if the contractor comes from outside the country this Bill makes a nonsense of this requirement and his obligations to the tourism industry on this island.  Will the Minister explain how the tendering process is operated? Will he tell us the number of organisations or persons who have tendered to date, where they have come from and their main areas of operation?  Are they in Ireland, Great Britain or the continental mainland and do they conform to the requirements for people tendering for this fundamentally important role?</P>
    <P>The reason for the amendment is evident. Any organisation applying for the position of contractor should have a minimum of five years experience of the business into which they are contracting. What more reasonable and responsible amendment can be made?  In fairness to him, the Minister is exercising his portfolio well and has the interests of the tourism industry at heart.  The people for whom we cater who operate our industry in the context of this Bill should have a minimum of five years' experience.  The Minister may have a different number of years in mind; we suggest five years but we will be flexible. If the individual selected does not have any experience it will make a nonsense of the proposal in the Bill.  We do not want to see that happen; we want the Bill to be perfect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>We would like to see this provision included in the Bill for three main reasons, the first being that we would like to see a smooth transition to the new system.  Everything possible should be done to ensure that this happens. Anyone conversant with the tourism <Col N="1730" /> industry would have an enormous advantage in this regard, worthy of consideration.</P>
      <P>We would also like to see an Irish applicant having an advantage.  We do not know, however, if applications have been received from outside the State.  The interests of openness and transparency would be better served if information on this matter was made available.</P>
      <P>It is ludicrous that important legislation will be passed by the Oireachtas without specifying the qualfications required by the contractor or employee. These reasons merit debate and we would like to hear the Minister's views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with European Union law, a third party contractor to conduct the process of registration and grading will be selected by way of an open tendering procedure. This means that the position was advertised in the press and the official journal across each member state.  The key criteria to be used in judging tenders were also set out.  These included: the capability to undertake the role, efficiency and reasonable cost within current fee structures, the amount offered by the tenderer to Bord Fáilte for the right to provide a service and to collect associated fees, transparency and objectivity in the service to be provided and accountability for actions.</P>
      <P>The contractor selected should have experience and capable of gaining credibility. These factors will be taken into account before a final decision is made and it is of paramount importance that there is a good rapport between the contractor and the industry.  It is my responsibility to ensure that the procedures laid down are adhered to and that we obtain a quality result.  It is not, therefore, necessary to accept this amendment.  Neither would it be appropriate to include it in the Bill as it refers specifically to the Irish tourism industry. I have received complaints from IBEC that attempts have been made to prevent Irish exporters from exporting goods to other member states of the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1731" />
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree with IBEC that some Irish exporters have had a bad experience but, unfortunately, that is how some countries operate.  I have always made the point that we have been too &ldquo;clubby&rdquo; on various issues.  It is for that reason I reacted from time to time within the club rules when I held various portfolios.  While it is right and proper that we should take our place IBEC is right to complain when exporters are obstructed in conducting their legitimate operations.  I respect its point of view in this regard but there is a difference between the perception and the reality.  Unfortunately, in this instance we have to face reality.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting for one moment that we should break the European Union code&mdash;we are obliged to conduct a public tendering process and advertise contracts in the European Union journal to allow contractors who may be interested in tendering to do so &mdash;but no one will convince me that we will be able to import someone to provide this service.  Tourism organisations in France, Germany and Italy, excellent though they may be&mdash;I have no expertise to judge their competence&mdash;operate in a different environment given the size of the population in those countries.</P>
      <P>We need to select someone who understands our culture and heritage.  It will not be possible to import someone who understands them.  While keeping within the rules we should pay particular attention to an application from a tenderer in this country.  We cannot say that the contractor should be an Irish national although that is what we want to say.  We would be breaking the law if we were to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a clever way of getting over the problem which we must face and understand.  How can we import an organisation that does not understand our ethos, culture and heritage?  This cannot be done.  For that reason we are pressing the amendment which is an important one for the tourism industry. Having discussed the matter with certain elements within the industry who hold strong views on this proposition we <Col N="1732" /> have come up with this clever proposal which is in keeping with our obligations to our European Union partners.  If the French, Italians and Spanish were to conduct a tendering process, all things being equal, their nationals would be given first choice.  That is a matter of experience.  Let us not delude ourselves and go down the road of communitarianism, of which we have been guilty from time to time.  Let us stand up for what we believe in.  I am not suggesting the Minister is doing less than that; all I am saying is that we should stand up for ourselves on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the advertisement for the new contractor and said that certain conditions would apply.  I welcome that.  The Bill would be enhanced if the provision relating to qualifications was clearer and more definite.  Deputy Andrews dealt in some detail with the advantage for a person from this country.  That is a very important point and an attempt should be made to ensure the Irish economy benefits from that provision.  A smooth transition is equally important at a difficult time but a time of great opportunity for the trade is also worthy of consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure whether Deputy Andrews has information that I do not have when he speaks about the Spaniards, French and Italians.  The amendment proposes a requirement of a minimum of five years experience of the Irish industry at the appropriate level.  Does he mean a would-be contractor with four and a half years experience would not qualify?  Considering all the Irish industries that win contracts abroad in services, construction, industry and other areas, their tenders must be much better than the home country tenders, otherwise we would do no business abroad&mdash;74 per cent of GNP depends on exports and it is very important that we have access to other markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Andrews and Killeen referred to the practice of importing <Col N="1733" /> personnel who would understand the ethos, culture and minds of our people. Part of the requirement of this contract relates to experience and qualifications of staff managing and undertaking this function.  Staff should have knowledge of and be experienced in conducting inspections and applying defined inspection criteria.  Ideally, they should also have suitable qualifications and experience in the hotel-tourist accommodation-restaurant industries.  Ability to consistently supply a required level of service in the Republic of Ireland, including making sufficient resources available within Ireland, is also a requirement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews who made a very good contribution on Second Stage said he understood that the tendering process was at a sensitive stage and that he did not wish to express any views on applicants.  He said, rightly, that those involved in the registration and grading process should be adequately qualified and experienced to carry out the relative inspections and advisory role.  He said that the State spent £2.2 million in redundancy payments and asked whether a former employee of Bord Fáilte who took voluntary redundancy would take over this function.  That is hardly a cost effective way to do business. On the one hand, I am being told to be very wary of imported experience and, on the other, the Deputy asks whether a former employee might get the contract.</P>

      <P>The committee dealing with this matter, comprising officials from the Department and Bord Fáilte, will ensure the criteria laid down in terms of experience and qualifications are adhered to.  That is fundamental to the job on hand and I have given the industry an assurance in that regard. With respect to Deputy Andrews who is an experienced campaigner on both sides of this House, it is not appropriate to include a requirement for specific <Col N="1734" /> experience with particular relevance to the Irish industry.  The requirements are published in the official magazine available throughout Europe.</P>

      <P>We are not strict about the 12 months period, each contract could probably be reviewed every two to three years as 12 months may be too short a time for contractors operating the scheme.  When I was Minister for Defence the then Opposition spokesman, Deputy Barrett, tabled an amendment to the Defence (No. 2) Bill requesting that our troops go to Somalia in the context of peace enforcement rather than as a peacekeeping mission to be reviewed annually. As there is a precedent for such review, I ask the Minister to consider it, but we will not fall out if he does not accept it.  It is a point of discussion, but we do not want to obstruct the contractor's operation.  As we do not have an opportunity to table a further amendment given the Order of the House regarding Committee and Remaining Stages, we would appreciate the Minister's response to the amendment as drafted.</P>

      <P>In page 4, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6) Registration officers must attain minimum levels of qualifications prior to appointment.'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To an extent this amendment relates to the earlier discussion on amendment No. 3b.  As the Minister rightly said, the contractor will be required to have a minimum level of qualification.  While that is not set out in the Bill, it will be set out in the advertisement for the position and can be pursued directly with the contractor under those provisions. However, that does not seem to apply necessarily to the person given the status of registration officer under this section.  The amendment seeks to ensure that when a contractor is appointed, and assuming that he or she complies with the necessary requirements under amendment 3b, he will be empowered to appoint employees who will be termed &ldquo;registration officers&rdquo;. <Col N="1737" /> We seek to ensure that such registration officers will be required to have certain qualifications because it would be damaging if a contractor were to employ people who were considered not to have the relevant qualifications to carry out their functions.  The Minister may, and most likely will, say that it is not appropriate to include this provision directly in the legislation, but I tend towards the view that we should err on the side of caution in this regard.  I strongly argue for the inclusion of a certain level of qualification in the Bill, by order of the Minister or very much independently of the contractor's wishes regarding the type of people he might designate as registration officers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that registration officers should have minimum levels of qualification and experience.  It is intended that this will be a requirement although I do not consider it necessary to include it specifically in the Bill.  There is no requirement for the appointment of existing registration officers under the tourist traffic legislation, but Bord Fáilte, as a matter of practice, always applies minimum criteria in appointing such officers.  The contractor will be appointed by Bord Fáilte and a specific and detailed contract &mdash; specifying minimum requirements &mdash; will be drawn up between the board and the contractor.  Obviously Bord Fáilte would not be disposed towards the appointment of unqualified people for a job as sensitive as this one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This case is strengthened by a provision under subsection (5) which states that the board is entitled to revoke the appointment of a registration officer appointed by the contractor where the board considers that he or she is not properly carrying out duties.  If the board were not enabled to do that, the contractor could appoint a registration officer who might be unsuitable for the job and the board would not be able to deal with that officer.  That subsection gives the board that extra authority.  In the context of a contract drawn up between the board and the contractor <Col N="1738" /> minimum qualifications will be specified. That extra power will enable it to deal with the case of an unsuitable registration officer appointed by the contractor. However, I hope that will not arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware there is concern in the industry about the powers being given to registration officers?  It was intended that the horse work in this area should be given to an outside company which would undertake, through its employees, the inspection of the various premises and make recommendations on whether they complied with the provisions of the Bill.  If they complied, they would be registered with Bord Fáilte based on the opinion of the outside contracting firm. However, under this section the Minister is proposing that the outside firm which carried out the inspection, not Bord Fáilte, will be the registration authority.  Has the Minister had representations on this from the industry because he implied in his earlier contributions that the proposals in this Bill had the full support of everybody in the industry and that no concerns had been expressed about them?  There is some concern regarding handing over of the registration function, as well as the inspection function, to the outside authority. When we come to deal with a later relevant amendment there seems to be a contradiction in the powers the Minister is giving to registration officers. Section 8 states:</P>
      <P>References to the opinion of the Board in sections 27 and 30 of the Principal Act and section 32 of the Tourist Traffic Act, 1952, shall be construed as references to such opinion formed by the Board itself and not by the Board acting through or by any contractor or any employee of a contractor.</P>
      <P>The Explanatory and Financial Memorandum states the opposite.  In explaining section 8 it states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 8 provides that the opinion of the contractor, or any employee of <Col N="1739" /> the contractor, that premises are not eligible for registration or have ceased to be eligible for registration will be construed as the opinion of the Board where the relevant functions have been contracted by the Board.</P>
    <P>Section 8 refers to the opinion of the board but the explanatory memorandum refers to the opinion of the contractor. Once the outside company has done its work and decided that a premises should be registered, surely the registration process should be carried out by Bord Fáilte and not by the contractor. Should a registration officer not be appointed in Bord Fáilte to maintain the register of registered companies? That function should not be performed by an outside contractor.  Has the Minister received representations on this matter?  Why has he considered it necessary to allocate the functions in this way?  The industry wants to be assured that ownership of the registration process will rest with Bord Fáilte and not with an outside contractor.  Will the Minister elaborate on the conflict between section 8 and the explanatory memorandum?</P>

What we have endeavoured to do runs parallel with the policy of the Deputy's party.

      <P>If applicants are refused registration they will lose their liquor licence and the appeal process, which is provided for under various Acts, is very cumbersome.  It was suggested during a debate on the matter that a modern appeals mechanism should be established under this Bill, The premises of an applicant seeking a liquor licence for a restaurant must be approved by the inspectorate who will also be the registration authority.  The objective could be met by the outside body carrying out the inspections and submitting recommendations. To retain ownership of the scheme within the ambit of the State structure, would it not be more appropriate if the registration officer was an employee of Bord Fáilte?</P>

      <P>Under existing legislation a registration officer from Bord Fáilte may deem a premises unfit to be registered, inform the proprietor and then the appeals procedure will take place.  Under this legislation the contractor's registration officer will carry out a physical inspection of the premises and if the officer deems the premises unfit for registration the proprietor will be informed of his right to appeal.  A Bord Fáilte registration officer will have the final say in preparing a recommendation to go before the board of Bord Fáilte for final decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">

      <P>It could take months for the matter to come before the courts. This is a very serious matter.  When Galway Corporation was upgraded from a borough council to a county borough, hotels were required to have 20 bedrooms instead of ten.  The proprietors of a Bord Fáilte registered ten bedroomed hotel in the area had a liquor licence but could not renew it without building an additional ten bedrooms.  The premises was closed for 12 months as a result. The loss of a liquor licence in the hotel business may determine whether one remains in business or goes into liquidation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I have outlined the position.  If a licensed premises is deemed unfit for registration, the proprietor can appeal the decision on the premises but cannot appeal the loss of the liquor licence.  However, he can reapply for a liquor licence the following day.  The Deputy raised a practical point <Col N="1742" /> and Bord Fáilte is acutely sensitive to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister is not responsible for the legislation governing liquor licences, but there is a connection between hotel registration and the issue of liquor licences to hotels and restaurants.  Surely the Minister should table an amendment, or have one tabled by the Minister for Justice, ensuring that a liquor licence would not be withdrawn from a hotel or restaurant until the appeal had been decided.  This would seem to be natural justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the new legislation the contractor does not have the right to cancel a registration under the appeals procedure.  With regard to a liquor licence, it would be the general assumption that somebody engaged in the hotel business would intend to do a good job.  Nobody likes to see a place run down to the extent that it would be deregistered.  In the past Bord Fáilte has been very sensitive to any reports about hotels.  That is the position in regard to the liquor licensing law.  The contractor or registration officer will not have the authority to cancel a registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Explanatory and Financial Memorandum states:</P>
      <P>Section 8 provides that the opinion of the contractor, or any employee of the contractor, that premises are not eligible for registration or have ceased to be eligible for registration will be construed as the opinion of the Board where the relevant functions have been contracted by the Board.</P>
      <P>That is the board deciding that he is no longer entitled to be registered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The contractor is <Col N="1743" /> obliged by law to use that term of reference but it is the board of Bord Fáilte itself which will take the final decision in the case of deregistration.  If the registration officer decides that premises are not fit or eligible for retention of a registration certificate, the wording used by the contractor in informing the applicant will be that it is the opinion of the board that his premises are unfit to continue to be registered premises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The contractor is not entitled to cancel his registration. He is entitled only to state that in the opinion of the board his premises are not fit to continue to be registered.  He will then inform the applicant of his right to appeal, whereupon the process of appeal to Bord Fáilte will commence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does he retain his licence for the duration of the appeal?  I thought the Minister had said he did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>He applies for a liquor licence the following day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The day following what? The appeal might last months.  Does the Minister mean the day following the day on which the appeal is decided?  I want to know whether his liquor licence is operative from the time he is informed by the registration officer he is no longer eligible for registration.  Does his liquor licence cease there and then and does it become possible for him to apply for its renewal only after a successful appeal?  If so, this would have major consequences for people within the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bearing in mind the Minister's uncertainty I wonder how much consideration this matter has been given.  It emphasises further the ludicrousness of proceeding with all Stages of this Bill by 7 o'clock this evening.  It is most unfair to the House to resort to a guillotine <Col N="1744" /> motion in this jackboot fashion, to push through this Bill without the industry having had a proper opportunity to study all of its implications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject that remark by Deputy Molloy since this matter has been discussed by the industry to some considerable extent.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, which have been discussed by, among others, the Tourism Council.</P>
      <P>There are two different points in regard to restaurant licence and hotel registration.  For example, if the registration officer deems the restaurant part of the premises to be unfit for continued registration, the applicant will apply for a new licence immediately thereafter.  If a registration officer deems the hotel to be unfit for registration, then the appeals process I have outlined comes into play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>How can he appeal for a new licence if his premises are deemed to be ineligible in that he would not then qualify for a licence?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The House can see how serious are these implications.  One loses one's liquor licence the moment a decision is made that one's premises are no longer eligible for registration.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider tabling an amendment himself or through the Minister for Justice, to allow the liquor licence remain operative until the appeal has been decided.</P>

      <P>We are not living in Utopia. I have exposed a serious flaw in the Bill and very much regret the Minister is rushing to take all sections now and only those amendments tabled by him, which is most unsatisfactory.  The Minister's response has been very poor, with no assurance that he will consider reexamining this matter to ensure that a liquor licence remains operative for the duration of an appeal.  He has given no assurance that the actual registration decision will be one for Bord Fáilte only, and not for an outside contractor, whose function should be merely one of inspection and recommendation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. E. Kenny Mr. E. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already clearly confirmed that the final say will rest with Bord Fáilte.  I have pointed to the earlier Act and read the relevant section into the record.  I do not accept that there is a serious flaw in this Bill.  I have answered a legitimate concern expressed by Deputy Molloy, have said I will examine that aspect which falls <Col N="1746" /> within the remit of the Minister for Justice and talk to her.  I have also pointed out quite clearly that the initial inspection function rests with the contractor but that the final say remains with Bord Fáilte.  That has been made abundantly clear to everybody within the industry. It is enshrined in law.</P>

I am very sorry the Minister did not see fit to accept any of our amendments, which is his prerogative.  He was open and frank with us and his response to our points was helpful, which we appreciate. Obviously our amendments were tabled with the objective of improving the Bill, based as they were on the Arthur D. Little Limited report on the general position of Bord Fáilte.

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy O'Rourke on 20 June 1995:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann, in view of</P>
    <P>&mdash; the fact that the underlying trend in unemployment has worsened since this Government came to office, with the adjusted total in May higher now than it was last January,</P>
    <P>&mdash; the fact that the rate of long term unemployment is the highest in the OECD and that over <Col N="1748" /> half the unemployed are now long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>&mdash; the fact that the Central Bank has upped its unemployment forcast for 1995 by 7,000 and that independent stockbrokers have said the Government will fail by a big margin to achieve its modest unemployment targets for this year,</P>
    <P>&mdash; the fact that there have been unprecedented major closures of industries throughout the country recently and that these crises will further add to the jobless total, and</P>
    <P>&mdash; the complete lack of planning for the County Enterprise Boards,</P>
    <P>condemns the Government and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment for failing to honour their commitment to make unemployment a priority and for failing to tackle unemployment in any significant way and calls on the Government to develop a coherent employment policy aimed at the maintenance and creation of employment as well as giving priority to measures to tackle long term unemployment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, having regard to</P>

    <P>&mdash; the very positive projected growth in output of 6¼ per cent and in non-agricultural employment of 37,000 in 1995;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the notable success of enterprise development agencies at both national and local levels; <Col N="1749" />&mdash; the growing success of the back to work allowance scheme;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the reduction in notified redundancy figures of 25 per cent in the first five months of this year;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the initiation of a local employment service to target long term unemployment; and</P>

      <P>This is the most important motion to come before the House since this Government was formed.  Little or no action has been <Col N="1750" /> taken since its formation.  Our economy is possibly on the eve of bankruptcy due to our handling of the national finances. People are concerned about what is happening and we may see an increase in unemployment because of the Government's inaction.</P>
      <P>The UK market imports 35 per cent of Irish goods including textiles, timber and foodstuffs.  We must be parochial and look after our constituencies.  In my constituency, 60 to 70 jobs have been put at risk because of the Government's failure to provide some type of support fund for companies exporting to the UK who are suffering because of the change in the value of our currency <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This problem arose some years ago and Fianna Fáil came to the rescue of many companies by setting up a market development fund.  That fund saved many companies exporting to the British market.  If this Government wants to save jobs it must recognise the importance of the UK market to our economy.</P>
      <P>I am sure this appeal will fall on deaf ears, as did many others.  We hear about growth in the economy but we do not hear about the projected rise in inflation.  It is predicted by Mr. McQuaid, a reputable stockbroker who deals in Government gilts that by the end of this year inflation will rise to 3 per cent because of this Government's mismanagement of the economy.  He stated that inflation would run at over 3 per cent by the end of the year.  Riada Stockbrokers made a similar statement. That is the trend in this economy and it is the frightening scenario facing foreign investors wanting to invest here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems at Irish Steel have been there for so long it is frustrating to talk about them.  I am sure the Government is only waiting for the doors of this House to close so that it can close the doors of Irish Steel, as happened with many industries in the Cork region <Col N="1751" /> including the Ford Company, Dunlop, Verolme Cork Dockyard, etc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>History is repeating itself.  This Government is not interested in employment, particularly in the Cork area.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks, Ministers have made announcements in Clonmel and other areas in regard to technology.  The work on those industries had already been done before this Government came to power and it is merely engaging in cosmetic exercises now.  It is trying to play to the public because of the by-election but I know where its future will lie following the by-election.</P>
      <P>Much has been said about unemployment but we have had nothing but crocodile tears from the Government on this issue.  It talks about a third banking force which will take an additional 600 to 700 people off the live register.  The creation of a third banking force will not solve the problem of unemployment.  It is merely an ideological aspiration of the Labour Party.  There is no future for a third banking force in our society.  It will not decrease the cost of borrowing to taxpayers by even 1 per cent but it will create further inefficiency in the financial market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I sympathise with the people in the Trustee Savings Bank who are not interested in participating in a third banking force.  Borrowers and investors have identified with the Trustee Savings Bank since its inception when it was known as the &ldquo;Shilling Bank&rdquo;.  I am aware of the views of the staff of the Trustee Savings Bank and they are not in favour of the creation of a third banking force which will result in increased unemployment.  If that is the type of policy this Government wants to pursue, it disturbs me and I am sure it disturbs the electorate.  I have no doubt the Government intends to sell the liquid assets of the Trustee Savings Bank to an Australian bank.  The Trustee Savings Bank <Col N="1752" /> has served the economy and the Irish people well.  Such a move will threaten the jobs of the 700 to 800 people working in the Trustee Saving Bank.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister with responsibility for employment &mdash; or unemployment &mdash; to respond to my comments on the banking sector.  How does she propose to rationalise the bank without the loss of jobs?  They are the questions I am being asked and I would like the Minister to give me a response to them.</P>

      <P>There is not enough time available to me go into all of the aspects of the problems associated with unemployment. One aspect, however, has not been mentioned and it relates to the more informal economy.  I attended a function today to celebrate the first birthday of <i>The Big Issue.</i> An exhibition was held in the multimedia centre in Ormond Quay. The producers of <i>The Big Issue</i> were interested in measures that would help the long term unemployed get back into the formal economy and, in so doing, retain wealth in local areas.  They were not interested in hearing meaningless economic jargon, but in opportunities to exchange skills and to work in what is becoming known as a local exchange trading system.</P>
      <P>
        <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> carried a feature on that system which is working well in areas severely affected by unemployment where people have the skills, and the time but not the money.  That system is proving to be a real alternative to the jargon and the false promises made by a succession of Governments. People find they not only manage to keep wealth in the area by having tokens but they can exchange them for skills.  The skills are as diverse as those found in the formal economy.  They include also caring jobs that are not paid for in the formal economy such as caring for the young, the old, the sick and jobs that people do voluntarily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Government to take on <Col N="1753" /> board the potential of measures offered by the LETS system.  Job creation initiatives need to be increased but should not entirely overshadow other measures that people in the long term unemployed bracket come up with and which help them to get back into the formal economy without the assistance of State agencies.</P>
    <P>In the conventional sense a great deal can be achieved through employment creation in horticulture, energy conservation, renewable energy and other areas that I am keen to see developed but these should not be the only measures.  Other measures should be adopted such as a guaranteed basic income, of which the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, is very well aware from the informal discussions we had. This should be taken on board by Government and perhaps she will do something about it.</P>

      <P>This motion deals with a very serious matter.  I find it difficult to agree to motions tabled by Fianna Fáil in Private Members' time.  As a party, Fianna Fáil found it difficult to believe it was in Opposition for three months but six months later Fianna Fáil is finding it difficult to believe it was ever in Government.  On reading this motion one would wonder whether Deputies O'Rourke, Tom Kitt and Ned O'Keeffe were ever members of a party that was in control of the economy since February 1987.  In their eight years in Government all of these problems had to be faced and most of them are as serious as they were eight years ago.  We do not need lessons in history from Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, and his colleagues, because his party was in office and failed.  We are left to pick up the pieces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The confused economic policies being <Col N="1754" /> enunciated by Members on the Opposition benches show clearly how difficult they are finding their time in Opposition. I hope they will have a long time to get used to it.  On the one hand Deputy Ned O'Keeffe calls for further control of public expenditure but he then lists all the matters at constituency and national level that require further funding.  He cannot have it both ways. He cannot scream for additional public expenditure on pet projects and at the same time demand the Government prunes public expenditure.  The Government is making a genuine and firm bid to keep the economy in trim and ensure the twin evils of unemployment and high taxation are dealt with in a constructive fashion.  Much progress has been made in those two areas in the 1995 budget and I look forward to further progress being made in the budgets of 1996 and 1997.  I concede readily that any country with 300,000 people unemployed officially or in job schemes which are not equivalent to full time employment would have to keep unemployment at the top of its priorities.</P>
    <P>Most Members would remember that a former Fianna Fáil Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, said that if unemployment reached 100,000, his party should leave office.  At that time it would have been unbelievable to have 100,000 people unemployed here.  Things have changed so much in the interim that if unemployment could be reduced to 200,000 it would be seen as a move in the right direction.  The grave problem remains and must be tackled.</P>
    <P>Our rate of long term unemployment is the highest in the OECD I am happy the Government is pursuing a strategy to attack the problem of long term unemployment.  Last night Members referred to the difficulties that the long term unemployed are in.  We have to look at the root cause of the problem. Education and training play a vital role for people who are unemployed for more than 12 months.  An untrained person who is unemployed cannot get experience and if he applies for a job, <Col N="1755" /> his application is not considered credible. Every possible State agency must gear itself to addressing the problems faced by these people.  Unemployment is a huge problem for the State but long term unemployment is a cancer on society and for those who must endure nothing but dole queues week in week out over many years.  It creates social as well as economic difficulties and I hope this Government keeps the plight of the long term unemployed at the top of its agenda when preparing policies.</P>
    <P>While I welcome community employment schemes, I think they need to be redefined and changed so that they are more than a beacon of hope for those who have been unemployed for a number of years.  The conditions of entry, the duration and the monetary reward for participating in community employment schemes need to be reviewed.  At a time when so many are unemployed and when, simultaneously, we have many community and social problems needing attention, we need to marry the work that needs to be done with those who are available and willing to do it.  I look forward to the Government making progress in that regard.</P>

      <P>The shadow of unemployment has hung over this country for far too long.  At present 16 per cent of the workforce is unemployed.  This is, to say the least, a distressing statistic for the Labour Party and one which we are committed to rectifying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Job creation is the cornerstone of the Labour Party's economic philosophy. Since Labour entered Government in 1992 unemployment has fallen steadily as a result of Government intervention and accelerated economic growth.  Last year employment grew by 30,000, and it is expected that this year employment growth will again exceed 30,000. However, Labour believes that it is wrong to rely totally on the market to create jobs.  Market forces, on their own, even with a favourable economic environment, are not sufficient to solve unemployment.  Intervention by the <Col N="1756" /> State in the marketplace is essential if we are to confront the economic issues of job creation.</P>
    <P>An example of this attitude in practice is the introduction by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, during his time at the Department of Enterprise and Employment of a strategic plan designed to give people the opportunity to obtain employment.  A further example of this Government's commitment to the eradication of unemployment is its acceptance of the central recommendation of the recent interim report of the Task Force on Long-term Unemployment which called on the Government to put in place a local employment service to meet the needs of the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>If Fianna Fáil had been as committed as the Labour Party now is to tackling unemployment while it was in Government, perhaps the task that the Government faces might be that bit easier.  Let me remind Fianna Fáil that in the five and a half years it spent in Government as a single party or with the Progressive Democrats, unemployment increased by 36,675, hardly an indication of a concrete commitment to the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>I would also like to remind Fianna Fáil that in June 1990, when the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Reynolds, sold Verolme Dockyard, which is in my constituency of east Cork, to a Dutch company he promised that the yard would employ 450 people by 1996. Fianna Fáil never delivered on this promise and, to date, not one of these 450 jobs promised by Fianna Fáil has been created &mdash; Fianna Fáil handed over a major asset for little or no return. During the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition, planning permission to build a chemical factory in the village of Killa, County Cork, was turned down by the then Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Harney, to Merrill Dow on the strength of protests by a certain section of the local community. <Col N="1757" /> Merrill Dow has since set up this chemical factory in Italy creating employment for 300 to 400 people.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to Irish Steel is also an illustration of its commitment to maintaining employment. This commitment will be proven in the not too distant future when a partner will be decided by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  The Labour Party has always been committed to the continued survival of Irish Steel and has proven this over the years. The party insisted that the company be protected by the State until it became a viable concern, which it now seems to be.  The jobs in Irish Steel are now secure in the long term, and this is due in no small way to the Labour Party and the Government.  Irish Steel is now a leading example, not only to semi-State companies but to companies in the private sector, of what can be done when there is commitment to the survival of a company.  I also commend the commitment of the workers and management in Irish Steel to the survival of the plant.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment will accept the recommendations of the task force set up by the Minister, Deputy Quinn, when he was in that Department.  I am sure that this task force will enhance the job prospects in areas such as Cobh, Midleton and Youghal and the east Cork area as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party will continue to ensure that job creation remains the core of this Government's activity.  We accept that unemployment is a social fact here.  We do not, however, accept that it cannot be overcome, and the Labour Party is committed to ensuring that it will be overcome.</P>

      <P>This important debate deserves to be taken seriously.  I enjoy a bit of knock-about humour but Deputy O'Keeffe's performance tonight did nothing for the unemployed.  Sound and fury in tackling one's opponent is all very well, and it often passes for politics here, but what was the policy, where <Col N="1758" /> was the beef?  There was no policy evident in the Deputy's contribution.  He came in here as an important speaker for his party to contribute something, attacked all around him with a blunderbuss of scattershot but said nothing positive or constructive that the unemployed would want to hear about finding a job.  Even one good idea towards finding an answer to unemployment would have been a good contribution to the debate.  The reality is that there is no panacea, no simple formula for creating jobs.  It is a most difficult policy area for us as a small marginalised country on the edge of Europe.  It is very difficult for us even to survive in the fast lane we are in, but we owe it to ourselves as a nation and especially to our unemployed to find a way forward and to use whatever intelligence and resources we have in answering those problems. Deputy O'Keeffe offered no answer and no solution in what he said tonight.</P>
      <P>I intended to refer to a very important document which was published one year ago today by the National Economic and Social Forum. Unfortunately it is now gathering dust. Ms Maureen Gaffney was the chairperson and the title was &ldquo;Ending Long-term Unemployment&rdquo;.  It would pay anybody in this House to read that document because it is full of good and sensible ideas.  I had ticked off a number of points I wished to make about it but I will put those aside because of the time factor.  Instead I will make some points that, perhaps, should have been made earlier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Too often in the past, unemployed people have been stigmatised and marginalised in our society, and we do not understand that if we have been Members for a long time.  After six to 12 months' unemployment self-esteem and self-confidence vanish.  People are often shabbily dressed and pushed into the margins in housing and social status.  It is very hard then to build up morale, verve and flair to tackle unemployment. If one is in the swim, if one has a goose, one gets a goose; if one has no goose it is quite difficult.  Anybody who has been <Col N="1759" /> unemployed knows that very well.  We, as an Oireachtas should understand that and tailor our policies to overcome it. People should be brought in from the margins of life and made to feel part and parcel of society in a meaningful way.</P>
    <P>I understand tomorrow is the birthday of &ldquo;The Big Issue&rdquo;.  I intend to go to the Mansion House to help to cut the cake.  That is an example of what can be done.  Even though it is a very small thing, I commend what they have done at a time when newspapers are going out of circulation and magazines are drying up.  It is a sprightly magazine which shows what the unemployed can do to help inform public opinion at a time when many journalists, young and not so young, some with no track record, slavishly follow a certain line and pontificate about things about which they know little or nothing.  We also have born again radicals who preach to the Labour Party about what should be done while their own records look more like a rake's progress in politics than anything else, but that does not stop them telling us what we should and should not do.  I support the unemployed people who are involved with &ldquo;The Big Issue&rdquo;.  I intend to launch a Limerick issue of it next month when they come down to sell their paper there.</P>
    <P>Apart from that, we must do more in the area of food processing.  We cannot go on exporting cattle on the hoof.  A balance must be found between selling cattle on the hoof and processing meat in our factories to create employment at home.</P>
    <P>The question of training must be examined.  The budget of FÁS, training in the community, doing something for the community in the community must be examined in a clear way.  Not only vocational courses should be provided in vocational education committees, regional technical colleges and FÁS training centres, local history courses would bring people back to studying.  It is difficult for someone who left school <Col N="1760" /> 20 years ago to study for six hours. Courses should be made more relevant to people's lives.  People have a right to education.  For too long adult education has been the cinderella of the system and there is no reason for not addressing that area.  Many musicians are unemployed at a time of changing musical tastes.  The talents of unemployed musicians, poets and artists could be used by the community.  There is no reason for the federation of musicians not to support the idea of a group of people playing music at different centres for the unemployed on civic occasions and paying them accordingly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for allowing me share time.  Deputy Kemmy is a genuine and concerned voice for the unemployed and the poor.  I find it difficult to address this motion following the gruelling time we have had in Cork recently.</P>
      <P>Many of my friends are unemployed and I was unemployed for a time.  I know what it is like to live within tight budgetary constraints.  Unemployed people are not &ldquo;the unemployed&rdquo; as if they were somehow different from us. They are people who do not have a job. Many of them live in the hope of getting a job.  Unemployed people are stigmatised and marginalised.  Deputy Kemmy said &ldquo;that if one has a goose one gets a goose&rdquo; and that is correct.  One is far more likely to get a job if one is already employed.  One suffers comments such as, &ldquo;that shower would not work even if they were offered a job for two hours a week&rdquo;, &ldquo;they are all defrauding the system&rdquo; and &ldquo;they do not care&rdquo;.  None of my friends or those I know who are unemployed fit into those categories.  It is offensive to use this group of people as a political football.</P>
      <P>There is not any one solution to unemployment and unless we are all determined to create a climate of employment we will not solve the problem. It is up to society to ensure everybody receives their just share of what society has to offer financially, socially or environmentally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1761" /> Unemployed people do not wish to be categorised or used by politicians who they feel have failed them.  Whether or not we believe it, all politicians are classed as being the same and this debate illustrates why that is so.  It is because of the insensitive way we treat people and how they live their lives.  We fail to recognise that when we speak about a group of people we are talking about mothers, fathers, children, their homes and their way of life.</P>
    <P>The amnesia which Fianna Fáil suffers will pass.  When that party was in Government between 1992 and 1994 unemployment fell by 11,000.  During the first six months of this Government the number fell by 11,200.  I do not understand that party's concern at present.  We will not be thanked for treating unemployed people as a political football and I do not intend to do so. We must protect existing jobs and encourage and invite others to create employment opportunities.  No one, no matter how arrogant, brassnecked or self-righteous, can stand over the unemployment figure.  To claim a Government can solve the problem in six months is unfair and untrue.</P>
    <P>We think the problem is caused by social ills, so we throw money at that area yet the problem continues to grow. Perhaps we should divert funds into the economic area.  The motion states that Ireland has the highest unemployment rate of all the OECD countries but it omits the statement by the OECD that unemployment in Ireland will fall from 14.8 per cent to 13.6 per cent.  We must not quote selectively.</P>

      <P>I support this motion on the serious issue of unemployment and I wish to give a few examples of the situation in my constituency of south <Col N="1763" /> Kerry.  In response to a parliamentary question tabled by me yesterday the Taoiseach said that last December there were 3,223 unemployed in south Kerry while the figure for May was 2,573.  This excludes the Kenmare-Sneem area where there is an extraordinarily high level of unemployment.  I was surprised to learn that the figure for the Kenmare-Sneem area is included in the figure for Tralee.  In the Killarney area 1,326 people were registered as unemployed in May as against 1,214 in May 1994.</P>
      <P>The figure for May was calculated long before the decision was taken to close the Pretty Polly factory in Killarney. This factory was closed with the full knowledge and consent of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  The closure of this factory has been a massive blow to Killarney, the 152 employees, the business community and the local economy generally.  The way the closure was announced was a matter of great concern.  It was made by a Dublin based firm of public relations consultants late in the afternoon last Thursday week when the Dáil had adjourned. There was no opportunity to have the matter debated in the highest public arena in the land, Dáil Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many observers take the view that because of its heavy investment in tourism and its success in attracting visitors there is no need for industrial employment in Killarney.  Nothing could be further from the truth, and the same applies to the Kenmare-Sneem area of south Kerry.  The season is getting longer and the shoulder periods are better than they were five or six years ago &mdash; these improvements are due mainly to the priority given to the industry by the last Government &mdash; with the result that many people employed in the industry commence work at Easter but they are back on the dole by the following October.  The impact of the tourism industry on employment in the Killarney area can be seen from the figures supplied to me yesterday in response to a parliamentary question.  The Minister <Col N="1764" /> stated that last December there were 1,733 people on the unemployment register whereas in May the figure was 1,326, a decrease of 400.  A fair percentage of these people took up employment in the construction sector.</P>
    <P>The unemployment situation in Killarney, the Kenmare-Sneem area and in other towns throughout my constituency is very serious.  Yesterday I tabled a question to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment asking him if he would set up a special task force for Killarney so as to resolve the serious unemployment problem in the area.  I am bitterly disappointed at his rejection of my suggestion, at his statement that it was not necessary to establish a special task force and that the agencies which failed to provide additional employment in the past year will work closer together so as to maximise job opportunities.  I am firmly convinced that a special task force should be set up to resolve the unemployment problem in Killarney.</P>
    <P>The unemployed include well educated young people with a great knowledge of technology.  The experience of the Pretty Polly employees should be availed of by those agencies in their efforts to maximise job opportunities and attract a major industry into the area.  The special task force I proposed could assist voluntary organisations such as the UDC, SIPTU, the Chamber of Commerce.  Killarney Resource Group, the Killarney Jobs Creation Forum and others who are doing their best to attract industry into the area but which do not have adequate finance to travel abroad or adequate expertise to canvass industrialists.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed that nothing has been done to attract industry into the area since the Minister's predecessor received a deputation from Killarney UDC approximately one year ago and gave an assurance that Killarney would be placed at the top of the list.  Since then industrialists have come and gone, and the failure of the IDA to fill a 25,000 square foot advance factory in the industrial estate in Ballyspillane must be questioned.  What role does the <Col N="1765" /> Minister and his Department play in determining the final destination of industries set up here?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the way she lectured us about the need to adopt a responsible attitude, I wonder if Deputy Lynch has had a bionic change in the past six months.</P>
      <P>Unemployment is one of the few issues on which practically everyone is in agreement.  We have all stressed the critical need to create and secure new jobs and to protect existing employment to the greatest possible extent.  The dramatic breakthrough in Northern Ireland last year has ensured that effectively tackling unemployment is now at the top of the national agenda.  We are continually told by Government spokesmen that this issue is being given top priority at Cabinet.  Given that responsibility for dealing with the matter rests fairly and squarely with the Government one would like to believe it is at last beginning to develop cohesive and effective policies for job protection and creation.</P>
      <P>However, when one looks for tangible evidence of the Government's success in this area one is almost reduced to despair.  There is increasing evidence that the Cabinet does not have any coherent policy or strategy for dealing with companies in crises.  In recent months there has been a succession of company closures and serious disputes. It is very easy to give examples of these &mdash; the Sunbeam factory in Cork, the Pretty Polly factory in Killarney, Packard in Tallaght and the Irish Press group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be unfair to lay the blame for all these problems at the door of the Government.  Factors such as changes in the marketplace and internal management and financial problems can pose a danger for the largest of companies from time to time.  It serves little purpose, therefore, to immediately place responsibility for industrial problems at the door of the Government.  However, it is both fair and proper to critically evaluate its response to such crises.  If recent examples are anything to go by, <Col N="1766" /> then the present Administration seems to be in total chaos.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the closure of the Sunbeam factory in Cork.  Since last Christmas my colleagues and I repeatedly asked the Minister to respond rapidly and effectively to protect the jobs in this factory.  Following a number of false starts last week we were relieved to hear that at least 100 jobs would be saved.  We were willing to give credit to the Minister for responding to the problem. However, a few days later we were told that only 50 jobs would be initially provided in the new enterprise.  This raises a simple but vital question: have the lines of communication in the Minister's Department completely broken down or is the unemployment problem in the north side of Cork city of little or no interest to him?</P>
    <P>Having observed its response to a succession of industrial crises over the past six months, it is difficult to avoid reaching the conclusion that the Cabinet is totally paralysed in terms of developing and implementing industrial policy.  The enormous policy differences between Fine Gael and Democratic Left are leading to stalemate on a wide range of issues.  One has only to look at the fiasco in regard to the third banking force to see evidence of this.  We have been hearing for months of a total stand off by the rainbow partners on this extremely important matter.  The country cannot afford a Government which is continually at sixes and sevens on industrial policy.  I have no wish to indulge in political point scoring on this matter as too many families and individuals are suffering grievously from unemployment.</P>
    <P>Politicians have a responsibility to develop comprehensive policies to ensure that the tide of unemployment is rolled back once and for all.  If the Government wishes to retain the slightest degree of credibility on unemployment it must act immediately to limit the enormous damage already done by its expensive disintegrated policies to date.  All available State resources must be used to fight unemployment.</P>

      <P>I regret Deputy Lynch has left the Chamber.  I recall what she said a short time ago in Opposition about the lack of employment and I marvel at how easily she sits in Government.  On occasions she can be pro-Government and when it suits her and her colleagues they can stand back and oppose once more.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the recipe for community schemes dished out by Deputy Lynch this evening.  If that is the way to tackle unemployment it leaves much to be desired and we cannot look to the Government with confidence to produce the necessary policies to ensure inward investment or indigenous growth.  She asked people to rely on community schemes as a means of sustainable employment within society. Democratic Left talks about the marginalised and yet when it had an opportunity to look after them it gave them an increase of only 2.5 per cent.  When the people received their increases this week they knew exactly the value of 20p.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Government came into office it has gone from crisis to crisis.  I could instance Packard, Sunbeam and the <i>Irish Press.</i>  I will avail of this opportunity to refer to the difference in treatment meted out in certain parts of the country.  If jobs are about to be lost in a Minister's constituency, Ministers will be seen strutting in front of Leinster House, looking for every camera and microphone they can find and they will travel abroad in an effort to do something. Let us look at what happened in sharp contrast in Cork in the case of Sunbeam.  For an Adjournment Debate two Ministers preferred to sup with Prince Charles than to present themselves here to deal with an extremely important employment issue in the Cork area.  The Minister told us he had found a maximum of 100 jobs but when we got down to the nitty-gritty the following week he told us there would be only 50 jobs.  The people of Cork are very annoyed at the treatment meted out to them by the Government.  They see no future in terms of the confidence <Col N="1768" /> or the investment to be generated by the Government to combat the serious unemployment problems in Cork&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Lynch is suffering a crisis of identity because sometimes she thinks she is in Government and other times that she is in Opposition.  We find it difficult on occasion to understand where she is coming from.  The Government must give a commitment to the Cork area which has been starved of investment and is now denuded of a senior Minister. We are in dire need of investment. Will the Minister listen carefully to what is being said from the Cork area?  Will the Minister relay to the Cabinet that nothing is happening in the Cork area and that the Government will be held responsible if nothing is done to eradicate the scourge of unemployment there?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this very important debate because the high level of unemployment in society is destroying this country, its potential, its communities and its families.  If we take the numbers on the live register, those on community employment schemes and those in the pre or early retirement category effectively we have 350,000 people unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I give some of my views on how we might tackle unemployment I wish to correct something which was said earlier by Deputy Mulvihill. Deputy Mulvihill seems to think that Ministers decide who gets planning permission. He said that when I was a Minister of State in the 1989-92 Government I refused planning permission to Merrill Dow in east Cork.  Planning permission is a matter for the local authority in the first instance and, on appeal, a matter for An Bord Pleanála.  Deputy Mulvihill's party took credit for the establishment of An Bord Pleanála in the mid seventies.  It is true that I opposed the location of Merrill Dow and I did so at <Col N="1770" /> an early stage, unlike recent Ministers, because it was not in the interests of the environment and because the location was opposed by the food sector, the farming community and the tourism sector in east Cork.  It was not a question of not being able to have Merrill Dow but to have it in an appropriate location.</P>
    <P>As the Culliton report said it is in the interests of the economy to strive for the highest possible environmental standards because those sectors of our economy that have the potential to grow and to create jobs in food, agriculture and tourism are extremely dependent on a clean green environment.  It is important when deciding on the location for an industry that has potential, if not properly run, to cause major problems for the environment, to handle the matter in a sensitive and appropriate way.  We can have jobs and a clean environment.  It is not a question of either or.  Deputy Mulvihill should acknowledge that and ask his candidate in Wicklow what he thought of the stand I took on that occasion.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulvihill also took credit for saving Irish Steel.  To the best of my knowledge Bishop Magee and the taxpayers will be responsible if Irish Steel is to be saved.  We must recognise that taxpayers will inject £50 million or £156,000 per job into Irish Steel when the question of its viability and the viability of the steel industry in general is in doubt.  The problem of Irish Steel is by no means solved.  The European Commission has not yet had its say on it.  Deputy Mulvihill needs to put the record straight on these matters.</P>
    <P>There is much debate and much concern among workers about casual work. While casual and part-time work suits some employees most people want full-time regular employment.  If we are to be honest about casual work, we must realise it is happening because of excessive levels of taxation on work, the amount of bureaucracy and red tape and some labour legislation.</P>
    <P>I know of a retail sector employer in a midland town who recently had good <Col N="1771" /> reason to know that five of his employees were involved in a major theft.  He was certain of it but under our labour legislation he could not do anything about it unless he established a provable case.  He had to install expensive surveillance equipment and hire a private detective.  When the gardaí were brought in and the matter went to the District Court all five employees either pleaded guilty or were found guilty of the major theft.  Not being happy with that, one of the employees appealed the case under a rights tribunal.  The rights tribunal despite the fact that the employee had been convicted of theft in our courts, found in favour of the employee that appropriate procedures were not followed when the employee was being dismissed although it made a nil award.  Not happy with this, the employee decided to appeal to the courts.  After much advice the employer decided he could not afford to go down the road of litigation and had to settle. Many others have had the same experience.</P>
    <P>Employers find that they are not operating in an employment friendly country.  We have 150,000 small owner-manager companies.  These have the potential to solve our unemployment crisis but only if incentives are provided to encourage them to expand and employ others.  For example, under labour legislation every employee has the right to be paid in cash.  This is not realistic in 1995 when almost everyone has a bank account, there are high crime levels and major thefts of money in transit.</P>
    <P>On the question of taxation, a single person taking home £172 per week pays £5,000 per annum to the State in tax and PRSI.  That penal level of taxation is anti-work and destroying the country.  A single person also pays 57 per cent of their marginal earnings in tax and PRSI. Is that sensible in a country with such a high level of unemployment?  We tax work as if it were a luxury.  This is something we are trying to stop.  A married man with four children earning £8,000 <Col N="1772" /> per annum would lose a couple of hundred pounds if he were to receive an increase of £7,000 bringing his salary to £15,000.  This does not make any sense.</P>
    <P>When I raise the issue of tax reform I am often asked where the money will come from.  It has been forecast that during the next three years the economy will grow by 6 to 6.5 per cent per annum.  This means that the Government will gain an extra £1 billion in revenue. If this were used to reduce the burden of taxation on work we could slash income tax by about 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to Packard Electric.  Out of a total wage bill of £15 million in 1994 workers paid £5.5 million in tax and PRSI.  If this plant were located in Newry in Northern Ireland the company would save almost £1 million per year in payroll costs.  In the context of the peace process, this economy, in which employee costs are 20 per cent higher, is not competitive.  Unless we do something about this we will not be able to encourage labour intensive industries to locate here and will lose out to Northern Ireland in terms of inward investment.</P>
    <P>I recently met an employer in a prestigious haulage company which employs almost 100 people in Dublin in the services sector.  Because of the licence requirements the typical employee is in his twenties or thirties, married with a number of children.  Despite the fact that the basic wage is £230 per week plus expenses of £8 per day &mdash; £40 per week &mdash; and there are opportunities for overtime, he has found it impossible to recruit employees.  While people are prepared to work part-time or take up employment if some of their wages are paid under the counter or if they are employed in the black economy, this employer is not prepared to engage in that practice.  He is not unique; I have been told similar stories by many other people.  Our tax and welfare systems do not offer sufficient incentives to encourage people to take up employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State believes that people are better off unemployed than in jobs for which they are not paid high <Col N="1773" /> wages.  A basic wage of £230 per week plus expenses of £40 is a reasonable income given the competition our companies have to meet in the global economy. If we fail to make it worthwhile for people to take up jobs this country is doomed to further disaster.  There is no point in saying that the fundamentals of the economy &mdash; high growth rates, low inflation and interest rates &mdash; are right if we are not going to tackle the problem which is destroying the economy.  The real economy is not successful.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the Dunnes Stores dispute about which Members on all sides are concerned. Great hardship is being experienced by workers and their families and also by suppliers, many of whom may have to close down.  This also applies to many of the businesses in those shopping centres where Dunnes Stores is the anchor tenant. I appeal to management to come to the table as no dispute can be resolved unless there is negotiation and discussion. Yesterday the Minister of State said she had made contact with Margaret Heffernan's office.  I hope she will respond in a positive way.  Dunnes Stores owes it to its consumers and workers to be reasonable.  It has an enviable record in meeting consumer needs. It will be a great pity if it fails to respond quickly in a positive way to resolve this dispute.</P>
    <P>Under section 67 of the 1946 Industrial Relations Act the Labour Court has the power to examine the matter and make a recommendation.  It is well respected as an independent body.  The industrial relations mechanisms and apparatus are highly regarded.  I hope the Labour Court will use its power to make a recommendation.  This could have the effect of bringing the parties to the dispute closer together.  To judge from the advertisement in the newspapers today there is little separating them.  MANDATE has adopted a reasonable attitude.</P>
    <P>Under the 1991 legislation the <Col N="1774" /> workers may also ask the Labour Court to intervene.  Even if the other side fails to come to the table the court is free to make a recommendation.  It would be a good thing if the Labour Court and the industrial relations apparatus which are respected were used to bring the dispute to a speedy conclusion.</P>
    <P>Dunnes Stores must realise that if its customers move to other stores they may not return quickly.  During the next few days consumers will make choices and it may not be easy to win them back.  People should forget about their pride, stop burying their heads in the sand and, in the interests of everyone concerned, come to the table.  If they fail to do so we should use the apparatus at our disposal.</P>
    <P>Labour Government throughout the world, particularly in New Zealand, see the reform of taxation as a major way of encouraging job creation and restoring incentives to encourage both employers and entrepreneurs.  We need to do that in this economy.  For every ten people at work there are 22 dependants.  Of the ten people at work eight are in the private wealth creating sector.  They have to support 24 others.  This gives a ratio of 1:3.  In Denmark, for example, the ratio is 1:1.  This is one of the reasons taxation is so high and it is necessary to do something imaginative and radical as a matter of urgency.  We need to change our attitude to enterprise and employment.</P>
    <P>It must be understood that while Government do not create employment they have the capacity to destroy it, to stifle enterprise and initiative, prevent job creation, increase bureaucracy and red tape.  I have questioned the Minister for Enterprise and Employment closely.  To every question he has either given no answer or indicated that a task force, committee or interdepartmental group has been established to carry out a review.  That is not what we need; we know what the problem is. What we require is courageous and effective action and decisive decision <Col N="1775" /> making if we are to overcome the obstacles in the economy which prevent us from giving so many people the opportunity to participate in the development of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the last speaker it would be easy to forget that Deputy Harney's party was in power for three years and that when my party entered Government at the start of 1993 we inherited the tax system bequeathed to us by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats regime.  During the period when Deputy O'Malley was Minister for Industry and Commerce the total number of unemployed increased.  Since the Labour Party entered office the total number at work has increased by 54,000 to the end of last year.  It is forecast that the number at work will rise by a further 31,000 this year.  In the same period the total number unemployed has decreased by 20,000.  We have focused in particular on the low paid.  By reducing taxation and providing money for benefits such as children's allowance we will help to create employment.</P>
      <P>A number of pro-work budgets have focused on the low paid.  Employers' PRSI was reduced in two successive budgets.  We reduced employees' PRSI, which contributes to the tax wedge.  The marginal relief rate was reduced from 48 to 40 per cent, benefiting workers just above the tax exemption thresholds.  We increased the tax exemption thresholds and extended family income supplement for people in low paid employment. By next September child benefit will have increased by 44 per cent since the Labour Party went into Government. That payment, made regardless of whether the parent is working, is a very important part of the strategy to eliminate the unemployment trap in which people with limited earning power find themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A couple of years ago 44 per cent of people with four or more children were out of work.  It is important to focus on <Col N="1776" /> the difficulties facing families with children and to provide a method of child support, regardless of the work status of parents.  Since we came to office considerable funds have been provided for child benefit.</P>
    <P>We have a very healthy economy, with a forecasted growth rate of 5 to 6 per cent to the end of the century. However, we still have a huge unemployment problem, about which we are all concerned.  In trying to find solutions to that problem it is important not to play politics with it.  I established the National Economic and Social Forum, bringing together politicians of all parties with the traditional social partners and the unemployed to devise a strategy to tackle unemployment, particularly long term unemployment.  General macro-economic policy has improved the growth rate of the economy as a whole.  Without special strategies to tackle long term unemployment the long term unemployed may stay permanently outside the workforce.  It is particularly important to devise a strategy to bring these people back into the system.</P>
    <P>In drawing up the National Development Plan I made a special effort to devote substantial sums of money to a programme of economic development for unemployment blackspots.  The pilot partnership scheme which applied initially to 12 areas was extended to 33 areas, the worst unemployment blackspots in the country.  The programme was aimed at building economic potential based on a partnership with the local community.</P>
    <P>The report of the National Economic and Social Forum on long term unemployment identified two important elements: first, the establishment of a local employment service that will utilise existing resources in training and placing long term unemployed people, assess their economic strength, rebuild their economic potential and give them an opportunity to go back into the workforce through a programme modelled on the Contact Point initiative in Coolock and the jobs centre project in <Col N="1777" /> Ballymun, by ensuring that long term unemployed people have access to a fair share of vacancies in the open market. As recommended in the report, the local employment service is being established.</P>
    <P>The second element involves the development of job opportunities in the non-market economy for the long term unemployed.  The task force is due to report next October and we will act on that report as speedily as we acted on the first report.</P>

      <P>Usually when we come to this stage of a debate, particularly on employment which is the most fundamental issue facing the economy, we have the opportunity to outline the salient, constructive and important points made by the Minister of the day, in this case Deputy Richard Bruton. While we may not agree on all matters there should be substantial points of agreement.  However, having studied the Minister's contribution it is difficult to find any policy of substance.</P>

      <P>The Minister upheld what this Government considers one of its pillars, transparency.  His speech was so transparent it was difficult to find anything of substance in it.  That surprised me because having served with Deputy Bruton on a number of committees over the years I always found him full of ideas and committed to implementing many of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Since he became responsible for the Department of Enterprise and Employment I have been surprised at the Minister's lack of initiative, but there are reasons for that and I will deal with some of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister concentrated his speech on statistics &mdash; I always take a jaundiced <Col N="1778" /> view of the use of statistical facts selectively taken out of context to underpin one's contribution.  He does not initiate policy in his Department, as was clear from his speech which lacked authority and was full of statistical revelations but no substance.</P>
    <P>Economic growth has been sustained in recent years.  There has been an increase in employment and a corresponding reduction in unemployment. This year more than ever there was an opportunity to maximise employment growth, but six months into the term of this Government that has been its most glaring failure.  We are not even achieving minimum employment growth.  Predictions &mdash; which the Minister did not dispute in his speech &mdash; that unemployment in the current year will be substantially out of kilter with Government projections are being realised.  The conservative estimate is in the region of 7,000 people, which will put great pressure on the Government.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister &mdash; I hope he takes this in the best sense because I understand his position in terms of sharing power with two other political parties, particularly as their persuasion is of the left &mdash; that he is clearly answerable to his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  He seems incapable of making decisions and taking action without having to answer to Deputy Rabbitte.  Knowing the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and having seen him perform over the years, it is clear he is not implementing the policy decisions that would be implemented if he was in an unfettered position.  That is the great tragedy of this Government.  I would have thought that he, more than anybody else in the Fine Gael Party, recognising that his party lacks authority in Government, would use his skills in the Department to establish an identity for the party.  However, he has abjectly failed in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is no decisive leadership in the Department of Enterprise and Employment. That is evident in respect of a range of issues in which the Government was involved in recent months. <Col N="1779" /> Many Government Deputies suggested there was no single simple solution to reducing the numbers unemployed.  I agree but that seems to be the only excuse offered by Government speakers. They did not say the Government has many opportunities to reduce the numbers unemployed and to create growth.  In that regard it is not doing its job.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, was absent for the preparation of the 1995 budget.  There is no evidence in the 1995 fiscal policy put forward by the Government that employment creation was anywhere near the top of its agenda.  Where was the Minister when that budget was being prepared?</P>
    <P>I wish to put two points to him in that regard.  On public expenditure, the Minister is aware that if a public expenditure growth policy is pursued, it is not possible to create jobs because the Government is restricted in its ability to reduce taxation on employees and employers.  Not alone did the Government do that in its targets, but it has practically run amuck since, in setting a ceiling of 6 per cent, which is now approaching 11 per cent.  Where was the Minister when that budget was being prepared or did he allow such a policy to be implemented by the Minister for Finance and the Government to the detriment of a real attack on reducing unemployment?  There was no evidence in the budget that the unemployment problem is a Government priority.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, was one of the principal speakers in the National Economic and Social Forum on the importance of the service sector industry. We know, and do not have to repeat, that the greatest prospect for growth in job creation is in the services sector.  One of the key conclusions on that sector &mdash; I want to refresh the Minister's memory on the report published on the services sector &mdash; was the fact that the services sector is, and will continue to be, the principal contributor to <Col N="1780" /> net employment creation.  That means that it should be better targeted if the scale and nature of this country's unemployment problem, particularly in regard to the long term unemployed is to be more decisively addressed.</P>
    <P>One area that was the subject of considerable debate during those discussions was corporation tax as it applied to the services sector.  What did the Government do?  It took 2 per cent off the gross figure of 40 per cent and made no effort to reduce corporation tax on the small and medium sized enterprise to sustain and encourage them to grow and to give them more funds to plough into job creation.  It favoured the large institutions.  The banks benefited most from the Government's largesse.  It is extraordinary that such an approach was adopted by Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton.  We know that large institutions are shedding jobs as modern technology drives their businesses and reduces the need for employees.  We are achieving growth in small and medium sized enterprises.</P>
    <P>The report on the services sector states that a selective and lower tax regime for certain designated labour intensive services is essential.  The Minister, his Department and the Department of Finance ignored those recommendations of which the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, has spoken so laudably here and elsewhere.  She mentioned the local employment service sometime ago, but like all Government initiatives it seems to be at the planning stage.  We cannot get anything off the ground.  We are waiting for one item after another to be dealt with, but the Minister for Enterprise and Employment has not taken a hard policy decision to deliver on them.  We had examples of that this evening.</P>
    <P>The way the report of the Competition Authority was dealt with by the Minister who is present was deplorable. I wonder if he read the legislation on competition here or the EU general competition legislation.  If he had, he <Col N="1781" /> would know that under that legislation he has the opportunity to put forward arguments which can allow for a dominant position to be maintained in the market where the preservation of jobs is at stake and the consumers' interests may be better served by allowing such a position to continue.  I am not coming down in favour of one or the other, but the Minister has failed in this regard by not publishing the full report of the Competition Authority.</P>
    <P>I accept that it alone may not necessarily have been able to solve the difficulties in the Irish Press group, but it would have contributed to a more enlightened debate on the issue.  His approach in dealing with the Irish Press was deplorable.  The Minister has failed the workers and in terms of the Irish Press titles, a considerable number of people.  He stood back and hid behind the Competition Authority's report as if to pretend to all and sundry that his hands were tied behind his back when he had, and still has, many options to deal with the dispute.  He wants others to deal with it and present a <i>fait accompli</i> to him before he enters the fray rather than being the leader of his Department on industrial policy, job creation, unemployment reduction and ensuring that industries with real capacity are sustained.  The Minister has not addressed any of those areas.</P>
    <P>We have put forward matters of substance. The ideas are contained in so many reports that they could fill this Chamber and we have enunciated many of them.  The Minister is a policy maker and is in charge.  He has enunciated <Col N="1782" /> ideas and policy suggestions month after month in this House, but he has failed to bring forward one concrete proposal that will be effective.  Where he has had an opportunity to do, he has allowed others to have their way thereby reducing his influence in Government and his ability to significantly reduce the numbers unemployed.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the dispute in the Dunnes Stores group.  Again, we have had an indication that the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, is primarily responsible.  She, along with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Government, have failed to publish their proposals on Sunday trading.  We are in the middle of a major strike that has had serious repercussions not only for Dunnes Stores employees, but for many suppliers whose jobs depend on Dunnes Stores?</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the Department is paralysed and unable to adopt a leadership role on that issue.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, may smile, but the answers to these questions rest with her and her colleague but are not being given.  The Minister is trapped in that Department, answerable to his colleagues on the left and driven by ideology.  The epitaph of this Government and the Minister of State when she leaves office will read, &ldquo;I was there but was unable to do anything because the ideology of my colleagues of the left persuasion was more important than reducing unemployment and creating real employment&rdquo;.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Virginia (Cavan) Sewerage Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very grateful for <Col N="1785" /> the opportunity of raising this issue on the Adjournment this evening.  I am glad to note that the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Allen, is here to respond.</P>
      <P>There is urgent need to provide a new sewerage scheme in Virginia, County Cavan.  The present scheme which is totally inadequate, was provided in 1935 catering for a population in the region of 300 whereas the same scheme now serves a catchment area with a population of 1,500.  When installed in the 1930s there were 110 connections to this sewerage scheme.  I understand that there are now upwards of 300 connections, including one to a vocational education school with 400 students, hotels and industries.</P>
      <P>Further developments are proposed for Virginia, County Cavan, including a nursing unit for the elderly, approved in the lifetime of the previous Government &mdash; which will I hope, come into operation before the end of this year &mdash; with a 30-bed complement.</P>
      <P>In response to a parliamentary question I tabled to the Minister for the Environment on 27 April last, he confirmed that the Virginia sewerage scheme was included in the River Boyne catchment scheme for which an application for Cohesion Fund assistance was submitted to the European Commission by his predecessor in December 1994. The Minister said he expected a decision to be taken on the Cohesion Fund application by early June.  I hope he has by now received a positive reply from the European Commission because there is an urgent need to approve the contract documents and to invite tenders so that work can commence on the scheme without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appealed previously to the Minister to ensure that work commenced on the scheme before the end of this year, which I repeat this evening.  There is urgent need to have this scheme approved in view of the widespread development in Virginia since the original sewerage scheme was provided. There is also an urgent need to protect <Col N="1786" /> the quality of the water of Lough Ramor.</P>
    <P>Put simply, the present sewerage scheme in Virginaia poses serious danger to this nearby, renowned waterway. Our sanitary services urgently needed in Virginia must be of a standard that will not contribute to pollution. I hope the Minister of State will be able to inform me that this scheme is progressing rapidly and that there will be a successful, early outcome to the application for assistance from the Cohesion Fund lodged in 1994.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister Deputy Howlin I thank Deputy Smith for raising this matter. I know he attempted to raise it last night also but we were interrupted.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the need to extend and improve the sewerage system in Virginia, which discharges to Lough Ramor and ultimately to the wider River Boyne catchment.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, considerable progress has been made in recent years with the provision of water and sewerage infrastructure in County Cavan.  A water supply scheme has been completed at Belturbet at a cost of just over £2 million, and a sewerage scheme at Bailieboro for over £1 million.  Two major water supply schemes are under construction: the Ballyjamesduff regional water supply scheme, costing an estimated £6,652,000, and the Bailieboro regional water supply scheme, at a cost of some £6,302,00.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards new schemes, the planning of the Ballyjamesduff sewerage scheme is being progressed; this has been included in an application to the EU Commission for finance under the Cohesion Fund in respect of the Lough Ree catchment protection scheme and the Minister is confident of being able to advance it shortly.  The Ballyconnell sewerage scheme, which is estimated to cost just over £1 million, has already been approved for funding under the EU initiative, INTERREG II.  Under this programme also, another eight <Col N="1787" /> small schemes, including water and sewerage schemes have been approved for funding and these are estimated to cost £660,000.  I hope the Deputy will agree that all of this represents a considerable investment for water and sewerage infrastructure in County Cavan.</P>
    <P>The proposed sewerage scheme for Virginia has been included in an application to the European Commission for financing under the Cohesion Fund; the overall application is for the River Boyne catchment protection scheme.  A decision on this application should also be available shortly.</P>
    <P>The existing sewage treatment plant, situated on the northern shore of Lough Ramor, is acknowledged to be inadequate for today's needs.  It was installed in the late 1930s to cater for a population of between 200 and 300.  The present population is over 1,500 and the plant is now unable to cope.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to provide secondary treatment, which will relieve the problem of overloading of the existing sewers and eliminate flooding.  The new scheme is being designed to cater for an estimated population of 2,000 people and will include the construction of a new sewage treatment facility, pumping station, rising main, sewer, storm overflow and outfall pipe.  Phosphate removal will also be provided to prevent enrichment of Lough Ramor and improve and protect the water quality of the lough.  The scheme, which is at contract document stage, can be advanced quickly following a decision by the Commission on the Cohesion Fund application for the River Boyne catchment protection scheme.  The Minister is confident that the scheme can progress shortly and that it will bring much needed improvement to the scheme.</P>

      <P>Thank you, for allowing me to raise this serious and difficult <Col N="1788" /> educational topic.  I would prefer to put my points to the Minister for Education although I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, is a very able Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware of the difficulties experienced by families whose children have been debarred from school because of disruptive behaviour and the serious lack of back-up facilities for the schools, the parents and the students involved? Because of the lack of such facilities, many schools refuse entry to certain students and that has inevitable knock-on effects.</P>
      <P>The Green Paper on Education stated that the problem of erratic behaviour, which is serious in some schools, and of disruptive behaviour, have a variety of causes which must be looked at in a caring and concerned way.  We must create a more supportive environment.  To alleviate adverse factors will require co-ordinated efforts by all concerned including health and social welfare agencies, the Garda Síochána, local communities, parents and educational interests.</P>
      <P>One of the main supports for students and parents should be the school psychological service.  What has happened at national school level this year in particular will not give any solace because the Eastern Health Board, in the absence of the Department of Education taking on responsibility for psycho-educational assessments, has operated under the following constraints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, referrals are to be made only through area medical officers, that is, school doctors, speech and language therapists or social workers who have already conducted a preliminary assessment of the child.  Referrals through the local general practitioner will not be accepted.  Second, teachers who are concerned about the academic performance of a child should prepare a report on the child describing his or her main difficulties. That written report must be presented to the school doctor when he <Col N="1789" /> or she screens children in the school. Referrals will no longer be processed without this written school report. Third, in order to ensure that an efficient effective service is provided for children with special needs, children experiencing a mild delay in the acquisition of reading, writing and spelling skills should not be referred for assessment if they have access to remedial facilities within their school.  Parental consent must be sought before a referral is processed through the school doctor or other referral agents.  Parents should also be informed of the waiting list and the fact that they will not be offered a second appointment if their initial appointment is defaulted.</P>
    <P>Everything militates against a child being helped.  In some cases, it can take up to three years before a child is attended to.  So much, therefore, for early intervention.  Every educationalist and every parent knows how essential intervention is in dealing with these difficulties. There is not any back-up services at secondary level.  There is a huge gap in the services available to our children. The rhetoric of commitment to equality of treatment in education is empty unless there is a co-ordinated psychological service available to all schools independent of the health boards.  This is essential at second level. It is not good enough to direct schools to have their own code of discipline without ensuring adequate supports are in place.  Can the Minister of State give an assurance that these difficulties will be addressed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education recently introduced a pilot scheme under which special counsellor teacher posts have been allocated to assist certain schools in addressing difficulties with disruptive pupils.  A total of 27 counsellor teacher posts have been allocated under this initiative to schools serving disadvantaged areas.  This pilot scheme has been introduced in Dublin inner city schools and also in schools in the Tallaght and Clondalkin areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House and the Deputy will be <Col N="1790" /> aware that the report of my Department's Working Group on Truancy was published in April 1994.  One of the issues highlighted in that report was suspensions and expulsions from schools and the working group made a number of recommendations on this matter.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of the truancy report, my Department has received a range of submissions from interested parties on the measures which should now be taken to address this difficult area.</P>
    <P>In keeping with its commitment to address the problems of truancy and early drop-out, the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, has been given special responsibility for this area by the Government.  The House will be aware that as a first step in the process of addressing this problem, the Minister of State Deputy Currie announced the establishment of a task force within the Department.  The terms of reference assigned to that task force are to examine the submissions received from interested parties in response to the report on truancy, and to consider and make recommendations as to future action required to address the problem of truancy at first and second level.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the task force will furnish its report to the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, shortly.  At that stage, it may be necessary to broaden the forum in which the issues involved are discussed and to involve a range of Departments and agencies in addressing the problem.</P>
    <P>It is evident from the truancy report, that truancy, non-school attendance and related matters are complex issues that demand a comprehensive solution. Minister of State, Deputy Currie, believes that this solution can best be achieved by a mix of legislative, administrative, educational and social measures.</P>
    <P>With reference to the school psychological service, the Minister for Education has given a commitment to extend such a service to primary schools generally on a phased basis.  Progress is <Col N="1791" /> being made to fulfil this commitment. There was a pilot development of a psychological service to primary schools between 1990 and 1993 in two designated areas, west Tallaght-Clondalkin in Dublin and in south Tipperary.  When the pilot phase ended in 1993 the service in the two areas was established on a permanent basis.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, the Minister announced her intention to begin to extend the school psychological service to primary schools generally.  This extension has begun now with the recruitment of nine additional psychologists earlier this year.  As a result, it has proved possible to begin the development of a psychological service to primary schools in three new areas in Dublin: Dublin north west, Dublin central north and in Dublin central south.  In addition, services have begun in Cork city and in Limerick city.  In extending the school psychological service, priority is being given to schools serving disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>It is hoped to recruit further psychologists later this year to continue the development.  The number recruited will, of course, be limited by the resources the Government is able to provide for the purpose and by the availability of suitably qualified personnel.</P>
    <P>The White Paper on Education, <i>Charting our Education Future,</i> recognises the fundamental importance of an effective system of assessment to ensure the earliest possible identification of pupils with special needs.  Although some children will have been identified as having special needs before commencing school, the classroom teacher carries the major responsibility for identifying and responding to learning difficulties.</P>
    <P>The White Paper also states that all primary schools will be required to develop a policy on assessment within the framework of the school plan.  The role of the school psychological service is to support teachers and schools in developing their assessments where <Col N="1792" /> such is required and to advise teachers and parents on the help and support which pupils with special needs require.</P>
    <P>In future, as envisaged in the White Paper, the provision of school psychological services will be one of the functions assigned to the regional education boards.  In the meantime, and while the establishment of these boards is being prepared, the development of the school psychological service will proceed on a phased basis.  The existing school psychological service to post-primary schools will also be maintained. However, in due course, there will be a fully integrated psychological service right through primary and post-primary school.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the responsibility for arranging psychological assessment for primary school pupils will remain with the regional health boards, in areas where the school psychological service has not yet been developed.  The extension of the school psychological service should be of benefit to the health authorities in reducing the demand for psychological assessments for educational purposes.  It will also mean that the school psychological service will be available to pupils, teachers and parents in their own schools.  This will bring the service much closer to those needing it.</P>
    <P>The development in the recent past, with the plans for the future, will result in a well-functioning, readily available, comprehensive school psychological service in the future.  This is a development which has been thought necessary for many years past.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise the plight of the <i>Irish Press</i> journalists who since the day they were locked out by the <i>Irish Press</i> management on Friday, 26 May have not been in receipt of wages and are now being denied their social welfare entitlements.  Irish Press Newspapers Limited had not paid out holiday or <Col N="1793" /> back pay owned to these journalists and the Department of Social Welfare has informed the journalist who signed on for unemployment benefit on 28 May that the Journalists are not entitled to it as they are involved in an industrial dispute.  That decision is the subject of a social welfare appeal.  I understand the unfortunate workers were told they would have a decision within two days of last week's appeal hearing but have not yet heard the outcome.</P>
      <P>Exclusion from unemployment benefit because of a trade dispute has become extraneous in the case of the <i>Irish Press</i> journalists and, as the Minister well knows, the company is in no position to trade or offer work to the locked out journalists.  I honestly believe they are being treated shabbily.  The journalists involved are in a social welfare limbo. They are precluded from claiming unemployment benefit, they are being turned down by community welfare officers for assistance, any back payments owed to them by the company are frozen and even their entitlement to basic statutory redundancy is dependent on whether the company is able to pay them and, if not, they will have to wait for State payments to come through.  In the meantime people have to feed their families and pay the mortgage or face the threat of losing their homes.  Many families are in severe financial straits.  The very basic income that the State guarantees its citizens is being denied them.</P>
      <P>I had meetings with the group of unions at the <i>Irish Press</i>&mdash; last week and the <i>Irish Press</i> directors admitted that the dispute with journalists brought forward the liquidation of the company by only two days.  Obviously they are not in a position to reopen the newspapers without a substantial injection of capital.  On 3 June the company announced it was meeting its shareholders to discuss whether it would start the process of liquidation and on 6 June the company announced its decision to liquidate on 28 June, 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These unfortunate people are locked out.  They have no money, they have no pay and are treated very shabbily by the directors of the <i>Irish Press</i> and it is <Col N="1794" /> regrettable that they are being treated shabbily by the Department of Social Welfare.  There is no valid reason these people are not entitled to their due payments and I call on the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, and his Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, to intervene.  These people have suffered enough.  Why punish people who have been a very important arm of the democratic institutions of the State?  I call on the Minister to intervene in this sad situation to ensure that they get their basic entitlement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan) Bernard Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Walsh for affording me the opportunity to place on public record my reply to this important issue.  Social Welfare legislation provides that persons involved in a trade dispute are not entitled to receive unemployment payments for the duration of the dispute. Persons not participating in or directly interested in the dispute are exempt from this disqualification.  However, it is open to a person who is disqualified to claim supplementary welfare allowance from his local health board in respect of his-her dependants for the duration of the dispute.</P>
      <P>Where persons who have lost their employment arising from an industrial dispute claim unemployment payments the procedure is to select a case representative of the persons concerned and apply the decision in this &ldquo;test&rdquo; case to the other applicants.  This is done with the agreement of the workers and their representatives and is a practical way of obtaining an early and uniform decision on all applications.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the Minister, Deputy De Rossa and I are deeply conscious of the hardship and concern of the people who are out of work and without an income arising from this dispute, in particular the plight of journalists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Minister not resolve it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the onset of the industrial dispute between the National <Col N="1795" /> Union of Journalists and Irish Press Newspapers my Department advised both the union and the company of the proposed approach and sought information on the background to the dispute.</P>
      <P>On Friday, 26 May 1995 local offices of the Department were advised that applications from non-journalist staff who had been laid off that day and who were not directly involved in the dispute could be approved for payment.  In fact, there are some 450 such workers currently claiming unemployment benefit from my Department.</P>
      <P>An application from a journalist for unemployment benefit was selected as a &ldquo;test&rdquo; case and submitted to a deciding officer on 31 May 1995.  The deciding officer determined that the applicant had lost his employment by reason of a stoppage of work because of a trade dispute and was directly interested in the dispute and was, accordingly, disqualified from receipt of payment for as long as the stoppage of work continues. This decision was then notified to all offices of the Department.  The person concerned appealed the disqualification on 1 June 1995 and was afforded an oral hearing of his case by the Social Welfare appeals office on 15 June.</P>
      <P>At the appeal hearing the appellant was represented by an official of the National Union of Journalists and had a full opportunity to present his case.</P>
      <P>The appeals officer has today issued his determination and has upheld the decision of the deciding officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social Welfare legislation also provides that a person involved in a trade dispute who is dissatisfied with the decision of a deciding officer and the appeals officer may apply for an adjudication on the matter to the Social Welfare Tribunal.  The tribunal is a statutory body which was set up in 1982.  The purpose of the tribunal is to adjudicate on cases of employees who are dissatisfied with a decision under the decisions and appeals machinery disqualifying them from receiving unemployment benefit or assistance on the grounds that they are involved in a trade dispute.  The tribunal investigates cases where it is <Col N="1796" /> alleged that a person was unreasonably deprived of his or her employment by an employer who failed or refused to utilise negotiating machinery normally available for the settlement of disputes. If the tribunal decides that this was in fact the case it can determine that benefits are to be paid.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the person concerned and his representatives to decide whether a case should be submitted to the tribunal.  All I can say at this stage is that the services of the tribunal are available to the employees concerned.</P>
    <P>I understand that the board of Irish Press Newspapers has decided to convene a extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders on 28 June 1995 for the purposes of appointing a liquidator to the company.  Any decisions made by the shareholders with regard to the future of the company and its workforce could affect the entitlements of the persons concerned to unemployment payments and will be taken into account by my Department in reviewing their entitlements.</P>
    <P>It is important to refer the case to the tribunal as quickly as possible as this is the next stage in the machinery for processing such cases.  It goes without saying that the Government is concerned about this and anxious to see an amicable and early resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I thank the Chair for the opportunity of raising this issue on the Adjournment and the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, for coming to the House.  I hope he will be able to clarify a number of matters that I intend to raise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be at present in Wicklow a certain amount of confusion about announcements made by the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, and the Minister, Deputy Barrett, over the last few weeks.  At a time when we hear much talk about transparency, openness and accountability, the people of Wicklow do not feel there is much of it about. On 23 May the Minister announced an allocation of £1.5 million for Arklow <Col N="1797" /> port development.  Also on 23 May £0.5 million was announced for Wicklow port development and on 7 June £2.3 million was announced by the Minister, Deputy Barrett, for coastal protection at Bray.  These allocations amounted to a total of £4.3 million.  The people in charge of the projects understood that they would be allocated this amount of money.  Now it seems to have been reduced from £4.3 million to £2.8 million. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, could explain the vanishing millions.</P>
    <P>When the announcement of £1.5 million was made for Arklow harbour development, the people in charge understood that the full amount would be allocated by the Government.  On the strength of the announcement the harbour board called a meeting and had a celebratory drink.  However, during the last week they received a letter from an official in the Minister's Department explaining that the allocation of £1.5 million has now been reduced to £700,000 and they themselves will have to come up with £800,000.  Arklow port has spent about £267,000 on dredging in the last few years and there is little likelihood of the harbour board coming up with the amount of money now expected by the Department of the Marine.  They have informed me that, because of lack of funds, they will be unable to proceed further with the project.</P>
    <P>The same is true of Wicklow harbour and in regard to coastal protection at Bray.  The allocation here has been reduced from £2.3 million to £1.6 million. That means the locals will have to come up with £600,000 which is practically impossible.</P>
    <P>I am not alleging that there was any deliberate misleading of the people involved in the three projects, but there was a perception in Arklow, in Wicklow and in Bray that the full amount of money would be made available to them through 48 per cent funding from the EU and 52 per cent funding from the Government.  The letters they have received from civil servants in the <Col N="1798" /> Department during the week indicate that this is not the case.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was on this side of the House, he was very vocal in stating that county councils were strapped for cash and would be in no position to raise matching funds.  If they are expected to come up with the amount of money the Minister is talking about now, these projects will not be able to proceed.  I ask the Minister to clarify the position because there is confusion in Wicklow.  I have been canvassing there for the last three or four days and the people are very cynical about the role of politicians and this type of announcement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>They are very happy with the money.  They did not get it before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Wexford</i>): They had the impression that this money would be given in full, but now they find the amounts have been halved.  In the <i>Evening Herald</i> yesterday a local Deputy, my good friend across the House whom I have always found to be an honourable man, Deputy Kavanagh, admitted that grant announcements were misleading.  There is confusion, but whether it was created intentionally I do not know.  It is important that the Minister of State clarify the situation for the people who are about to embark on these projects because they have made it clear to me that it will be impossible for them to come up with the amount of money expected and the three projects will have to be shelved because of lack of funding.  The Minister must re-examine the matter to see how increased moneys can be made available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for raising this matter and affording me an opportunity to set the record straight.  Recently, there have been reports, repeated by Deputy Browne tonight, that the Bray coastal protection scheme and the investment programme for Wicklow and Arklow ports are in jeopardy.  These reports are <Col N="1799" /> inaccurate and mischievous.  All these schemes are proceeding, as announced publicly on 23 May and 6 June.  There has been no change in any of the projects.</P>
      <P>The Bray coastal protection scheme will cost £2.3 million.  EU grant aid of £1.725 million from the Environmental Services Programme 1994-99 has been allocated to the project.  This is 75 per cent of the total cost which was the allocation publicly announced by the Minister and me on 6 June.  The balance is being provided by the local authorities who are well aware of the funding arrangements and with whom the Department of the Marine has been working on the design of schemes for some time.  The scheme will be undertaken on a phased basis over a three year period.  The first phase will commence this year.</P>
      <P>An investment programme of £1.5 million of Arklow Harbour and £0.5 million for Wicklow Harbour was announced on 23 May 1995.  The press release which announced the approvals stated that EU grant aid of £0.72 million in respect of Arklow and £0.24 million in respect of Wicklow is expected towards the works, subject to the projects meeting the criteria for EU aid set down in the Transport Operational Programme. This is 48 per cent of the cost of the projects which is the maximum EU aid level permitted under the programme. This rate of aid was fixed by the last Government in 1993 when the national plan 1994-99 was drawn up.</P>
      <P>This is the standard funding arrangement for all investment in regional ports announced in recent weeks.  In this respect, Wicklow and Arklow are treated no differently from other ports in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the current by-election campaign in Wicklow, it was suggested that I originally announced a 100 per cent <Col N="1800" /> grant for both ports.  No such announcement was made by me as any examination of the press releases issued by the Department of the Marine will confirm. There is no such thing as a &ldquo;100 per cent grant&rdquo; for port development.  EU funds must be matched.</P>
    <P>In the vast majority of cases, matching funds are provided by the port authority. Certain regional ports, including Arklow, have indicated they have financial difficulty in matching the EU funds and having regard to the importance of these ports to the local economy, I have asked them to submit their proposals for funding the investment programme.</P>
    <P>Once I receive these proposals I will assess the options for ensuring that the balance of the funds are available to enable the investment programme to proceed.  In addition, I commissioned an independent financial study of the ports to recommend on the long term funding requirements of the ports and how these can be achieved taking account of the planned capital investment programme.</P>
    <P>Arklow Harbour Commissioners have asked to meet me and I will meet with a deputation from the commissioners tomorrow.</P>
    <P>This is the first time in decades a Government has approved a major investment programme in Wicklow and Arklow ports.  I am disappointed that the Government's efforts to revitalise the long neglected port of Arklow are being distorted in the course of the Wicklow by-election campaign.</P>
    <P>I look forward to receiving proposals from both Arklow and Wicklow Harbour Commissioners for financing the investments which have been approved so that we can proceed to the next stage of the process.</P>
    <P>The investment of £1.5 million in Arklow port and £0.5 million in Wicklow port which have been approved will proceed as announced publicly on 6 June.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 22 June 1995.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 34 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>The issues raised by the Deputies are matters for the boards and management of Córas Iompair Éireann, Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath.</P>
      <P>I have been advised that while Bus Éireann is fully aware of the desire on the part of people with disabilities for the introduction of fully accessible buses, the company considers it would be difficult to justify the costs associated with such a venture.  Road conditions in some areas are also seen as a limiting factor.  For these reasons I understand that Bus Éireann has no immediate plans to introduce wheelchair accessible buses in Cork or elsewhere on its service network.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath are conscious of the need to achieve the maximum degree of accessibility while operating a cost-effective public transport system.  In this regard, <Col N="1640" /> approximately 50 per cent of the Bus Átha Cliath fleet is designed to the recommendations of the UK advisory committee mentioned by the Deputy. The proportion of user-friendly vehicles will automatically rise as the company's fleet is renewed.  Similarly, the corresponding Bus Éireann figure, just over 12 per cent of the urban fleet at present, will increase with the acquisition of new vehicles, all of which will comply with the recommendations in question. While these recommendations do not apply to vehicles operating long distance services, I understand that Bus Éireann's coaches achieve a high standard of accessibility.  For example, 60 per cent of the fleet now incorporates a facility whereby the front of the coach may be lowered to facilitate access.</P>
    <P>I have asked that the two CIE bus companies, as a matter of policy, will continue to accord high priority to affordable accessability improvements in their fleet replacement programmes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that six member states of the European Union have been in negotiation with the United States with regard to the possible conclusion of individual &ldquo;open skies&rdquo; bilateral air-services agreements.  The question of whether such action by the member states concerned contravenes European Union law would be a matter ultimately for the European Courts to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In April this year the Commission put forward a proposal for a Council decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations with the United States in the field of air transport.  There <Col N="1641" /> is at present no consensus on the appropriate way forward, with some member states favouring the continuation of bilateral negotiations and others favouring a common EU approach.  The issue of how best to proceed in regard to aviation relations with the United States was discussed at a meeting of the Council of Ministers in Luxembourgh yesterday, 20 June 1995.  Council agreed that the matter should be examined in detail by the aviation group comprised of high level officials from the Commission and member states with a view to bringing forward final proposals during the Spanish Presidency on how best to proceed in this area.</P>
    <P>I believe that a detailed examination of the practical considerations involved may lead to solutions on the issue of principle.  A detailed assessment of the proposals in the draft Commission mandate is required in order to fully assess the implications of a common approach. While the issue is complex and not without difficulties for all concerned, we have indicated that we are committed to finding an agreed way forward and will work with the Commission, the Presidency and other member states to this end.  I strongly believe that seeking consenses rather than confrontation is the most appropriate way to proceed with this issue in the interests of European aviation.</P>
    <P>This viewpoint was strongly expressed during yesterday's discussions by the Irish delegation.  I am happy to say these views were well received. While intensive work remains to be done during the Spanish Presidency, yesterday's work was a step in the right direction and should help to avoid unnecessary confontation between the Commission and the member states in the legal area.</P>

      <Quest>the action, if any, he proposes to take to ensure that the large tracts of cutaway bogs becoming available from Bord na Móna operations will be put to beneficial use.</Quest>
      <QRef>[11386/95]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Bord na Móna operates on a total peatland area of over 80,000 hectares, primarily in the midland counties but also in County Mayo.  The extraction of peat by Bord na Móna from its production areas results in areas of cut-away bog being created.  These are areas where it is not economic to continue the removal of peat.</P>
      <P>Over the yeas a number of studies into the possible use of cutaway bog have been undertaken, which have yielded useful pointers for the future. Research into the potential long term uses of industrial peatlands has tended to concentrate on the agricultural and forestry potential of the emerging cutaways. A preliminary assessment has indicated that up to 30 per cent of the eventual cutaway peatlands will not be suitable for either agricultural or forestry purposes but that they will have considerable potential for the creation of wetlands, wilderness and wildlife habitats.</P>
      <P>As a result of the most recent study on cutaways, the report of the Independent Expert Committee on Cutaway Bogs which reported in 1991, Bord na Móna ensures that cutaway bogs converted to grassland are disposed of in small lots to allow small farmers the opportunity to acquire such land. Coillte Teoranta no longer has first option on cutaway bogland suitable for afforestation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expert committee recommended that the planning and development of the amenity-environmental areas of cut-away should be based on sound ecological principles and the process of accumulating the knowledge to establish these principles should commence as soon as possible.  In this context my Department has included a measure in the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme for Ireland 1994-99 which will entail the undertaking of <Col N="1643" /> studies into the regeneration of certain cutaway peatlands.  Cutaway developments will also be established involving the creation of 1,000 acres of new wetlands and around 500 acres of wildlife habitats.  The total cost of the measure, which will be managed by Bord na Móna, will be approximately £2.2 million of which 50 per cent will be grant-aided by the EU.  The completion of this project should add immeasurably to our knowledge of the principles undermining the planning and development of amenity and wildlife areas and will form the basis for future development of Bord na Móna's cutaway peatlands.</P>
    <P>As a condition of the disbursement of Structural Funds towards the cost of the new peat-fired power station for the east midlands I have agreed with the EU Commission that Bord na Móna will be required to implement a development plan for the bogs supplying the new station after the peat is extracted, dividing areas between coniferous forestry, deciduous forestry, grassland and wetlands.</P>
    <P>Finally, I stress that there will be no significant areas of cutaway available until after the end of the decade.  All areas available to date have been developed for grassland, coniferious forestry and, in recent years, some wetland areas.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 14, 25 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>As part of the tripartite cost and competitiveness review in the ESB, McKinseys undertook benchmarking studies to examine how the board could deliver its services in the most cost-effective way. The consultants estimated the overmanning in ESB at 2,900 by reference to best practice elsewhere.  The consultants concluded that this represents scope for gross savings of £120 million to include an approximate £80 million reduction in payroll costs and an additional £40 million to be saved in non-payroll costs. However, when offset by necessary increases in networks investment, the total net savings would be £100 million. The Government has required the ESB to take all necessary measures to achieve as much as possible of the savings identified by McKinseys within a two-year period.</P>
      <P>My Department is, of course, represented on the Cost and Competitiveness Review Steering Group which monitors progress on negotiations between the ESB management and unions.  However, my Department has no direct role in the negotiations themselves and, therefore, has no input into decisions about ESB's operations and services throughout the country &mdash; such decisions properly being the responsibility of the ESB management.  My Department's responsibility is to represent the shareholder and promote the cause of the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that I have had a number of meetings with ESB management and unions recently with a view to bringing the CCR to an early successful conclusion.  My most recent meeting with ESB management and unions was on 15 June.  As a result of that meeting all sides reaffirmed their full commitment to a successful conclusion of the CCR.  It was agreed that <Col N="1646" /> negotiations under the CCR would continue and that I would meet both sides again on 27 June next.  I am fully committed to an early and successful conclusion to these negotiations.</P>
    <P>My announcement on 6 June last of major Government decisions concerning the electricity sector will help to build on the drive for efficiency within the ESB.  The decisions encompass a range of issues affecting the electricity sector and take account of expected European Union legislation on the Single Market for electricity.  I am hopeful that the statement of the Government's policy will give added impetus to the early conclusion of CCR negotiations. At my meetings with the ESB unions on 15 June last I took the opportunity to clarify points they had raised on the Government decision.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>I should explain that matters relating to the location and nature of BGE's headquarters are for the Board of BGE. The Gas Acts do not confer any powers on the Minister in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I have made inquiries with BGE and have been informed as follows. In August 1992 BGE invited six <Col N="1647" /> architectural firms to submit tenders-proposals for a design team to undertake a redevelopment-extension of the existing headquarters facility at Inchera, Little Island, County Cork.  Following this process, a firm of architects, together with their back-up team, including quantity surveyors, were appointed.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, land at Little Island which BGE had hoped to purchase was no longer available.  In fact, BGE received an offer for its own site.  As a result, the Board of BGE decided to sell the existing headquarters at Little Island and locate all of its Cork based activities at its existing Albert Road site in Cork or, alternatively, at another green-field site in Cork City.</P>
    <P>On 25 April 1995 the board decided to extend the appointment of the original architects and back-up team to undertake design work relating to the Albert Road site.  This was done without competitive tendering in order to meet the timescale of the prospective purchaser of the Little Island complex and having regard to the commercial aspects of the deal.</P>
    <P>I first became aware on 22 May 1995 that the architects and back-up team had their appointment extended without recourse to competitive tendering procedures.</P>
    <P>The guidelines for state bodies give boards of state bodies a degree of discretion in relation to competitive tendering. However, in the case in question, it is in my opinion that, it would have been preferable for BGE to have used that discretion to ensure tendering for the revised project.</P>
    <P>The guidelines are now being reviewed for all state companies reporting to the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>

      <P>The Report of the National Minerals Policy Review Group was published on 12 May 1995, to give interested parties as well as the general public an opportunity to comment on the report and the 52 recommendations in it.  Few people have commented so far and the organisations representative of the minerals industry have yet to do so.  I arranged for a copy of the Report to be supplied to every member of Dáil and Seanad Éireann.</P>
      <P>The report provides an important input into the development of a sound national minerals policy for the years ahead and has to be carefully examined, particularly because of the major implications of some of the recommendations for the Exchequer and public administration as well as the wide-ranging revisions to existing legislation which the report also calls for.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the recommendations in the report relate to areas of responsibility of most other Ministers who are clearly entitled to time to examine the recommendations and to give me their considered views before I can finalise proposals in response to the report.</P>
      <P>I confirm that I am giving priority attention to the report and I expect to be able to respond comprehensively to the report within the next few months.</P>

      <P>The Final Report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative contains a strong commitment to an improved public transport system for the greater Dublin area with a view to giving existing public transport users a new deal and attracting motorists to public transport.</P>
      <P>There are a series of important priority public transport projects for Dublin recommended by the DTI including the construction of the light rail system, upgrading of DART and suburban rail services, provision of an integrated ticketing system for public transport and implementation of a qualiity bus network.</P>
      <P>In overall terms the expected cost of all of the projects recommended by the DTI would greatly exceed the level of funding available under the National Development Plan and the Operational Programme for Transport covering the period 1994 to 1999.</P>
      <P>Pending further detailed evaluation of the position it is not possible for me to be more specific about the prospects for projects such as the extension of DART to Malahide.  However, I am conscious that the project is an important component of the DTI Strategy for the development of public transport in Dublin in the medium-term.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>I am currently in consultation with the Commission regarding certain aspects of the GSM competition and, in particular, the requirement that applicants indicate the level of fee they are prepared to pay for the licence.  The Commission is concerned that this requirement may be contrary to the competition rules of the EU Treaties.  It had been anticipated that these discussions would have been completed before the planned closing date of 23 June 1995 for receipt of applications for the GSM licence.  Unfortunately it became apparent over the last week that this would not be feasible.  Consequently, I informed all prospective applicants that the closing date would be extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My priority now is to get the competition back on track as a matter of urgency.  Consultations with the Commission could take up to a further four weeks to complete.  My aim is to achieve as much legal certainty as possible before announcing a new closing date. While prospective applicants will be allowed an appropriate period to adapt <Col N="1652" /> their applications if necessary, the new deadline for receipt of applications will be set as early as is practically possible and I am confident that the successful applicant will be selected before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>As I have stated on a number of occasions, my primary objective in this competition has always been to select the applicant who will have a progressive approach to market development, a commitment to a high quality national service and an innovative approach to tariffs.  I am not convinced that a voluntary fee determined by the market for the right to the licence would undermine that objective.  I should clarify in this context that the Government never indicated a requirement for a fee of £45 million.  However, in the light of the views of the Commission, I am seeking to agree a compromise solution to the fee, which may involve a contribution from Eircell.</P>

      <P>During the period 1991-92, proposals were formulated in my Department to replace the Road Transport Act, 1932, to provide for the development of the bus industry and meet the requirements of the travelling public.  These proposals envisaged the extension of competition in the passenger road transport sector on a phased and orderly basis but were not proceeded with.</P>
      <P>It is widely accepted that there are a number of difficulties associated with the operation of the Road Transport Act, 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A comprehensive review of the legislative framework is now under way.  In <Col N="1653" /> the circumstances, it would be premature for me to speculate on its eventual outcome.</P>
    <P>Deputies will, of course, appreciate that proposals of a regulatory nature must take account of planned investment in that sector.  Accordingly, in reviewing the proposals already prepared in my Department, plans for major investment in public transport infrastructure and services in Dublin and throughout the rest of the country in the context of the National Development Plan and the Operational Programme for Transport 1994-1999 will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the Deputy that there will be a full process of consultation with all sides of the public transport sector before any new proposals are finalised for submission to Government.</P>

      <P>The minerals prospecting licences for the area in question expired on 9 April 1995 and is not being renewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special public competition for a minerals prospecting licence for the area will be held in September-October 1995 and will be open to all interested parties.  I am hopeful that the competition will yield firm proposals for necessary further work to be undertaken under such a licence, so as to pave the way for development of the major <Col N="1654" /> deposit as quickly and effectively as possible.</P>
    <P>I know that the Deputy and other Members of this House over the years have expressed the wish to see such a development proceed.  However, as the Deputy will appreciate, the commercial viability of such a development is mainly dependent on securing a remunerative market for the mine output. Whoever is awarded the minerals prospecting licence under the forthcoming competition will, therefore, have to be geared to addressing that particular issue with the necessary vigour and professionalism.</P>
    <P>I am determined to ensure that with the proper application of modern technology and mining techniques and sound environmental management systems the minerals resources of the nation will be developed responsibly, so as to achieve the maximum benefit in terms of job creation, increasing national wealth and underpinning industrial growth.</P>

      <P>The provision of transatlantic air services between Ireland the US is governed by the Ireland-US air transport agreement. In accordance with the terms of that agreement designated airlines of both countries are free to operate air services on specified routes between the two countries.  There are no limitations on capacity offered by airlines on such services and airlines are free to determine air fares in accordance with their own commercial judgment.</P>
      <P>In relation to scheduled air services, Irish airlines currently enjoy access rights to four US points &mdash; New York, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles &mdash; while US airlines may serve Ireland from any US point.  In relation to charter services, both Irish and US airlines can operate from any point in the US to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both scheduled and charter services must operate in conformity with current policy in relation to Shannon which is that airlines must maintain the same level of direct flights to Shannon as to Dublin.  However, in relation to charter services to Cork or Connacht Regional <Col N="1656" /> Airport, there is no requirement to serve Shannon.</P>
    <P>Currently Ireland has services from New York and Boston in the North East provided by Aer Lingus and from Atlanta in the South by Delta.  It is a matter in the first instance for airlines to decide whether to operate services between the US and Ireland based on their own commercial judgment but of course every opportunity is taken to encourage US airlines to commence new services to Ireland.</P>
    <P>In this regard my Department from time to time approaches US airlines regarding opportunities for new Ireland-US services as does other state agencies such as Shannon Airport Marketing and Bord Fáilte.  I should also like to advise that Shannon Airport Marketing are currently finalising presentations on new route development opportunities which will be made shortly to specific US airlines.  I am available to lend support to these efforts at the appropriate time.</P>

      <P>This approval is subject to both the ESB and Bord Na Móna independently fulfilling certain conditions which I have laid down.  In the case of Bord na Móna, I have written to the chairman of the board outlining these conditions.  The main conditions are: the timing of the reduction in the price of milled peat is to be co-ordinated with my Department and the new peat price can be escalated in line with normal commercial arrangements between the two companies; there will be no further State guarantees in respect of future borrowings by Bord na Móna; and the statutory limit on existing State guarantees will be reduced to the level of the remaining debt in Bord na Móna; the current statutory limit on borrowings by Bord na Móna will be reduced to £80 million; the performance of each operating division is to be clearly shown in the published accounts; the benefits of incorporating these divisions as limited liability companies is to be explored in the context of the legislative amendments which will be required to give effect to this proposal.</P>

      <P>I should explain that regional airports are owned and operated by private undertakings.  Therefore, the development plans, traffic potential and viability of these airports are matters for the individual airport companies.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the financial results of the airports in 1994 or other years is confidential to the companies concerned.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the importance of the regional airports for the economic and tourism development of the regions in which they are located, a very extensive capital development programme costing almost £21 million was carried out under the Operation Programme on Peripherality 1989-1993.</P>
      <P>In view of this development, the emphasis must now be on attracting increased traffic levels into these airports. A significant downturn in traffic was experienced in 1991 as a result of the Gulf War and world economic recession.  This downturn continued for a number of years but Deputies will be pleased to note that traffic at the regional airports increased overall by 25 per cent in 1994 compared with 1993 and that the upward trend has continued in 1995.</P>

      <P>I do not accept that Aer Rianta's position in relation to the Cargobridge project is at variance with departmental policy.  As my agent and as an acknowledged expert in the field of airport management, it is incumbent upon the company to protect the State's interests at all times.</P>
      <P>I would like to put the record straight. Aer Rianta, who manage the three State airports on my behalf, did not object to the application for planning permission by Cargobridge but to specific conditions imposed by the planning authority in their approval which would have serious implications for the development of the airport in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objection was based on technical grounds, the resolution of which can only be determined by An Bord Pleanála. The Cargobridge planning advisers argue a particular point of view which is diametrically opposed to the opinion of the Aer Rianta advisers.  The Department has no expertise to enable it to assess these conflicting viewpoints.  In these circumtances, my view is that An <Col N="1661" /> Bord Pleanála &mdash; which has the necessary technical experts &mdash; should be allowed to arbitrate on this issue and I am satisfied that the objection should stand.</P>

As promised this process includes consultation with all interested parties and the advertisement in the national dailies in April last inviting <Col N="1662" /> submission of views resulted in over forty responses.  The review will form the basis for decisions on the setting of further targets in respect of electricity generation from renewable sources and any incentives which may be appropriate in that regard.

      <P>While biomass projects did not succeed in the recent alternative energy requirement scheme, I was encouraged by the potential of this technology to make a meaningful contribution to energy supply.

Under the Fuels (Petroleum Oils) Order, 1982 importers of petrol, gas oil and LPG are required to purchase up to 35 per cent of their requirements from the Whitegate refinery.  The decision to end the mandatory purchase requirement at the end of 1996 was taken in the context of the Government response to the Culliton and Moriarty reports.</P>
      <P>In order to enable the refinery to trade on a fully competitive basis, the Irish National Petroleum Corporation Ltd. is implementing a three-year programme of investment which will continue up to 1996.  The results of this programme, allied to a number of marketing initiatives, is expected by the company to enable the refinery to operate on a commercial basis at open market prices when the mandatory regime ends.</P>

      <P>The person named has applied to my Department for an occasional passenger licence to provide a late night bus service between South Main Street and the Hilltop Hotel, Youghal, County Cork. Occasional passenger licences are issued in accordance with the terms of the Road Transport Act, 1932.  In considering whether to grant or refuse an application for a passenger licence under that Act, my Department is required to have regard to the extent of passenger road services and other forms of passenger <Col N="1665" /> transport available to the public on or in the neighbourhood of the route of the proposed service.  In view of these restrictions, the scope for granting new licences to private bus operators is very limited.</P>
      <P>The difficulty in the present case is that another operator already holds a licence in respect of a service on the route in question, while my Department has also received a number of applications from other bus operators in respect of this route.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, to grant a passenger licence to the named person would be a departure from the current policy whereby, in general, only one passenger licence is issued for a particular service on a specific route.  The complex issues raised by the application are receiving further consideration and I hope to be in a position to advise the Deputy of the outcome in the near future.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to Shannon Airport Marketing, the body which was established in October, 1994 as a result of the recommendations of the Shannon Airport traffic development task force.</P>
      <P>The Shannon task force was established by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications in June 1993, and presented its report on the future of Shannon Airport to the Minister in December of that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The central recommendation of the task force was for the setting up of a single integrated traffic promotion body for Shannon.  The Government endorsed the recommendation and <Col N="1666" /> Shannon Airport Marketing was established as a single cohesive unit to promote traffic at Shannon Airport and eliminate the fragmentation and overlapping of marketing which the task force found was inhibiting the development of the airport.</P>
    <P>It is probably too early to make a definitive judgment about the effectiveness of Shannon Airport Marketing in implementing the mandate given to it by the Government.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the function of Shannon Airport Marketing, which is to grow the traffic at Shannon, through vigorous promotion of the airport in overseas markets including the US is the correct function.  However, I am aware that some local interests in the Shannon region are not entirely confident that the Shannon Airport Marketing structure is the most appropriate mechanism to discharge this function.  I will be keeping a close watch on the activities of the body to ensure that it continues to be the best mechanism for the job.</P>

      <P>It is presumed that the Deputy is referring to the arrangements for the collection of income tax in respect of the earnings of pickers employed in the mushroom industry.  The Revenue Commissioners examined the method of taxing the remuneration of mushroom pickers in the early 1990s.  They found that some mushroom growers were correctly operating the normal PAYE-PRSI system in respect of their employees, while others were either making deductions under the farmers casual scheme without Revenue approval or were not making any deductions.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners concluded that the normal PAYE-PRSI system was properly applicable to mushroom pickers.  Nevertheless, following discussions with representatives of the mushroom industry and in recognition of the difficulties which individual growers might experience in moving to full PAYE-PRSI, Revenue agreed to the phased extension of the normal PAYE-PRSI system to all mushroom growers over a two year period concluding in April 1994.</P>
      <P>It should be noted that the normal PAYE-PRSI system is not only the appropriate system for taxing the remuneration of mushroom pickers, but it is less onerous for the mushroom growers to administer and avoids possible hardship for mushroom pickers which could otherwise arise in meeting their tax liability at the end of the tax year.  It does not, of course, in any way alter the income tax liabilities of the mushroom pickers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the circumstances, I do not propose to make a special exemption for the mushroom industry in respect of the application of the normal PAYE-PRSI <Col N="1671" /> system.  However, in replies to recent representations about the taxation of workers in the mushroom industry I offered a meeting between the Revenue Commissioners and the representatives of the mushroom industry to hear their concerns on this matter and to clear up any outstanding difficulties in relation to the operation of the income tax system.  To date the mushroom industry has not availed of this offer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The death registration system is the principal source for statistical information on causes of death, including deaths by suicide.  Information on particular occupations and professions recorded on death certificates is in all countries, however, known to be subject to many sources of bias, incompleteness and unreliability.  For this reason the Central Statistics Office does not provide any analysis of cause of death by occupation in its annual reports on vital statistics.  The possibility of improving the quality of occupational information recorded on death certificates is one of the issues under consideration in the context of the overall review of the registration legislation currently being undertaken by the Department of Equality and Law Reform.</P>

      <P>Contract documents for these schemes are with my Department.  Both schemes envisaged increased abstraction of water from the Old Kilcullen reservoir which in turn is supplied from Dublin Corporation's water production plant at Ballymore Eustace.  A major strategic study of water requirements in the Dublin region has been commissioned by my Department and is in progress.  Water supply investment proposals for the Dublin region generally, including in this context the south Kildare and Monasterevan schemes, will be considered in the light of this study which is expected to be completed by early 1996.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 65 together.</P>
      <P>In response to a letter from the North Western Regional Fisheries Board about the need for a new sewage treatment plant for Crossmolina and nutrient removal facilities for Castlebar, I have explained to the board the present position regarding these schemes.  Mayo County Council has submitted a proposal for an integrated catchment protection scheme for the Conn-Cullen catchments which includes the two schemes; the proposal is being examined in my Department at present with a view to a possible Cohesion Fund application.  In these circumstances, I do not think that a meeting with a deputation from the board is necessary.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware from correspondence with my predecessor that under existing Government policy the Garda authorities are not authorised to issue firearms certificates to persons wishing to hold pistols or revolvers.  There is a provision in the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990, which allows a superintendent of the Garda Síochána to issue, in certain circumstances, an authorisation to a person wishing to <Col N="1683" /> hold a deactivated firearm.  However, legal advice available to my Department is to the effect that at the time when an authorisation is sought the firearm in question must be defective.</P>
      <P>I have brought the case referred to by the Deputy to the attention of the Garda authorities and requested a report indicating whether or not they consider that the weapon is deactivated, and I will communicate with the Deputy when I have this information to hand.</P>

      <P>It is generally accepted that Irish hauliers are disadvantaged by comparison with their European competitors due to our island/peripheral location.  As part of the national development plan very significant investment in this country's transport system is being made which will improve internal and access transport infrastructure and facilities on an integrated basis, thereby reducing transport costs.  The reliability of the transport system will also be improved by removing bottlenecks, remedying capacity deficiencies and reducing absolute journey times.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer the Deputy to the reply <Col N="1690" /> given by my predecessor on 6 April 1995 which was as follows:</P>
      <P>Air Corps aircraft, both fixed and rotary wing, made 79 flights in 1993 and 116 flights in 1994 to Kerry Airport, Farranfore.  Those flights were either for military purposes, including training, or in response to requests from various Government Departments.  The Department of Defence is not made aware of the specific purposes of Air Corps flights carried out at the request of other Departments.</P>

      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>if he will make an Order under section 39 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, regarding access to a point known as Ballantines Pier, Lough Arrow, County Sligo, where locals are being prevented access to the public pier erected by Sligo County Council.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 39 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, provides that the Central or a Regional Fisheries Board may apply to the Minister for an Order to be made creating a right of way by a particular route over any land to enable a board to perform statutory functions under the Act or to enable fishermen to gain access to fishing waters. No application for such an Order in relation to access to Ballantines Pier has been made to date.</P>
      <P>I understand that anglers have experienced difficulty in gaining access to Ballantines Pier on Lough Arrow.  The North Western Regional Fisheries Board is aware of these difficulties and is currently in discussion with Sligo County Council and Bord Fáilte with a view firstly to clarifying whether a public right of way to the pier already exists.</P>
