      <P>I asked the Tánaiste some weeks ago about the implementation of the recommendations of the Costello report and the fundraising for charitable and other purposes Bill.  A number of groups outside the House have continually raised this with the Opposition.  Will the Taoiseach tell us the latest position on the Bill and give an assurance that the Bill will be completed in time for the autumn session?</P>

      <P>I recollect asking the Government of the time about progress on this issue when I was on that side of the House.  This Government is relatively recently in office and is taking action on the matter.  The House will recollect that the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, has made an extensive statement on the subject and the Minister for Justice has indicated a seminar is taking place.  This report is old and it was a long time lying on the desk of previous Ministers.  It will be delt with by this Government.</P>

      <P>In the course of the debate yesterday on the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, the Opposition pointed out that the amendments to which the Minister was referring had not been received by this side of the House.  We dealt with them on the occasion, but the Minister said that they had been posted on Friday last.  When I arrived home yesterday evening I received the amendments postmarked 27 June, which is not Friday last.  The Minister may have misunderstood the position, but he misled the House by telling it that that information was in the hands of Deputies in advance of the debate.</P>
      <P>I want to make it clear that what we said was true.  The envelope was there when I went home yesterday evening with that postal date on it.  If the Minister wishes he may look at it later.</P>

    <Title>European Summit: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was accompanied at the European Council in Cannes by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and the Minister of State for European Affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell.</P>
      <P>The European Council in Cannes achieved its immediate objectives.  First, the Council cleared the way for the establishment of Europol which will enable European police forces to cooperate using modern technology in the fight against increasingly sophisticated crime, especially the drugs trade.</P>
      <P>Second, the Council cleared a substantial aid programme for the Third World, Central and Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean region.  Before Cannes this had been blocked by disputes about share-outs.</P>
      <P>Third, following the priority which I attached to the drugs issue at the dinner in Paris for Heads of State of Government earlier this month, the Cannes Council commissioned an expert study on the drugs issue to be presented to the December Madrid Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, the summit confirmed that <Col N="711" /> there will be annual reports to the European Council on the employment performance of each member state and of the Union as a whole with the first report to be submitted to the Madrid Council next December.  This is very welcome because it will create a political and institutional focus on the jobs issue at the highest level every year and will help to ensure that all community policies serve the overall objective of job creation.</P>
    <P>This European Council was the first Council of the enlarged Union including for the first time the Heads of State and Governments of Austria, Sweden and Finland.  The 15 were joined on 27 June for a working lunch and a subsequent plenary session by the leaders of the states of Central and Eastern Europe, the Baltic states, Cyprus and Malta.  As the Council conclusions state, copies of which I have arranged to have placed in the library, the presence of the leaders of these countries provides confirmation that they are destined one day to join the Union.</P>
    <P>The Council considered the major strategic issues facing the Union at present, notably employment, economic and monetary union, the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference and the future enlargement of the Union and also other issues of prime concern to the citizens of Europe especially drugs and general co-operation on the prevention of crime.</P>
    <P>Widespread concern was expressed at the Council that, despite recent benign economic conditions, the level of unemployment in Europe remains unacceptably high.  The Council and the Commission have set out what needs to be done to tackle the problem of unemployment and this message was reinforced at Cannes.  Accordingly, stress was laid on the implementation by member states of stability-oriented monetary and budgetary policies which will deliver a climate conducive to investment and employment growth.  On this basis the Council approved the <Col N="712" /> broad guidelines of the economic policies of the member states and of the Community and emphasised that the current economic upturn must be used to step up sustained efforts to put public finances in order.  Compliance with these guidelines is also necessary to substantially reduce unemployment.</P>
    <P>It is, however, recognised that proactive structural policies are also called for to deal with the scourge of unemployment. The Cannes Council, therefore, underlined the necessity for follow-up on the guidelines for action on structural reform set out in the conclusions of the Essen Council.  It was agreed that a comprehensive report on member state performance in these areas would be submitted to the Madrid Council next December.</P>
    <P>The onus on implementing the prescriptions on employment agreed at Union level rests with individual member states rather than the Union itself. Ireland has a good record on this score. The Government's commitment to stable macroeconomic policies and sound management of the public finances is delivering the necessary climate for employment growth.  We are also making advances on the specific guidelines set out at Essen.  For example, stress is laid in these guidelines on reducing non-wage labour costs.  Consistent with this objective the 1995 budget increased the earnings threshold for the lower PRSI rate from £9,000 to £12,000.  This measure, with the 1995 budget improvements in income tax primarily directed at the lower paid, form part of the Government's tax reform policy aimed at rewarding work and promoting enterprise.  Clearly our policies are working as employment is expected to expand by approximately 31,000 this year.</P>
    <P>Deputies may also wish to note the emphasis placed in the Cannes conclusions on the development of local employment initiatives.  The Commission paper on this subject referred to the Irish experience in this regard.  The <Col N="713" /> Government is convinced of the importance of local initiatives in generating employment, and has given recognition to this by conferring special responsibility for local development on the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell. I outlined our success in this area to my European Council colleagues and indicated that we intend to convene a special conference on local employment initiatives during our Presidency next year.</P>
    <P>The Council also noted the vital role played by small and medium sized enterprises in the creation of employment and asked the Commission to submit a report to it on the policies currently being conducted in this field and on ways of improving their effectiveness in aid of small and medium sized enterprises.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to economic and monetary union.  The Cannes conclusions reiterate firmly the Union's resolve to prepare for the changeover to the single currency by 1 January 1999 at the latest in strict accordance with the convergence criteria, timetable and procedures laid down in the Treaty.  In essence, the preparations for the final stage of European Monetary Union were given significant momentum in Cannes.  The central importance of convergence for the European Monetary Union project and for sustainable progress in growth and employment was emphasised by all the participants.  The European Council endorsed the work already done under the aegis of the Finance Ministers and mandated them to report to the Madrid Council on the various issues, technical and otherwise, so that the European Council can decide at Madrid on the scenario for introducing the single currency. The message from Cannes is clear: the single currency is on track for introduction by 1 January 1999 at the latest.  I reiterate that the Government intends that Ireland will be among those countries which qualify for inclusion in the single currency bloc whenever it commences.</P>
    <P>The Council also focused on the important issue of the relationship <Col N="714" /> between those member states in the single currency zone and those member states in the single market but not in the single currency zone.  Clearly this scenario contains the potential for distortion in the operation of the single market.  It is an issue which requires further study. The European Council, therefore, directed that a special examination of it should be undertaken by the Commission, which is required to report on its conclusions in the autumn so that they can be considered at Madrid.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to report to the House that agreement was reached on the convention establishing Europol.  I have to admit that this agreement was exceptionally difficult to achieve and was only arrived at by deferring until June 1996 a decision on the role of the European Court of Justice under the convention.  Nonetheless, the agreement on Europol is a significant step in institutionalising co-operation between member states in internal security matters.</P>
    <P>The convention provides for the setting up of a European police office to be called Europol.  The objectives of this office will be to combat drug trafficking, nuclear or radioactive material smuggling, illegal immigrant smuggling and motor vehicle-related crime. The tasks of Europol will be to facilitate the exchange of information between member states: to obtain, collate and analyse information and intelligence about crime; to pass information rapidly to national units or police forces and to maintain a computerised information system.</P>
    <P>What is important now is that the convention be adopted by all member states as a matter of urgency so that Europol is operational as soon as possible to enhance the fight against crime, especially drug trafficking.  It is important for all member states to put this convention through their parliaments. I accept the view expressed by some member states that there are difficulties about the lack of dispute settlement mechanism and disagreements about whether it should be run by the <Col N="715" /> European Court of Justice or some other body.  It is very important to recognise that most of the work of Europol will be done without any dispute or disagreement.  It should be let proceed with the work which can be done without dispute or disagreement and the issue of the disputes mechanism can be solved in a year's time.  We cannot afford another year of lack of adequate co-operation between police forces just because of what are essentially ideological arguments about the appropriate disputes mechanism.  I make that appeal in particular to those member states and parliaments within which there may be arguments about this issue.  These arguments should be put in their proper context relative to the wider importance of dealing on a European-wide basis with crime which is a threat to society.  The threat of crime is of similar magnitude to the threat which led to the creation of the European Union in the first place, namely the threat from behind the Iron Curtain, and it requires a similar degree of commitment and sacrifice on the part of member states.  I hope the arguments about the dispute mechanism which is a relatively minor issue in comparison to the overall concern are not allowed to delay the implementation of the convention by all member states.</P>
    <P>On the specific issue of drugs, the Council urged on member states the practical implementation of a strategy involving the reduction of supply, combating of trafficking and better international co-operation.  It was also decided to establish an expert group to report to the Madrid Council with proposals on how to implement this strategy. I am particularly pleased about this as it was one of the issues I raised in Paris.  I am glad action was taken so quickly to establish this expert group.</P>
    <P>I accept that more than generalised aspirations are needed in regard to drugs and while the establishment of Europol is clearly a significant advance, concrete action must be taken and we must ensure that the expert group <Col N="716" /> comes up with solutions in this regard for Madrid.  Deputies will be conscious of the priority which the Government attaches to dealing with the drugs issue at domestic and European levels.  We are determined to put forward realistic and tenable proposals in regard to combating drug trafficking in Europe.  An inter-departmental group chaired by the Department of Justice has been established for this purpose and will advise the Irish representative of the new EU expert group in relation to specific Irish proposals in this area.</P>
    <P>The European Council confirmed the mandate of the reflection group which has the general task of preparing the way for the work of the Intergovernmental Conference.  As Deputies are aware, Ireland is represented on this group by the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell.  The Council went on to emphasise the importance of focusing on the needs and expectations of its citizens, with particular reference to the following: analysis of the principles, objectives and instruments of the Union in the context of challenges facing Europe; strengthening of the common foreign and security policy so that it can cope with new international challenges; provision of a better response to modern demands as regards internal security and the fields of justice and home affairs more generally; making the institutions more efficient, democratic and open so that they are able to adjust to the demands of an enlarged Union; increasing public support for the process of European integration by meeting the need for a form of democracy which is closer to the citizens of Europe who are concerned with employment and environment questions; and putting the principle of subsidiarity into practice more effectively.</P>
    <P>Some of these priorities accord very closely with views enunciated by me, the Tánaiste and the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs in relation to the work of Intergovernmental Conference.  In particular I have at every opportunity stressed the need <Col N="717" /> for the Intergovernmental Conference to respond to the real needs of European citizens and to address the issues of transparency and democracy in the institutions.  I have commissioned a study by the Politics Department of Trinity College Dublin on the issue of the democratic accountability of the European Union in the context of the preparation of the Irish position on these issues for the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>It would be useful if I outlined the general approach which Ireland will take to the negotiations on the Intergovernmental Conference, bearing in mind that we will, of course, have to react to the agenda as it emerges and to the priorities of other member states. Ireland's general approach to the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations will be to equip the European Union institutionally and otherwise to meet the challenges of the 21st century, including further enlargement, and in the process to ensure that our vital national interests are fully protected.  I would make the following specific points in this regard.  The balance between large and small member states and between the institutions of the Union in the Community under the present Treaty provisions has served both Ireland and the Union well and should not be significantly altered. Ireland will oppose proposals which suggest that the smaller member states should forego their Commissioner or should share Commissioner posts on a rotating basis.  A single speed approach to further European integration should be maintained as far as possible; there may however continue to be instances, such as with Economic and Monetary Union, which would permit a differentiated approach in terms of timing, to a common objective.  In general we are opposed to the concept of allowing options.  The question of the democratic legitimacy of the Union will have to be addressed at the Intergovernmental Conference in a way that would not adversely affect the positions of small <Col N="718" /> states or dilute the power of the Commission. The outcome of any negotiations that would involve Ireland's participation in a common defence policy will be put to the people in a referendum. This will ensure that Ireland's policy of military neutrality remains unchanged, unless the people decide otherwise.</P>
    <P>One thing is clear &mdash; and this was recognised at the Cannes Council &mdash; there must be no repetition of the experience of the Maastricht Treaty. The citizens of Europe must be kept informed of the deliberations of the Intergovernmental Conference and the outcome must be crystal clear, intelligible and above all relevant to the ordinary citizen.</P>
    <P>A key task of the Intergovernmental Conference will be to prepare the way for future enlargement of the Union.  As I indicated earlier, the Heads of State and Governments of those countries who have Association Agreements with the Union and who aspire to eventual membership of the Union were in attendance at Cannes.  Our exchange of views with the leaders of these countries enabled us to review the strategy of preparing them for accession.  In specific terms the Council approved the Commission White Paper on integrating these countries into the internal market. The White Paper outlines the admistrative, legislative, and legal environment necessary for the effective and efficient adoption and implementation of internal market legislation.  As such it should prove to be of valuable assistance to the associated countries in adapting their legal and other frameworks to what is necessary to allow them to participate in the single market. Of course advice on the changes necessary for participation in the single market is not sufficient for these countries. A significant element of financial assistance must also be provided.  At Cannes the European Council reached agreement on the appropriations for financial <Col N="719" /> co-operation with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean countries for the period 1995-99. This amounts to some 11.4 billion ECU in aid broken down as 6.7 billion for the Central and Eastern European Countries and 4.7 billion for the Mediterranean region.  The Union has not therefore shirked its responsibilities towards these countries especially the newly established democracies of Central and Eastern Europe.  The preparation of the associated countries for accession will be kept under review at subsequent European Councils.</P>
    <P>Enlargement of the Union to the east and to the south is a scenario which poses both challenges and opportunities for Ireland.  The Government will carefully study the implications of accession by these states for all sectors of the Irish economy.  The debate to date has concentrated on the fear that Ireland's monetary benefits will be diluted as a result of the next enlargement.  Ireland receives 18 per cent of its public expenditure and 7 per cent of its national income directly from European Union sources.  However, let us not lose sight of the trading opportunities which will be afforded by enlargement through the opening up of large and relatively untapped markets.  All sectors of our economy should be preparing now to avail of this opportunity.</P>
    <P>I mentioned funding for the Mediterranean region.  The provision of such aid underlined the importance the European Council attaches to relations with the states in this region.  The Council looked forward to the forthcoming Mediterranean Conference in Barcelona in November to lay the foundation for a Euro-Mediterranean partnership. Peace and stability in this area is a vital strategic interest of the European Union.</P>
    <P>I should mention at this juncture that the Council also adopted the amount and financing arrangements for the Eighth European Development Fund. As a result the conditions have been met, to conclude the revision of the <Col N="720" /> Lomé Convention with the developing countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (the ACP countries).  The effect of this agreement will be to increase the Irish contribution over the next five years to the Eighth European Development Fund by 20 million ECU. This is an increase of significant proportions and is a measure of the importance we attach to the Lomé Convention. We are doing this in the context of the Government's commitment to make steady progress towards achieving the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP devoted to overseas development aid.</P>
    <P>The Council also discussed a number of important external issues, notably former Yugoslavia and Russia.  We adopted a declaration on former Yugoslavia and resolved to establish a substantive relationship with Russia commencing with a decision to authorise the Commission to sign the Interim Agreement with Russia against the background of the improved situation and the negotiations on humanitarian aid in Chechnya.  The importance of relations with the US was also underlined.  The Tánaiste will elaborate on those matters in his statement.</P>
    <P>A generally optimistic scenario was painted by its immediate neighbours at the extended meeting we had on the evolving situation in Russia both from political and economic points of view.  It was more optimistic than general comment in the West would seem to indicate.</P>
    <P>The Cannes European Council considered the basic questions of jobs and crime, especially drugs related crime which confront the Union and its citizens and how these might be tackled.  It also laid solid foundations for a new stage in the process of European integration, including revision of the Union Treaty, completion of economic and monetary union and the achievement of a further major enlargement.  Our task is to build on this foundation, bearing in mind that we must retain the support of public opinion.  Europe has been a success but it has not been a commensurate <Col N="721" /> success in the public view.  That needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I will give a few personal impressions arising from my first attendance at a European Council.  I was struck by the large measures of common philosophy and shared purpose among all the participants. The major and detailed preparatory work undertaken by the Presidency and the Commission was very evident and contributed to the smooth operation of the Summit.  President Chirac of France showed himself to be a dedicated and determined chairman with a fine ability to facilitate appropriate compromise between the divergent views and an equal ability to impose his will whenever that was necessary.  I found it a little disappointing that some issues of minute detail were left to be settled at this level although I accept that the European Council is the highest decision making forum in the Union and the exercise of its function may from time to time involve dealing with such minutiae.</P>
    <P>On employment and economic issues, we had to consider seven or eight individual lengthy papers on different employment and economic topics.  Our discussion would have been assisted by a more synthesized approach in the papers and a more targeted focus on the decisions being sought from the Council. We might, thus, have used our time more appropriately rather than having interminable <i>tours de table</i> which became longer and longer the more countries were involved.  When 11 of the 15 have spoken the remaining four feel obliged to speak as well even though they may have nothing to say.  This approach is tiring.  There is a need to look at this issue and it is one of the matters we hope to address at a more informal meeting later this year, in the first half of the Spanish Presidency.  We may be able to look at how the Council does its business and how it can be prepared for more precisely, so that decision points are more easily identifiable and questions of detail, if possible, are settled elsewhere.  I realise that is not always possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his statement.  It is unfortunate that the deliberations of the Cannes European Council were overshadowed, in immediate terms, by the leadership election facing the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major.  Most of the programmes on the various networks were on that issue.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I am glad the most urgent business connected with the Council meeting from Ireland's viewpoint &mdash; resolving the impasse in the peace process &mdash; was the subject of serious discussion by the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister.  However, everything remains in political limbo until the leadership issue is resolved.</P>
      <P>While we must guard against interference in another country's political affairs and be willing to work with whoever is the British Prime Minister, I support the warm remarks made by the Taoiseach at Cannes about Mr. Major. They were similar to remarks I made following the Prime Minister's statement last week that he would face a contest.  I was equally struck by the ostentatious political indifference expressed by the Tánaiste to someone who has been a hugely important partner in the progress made in the peace process to date.</P>
      <P>There is a difference between saying the peace process must be capable of surviving changes of Government and saying it makes no difference who is in charge in Dublin, London or Washington, which is manifestly absurd.  It was the combination of Deputy Reynolds, Mr. Major and President Clinton, as well as the Northern nationalist leaders, Mr. John Hume and Mr. Gerry Adams, which made peace happen in the first place.  I am glad Northern Ireland is not so far an issue in the leadership campaign and that the approach of Mr. Major has been endorsed by the candidate standing against him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Northern Ireland is not the only subject in whose outcome we have a legitimate interest.  Whether Britain has a <Col N="723" /> new Prime Minister committed to keeping that country out of a single currency or disposed to withdraw from Europe, or one who is open to participation in the future development of the EU, is hugely important to Ireland and there is no point in pretending to be neutral about that issue.</P>
    <P>I can understand why the Prime Minister was keen to present an upbeat message, reflected in yesterday's British and Irish newspapers, that progress is being made in the peace process.  He was asked whether it was still the position that decommissioning must commence before the political process can progress.  I quote in full what he stated:</P>
    <P>The reality is that the political process will have to involve all the political parties, that is the objective.  The objective that I wish to see, and the Taoiseach wishes to see, is all the political parties sitting down together &mdash; that is the way in which we are going to make a progress which will be sustained. And so we need to make sure all the political parties will come in, and so that is the key reason why we have to be clear about how we are going to progress here and why I said there needs to be some form of substantial gesture.  So we are not trying to box anybody in.  We are trying to find a practical way forward that would be acceptable to all the parties and that will enable the political parties to get together &mdash; that is the objective that we have in mind.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach would have been pleased with the Prime Minister's remarks following their talks at Cannes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We were equally disappointed about the cold water poured on rising hopes by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.  The approach of the British Prime Minister is manifestly <Col N="724" /> at variance with the line taken by Sir Patrick Mayhew yesterday&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when he raised the possibility of Sinn Féin being excluded from talks and represented by the SDLP.  Unfortunately this is by no means the first time attempts have been made at various stages of the peace process to pull back from signals of readiness to move forward from the Prime Minister.  What I found hopeful and refreshing about Mr. Major's statement was the recognition that Sinn Féin's presence at talks was necessary and that attempts to exclude them would be futile.  That is the precise opposite of the position taken by Sir Patrick Mayhew. However, at Question Time yesterday the Taoiseach did not appear to fully subscribe to my interpretation.</P>
      <P>If that is the case I am not particularly impressed by the decision to do further studies on decommissioning.  I have no objection to them if they are used as a route to progress rather than a temporising device.  A study was set in train last August at Chequers by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds and the British Prime Minister, between the Permanent Under-Secretary at the Northern Ireland Office, Sir John Chilcott, and the Secretary of the Department of Justice, Mr. Tim Dalton.  The outcome of their work was, perhaps understandably, never made public and it seems further work was suspended early this year until now for reasons I still do not fully understand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach knows, I tried to find out yesterday who is continuing the work, what work was done and what progress has been made. I have tried that a number of times and perhaps in answer to a future question he will tell us what progress has been made since late January.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  All the work inherited from the previous Government has been taken on board and used to the full for the benefits it confers, which are considerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that.  There has always been the danger in this process of putting the cart before the horse and the Unionists deserve some acknowledgement of their political success in highlighting the decommissioning arguments, making us almost lose sight of the joint framework document. The well known writer, Mr. Tim Pat Coogan, suggested recently that the emphasis on decommissioning is today's &ldquo;orange card&rdquo;.  The framework document should be continually to the fore and I ask the Taoiseach to do so in whatever way possible.  My predecessor argued tirelessly for the joint declaration and the same attitude should be taken on the framework document, otherwise it will be side-tracked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>A solution to decommissioning will only be found in the framework of inclusive negotiations and as part of an overall agreement.  Equally there must be a firm readiness and a declared commitment by all the organisations concerned to deal with it in that context.  As I suggested earlier, it is legitimate and necessary to obtain from them a firm commitment to engage in arms decommissioning when the peace process is further advanced and to <Col N="726" /> ensure that until then arms will be inaccessible and kept in cold storage.</P>
      <P>With regard to prisoners, we now need decisions and not studies because it is clear what is necessary.  The restriction imposed on remission in response to a particular security situation in the late 1980s must surely as a matter of logic be reversed after 10 months of complete cessation of violence.  An early indication or declaration of the British Government's legislative intentions on this would go a long way towards defusing the situation.  When the leadership contest is over I hope we have a Government in London which is capable of taking the necessary strategic decisions and moving the peace process forward.  If there are any changes in personnel the principals should waste no time in coming to grips with the issues.</P>
      <P>The Cannes European Council was preceded by meetings of the Christian Democrat and Socialist groups.  The Germans put forward a paper proposing majority voting in the foreign policy area, a proposal designed to marginalise the influence of smaller countries in the arena where the Commission does not have a major role or a right of initiative. It is never clear what influence we can exercise over these gatherings and perhaps the Taoiseach will have a unique opportunity to do so in the future.  All that seems to come from them are the views of the German Christian Democrats, many of which are hostile to Ireland's vital interests.</P>
      <P>If the Taoiseach has not already done so.  I suggest he seek an early bilateral meeting with Chancellor Kohl to iron out the difficulties being put forward or at least try to make the Chancellor and his party colleagues see the vital interests of small states; the Chancellor usually does personally but those who draw up the policy documents do not. At both Structural Funds meetings in 1989 and 1993, where I was honoured to negotiate for Ireland, he took a pro-Irish view.  However, reading the documentation of his party one would not match it with the utterance of the man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> The German Finance Minister, Mr. Theo Waigel, not content with questioning Ireland's participation in European Monetary Union, believes the Cohesion Fund should not be renewed after 1999. It is suggested that this will be raised in the Intergovernmental Conference an what may happen there continually worries me.  It should not be raised there but that is what Mr. Waigel is quoted as saying in the last few days.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It should not be raised there.  It has nothing to do with the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>After 1999, the country will no longer be treated as one region, eligible for objective 1 status, with its 75 per cent threshold.  Abolition of the Cohesion Fund, with its 90 per cent threshold, would be disastrous for us. The briefing on German intentions is contained in <i>Le Monde</i> of 25 and 26 June.  On 27 June, the same newspaper commented that the members of the Socialist groups are too preoccupied with domestic problems &ldquo;to have real debates on ideas with transparency.</P>
      <P>I am glad the main focus of the European Council was economic and on employment.  The French Government is determined both to resolve its deficit problem and to make a real and quantifiable impact on unemployment.  President Chirac sought a renewed commitment at European level of the finance trans-European networks which, for this country, consists principally of the Belfast-Dublin-Cork axis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A realistic approach is being adopted to Economic and Monetary Union by postponing it until 1999.  The decisions have yet to be made on the place of national symbols on the new currency.  I hope that Irish design motifs, as well as the Irish men and women of European stature, will be at least considered and figure on some of the European bank notes and coins.  The European Monetary Institute will discuss that issue over the next month or two and I was privy <Col N="728" /> to some of those meetings and documentation late last year.  Of course, there is no shortage of European figures for these notes.  However, we have always treasured our coinage and notes in this country and I would contend that Joyce is as European as Beethoven, according to arguments put forward in some newspapers.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in Government over the last number of years ensured that in respect of our inflation, borrowing and reduction of debt/GDP ratio, Ireland remained comfortably inside the Maastricht criteria.  With growth so high, the Government should ensure that an adequate safety margin and room for manoeuvre is being created rather than increasing the deficit.  I agree wholeheartedly with President Santer's warning to the European Council, which is applicable to Ireland, that &ldquo;there is a serious risk that member states will relax their efforts for structural reform under the pretext that economic conditions are improving&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Clearly, a number one objective of all Irish Governments up to 1999 must be to sustain a credible policy option participation in European Monetary Union, even without Britain.  We accept that the final decision can only be taken at the time in light of all of the circumstances. There could be a serious loss of investment confidence and jobs as well as a threat to marginalisation if we stayed out, which is the matter we must continue to review.  If we went in without Britain we would have to guard against the loss of competitiveness.  With centrally set interest rates, we would have to contend with exorbitant interest rates as we did in the last currency crisis. The problem would be confined to the value of the ECU, or whatever the common currency is called, against sterling, which is a European wide problem. However, European Monetary Union may continue to face the dilemma which already exists in relation to the social charter with some of the Mediterranean countries.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was right, in our view, to join his partners in insisting that any <Col N="729" /> study on the implications of a multi speed Europe in relation to the common currency should be conducted primarily by the Community institutions rather than by selected politicians and financial experts.  The economic and financial implications of a substantial enlargement are potentially huge.  Further enlargement should be phased in according to the state of readiness of different applicants.  It is right that some assistance should be given now to help that preparation.  We have all given political commitments which hold out the prospect of eventual membership to most of the other countries of central and eastern Europe.  I have even had a letter &mdash; as I am sure the Taoiseach had &mdash; in recent days from international quarters seeking support for Bosnia's membership of the European Union.</P>
    <P>The prospect of eventual membership of the EU is necessary to underpin democracy and the difficult political and economic transition which many of these countries have to make.  The alternative could, in the long run, be more costly for all of us.  However, it would be of no assistance to anybody if enlargement was to take place in a manner which would cause massive disruption, particularly in the existing less advanced economies of Western Europe; Structural, and Cohesion Funds assistance will continue to be needed.</P>
    <P>The CAP reform carried out under Commissioner MacSharry, which the Minister, Deputy Yates, is now administering in Ireland, will need to be sustained if the countryside over large areas of Europe is not to become largely denuded of population.  The Dáil should be kept informed of developments in this area which are often complex and difficult to grasp.  I would like to hear the views of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry particularly the latter, on how recent discussions have been advancing on these issues, particularly in relation to the compensation for currency fluctuations.</P>
    <P>The establishment of Europol will clearly be important in assisting the <Col N="730" /> international drive against drug trafficking, although supervision by the European Court of Justice has not yet been agreed.  I appreciate the points which the Taoiseach made about the difficulty in reaching this stage and that there will be divergent views on such an issue.  As we know, drugs are the main source of serious crime in this and many other countries.  The Government should make the combating of the drugs problem a major priority of Ireland's Presidency next year.  It is important for the credibility of that stand that Ireland should, as a matter of urgency, ratify most outstanding international conventions on drug trafficking to which we are a party.</P>
    <P>However, we cannot rely on European action to solve our problem.  We will need effective action at home.  As the Taoiseach knows, the House debated this week this indefensible decision to defer the construction of prisons in both Castlerea and Dublin.  I hope that he will redress this decision in time.  He heard our arguments this week, which I do not need to repeat, and he has clearly made mistakes which should be redressed.</P>
    <P>I am glad that other members of the European Council, both Heads of Government and Foreign Ministers, made clear their disapproval of the French decision to resume nuclear testing in the Pacific.  Our party has also made our disapproval known to our French Gaullist allies in the European Parliament.  The power of world opinion, as shown in the case of the Brent Spar oil rig, is never to be underestimated.</P>
    <P>The European Union, like the UN, is right to maintain its determination to reduce, as far as possible, the level of violence in Bosnia and to maintain the pressure on the combatants.  People are inclined to dismiss the UN operation as ineffective.  However, what would have been the level of bloodshed and civil war if the outside world had simply looked on and not even made any attempt to preserve or maintain the peace?  However, no outside military <Col N="731" /> power, even those who are part of an alliance, wishes to become directly engaged in ethnic wars.  This would still be true regardless of what European defence structures might be involved in.</P>
    <P>I agree with President Chirac that the objective should be to lift the siege of Sarajevo and open a route to the city as well as revive the Bosnia peace plan. The least that can be demanded is that the peace-keeping mission should be respected and receive the necessary co-operation. If the firmer tone coming from the European Council can be sustained, it may bring peace in that troubled area a little closer.</P>
    <P>I have always had an interest in finance matters, apart from holding the portfolio.  I have raised with the Taoiseach at Question Time that a comprehensive study has still not been undertaken in this country into the consequences of European Monetary Union.  There are workings by the director of the European Institute, Brian Farrell and its chairman, Brendan Halligan. However, the Government should carry out a study with other interested bodies such as IBEC, the Chamber of Commerce of Ireland, the Central Bank and others into the consequences for this country as we move closer to 1999.</P>
    <P>There are no complete studies in the Central Bank of the Department of Finance. The studies by academics have been done without access to State and Central Bank data.  We have to make the best judgment, as was made in 1979 when we broke the link with sterling which had existed since 1826 and joined the EMS.  A huge volume of research must be done.  There has never been a study of how the trade-weighted statistics of our industries would be affected if sterling stayed out of the European Monetary Union.  In my view, European Monetary Union will not happen in 1999.  There has been no work on how we can move into a position where we can return to a 2.25 per cent range since that scheme broke in 1993.</P>
    <P>I urge the Taoiseach to, over the summer, call the financial experts to whom <Col N="732" /> the Government has access in the Central Bank and the Department of Finance to examine the wisdom of carrying out such a study.  After 1999 we will definitely not be an Objective 1 region &mdash;although a large proportion of the country, particularly the western seaboard and some other areas of heavy population, will still have that status&mdash; which will take huge resources out of this country.  I accept that I worked on such study and talked about it but I did not do it.  Regardless of what may be said through the official channels it would still be worthwhile conducting that study.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">

Unfortunately, our statistics are a number of years out of date.  As a result it will not be possible to make a quick decision.  I am not accusing the Central Statistics Office or anyone else but it would not cost much money to conduct such a study.  This would stand to our credit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="733" /> I congratulate the Taoiseach on attending his first European Council meeting.  I understand his frustration in relation to the <i>tours de table.</i>  The Council was attended by the heads of state of the 15 member states as well as by the heads of state of a number of other countries which were invited to attend. This gave the Taoiseach an indication of what things would be like if there were 28 member states.  I had the honour on behalf of this country to chair meetings of the European Investment Bank, the OECD and the EBRD at which 38 or 39 countries were represented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be far worse because, as the Taoiseach is aware, everyone feels they must speak for 20 minutes.  It would be impossible to conduct business.  Unless the heads of state insist that only matters of vital importance are discussed progress will not be made.  The Council's Conclusions in a great many areas are written in advance. I have no objection to this as much of the work is done in advance but the Council should focus on a small number of areas.</P>
      <P>There is a danger that the larger countries will use the mechanisms of enlargement to frustrate the smaller countries and suggest that the constituency based IMF-World Bank approach should be adopted.  That would be unsatisfactory from our point of view. They will purposely allow enlargement to take place and then suggest that the way to proceed is to adopt the IMF-World Bank model.  I ask the Taoiseach to ensure that such a proposal is strongly opposed.  The French and, in particular, the Germans favour such an approach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in the Taoiseach's observation that everyone feels they have to speak.  When I first attended a Council of Ministers meeting as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, I was bewildered at <Col N="734" /> the way decisions were made, invariably, in the early hours of the morning.  Everyone felt they had to speak on every single issue.  I thought that if the citizens of Europe could see how decisions were made in their name they would be disillusioned.  It is just as well that meetings are held in private and not transparent.</P>
      <P>Even if the European Union were never enlarged it needs to seriously consider the question of streamlining its decision-making process.  Reference has been made to parliamentary party meetings. Even if a meeting is attended by only ten people it can still go on for hours as contributions can be longer. Just because the number is small does not mean necessarily that decisions can be made more quickly.  There is a need for the Union to consider how it can streamline and improve the decision-making process.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach rightly said that although the European Union has been a success this is not the perception.  The Union has been under severe strain.  It has faced many difficulties from the initial rejection by the Danes of the Maastricht Treaty, the weak response of the French, the various crises in the ERM, the lack of enthusiasm for European Monetary Union, the failed response to the problems in the former Yugoslavia and the Gulf War to the high level of unemployment running to 17 million, equal to the total population of Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg.</P>
      <P>It is clear that by the year 2000 it will be a different Union.  Not only is it going to be enlarged but we will probably have European Monetary Union, a new budget, greater fiscal controls, different decision making and institutional arrangements.</P>
      <P>To a large extent, the debate in this country tends to focus on two or three issues &mdash; the level of funding we receive, the defence issue and whether we will have a commissioner.  These are not the fundamental questions as far as Ireland is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="735" /> We need to consider the consequences for this country of enlargement of the Union.  Many of the issues involved were at the heart of the debate on the internal market.  Countries with a loosely regulated low cost base will become members.  This will put enormous pressure on Irish business because of the high cost base of this economy. While a larger market will present opportunities for Irish business it will also present problems.</P>
    <P>I would like the Government to set out in a Green or White Paper the opportunities and challenges as well as the consequences of enlargement for Ireland.  It is clear from the dinner held on the eve of the Cannes Summit when the 15 heads of state were joined by the heads of state of the Baltic states, Malta, Cyprus and six central and eastern European countries that it is simply a question of when this will take place and not an issue of principle.  It is in our own interests that we set out the implications for the economy.</P>
    <P>The business perspective produced by IBEC, Ireland, the European Union and Economic Integration, is well written. It sets out some of the options so far as Irish business is concerned and calls on the Government to prepare a paper outlining the consequences of enlargement for Ireland.  It strongly urges that enlargement should not take place before the year 2000.</P>
    <P>Apart from the pressures that will be put on Irish business from the point of view of exports and trade, enlargement will also have implications so far as funding is concerned.  This country has received £18.5 billion in net transfers since we joined the Union in 1973.  This year we will receive approximately £1.85 billion.  This is an enormous sum of money which is used to fund third level education, community employment and training, the price support mechanism for agricultural products and the development of infrastructure. It is not as great, however, as the sum we currently spend in meeting interest repayments on the national debt.  As we <Col N="736" /> will not receive the same level of resources after 1999, we need to prepare to cope with the consequences.</P>
    <P>If we take the 12 original countries, average income in Ireland is 86 per cent of the European average, and 75 per cent is laid down as the figure that has to be met before a country can be given objective one status.  The Taoiseach said that 7 per cent of our national wealth now comes in the form of transfers from the European Union.  In future we will have to stand on our own feet.  We must now begin to put in place the fiscal requirements to bring that about.  In the meantime it is necessary to ensure we spend the remaining Structural Funds in an efficient and effective way to deal with the structural inadequacies in the economy and improve our infrastructure so that we can compete more effectively in an enlarged Community.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt the greatest failure of the Community relates to unemployment &mdash; at 17 million people it is equivalent to the population of Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg.  When one compares Europe's performance on employment with that of Japan, the Asian-Pacific countries or the United States, it has been abysmal.  In its White Paper in 1993 the Community said that we would need to create 15 million jobs by the end of the decade to halve the rate of unemployment &mdash; that was the best that could be expected.  The reason unemployment is so high is that the Community is a high cost Community with low growth and is over-regulated.</P>
    <P>I agree with IBEC, who states that Europe must become more competitive <i>vis-á-vis</i> the other trading blocs and that competition must become a central plank of the Union, just as the social dimension and European Monetary Union have become central policy requirements.  IBEC suggests the Irish Government should carry out a study on competition in this economy and its implications.  The President of the Commission, Jacques Santer, set up an advisory group last February to examine how the Community could become more competitive, but I do not know whether <Col N="737" /> that group reported.  The European Union must become more competitive in the global economy if we are to create the employment opportunities in all members states that are required even to halve the present unacceptably high level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>To a large extent the summit was overshadowed by the difficulties experienced by the British Prime Minister, a man of substance who has given enormous commitment to the Irish problem. Over the years we always experienced difficulty in trying to persuade British Prime Ministers to focus on Ireland and maintain a commitment to it.  We saw what happened at Sunningdale and on many other occasions.  The present Prime Minister has shown courage and commitment that is unprecedented and I wish him well.  It is in the interests of people on this island that he succeeds and remains in office.  Praising him is probably the worst thing we can do for him and therefore I am reluctant to say much more, but I would be genuinely concerned for the peace process if there is a change in leadership of the British Government at this time.</P>
    <P>The bilateral meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister on the margins of the summit was a significant and important one.  Perhaps the most important statement the Taoiseach made in this regard yesterday was that both Governments have agreed on a joint strategy to resolve the issues outstanding &mdash; the stalemate as I called it last week &mdash; arms decommissioning and other issues.  There must be movement on decommissioning and on the release of prisoners, which is important not only to the families of the prisoners but to the former parliamentary organisations. If the Governments link the two issues and there is a <i>quid pro quo</i>, with release of prisoners in return for decommissioning, that would be a sensible strategy.  It would be naïve to expect any radical change in the prisoner issue if the weaponry and arsenal stay in the hands of the paramilitaries.  The community at large would find that very difficult to accept.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="738" /> I appeal to Sinn Féin in particular to use its influence to ensure some move is made and that there is a generous response to the decommissioning issue. Decommissioning is not a mere requirement of the British Government; as Seamus Mallon rightly said at the forum two weeks ago, the Irish people want to see a move on decommissioning because the weapons in the hands of the paramilitaries represent to the families of victims who died in the past 25 years the weapons that killed their loved ones. He said that Sinn Féin should consider it their duty to the Irish people, not to the British Government, to be generous and make a move on that issue.  I strongly reiterate those words.</P>
    <P>A successful outcome to all-party inclusive talks, which we all want, is not based simply on participation of all parties, with the famous round table at which everybody will sit.  The talks will be successful only if there is trust, generosity and a spirit of compromise, if there is give and take.  Everybody who wishes to be at the table must approach the talks in that frame of mind, just as the rest of us approach the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in that spirit. I said recently that many of us initially found it difficult to attend the forum, to meet and work with those whose <i>raison d'être</i> and methods we had vigorously opposed, yet we know it is our duty to work with people whose methods we found totally objectionable.  It gets easier as you get to know people.  Trust is required and compromise must be the order of the day.</P>
    <P>I spent three days in Northern Ireland in the last two and a half weeks.  I met many ordinary people, particularly from the unionist tradition, and the message I got loud and clear is that they feel let down by their leaders and representatives. They want to be involved in the all-inclusive talks process and in thrashing out a settlement.  There is a completely different attitude and climate from that I might have experienced 12 or 18 months ago.  The Official Unionist Party in particular has a duty to give leadership.  I urge unionist politicians to <Col N="739" /> show courage and spell out the realities in terms of their party and their tradition. They must realise that an agreement cannot be reached on Northern Ireland and there cannot be a sustainable political settlement unless they participate in dialogue and discussion with other parties in Northern Ireland and with the Irish and British Governments.</P>
    <P>Unionists have always said they wanted nationalist parties to accept what is called the consent principle, that there would be no change in the status of Northern Ireland unless the majority there wish it.  Virtually every nationalist party, all parties in this House and every party on this island except Sinn Féin accept that principle.  Unionists should consider that as reassurance.  They have been told that no change will be made unless a referendum is held, and that too offers reassurance.  Their sheer numbers and, as John Hume said, their geography gives them a strength that virtually nobody else has.  They owe it to their fellow citizens in Northern Ireland and to the citizens on the rest of this island and in the United Kingdom to participate and stop saying no.  I urge them to rethink their attitude to the Taoiseach's invitation to enter dialogue with other parties in Northern Ireland and approach that dialogue in a spirit of generosity, with compromise and moderation in mind.</P>
    <P>I hope the all-inclusive talks process gets under way soon, but I do not think that will happen as we approach the marching season and it is probably unlikely to happen during the summer months.  I hope the conditions to allow it to happen will be in place very soon because the stalemate is damaging.  We need to maintain momentum.  Violence and barbaric evil acts carried out in the name of this country were never justified, but we must give nobody an excuse to contemplate a return to violence.  As we approach the first anniversary of the IRA and Loyalist ceasefires I hope the conditions will be in place to allow the <Col N="740" /> all-inclusive talks to take place.  Everybody was promised a speedy response in the event of a ceasefire.  The ceasefire has been maintained and there is a duty on all participants, and those who wish to be participants, to be generous in the attitude they adopt.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to European Monetary Union.  This country must meet the criteria to participate in monetary union.  If it proceeds in 1999 we will have to meet those criteria, including low inflation, low interest rates, a debt GDP ratio of 60 per cent or less and an Exchequer borrowing requirement of less than 3 per cent one year in advance.  We must meet those criteria for their own sake, even if the European Monetary Union were not at stake, because it would be good for the economy, make us more competitive and assist job creation.  Equally, I strongly believe we should not have a single strategy.  We must not close off the option of not participating in European Monetary Union.  People who express that view are sometimes accused of not wearing the Irish jersey and of maintaining a strong link with the United Kingdom.  The reality is that despite the decrease in our dependency in trade terms from 50 per cent to 60 per cent the official figure of approximately 30 per cent &mdash; although our GDP figures are not accurate and it may be as high as 40 per cent &mdash; 60 per cent of jobs in vulnerable indigenous sectors of our economy are at stake.  In this regard we only have to consider the consequences of the political difficulties in Britain, which have contributed to the value of the púnt increasing to £1.03 against sterling. We must consider the dilemma and difficulties that poses for Irish business and, therefore, we cannot have a single strategy.  I note the Taoiseach in his contribution said that he reiterated that the Government intends that Ireland will be among those countries which qualify to be included in the single currency bloc whenever it commences.  Qualifying to be included does not mean a country will be included, although if it will <Col N="741" /> qualify, it will be included automatically. However, I am sure other countries will not coerce us to join.  I do not believe it is realistic to join if Britain does not join.  It is not only a question of the Tory Party not toeing the Euro line; it is sceptical and does not want to follow that line.  That issue will have major consequences for this economy.  I support what Deputy Ahern said about carrying out a study into the implications for this economy of Britain not joining the European Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>That would have implications for Northern Ireland.  As we move closer to creating a single market on this island, there is greater co-operation and we want to increase the level of trade between the two parts of Ireland.  I understand Articles 26 and 28 of the Framework Document deal with Europe.  They have not been widely discussed, but they raise the possibility of adopting a joint approach to European issues, taking joint action on monitoring policy formation and policy management. I welcome that approach as it makes a good deal of sense, but we will not be able to maintain any type of joint approach if one country, particularly the smaller more vulnerable one, is in the fast lane and the other is virtually outside or operating at a different speed. That would have implications for the creation of an all island economy which many of us want to see established.  It would be unwise if we were to close off the option, either mentally or politically, of staying outside.  Although I emphasise that we should meet the criteria, nevertheless we should keep the two options open until the time comes to make a decision.</P>
    <P>The summit was aspirational, as are many such events, particularly in relation to unemployment.  Each member state will submit an annual report, the first one at the Madrid Summit in December, outlining the measures being taken by member states to tackle the problem of unemployment.  The fact that it is on the agenda of the heads of Government meeting is a good thing, <Col N="742" /> but we need to address some fundamental questions.  I am sure people are tired listening to proposals to lower taxes. The Colm McCarthy-Paul Tansey study undertaken for IBEC recently indicates that payroll costs are 20 per cent higher in the Republic than in Northern Ireland.  That difference adds approximately £1 million to the annual payroll costs of companies like Packard Electric. Now that there is peace and Northern Ireland is much more attractive as a location for inward investment, we should not underestimate the difficulties that will pose for the Republic unless we become competitive <i>vis-á-vis</i> Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The big issue, not only for Ireland but for the Community, is that of unemployment. One of the big failures of the Community and a challenge facing us as we approach the Intergovernmental Conference and the years ahead is the fact that many European citizens cannot participate in the economic and social development of their countries; they are marginalised and cast aside as human set-aside.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it is normal practice to congratulate somebody on attending their first summit, but I congratulate the Taoiseach on this occasion.  I was amused by his observations of how decisions are made.  From my experience attending Council of Ministers meetings on the environment during 1989 and 1990 I was bewildered and wondered how decisions were ever made, given language barriers.  One wonders how the Eurospeak has such implications down the road.  The Community needs to examine and streamline the decision making mechanism.  The debate on this issue must be concentrated less on important issues like defence and whether we do or do not have a Commissioner.  The issues of enlargement, European Monetary Union, unemployment and competition are fundamentally important to a small country with our exposure to trade.  We must put those issues at the top of the agenda and not be sidetracked by issues <Col N="743" /> which may be important, but may not at the end of the day be vital.</P>
    <P>As the Tánaiste will be responding to the debate, I am interested to know when the White Paper will be published, or what progress has been made in that regard.  I know the Tánaiste has been engaged in widespread consultation around the country.  Although I have not been involved in it, I have got favourable feedback about some of the consultative meetings that were held and I consider they have been useful.  I look forward to the debate here and in the committees on the issues of concern in the White Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>On Deputy Harney's last point, we are trying to bring work on the White Paper to a conclusion. I am grateful for her remarks regarding the seminars.  It was a worthwhile experience and we engaged academic, lay people and people interested in various NGOs and foreign policy issues around the country.  It was an opportunity for them to have an input, and such an exercise was not carried out before.  It was worthwhile and I appreciate the efforts made by those who participated in those seminars.  I hope the White Paper will be ready for discussion before the House resumes in October.  I can assure the Deputy that it will be my intention to have a full debate in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Joint Committee on European Affairs and during a full session of this House on the implications, opportunities and the many hard questions in respect of which we need to make decisions in the coming years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy Harney, I agree we must ensure that we have all the homework done on the issues facing us like the European Monetary Union and others. It is important that we keep our economy on track to ensure that we meet the convergence criteria and consider the implications of the decisions that will be made by the United Kingdom.  Whether we like it or not, we are inextricably <Col N="744" /> linked to the UK by way of trade and other issues and we must take full cognisance of whatever decision it will make. It is a difficult one to forecast at this stage and we must await developments in British politics to ascertain the attitude that will prevail leading up to 1999.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a remark made by the Leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Ahern.  He accused me of being aloof in regard to Northern Ireland.  I reject that and I have made clear at many fora my appreciation of and respect for the work done by the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, in the Northern Ireland peace process.  That is my view and it is well known to those who know me.  We must make a distinction about commenting or otherwise on the internal affairs of a party across the water.  That is something I was careful not to do and I believe that was the correct approach to take.</P>
    <P>The Cannes European Council discussed the major current international political issues, in particular the efforts of the European Union to promote a peaceful solution to the ongoing conflict in the former Yugoslavia and its support for the Middle East peace process.  The Council expressed its concern about the deteriorating situation in Burundi and reviewed the development of its external relations in particular with the associated European countries, Russia and the Mediterranean countries.  The Council considered, in this context, how best it might pursue the Union's objectives of contributing to international peace and stability and assisting the development and consolidation of democracy, human rights and fundamental freedoms.  I availed of the meeting to raise the concerns of the Government about the recent decision of the French Government to resume nuclear testing.</P>
    <P>The situation in former Yugoslavia continues to be a source of major preoccupation. The deliberations at the European Council focused mainly on Bosnia and the question of how to advance the peace process there.  Since <Col N="745" /> the expiry of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement at the end of April, we have witnessed a general resumption of hostilities. Sarajevo has been denied water, electricity, food and medical aid.  Bosnian Government offensives out of Sarajevo and other locations have brought reprisals against military targets and indiscriminate shelling of the civilian population.  In the wake of the hostage crisis, the UN's heavy weapons exclusion zone around Sarajevo has collapsed.  The situation in the eastern enclaves is also critical.</P>
    <P>At this critical juncture, the comprehensive statement adopted by the European Council, of the principles and objectives that will guide the Union's policy in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, is both timely and important.  The Council reiterated its opposition to a settlement by force and called for the cessation of military operations. It fully supported the efforts of the UN to promote the peace process. In this context, the Union expressed its support for the strengthening of UNPROFOR through its new rapid reaction capacity which is currently being deployed.  This will enable UNPROFOR to discharge its mandate more effectively.</P>
    <P>The European Council sent a strong signal to all parties to the conflict to refrain from placing obstacles in the way of UNPROFOR's freedom of movement and that of the humanitarian aid organisations which, in perilous circumstances, are bringing aid to the civilian population to the extent possible.  The European Union demanded that the siege of Sarejevo be lifted and that freedom of access be granted to that town and to the other designated safe areas.</P>
    <P>The failure to renew the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement has brought death and deprivation to many Bosnians. It has called into question whether UNPROFOR could continue to operate in Bosnia and raised the spectre of the total war which would follow its withdrawal. Yet there have been successes in Bosnia.  The European Council welcomed the progress being made in <Col N="746" /> developing the <i>rapprochement</i> between Bosnia's Croat and Muslim communities, for example through the deepening of their co-operation within the Federation structures agreed last year.</P>
    <P>The successes registered by the European Union's administration of Mostar were acknowledged by the European Council.  That town's communities, deeply divided by an horrific conflict, are again living together and engaging in a common enterprise to build a better future.  Notwithstanding the legacy of war, Mostar can act as a model for reconciliation in Bosnia and elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>Mr. Carl Bildt, former Swedish Prime Minister, who was recently appointed EU co-chairman of the International Conference on Former Yugoslavia, reported to the Council on his preliminary round of contacts in the region. Mr. Bildt was mandated to explore urgently with the parties concerned in Bosnia, ways of reopening dialogue on the basis of the contact group peace plan which was drawn up by the EU, the US and Russia.  He was also asked to pursue efforts to secure mutual recognition of the states of the former Yugoslavia within their internationally recognised boundaries.  Mutual recognition, particularly between Bosnia and Serbia, could give considerable impetus to the efforts to create the conditions for a peaceful settlement in Bosnia as it would convey a clear signal that ambitions for a &ldquo;greater Serbia&rdquo; were not supported by the authorities in Belgrade. I look forward to hearing from Mr. Bildt on the initial results of his efforts at the next meeting of the EU Foreign Ministers in July.</P>
    <P>While the main focus of discussions was on Bosnia, I was pleased that the European Council also considered other important issues which must be resolved if the former Yugoslavia is to enjoy peace.  I would mention two aspects in this regard.</P>
    <P>First, against the background of the hostilities in Croatia in May, the Council sent a clear warning to Zagreb that <Col N="747" /> it must not attempt to settle the situation in the largely Serb Krajina region by force.  Mr. Bildt has been mandated to encourage Zagreb and the Croatian Serb leaders to reopen talks; to resume implementing the December 1994 Economic Agreement and to accept the plan for a political settlement in Croatia which has been prepared by the international conference.</P>
    <P>Second, the European Council underlined a vitally important principle of general application: that no peaceful settlement will be complete unless the rights of all minority communities are safeguarded.  The situations of the people of Kosovo, Sandjak and Vojvodina were uppermost in our thoughts in this regard.</P>
    <P>I reported to my colleagues at Cannes on my impressions from my recent visit to the Middle East.  My visit has confirmed me in the view that the peace process is at a crucial stage.  I was convinced from my discussions with political leaders in the region that all parties are committed to moving forward. There are hopeful signs in the Syrian-Israeli track of the negotiations.  Developments in this area of negotiations should have positive implications for the situation between Lebanon and Israel. Because of our participation in UNIFIL Ireland has a particular interest in any steps which will bring peace to this war-torn area.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the Declaration of Principles agreed in 1993 between Israel and the Palestinians is a key element in efforts to secure a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.  In this context agreement between the parties on the redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank and the holding of elections in 1995 is vital.  From my visit to Gaza I am also convinced that for peace to become a reality the peace dividend must be translated into improved living standards. With more than 50 per cent unemployment and a population which is forecast to double within the next 15 <Col N="748" /> years Gaza must be a priority for international aid efforts.</P>
    <P>The European Council at Cannes made a firm statement of support for the peace process.  The Union expressed its strong wish that the deadline of 1 July for agreement between Israel and the Palestinians on the redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank and the holding of Palestinian elections will be met.  At Cannes the Union confirmed its willingness to send observers to the forthcoming elections and its willingness to co-ordinate the international election observer mission.  The EU is also playing a major role in support of the peace process as the major international aid donor to the Palestinians.  Through its chairmanship of the Regional Economic Development Working Group it is also at the forefront of efforts to further economic co-operation and development in the region as a whole.</P>
    <P>The commitment of the EU to supporting the Middle East peace process will complement its efforts to build a new partnership with the countries of the Mediterranean.  At Cannes the European Council reaffirmed the importance it attached to the Euromed Conference which will be held in Barcelona in November of this year.</P>
    <P>The European Council issued a statement expressing serious concern at the deteriorating situation in Burundi, and its full support for the efforts of the Burundi authorities to achieve national reconciliation and to restore order.  The European Council wants to see a conference on peace, security and stability in the Great Lakes region convened as soon as possible under the aegis of the United Nations and the Organisation of African Unity.  This follows the declaration by the French Presidency on 23 June which condemned, <i>inter alia</i>, extremists, on all sides and called on the Burundi Government to draw up a clear programme of economic and social recovery.  It also called on states in the region to support the stabilisation efforts made by the Burundi authorities and to take the measures required to <Col N="749" /> prevent the arming and movement of extremists.</P>
    <P>In discussion with the Heads of State or Governments of the associated European countries, the Members of the European Council reviewed the operation of the arrangements for political dialogue between the Union and the associated countries.  This dialogue is an integral part of the strategy to prepare the associated countries for membership of the Union.  The European Council considered that the conclusion last March of the Stability Pact in Europe will also help to bring the Union and the Central and Eastern European countries closer together and provide a framework for the development of co-operation and good neighbourly relations in Europe.  The task of overseeing the agreements and arrangements entered in the Stability Pact has now been entrusted to the OSCE.</P>
    <P>The European Council gave considerable attention to the question of how the Union's relations with Russia should best be developed.  The central objective of EU policy in relation to Russia is to support the democratic and economic reform process there in the interests of all of the people of that country and of the general stability and prosperity of the whole European Continent.  The Partnership and Co-operation Agreement with Russia, signed at the Corfu Summit last year is a key element in this approach.  It provides for wideranging and mutually beneficial economic links and closer more structured dialogue on political issues.  In the light of the disproportionate use of force by the Russian military in Chechnya earlier this year, EU Foreign Ministers identified four criteria on which they wished to see progress in order to facilitate signature of the Interim Agreement which is to give effect to the trade and commercial provisions of the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement, pending its ratification and entry into force.  These criteria were a ceasefire; negotiations for a political solution; an effective role for the OSCE and the facilitation of humanitarian action in Chechnya.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="750" /> Considerable progress has been made towards fulfilling these criteria.  An OSCE assistance group was deployed in Grozny in April and is enjoying co-operation from the Russian authorities. Negotiations between the parties began last month and has been given impetus in recent days following the tragedy in Budennovsk.  Humanitarian aid agencies are now enjoying greater access to areas affected by the fighting.</P>
    <P>In the light of the progress made in implementing the four criteria and relying on confirmation of that progress, the European Council decided in favour of signature of the Interim Agreement.</P>
    <P>The European Council also expressed its support for efforts to develop dislogue and a closer understanding with Russia on security matters and its intention to contribute actively to the work in the OSCE framework to prepare a security model for the 21st century.  By virtue of its comprehensive concept of security and inclusive membership, the OSCE has a key role to play in the evolving European security architecture and the security model exercise provides an important opportunity to engage Russia in constructive dialogue on these issues.</P>
    <P>Elsewhere, the foreign policy engagement of the Union is increasing rapidly in response to the growing demands of third countries for closer economic and political relations.  Work is currently in progress on the development of new structures for regular dialogue and co-operation with a range of third countries and groupings of third countries in Asia, Latin America and Africa.</P>
    <P>I availed of the meeting at Cannes to express the Government's profound concerns about the decision of the French Government to resume nuclear testing this year.  I outlined the Government's opposition to nuclear testing and I asked that the French Government reconsider its decision in the interests of the environment, nuclear disarmament and of a comprehensive test ban treaty. We will continue our efforts to persuade the French Government to rescind its decision to proceed with these tests.  The <Col N="751" /> French decision and the recent Chinese test show the limitations of a purely unilateral approach and the need for a binding international agreement that will ban all tests, in all atmospheres for all time.  Following discussion by Heads of Government, it was agreed that the European Council should reaffirm in its conclusions the objective of the signature of a comprehensive test ban treaty by the end of 1996 at the latest.</P>
    <P>The opening day of the European Council coincided with the 50th anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter.  The Council adopted a declaration to mark the occasion which pays tribute to the work of the UN over 50 years and reaffirms the Union's attachment to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter.  The Union is by far the biggest contributor, both financially and in terms of peace-keeping troops, to the United Nations.  The United Nations organisation is faced with a very severe financial crisis at present because of the failure of many member states to pay their assessed contributions. I, therefore, particularly welcome the emphasis in the Declaration on the need for all members states to pay their assessed contributions unconditionally, in full and on time.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of the Declaration also reflect Irish concerns as I have presented them to the UN General Assembly last autumn.  The need for a sustainable development policy centred on human beings and building on the achievements of the series of world conferences which the UN has organised in recent years is highlighted.  Ireland attaches particular importance to the full implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action in the field of human rights.</P>
    <P>We hope that the gathering of Heads of State and Government in New York next October, which will mark the 50th anniversary, will provide an impetus to the process of UN reform.  However, if the UN is to become a more effective organisation for international co-operation in the next century, all member <Col N="752" /> states must pay their fair share of its costs.  As we celebrate the 40th year of our UN membership this year, we can be proud of our record as a troop contributor to peace-keeping.</P>
    <P>We took a number of important decisions on financing the Union's assistance programmes for the neighbouring regions in Central and Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean and our partners, the ACP countries.  First, the agreement which was reached on the level of funding for the Union's aid programme in the ACP countries will enable our negotiators to return to the negotiating table tomorrow and to offer these countries a reasonable increase on current levels of aid.</P>
    <P>The ACP countries are the poorest in the world.  Africa, as we know, has suffered appallingly over the last decade. The Union must do all it can to break the spiral of deprivation.  The Lomé Convention and its financial instrument, the European Development Fund is the main focus for the Union's activities in this area.  In the past Ireland has played an important part in the development of the Lomé instruments.  The first convention was negotiated during our first Presidency in 1975 and we continued to play our part in the negotiation of subsequent conventions.  I know that our willingness to accept an increase of one third in our contribution under the current convention helped to create the atmosphere which enabled the Presidency to get agreement in Cannes.</P>
    <P>Africa needs all the assistance we can give.  There is a danger that Europe's attention will wane, it is through instruments such as the Lomé Convention that it is maintained and during our Presidency next year we will give priority to the Union's relations with Africa when we establish the Union's external agenda.</P>
    <P>The second significant decision we took at Cannes was to agree on the level of funding of our assistance programmes in the Mediterranean region to the end of the decade.  I have spoken earlier of my recent visit to the Middle East.  The southern Mediterranean and <Col N="753" /> the islands of Malta and Cyprus are of great importance to the Union as a whole.  What happens on our southern flank is of immediate relevance to the Union.  We are the largest donor to development in the region and will remain so.  Our assistance and the trade liberalisation measures which we have adopted are helping to underpin the economic development of our Mediterranean neighbours.  The need for peace and stability in the region cannot be underestimated, as I found during my visit last week.</P>
    <P>Third, we have now fixed the budget for aid to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe for the rest of the decade.  The changes in that region since 1989 have had a profound effect on the Union.  We have established a close relationship with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe through the structured dialogue which involves regular meetings at ministerial level and, as happened on Tuesday, prime ministerial level.  Our aid programmes and the important measure of trade liberalisation which has been established through the Europen agreements, play a vital part in preparing these countries for eventual full membership of the Union.  The major challenge involved in preparing for membership was highlighted in the Commission's White Paper on the integration of the countries concerned to the internal market which the European Council noted.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal to be done to give effect to the aims of Cannes.  On employment and growth, while we reaffirmed the objective of economic and monetary union, we are still at the stage of commissioning reports from the Commission and of calling on the specialist councils to come up with ideas which can make a real impact on unemployment.</P>
    <P>It is by its success in dealing with this problem that the Union will be judged. Significantly, the priorities listed for the preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference now specifically recognised that employment &mdash; and the environment &mdash; are the major concerns which <Col N="754" /> the citizens of the Union will bring to the process.</P>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing this Bill the Minister admitted that the disconnection of water supply is a last resort of local authorities, a step not taken lightly.  He agreed that local authorities have been sympathetic and responsible in their exercise of that power.  If it is not broken, why fix it?  Why plunge local authorities into this bureaucratic merry-go-round when they have been sensible and sympathetic dealing with problem cases.  Up to 600,000 householders regularly pay their annual service charges.  As few as 900, a fraction of 1 per cent only, have had their water supply disconnected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This absurd Bill, with all its tedious procedures and guidelines, has been introduced for the sake of a very small number of householders who cannot and, in many cases, will not pay their fair share.  One wonders what signal this Bill will send to the hundreds of thousands of hardworking citizens who strive to pay their fair share in all walks of life only to observe the Government and this Minister, at the behest of the Democratic Left Party, fretting over the <Col N="755" /> handful who fail to pay for whatever reason.  If this is the attempt of Democratic Left to shore-up their left wing credibility, it is a poor, pathetic effort.</P>
    <P>After the enactment of this Bill each local authority will have to write to a defaulting householder no fewer than six times, thereafter seeking a court order if it is necessary to disconnect supply.  Whatever happened to the concept of greater autonomy for local authorities and locally-elected public representatives? This Bill will erode the power of local authorities to manage their affairs, divesting so much of their administration to the courts.  The new arrangement is showing signs already of seriously affecting the revenue local authorities will be able to collect.</P>
    <P>For example, in my county of Cavan, which had the second highest rate of service charges in 1994, with a 90 per cent collection rate, already in 1995 the local authority revenue collected is 30 per cent down on the corresponding period last year.  People now know just how difficult it will be for any local authority to disconnect supply.  Some will be even more tempted to exploit the opportunities afforded them to defer payments for several months or not to pay.</P>
    <P>How does the Minister propose to make up the revenue shortfall that would now appear to be inevitable for local authorities, already experiencing serious funding difficulties?  One also wonders what people in rural areas, many of whom must pay thousands of pounds to instal their own water supplies, will think of a Bill that seeks to comfort other householders who, in many cases, pay only small annual charges for water and sewerage connections; it will hardly strike them as fair, just or equitable.</P>
    <P>I would be more concerned about people living in houses lacking basic sanitary facilities which should be addressed with greater urgency as everybody should have such facilities in their homes.  Indeed, it would be opportune for the Minister to consider the <Col N="756" /> reintroduction of a limited house improvement grant scheme whereby householders could be assisted in providing basic facilities and comforts in homes which do not have them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Deputies have contributed to the debate on this Bill.  I am grateful for the interest and depth of those contributions and I intend to respond to as many of the important issues raised as possible.  Before doing so, I would like to recall briefly the purpose of the Bill and its effects because many of the comments made from the other side of the House were not focused on the real intent of the Bill and did not reflect its real impact.</P>
      <P>The Bill meets a commitment in the Government's policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal.</i> It is designed primarily to protect the individual in the serious matter of water supply disconnection without introducing any unreasonable or unworkable regulations or restrictions on local authorities in their efforts to recover outstanding water charges.</P>
      <P>The notification procedures set out in the Bill are, for the most part, already in operation by local authorities and, in many cases, have been for years.  I notified them by regulation last April and they are in effect.  Three notices, not six, are required under the regulations circulated earlier and that is reasonable and fair.  The Bill establishes formal, standardised and statute-backed procedural arrangements which will ensure that people are fully aware where they stand on this important issue and know they will be treated in like manner whether they are in Cavan, Wexford, Dublin or Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already referred to the fact that service charges will be considered as part of the professional study on local government financing which I commissioned earlier this week.  Deputy Michael Smith surprised me by suggesting that the study is a compromise, a cop-out and a cover-up.  Deputy Smith <Col N="757" /> was my immediate predecessor as Minister for the Environment.  He knows the financial problems faced by local authorities. He knows the difficulties experienced by them in generating acceptable levels of services and facilities, as does every other Member of the House who is, or was, a member of a local authority. Does Deputy Smith believe that the present system of local government funding is working well or, more fundamentally, is an appropriate or an effective one?  I genuinely do not believe that is his view.</P>
    <P>Local authority finances need to be put on a much firmer footing.  To do this properly, we must consider all the options, critically evaluate their potential and likely consequences and decide how best to implement the agreed solution. Part of that process &mdash; and I make no apology for it &mdash; will be the building of the consensus needed among members of local authorities and the general public who are committed to having an effective tier of local government.</P>
    <P>Despite what Deputy Quill may say, there is no easy solution.  If there were, it would have been tried and implemented long before now.  The study, therefore, is not a compromise, a cover-up or a cop-out; it is a genuine attempt to tackle a difficult and often contentious issue in a serious way.  As Minister for the Environment, I am committed to seeing it through and I am confident the study will form the basis of a comprehensive and imaginative review.  With the publication of the White Paper we can build consensus and, for the first time in a generation, move forward the issue of local government reform.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill suggested it is inappropriate to have the issue of water supply disconnection examined in the courts. We are all agreed that disconnection of water supply can have serious repercussions for householders and individuals. It is therefore essential that consumers perceive the disconnection system to be transparent and fair, and the courts will provide them with safeguards. The independence of the courts <Col N="758" /> is beyond question and will provide forceful back-up to the decision of a local authority to disconnect in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>I am as concerned as the Deputy to ensure that the new measures will not overburden the courts.  In drawing up the Bill, I was conscious of the concerns raised by her and I specifically and deliberately included provisions relating to evidence and burden of proof which will minimise the possibility of delays and obviate the potential for long drawn out legal battles or court proceedings. My colleague, the Minister for Justice, announced last week that she has obtained Government approval to prepare a Bill that will contain a package of initiatives aimed at reforming the courts and the judicial system.  The initiatives will streamline the courts system and will, among other measures, provide a statutory basis for an increase in the number of District Court judges available to deal with the current backlog.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss to understand how Deputy Michael Smith considers that this Bill should be somehow tied in with people who provide their own water supplies.  Such people are not liable for water charges.  The Deputy specifically referred to group water schemes.  I am proud of my record in this area in a mere six months.  Since I came to office, I have launched a number of important initiatives on group water schemes.  In March, I announced increased group scheme grants which more than doubled previous maximum grant rates to take account of rising costs and to further encourage the provision of rural piped water supplies through co-operative effort.  In April, I approved over 140 group water schemes which will provide quality water supply to approximately 2,300 rural households and associated farms at an estimate cost of £6.5 million. I also gave an undertaking to advance the planning of other large group schemes throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Quill expressed the view that the Bill represents a vote of no confidence in the judgment of local authority officials and that local authorities <Col N="759" /> should have discretion in this matter. Deputy Ahern also felt it was an unfair reflection on local authority officials.  I reject these comments out of hand.  In my opening speech on Tuesday, I made it quite clear that the Bill should not be interpreted to suggest that local authorities have acted improperly in the use of their disconnection power and I said that authorities had adopted a responsible and sympathetic attitude.  The procedures in the Bill which are being introduced because of the severity of the disconnection sanction will do nothing to remove the discretion of local authorities in deciding on disconnection.</P>
    <P>Both Deputies Smith and Quill suggested that the proposed new notification arrangements will give rise to unnecessary bureaucracy and additional work for local authorities.  The new measures may initially have minor implications for some local authorities in terms of adjusting their existing procedural arrangements to ensure compliance with the law.  Once the initial adjustments have been made, however, there is no reason to believe the new procedures will place any additional burden on local authorities.  There are two main reasons for this.  First, the notification procedures required under the Bill are already being implemented in large measure by local authorities. The fact that these will, in future, be mandatory by statute should not give rise to much additional work.</P>
    <P>Second, the Bill has been designed to minimise the potential for unnecessary bureaucracy and to avoid the creation of an unreasonable additional workload on the part of local authorities.  Under section 3(6), a sanitary authority will be entitled to give <i>prima facie</i> evidence as to compliance with any of the notification procedures under the Bill.  Under section 6, information from the records of a sanitary authority will be admissible as evidence on foot of a straightforward certification process.  It will be possible for local authorities to keep computerised records, thereby precluding a <Col N="760" /> need to file and keep copies of all reminders or warning notices issued.</P>
    <P>Lest there be any doubt about the number of notifications required to be issued before disconnection, under Article 1 (b) of the Schedule to the Bill, it is possible to issue warning notices in conjunction with the reminders.  Thus, before a final notice is delivered to a consumer's premises, a local authority need send only one initial demand and two follow-up reminders or warning notices.  This cannot be considererd too bureaucratic or onerous a task.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Smith expressed concern that the new arrangements for disconnecting water supplies for non-payment of charges will adversely affect service charge collection rates with resultant consequences for local authority income.  This possibility also worried Deputies Quill, O'Keeffe and Brendan Smith.  I reject this notion.  The power to disconnect has not been abolished and will not be abolished by the statute.  It remains to deal with people with adequate resources who refuse to pay their charges.  The Bill simply puts in place a procedural mechanism in respect of water supply disconnection which is necessary to provide a certain basic level of information and protection for all consumers.  Consumers will be in no doubt as to the possible eventual outcome of refusal to pay any overdue charges.  Under the notification procedures, the penalty for disconnection for refusal to pay charges will be hammered home to consumers through the issuing of the statutorily required warning notices.</P>
    <P>In addition, Deputies should not forget that, as promised in the policy agreement <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, a new income tax allowance was provided in this year's Finance Act in respect of service charges paid in full on time.  The new allowance will be a valuable incentive to people to pay on time thus protecting and enhancing local authority incomes derived from such charges.  The allowances will commence in the year 1996-97 in respect of service charges paid in the current year.  It is worth <Col N="761" /> emphasising also that local authorities are stepping up their efforts to encourage early payment of charges through promotional schemes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern said local authorities' powers to disconnect are being watered down.  The power to disconnect is being restricted only in so far as it will be no longer possible to disconnect a water supply where the person has not paid because of hardship.  I make no excuse for this.  Nobody in the House would advocate cutting off the water supply of a person who is unable to meet the charge.  This restriction will not be a significant factor in terms of local authority income because local authorities throughout the country already operate generous waiver schemes in hardship cases.</P>
    <P>As a once off exercise, my Department recently sought information from a number of local authorities as to the collection rates in 1995.  It will be of particular interest to the Deputies present that the responses received indicate that in more than 50 per cent of cases the collection rates for the first quarter of this year were up compared with the same period last year.  Deputy Michael Smith, who raised this, will be glad to know that Tipperary (North Riding) County Council's collection rates for service charges are up significantly on 1994 levels, almost 66 per cent for the first quarter of this year, and Deputy Brendan Smith will be interested to know that the collection rates in Cavan are up by 10 per cent in the first quarter of this year.  Despite the fears expressed by those two Deputies, income is not only not collapsing, it is increasing over the same period last year.  The Deputies will be heartened to hear of that positive outcome of the regulations which I introduced.  I reject any suggestion that the Bill will result in a fall off in the payment of charges.  Putting notification procedures on a statutory footing will have a greater impact on people and encourage rather than discourage payment of charges.</P>
    <P>This is a short and simple Bill, and its <Col N="762" /> purpose is clear.  It is intended to provide a proper balance between protection of individual consumers and the need to allow strict sanctions against defaulters to ensure recovery of charges which are properly due.  The negative attitude of Deputies on the Opposition benches is unjustified.  This Bill will act as a charter for people who pay water charges.  It will provide protection to the less well off in our society who cannot pay.  At the same time, it will preserve the powers of local authorities to cut off the supplies of non compliant consumers who have the resources to pay but refuse to do so.</P>
    <P>I am happy that this Bill strikes the right balance and it deserves support.  I thank all Deputies who contributed to this debate.</P>

    <Title>Civil Legal Aid Bill, 1995    [Seanad]:    Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Civil Legal Aid Bill, 1995 is to provide a statutory framework for the Government's scheme of civil legal aid and advice. Since the scheme was established it has helped many thousands of people to have access to justice who would otherwise not have been able to afford it.  It is a scheme targeted at those whose need is greatest and while the range of cases dealt with covers most civil law matters the vast bulk of cases are family law cases.  The Bill is an important social measure and it implements one of the priority commitments in the Government's programme of family law reform in the run-up to the referendum on divorce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="763" /> The Bill provides for the establishment and composition of a legal aid board, maps out its powers and duties and the criteria for granting legal aid and advice, details the types of cases which may be aided, sets out provisions regarding management of the board's finances and empowers the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to make certain orders and regulations to give full effect to the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill guarantees the continuation of the civil legal aid scheme.  The Government believes the statutory scheme now provided for in this Bill and the development programme that has been devised by the Legal Aid Board in consultation with my Department is the best way forward for an efficient, effective and high quality system of legal aid.</P>
    <P>To function effectively the board needs a combination of money, staff and law centres.  The board operated for far too long on meagre funding since its establishment almost 16 years ago.  It was difficult to gain access to justice because numbers of law centres and staff were low and long waiting lists were an unfortunate feature in many law centres.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Equality and Law Reform I secured funding for the board which increased from £2.7 million in 1992 to £4.97 million in 1994.  The 1995 Estimates provide for £6.2 million, an increase of 25 per cent over last year's figure.  As a result of this increased funding over the last two years, staff numbers have increased from 99 to 204. The number of solicitor staff has increased from 39 to 75.  The number of administrative staff has increased from 60 to 129.</P>
    <P>The number of full-time law centres has increased from 16 in 1993 to the current figure of 25.  When the Wexford law centre comes on stream shortly, the number of full-time law centres will be 26 and the 1995 Estimates allow for further expansion.</P>
    <P>The increases have facilitated a major development of the services of the Legal Aid Board.  They are aimed at ensuring <Col N="764" /> that individuals entitled to legal aid are provided with that legal aid within a reasonable time and that they do not have to travel long distances to obtain it.  They have helped to address the problems of persons who, in the main, seek recourse to the courts for maintenance orders for themselves and their children, for barring orders to protect them from violence in the home, for child custody orders and for decrees of judicial separation.  Against the background of those major developments and this Bill the legal aid scheme is now one of the flagships of the State's services to those in need.</P>
    <P>A key feature of the board's services with which I readily agree is that it employs its own solicitors.  It has resulted in a good standard of service which is uniform throughout the law centres.  I take this opportunity to thank the staff and the board for delivering that service to the public.</P>
    <P>To assist the House in its consideration of the Bill, I will explain briefly the manner in which the existing scheme of civil legal aid and advice operates.  An understanding of that scheme, on which I have based the Bill, will be useful when we come to deal with the minutiae of the proposed statutory scheme.</P>
    <P>In order to qualify for assistance under the existing administrative scheme, an applicant must satisfy two basic eligibility tests; one based on his or her means and the other on the merits of his or her case.  The income eligibility limits are reviewed from time to time on the basis generally of increases in the consumer price index.  The most recent increase was in 1991.  I am increasing the various allowances which may be deducted from an applicant's gross income to determine his or her disposable income by an average of 13 per cent, the income threshold beyond which means related contributions are payable by 15 per cent and the income eligibility limit by 18.5 per cent.  These increases will mean that more persons will be eligible for legal aid than heretofore.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> Certain details in relation to the operation of the means test which may be of interest to Deputies are as follows.  An applicant satisfies the means test if his or her &ldquo;disposable income&rdquo; and &ldquo;disposable capital&rdquo; are within limits specified in the scheme.  &ldquo;Disposable income&rdquo; is the income which remains when various deductions are made from gross income &mdash;&ldquo;gross income&rdquo; being defined as total income received from all sources.  The deductions to be made from gross income, which are referred to as allowances, include, for example, sums in respect of income tax, mortgage repayments, rent, social insurance, VHI contributions, expenses in travelling to and from work, together with various allowances in respect of the applicant's spouse and dependent children.  &ldquo;Capital&rdquo; includes, for example, money in the applicant's bank, credit union, building society or post office accounts, or the applicant's house, property or land.  The assessment of the value of such resources can seem to be a complex matter.  The aim, however, is simply to assess the real value of the applicant's disposable capital.  That is essentially its gross value, less, for example, the cost of realising assets or repaying outstanding loans.  In the vast majority of cases applicants do not have significant capital resources, which means that, by and large, eligibility is determined by reference to income alone.  I should add that while the income of a husband and wife are normally aggregated, they are treated separately when the parties are in conflict with each other or where they are living apart.  As a result, in a very high proportion of matrimonial cases, women will qualify for legal services even if their husbands are financially secure.</P>
    <P>The merits test to which I referred earlier operates on the basis that legal aid may be granted only where the applicant has, as a matter of law, reasonable grounds for taking, defending or being a party to legal proceedings and is reasonably likely to be successful in those proceedings.</P>
    <P>As a result of the decision of the</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="766" /> Supreme Court in the case of <i>M. F.-v.&mdash;Legal Aid Board and Others</i> different considerations apply in the case of applications to the board concerning children.  Due to that decision, individuals applying for legal aid in cases concerning children who are otherwise eligible, are not refused legal aid under the merits test unless the board considers that their is no reasonable likelihood that their points of view and submissions in relation to the child would be among the material which would be relied upon by a judge in determining issues concerning the child.</P>
    <P>In considering applications for legal aid in general, it is also necessary for the Legal Aid Board to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the probable cost of taking or defending the proceedings, measured against the likely benefit to the applicant.  In effect, the scheme aims not to put the person of limited means in the position of an individual for whom &ldquo;money is no object&rdquo; but, rather, to put him or her in the position of a person whose means, while not over-abundant, are sufficient to cover the cost of obtaining essential legal services.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme, recipients of legal services are liable to pay contributions to the board.  The new minimum contribution will be £4 for legal advice plus an additional £19 where the applicant needs to take or defend court proceedings. The scheme also provides for a maximum disposable income related contribution of £583.  Generally speaking, therefore, the individual applicant knows from the outset the maximum cost of the board's services.  In a small number of cases, the contributions originally determined may be increased &mdash; for example, where the applicant's financial circumstances improve while he or she is in receipt of legal aid or where his or her financial circumstances improve as a result of obtaining the board's services.  The forthcoming increases in eligibility levels will be reflected in the amount of contribution payable by an applicant for legal aid or advice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="767" /> There are three final points concerning contributions which are worthy of mention.  First, all persons depending solely on social welfare payments qualify for legal services on payment of the standard &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; contributions. Second, a person who is liable to pay the minimum contributions may have the payments waived in whole or in part in cases of severe hardship and, finally, contributions may in certain circumstances be paid in instalments.</P>
    <P>Certain matters, including representation before tribunals, are excluded from the scope of the existing scheme. However, law centre solicitors can, and regularly do, provide advice to applicants in cases coming before tribunals; and if the decision of a tribunal is appealed to the courts, both legal aid and advice may be provided.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill enables me, as Minister, by order to appoint a day to be the establishment day for the purposes of the Act.  This is a standard provision in legislation of this nature.  It will allow time for regulations to be made under the Act and for the board to put in place the measures necessary for its operation as a statutory body.  The aim, of course, will be to bring the legislation into force as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Sections 3, 4 and 5 deal with the establishment of the Legal Aid Board and charge it with the function of providing, within its resources and subject to the provisions of the Act, legal aid and advice to applicants who satisfy those provisions.  The board will be endowed with legal personality thereby entitling it to be a party to legal actions and to hold legal title to property.</P>
    <P>Section 4 continues the arrangement under which the Minister has power to appoint the Legal Aid Board, which will consist of a chairperson and 12 ordinary members.  Two members of the board must be barristers and two must be solicitors. In addition, staff will be represented on the board by two of their number.  I am also ensuring that the board will have an appropriate gender balance.  No fewer than five members <Col N="768" /> must be men and no fewer than five must be women.  As at present, the term of office of board members will be five years and no member will be able to serve more than two terms.</P>
    <P>The principal function of the board, by virtue of section 5, will be to provide legal aid and advice in civil cases to individuals who satisfy the income eligibility criteria specified in section 29 and the other requirements of the Act.  The board will also be obliged to disseminate information in relation to its services to such an extent and in such a manner as it considers appropriate. Under section 6 the Minister may assign additional functions to the board which are incidental or consequential on the functions assigned to it by the legislation. The board will be entitled to delegate functions to its members or its staff.</P>
    <P>Section 7 empowers the Minister to issue general policy directives on legal aid and advice to the board and requires it to comply with such directives.  This provision is necessary in view of my overall responsibility to the Oireachtas for legal aid policy.  As at present, however, the board will be independent in relation to the provision of legal aid and advice.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with annual reports, and adheres to the current practice of requiring the board to present such a report to the Minister in such form as the Minister may approve.  The board must make its report within nine months after the year which is covered by the report.  The section also requires the Minister to lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas copies of every such report. The Minister may also request the board to supply information relating to the performance of its functions.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides for a chief executive officer of the board who will be a civil servant of the State and will be appointed by the Minister on the recommendation of the Civil Service Commissioners.</P>
    <P>Sections 11, 21 and 22 deal with matters relating to the other staff of the board.  Those sections were framed after <Col N="769" /> lengthy discussions with five different trade unions as well as the board itself. The result of those discussions is one which I believe will satisfy all of the parties involved.  The effect of the sections in question is that the board's administrative and clerical staff will be civil servants in the Civil Service of the State.  The board will be in a position to recruit its own staff through the Civil Service Commission, a development which it has sought for some considerable time.  The board's solicitor staff will continue, as at present, without Civil Service status.  However, the Bill enables me to designate them as civil servants following consultations with them and with the consent of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Section 13 to 17 deal with a number of technical and practical matters which arise because of the legal identity which the board will have following the enactment of the Bill.  Section 14, for example, is a standard provision which transfers all property, rights and liabilities currently attaching to the non-statutory board to the new board, while section 15 serves to ensure that contracts entered into by the current non-statutory board are transferred to its statutory successor.</P>
    <P>Sections 18, 19 and 20 deal with matters relating to funding of the board. They empower the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to advance funds to it and require it to establish and maintain a fund to finance all its operations.</P>
    <P>I now come to the heart of the Bill, that part which deals with the provision of legal aid and advice.  While the sections in question reflect the provisions of the existing scheme to a considerable extent, there are a number of significant changes which will enhance the legal aid system.</P>
    <P>Section 24 maps out the primary test which an applicant for legal aid must pass in order to obtain such services.  It requires that legal aid or advice may not be granted unless, in the opinion of the board, a reasonably prudent person in <Col N="770" /> similar circumstances who could afford to pay for the services of lawyers in private practice would do so at his or her own expense and a lawyer would be likely to advise them to do so.</P>
    <P>Sections 25 and 26 concern legal advice, which is defined as legal assistance other than actual representation in court or any preparatory steps leading up to it. The board will, subject to section 26 (3), be precluded from providing legal advice in relation to criminal law matters because, as Deputies will be aware, such matters are dealt with under separate legislation, namely the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962.  That subsection addresses the situation where complainants in cases of rape, aggravated sexual assault, unlawful carnal knowledge and incest are in need of legal advice.  The board will be in a position to give that advice free of charge.</P>
    <P>Sections 27 and 28 deal with legal aid which is defined as meaning representation by a solicitor or barrister nominated by the board in civil proceedings conducted in the District, Circuit, High or Supreme Courts or any court or tribunal prescribed by the Minister by order under section 27.  The definition encompasses all such assistance as would normally be given to a client by a solicitor in private practice in relation to instituting, defending or concluding court proceedings, and it applies to all civil proceedings other than those referred to in section 28 as &ldquo;designated matters&rdquo;.  The designated matters are matters presently excluded from the scheme, such as defamation and conveyancing, other than conveyancing which arises out of a matrimonial dispute. However, I have provided in section 28 (11) that the Minister may, by order, deem any of these matters as no longer being designated.  The making of any such order would take into account the capacity of the board to deliver those services in addition to existing services, its resources and the Exchequer position.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that applicants will be provided with legal aid where they are granted legal aid certificates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="771" /> The criteria for the granting of certificates are contained in section 28 and are on similar lines to those contained in the scheme.  For reasons which I have already outlined, special provisions will apply in the case of children.  It also provides that applicants in general must satisfy a &ldquo;merits&rdquo; test.  There is provision, for example, that the applicant must, as a matter of law, have reasonable grounds for taking, defending, or being a party to proceedings, that it must be reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case, to provide legal services.  Deputies will readily appreciate that there is little point in legally aiding a client where it is considered that, from a legal point of view, his or her case is totally lacking in merit and that legal services, no matter who may provide them, are unlikely to provide him or her with any worthwhile benefit.</P>
    <P>In assessing whether or not a legal aid certificate should be granted, the board will continue to be required to weigh the probable cost of providing legal aid against the benefit likely to accrue to the applicant as a result of the proceedings. The board will also have discretion to refuse to grant legal aid certificates on specified grounds where, for example, the cost to the applicant of taking the proceedings without receiving legal aid would be less than the contribution payable by him or her to the board or where the applicant has failed to provide such information as is required by the board to make a decision on his or her application.</P>
    <P>Section 29 deals with the critical matters of financial eligibility criteria and contributions.  An applicant's eligibility and contribution will be assessed by reference to his or her disposable income and, where appropriate, disposal capital, in such a manner as is prescribed in regulations.  As indicated, I have reviewed the income eligibility limits and increased them from 1995.</P>
    <P>Section 30 of the Bill provides for the establishment of panels of solicitors and barristers who will be able to provide <Col N="772" /> legal aid and advice to clients of the Legal Aid Board.  The pilot private solicitor project which I initiated last year was generally welcomed as being instrumental in helping to reduce the backlog of cases which had existed because of under-funding and the lack of law centres and staff.  Its operation has been reviewed in the light of implementation of the development programme involving the significant additional resources I have been able to provide for the board and I am at present awaiting receipt of the board's observations on the conclusions of the review group.</P>
    <P>Section 30 (6), which is new, will enable individual law centres, through different solicitors, to assist both parties to a case.  In the past, such cases have been dealt with by separate centres with the result that clients of the board have, on occasion, to travel considerable distances to meet with their solicitors.  I have taken the opportunity given by the Bill to tackle that problem.  It will be of benefit particularly to persons who avail of law centres in small or remote towns. They will not now have to travel long distances to other centres.</P>
    <P>Section 31 deals with the selection or nomination of lawyers to represent clients, while section 32 in effect guarantees clients of the board the same rights as they would have should they have retained the services of solicitors in private practice.  Sections 33 to 36 deal with the matter of costs.  They allow orders to be made in proceedings for costs in the same way as they would in cases involving parties who are not legally aided.  Section 34 points to a number of specific factors which should be taken into account by the courts in making such orders.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions in the Bill.  They have been subjected to close scrutiny by the other House in the course of an invigorating and constructive debate and the Bill has been improved as a result.  Deputies may be aware that the question of including Employment and Social Welfare Appeals Tribunals cases in the scope of <Col N="773" /> the statutory scheme was the subject of a long debate in the other House.  As I explained in that House, the Legal Aid Board provided legal representation in 2,411 cases in 1993 and in that same year the Employment Appeals Tribunal heard 5,710 cases.  In 910 of the EAT cases the employee was legally represented. Had legal aid been available, it is estimated that the vast majority of those 910 cases would have been legally aided and the board's caseload would have increased by almost 38 per cent. The board would simply not have been able to deal with that number of cases without a major disruption of its capacity to deal with family law cases.</P>
    <P>In the same year the Social Welfare Appeals Tribunal decided on 14,115 appeals.  Once again, the overwhelming majority of individuals involved in those cases would have qualified for legal aid had it been available.  Any need to provide legal representation in even a small proportion of that large number of cases would wipe out the capacity of the board to deal with family law cases. What one would have is a picture of chaos in which the board would be unable to deal with any case at all within a reasonable time, be it a family law case or a tribunal case.  The combined effect of labour and social welfare cases on the board would increase by upwards of six times its existing workload.  To cope with the work, funding for extra staff and premises would have to increase to up to £20 million or more compared to present funding of £6.2 million.  It is no surprise, therefore, that successive Ministers with responsibility for legal aid and successive Governments have been unable to agree to the extension of legal aid to tribunal cases.</P>
    <P>My priority at present is to ensure that we have a nationwide legal aid service which is reasonably accessible to clients and to ensure that waiting lists can be kept to an absolute minimum. The board must, as a priority, be in a position to deal effectively with family law cases.  That being said, I should reiterate that legal advice on labour and social welfare law matters is available <Col N="774" /> under the scheme at present and legal aid is available where court proceedings are concerned.  The Bill, as it is framed at present, will allow legal aid to be extended to tribunals by ministerial order at a time when it can be said that the financial and structural arrangements are in place and when it can also be said there is public acceptance of the need for that type of expenditure, given the other demands on legal aid and on the Exchequer.  The immediate inclusion of even the Employment Appeals Tribunal, however, would result in very large increases in waiting lists and divert the board's limited resources away from it primary focus.</P>
    <P>The fact that over the years the legal content of cases before the Employment Appeals Tribunal appears to have increased is of concern.  In so far as legal aid may be involved, I am reviewing the position in consultation with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  If a structured approach can be developed it may be possible to extend legal aid to certain such cases, depending on how the current development programme of the Legal Aid Board works out and depending also on the Exchequer position.</P>
    <P>I regard the legal aid scheme in its statutory form as part only of a general scheme or framework for persons who are in the unfortunate position of having to resolve a civil dispute.  I think, Deputies will readily accept that the courts should be a last resort and that where possible every other effort should be made by persons to resolve matters by other means.  In this context my approach, in so far as marriage breakdown in particular is concerned, is not to confine State funding to any one area but to channel funding into marriage counselling agencies and the family mediation services.  Our separation laws encourage that approach and enable the courts to adjourn proceedings to allow parties to avail of those services.  My Department has responsibilities in relation to all of these areas and the programme of legislative and administrative reform being implemented by <Col N="775" /> my Department represents the commitment of the Government to the social principles of equality and of access to justice.  I look forward to the comments of Deputies on the Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Governments and Ministers have come and gone since this Bill was initially promised in the early 1980s.  I welcome the Bill, which reflects the Minister's commitment to the development of the legal aid scheme, which has undergone major expansion in the past two years.  The Fianna Fáil-Labour Programme for Government, which was to have run from 1993-1997, contained a specific commitment to place the scheme on a statutory footing and to extend it to cover tribunals.  This legislation places the scheme on a statutory footing but it does not extend its scope to include tribunals.  This development and this scheme as a whole has major implications for women, since 98 per cent of the cases dealt with are family law cases and most of the cases for civil legal aid are brought by women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provided the Minister with a unique opportunity for a wide-ranging discussion on the role and purpose of a publicly funded legal aid service.  So far as it has failed to achieve that objective the content of the Bill and the approach adopted by the Minister, in relation to the scope of the legal aid services, must be called into question.  The Government has failed to meet present-day needs because the Bill, first, does not improve access to justice for people who cannot afford to provide legal aid services out of their own resources.  I welcome the increases in the allowances which the Minister announced here today for qualification.  I note also the increase in the contributions required from those who seek to use the service. Second, the Bill adopts a minimalist approach to the availability of legal aid services; third, it excludes class actions <Col N="776" /> and test cases; fourth, it makes no provision for representation before tribunals; fifth, it does not provide for community involvement in the running of law centres; sixth, it makes no arrangement for involving services other than the services within the law centres, for example, by linking on a one-stop-shop basis mediation and legal aid services throughout the country; and, seventh, it makes no provision for the board to undertake education or research.  These are issues that need to be addressed before this legislation is enacted.</P>
    <P>We have had 15 years experience of the operation of the legal aid service. The current legal aid scheme was introduced in 1979, as an immediate response to the decision of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Mrs. Joanna Airey.  When it was introduced in 1979 it was intended that it would be a long term or fully comprehensive response to the legal aid needs here.  In the light of the experience of the operation of the scheme since 1979, and bearing in mind the impact of marital breakdown and divorce, if introduced, has the Minister conducted any research into the effectiveness of the present legal aid scheme in meeting current and expected future needs?  In the absence of such research, questions arise as to what is to be achieved by simply putting the present scheme on a statutory footing.  A fear has been expressed by FLAC and various other groups, including the community law centre in Coolock, interested in the provision of the legal aid service, that the legislation will simply enact the provisions of the existing scheme, including its deficiencies, without sufficient debate, discussion and examination of the role and functions of a publicly funded legal aid service.  I share their concerns.</P>
    <P>There are two very different views as to the proper role and function of a civil legal aid scheme.  On one view, civil legal aid primarily assists individuals to litigate their claims.  It is this perspective which apparently governs the Bill.  The <Col N="777" /> other view sees civil legal aid as being primarily concerned with assisting disadvantaged individuals and communities and engaging in activities other than simple litigation, such as the provision of information on aspects of the law and the legal system so as to equip individuals and groups to resolve disputes without recourse to litigation; in other words, to assist in developing community-based dispute resolution skills.</P>
    <P>Although the civil legal aid scheme covers most types of civil proceedings, in reality, to date it has been confined to dealing with family law matters.  This arises from the demand placed on the board by the public for legal aid services to resolve family problems, including proceedings for barring, maintenance, custody, access, judicial separation and nullity.  A small number of cases are dealt with in areas other than family law.  These include contract, negligence actions and landlord-tenant matters. The scheme provides that the public will not be provided with legal services where those services are readily available outside the scheme.  For example, a person who has a cause of action which has a reasonable chance of success is likely to obtain services from a practising solicitor outside the scheme on a &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; basis.  I support this approach which is adopted in the Bill.  It makes good use of the board's resources, people are not deprived of a service and the State does not have to pick up the cost of providing services in those cases.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of the independence of the board.  The Minister has said that the purpose of the legislation is to establish the board on a permanent basis and to copperfasten the position of the board.  However, the Bill creates various problems in relation to the independence of the board.  Section 3 (3) states that the board shall be &ldquo;independent in the exercise of its functions&rdquo;. Under the provisions of section 11, staff members, including solicitors, will become civil servants in the Civil Service of the State.  At present some of the existing non-legal staff of the board <Col N="778" /> are civil servants.  Under the provisions of the Bill all staff will become civil servants. All solicitors and law clerks of the board are employed under direct contract between themselves and the board and do not fall into the category of civil servants.  Why does the Minister wish to change the status of the solicitors and bring them within the Civil Service?  In a recent article in the <i>Irish Law Times</i> of May 1995, Siobhán Fianna in an article on human rights had this to say in relation to the position of staff members as civil servants:</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill also give rise to some concern in that it is difficult to accept that the staff members will remain independent and neutral in the exercise of their duties, given that under the Bill their status within the Board depends upon the consent of the Minister and that they are also to be designated &ldquo;Civil Servants in the Civil Service of the State&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is not that far fetched to suggest that a position of a legal aid solicitor as servant of the State will undermine his/her judgment in decisions relating to actions against his/her master, i.e. the State.</P>
    <P>Why should individual members of the public who want to take legal actions against other members of the public, or against the State itself, have to go to civil servants to take those actions on their behalf?  If, for example, a member of the public wishes to take an action against the Department of Equality and Law Reform or some other Department, how can that person rely on the independence of the board in taking an action?  The person taking the action is a civil servant and a direct employee of the State against whom the action is being taken.  Can the public have faith and confidence in the independence of the legal advice and legal aid services provided by that solicitor?</P>
    <P>In case the Minister may consider that this is a concern in this jurisdiction only, this matter has been the subject of discussion in Australia.  In the report of the</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="779" /> National Legal Aid Advisory Committee in 1993-94, the question of the independence of the Legal Aid Commission in Australia was discussed.  In Australia, legal aid is provided through legal aid commissions.  The independence of those commissions was emphasised in their establishment.  The advisory committee stated it had discussed the independence of legal aid commissions at length and concluded the notion of their independence was initially directed towards ensuring their freedom to act against Government, whether as the initiating party or as the defence, uninhibited by Government interference. The advisory committee suggests there are two underlying principles to the independence from Government control of the commission: first, employees should not be servants of the Crown; and second, they should not be subject to Ministerial direction and control.</P>
    <P>The employment of its own staff by a legal body established separately from Government has been accepted by jurisdictions internationally as an appropriate safeguard to ensure the independence of the service.  Lawyers providing legal aid services should not only be independent in practice from Government control but should also be seen to be independent from it.</P>
    <P>There is no suggestion that the independence of legal authorities was ever intended to be absolute.  Rather, their independence is directed towards ensuring they are uninhibited by Government interference and, more particularly, by the fear of such interference.  Subject to the requirement of independence of this form, legal aid authorities carry out their duties and functions in accordance with their governing legislation.  The Minister might look again at the question of the perception of the independence of the board and its staff and consider it further for Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (3) provides that the board shall, subject to the provision of the Act, be independent in the exercise of its functions.  However, section 9, which <Col N="780" /> deals with the reports of the board, provides that it shall, at the request of the Minister, supply him or her with such information on the performance of its functions as the Minister may specify. There is no provision, in accordance with normal arrangements in State or semi-State bodies, for the exclusion of day-to-day activities from the scope of the report sought by the Minister.</P>
    <P>This would appear to be a case in which the Minister is taking the board more closely under the control of his Department.  It differs from the normal position adopted by Government in established semi-State bodies.  This is a dangerous, almost a sinister, provision and one which the Minister should avoid.  From the examples I have given of the approaches taken elsewhere, there is every reason to examine the provision again.</P>
    <P>Another factor is that solicitors will not have practising certificates once they become civil servants in the service of the State.  To that extent, they will differ from solicitors in private practice when representing clients.  Solicitors employed by the State are not required to have practising certificates because they are in effect acting for their employer, which is the State.  That confirms that they are civil servants in the service of the State.  However, law centre solicitors are acting for private individuals in the same way as solicitors in private practice would operate.  The board's solicitors would be at a disadvantage in that they would not have a practising certificate.</P>
    <P>Membership of the board is dealt with in section 4 and the Minister has gone a long way towards achieving equality between the sexes in his appointment of members to the current board. However, one provision which needs to be considered is that concerning the removal of a member of the board from office; section 4 (4) (e) provides that the Minister may do so at any time without showing any good cause.  This will seriously compromise the independence of the board as its members will have no security of tenure and will always be <Col N="781" /> dependent on the goodwill of the Minister for continuance in office.  Having regard to the developments since the Bill was published on the removal of members of other State boards, the Minister should consider introducing an amendment to provide for removal for stated reasons only.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties with the Bill is the absence of a role in the provision of an information and education service to the public and voluntary organisations. As the Bill is drafted it appears the board can do nothing except provide legal advice and legal aid, and advertise and disseminate information about its services.  The Minister made a change on Report Stage in the Seanad to allow for dissemination and advertisement of its services and that is welcome.</P>
    <P>The question of the assignment of other functions to the board will be a matter for the Minister.  It seems the role of the board will be even more limited than at present.  The staff of the board provide information, give talks to various statutory groups and give advice to the public about seeking legal aid and advice.  Surely this is a positive role for the board and one the Minister would encourage?  However, it appears from the Bill as drafted that this will no longer be possible and the Minister should further consider this matter.</P>
    <P>When State bodies have been established the primary function in their establishment seems to be the assignment to them of the task to be carried out and giving them power and resources necessary to do so.  This Bill has an unusual provision whereby the Minister may issue such general directions as to policy in relation to legal aid and advice as he or she considers necessary. The Bill should set out the policy behind publicly-funded legal aid services, the present policy approach towards the legal aid service and the use which will be made of the policy directives at a later stage.  These policy directives may be given by the Minister without being laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, as required in relation to regulations made under section 37 of <Col N="782" /> the Bill.  The purpose of this section should be clarified.</P>
    <P>The criteria for obtaining legal aid are set out in section 28, which is extremely long and complicated.  Will the Minister consider putting a general policy statement on the criteria for obtaining legal aid at this point and provide the details in regulations, which are more amenable to change in the event of the board recommending the criteria should be changed?</P>
    <P>One issue which arises is the extent to which the board provides a conveyancing service.  Since the enactment of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, the need for conveyancing to finalise family law matters has increased considerably.  How is the board dealing with this matter?  Is there scope for specialisation, given the high risk of negligence action in this area of legal work?</P>
    <P>The question of tribunals was debated at some length in the Seanad.  There is a clear need for legal assistance in a proportion of the cases going before some tribunals, particularly the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  The Minister said he was prepared to look at this position and perhaps to review it.  On Committee Stage we should discuss the matter further; I agree with much of what he said but we should cover exceptional situations and I appreciate that requires considerable thought.  Nevertheless, the Minister should be able to devise some formula whereby those in need of greatest representation before such tribunals could have representation under the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Bill offered the Minister an opportunity to provide for a new and more comprehensive legal aid service based on the experience of the Legal Aid Board over the last 15 years.  The need for family law support was never greater.  The expansion of the service to provide a national network of legal aid centres is particularly welcome.  I congratulate both the Minister and the board for the way in which they have so quickly met this need, because there is <Col N="783" /> no doubt that a national network is required.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister's failure at this very critical time to deal imaginatively in an integrated way with the need for mediation, research, advice, education, information, community involvement, test cases and representation before tribunals means the loss of an historic opportunity.  We on this side of the House will be very happy to further discuss these matters with the Minister on Committee Stage and to be as helpful as we can in further developing this important legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister's tightening of ministerial control over the board and its staff damages the democratic basis on which the board operates and will, inevitably, lead to the erosion of public confidence in the service.  I call on the Minister to look again at that aspect of the independence of the board.  I understand the Minister has been tackling very serious practical problems and has been making a great deal of headway in that regard. I congratulate him on that and applaud the work he is doing in that respect. There is a need for a national network of mediation services, as well as legal aid services.  That will have to be addressed urgently, particularly in the context of the forthcoming referendum on divorce.</P>
    <P>Apart from the practical issues the Minister must face, this is an historic opportunity to look more comprehensively at the future direction of the Civil Legal Board and to ensure it is given a clear mission.  The Minister must have the necessary degree of control which can be exercised through regulations laid on the table of the House where everything is open and transparent.  To incorporate the board within the Civil Service is to do the opposite.  It would reduce the transparency of the board's operations and would be damaging in the long run.  In the short term the Minister has a great deal of work to do. However, we should look further at the mission statement for this board, in conjunction with other bodies examining <Col N="784" /> their mission statements.  It should then be let get on with its important task.</P>
    <P>The Bill will have our support in the House and I look forward to discussions on Committee Stage with the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish I was elsewhere on this very sad day when we must acknowledge that many of our colleagues have gone to the funeral of our dear friend and colleague, the late Senator Gordon Wilson.  I would be there if we were not taking this legislation in the House today.  There is an understandably melancholic air around the House.</P>
      <P>I wholeheartedly welcome the Bill which puts the scheme of civil legal aid and advice on a statutory footing.  It was long promised and has now come to fruition. We recognise that this legislation has been introduced in the context of the impending divorce referendum which we all hope will be brought to a successful conclusion.  While I welcome the Bill, I regret it is limited in scope. As Dr. Woods said, an opportunity has been missed.  The original purpose of the civil legal aid scheme in 1979 was to enable any person whose means were within certain limits to obtain legal services, subject to certain basic criteria of reasonableness.  As the Second Commission on the Status of Women pointed out, the legal aid board said in its 1987, 1988 and 1989 reports that the reality is that many people badly in need of legal services, mainly in relation to family law matters, are being denied access to justice because of the board's inadequate resources.  It also stated that the spread of law centres is totally inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission also pointed out that 75 per cent of the clients of law centres are women, which is hardly surprising given that so many women are engaged in home duties without rights either to the earned or social assistance incomes of their households.  The long waiting lists and lack of real access to legal aid impact most severely on women.  Most women who avail of the scheme do so in the area of family law.  Some 95 per <Col N="785" /> cent of court cases involving civil legal aid have been to do with family law &mdash; barring orders, judicial separations, access orders, maintenance orders and so on.  In this context, we must commend the Minister for the undoubted improvements in the civil legal aid system.</P>
    <P>Obviously, we are never satisfied and I have been critical of the Minister in the past.  However, that is because of my impatience to assist people who do not have access to aid and were delayed for many months and years in the past.  We acknowledge that situation has been substantially improved because of the resources the Minister has made available to the law centres through the Civil Legal Aid Board.</P>
    <P>With regard to the membership of the board, I particularly welcome the provisions for gender balance and that not fewer than five members of the board should be men or women.  I believe in making things happen and I support the notion that boards must be directed as to the quota of men or women who serve on boards.  However, there is a missed opportunity in the Bill and there are elements of it with which I am not satisfied.  I know there was long and sometimes tortuous argument in the other House on particular amendments. The Minister accepted some of the arguments made and I hope that, on foot of the arguments made on this side of the House, he will accept certain amendments.</P>
    <P>It seems that the Minister has retained a great deal of control over the Civil Legal Aid Board.  While I recognise that the Minister has responsibility for it, such a body should have greater autonomy which would allow it greater flexibility, for example, in examining cases.  This would resolve some of the difficulties the Minister appears to have about representation, for example, at the Employment Appeals Tribunal, before social welfare appeals officers and in what he might describe as test cases and the development of the role of the board to note the differing views expressed on legal aid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="786" /> The Minister is aware of the views of Mr. Gerry White, which are shared by FLAC, the Coolock Community Law Centre and the Pringle committee established in 1977, that a comprehensive scheme of civil legal aid should cover all civil proceedings, that there seems to be no logical basis on which any particular case category could be excluded and that the merits of any case and the question of granting legal aid should be assessed not by reference to category but to the particular circumstances of the case.</P>
    <P>Mr. White also maintains that the purpose in granting civil legal aid is to assist individuals &mdash; the theme of this Bill &mdash; and to assist disadvantaged individuals and communities and engage in activities other than litigation.  FLAC and the Coolock Community Law Centre from whom we have received representations favour the recommendation of the Pringle committee that, in addition to providing legal advice and representation, the Legal Aid Board should also engage in any appropriate activities in the community which would be likely to enhance the status of a centre and consistent with the provisions of a comprehensive legal aid and advice service for the community.  They argue that the Bill reflects the provisions of the existing civil legal aid scheme and that the scheme was not evaluated, in terms of its efficiency and effectiveness, before the Bill was drafted.</P>
    <P>The scheme was originally introduced in reaction to the decision in the Airey case in the European Court of Human Rights and was not seen as a long term solution.  We have reached the point where it is not predominantly a family law representation service.  Following the introduction of divorce there will be an increased demand for this service.  If we are to follow the logic of the Pringle committee we should try to meet the needs of those most in need.</P>
    <P>The question of flexibility needs to be re-examined to allow the board to act in test cases and group actions.  We need to move away from the traditional model &mdash; the individual and the lawyer <Col N="787" />&mdash; and concentrate on providing a service to those who are most vulnerable. The board should positively seek our test cases as well as group and class actions.  The Bill removes the blanket exclusion in relation to test cases.</P>
    <P>Provision must be made to allow civil legal aid to be granted in specific cases. I wish to cite a particular example.  This is not the usual case in which one would expect an application to be made.  It involves a dispute over an adopted child.  It is a heartbreaking and difficult case for the couple concerned who are living in Cork.  After completing the usual lengthy and exhaustive procedures they successfully managed to adopt the child concerned.  The natural mother subsequently contested the decision to grant adoption.  Happily for the adoptive couple concerned, the High Court found in their favour but the case has been appealed on technical grounds to the Supreme Court.  Regardless of the merits of the case &mdash; I am not taking one side or the other &mdash; unlike the adoptive parents, the natural mother has been granted legal aid but the adoptive parents have had to mortgage their house.  As they are considered to be notice parties, they do not qualify for legal aid.</P>
    <P>This problem was adverted to in the Grey case when it was stated there should be an equality of arms in litigation of this nature.  If the board had autonomy, this is the type of case it would examine and perhaps take on.  It is ironic that the couple who unexpectedly found themselves involved in litigation do not qualify for legal aid.  Unfortunately, they have been impoverished as a consequence.</P>
    <P>I agree with the points that equal access to justice requires that all members of society be made aware of their legal rights and obligations.  It is important that the Legal Aid Board reaches out to those who need information and need to be included.  It is wrong for the Minister to curtail the role of the board on the question of education and information.  While he <Col N="788" /> has made a gesture in this regard the board can play a greater role.  The sad fact is that many people are unaware of its existence.</P>
    <P>On the question of law reform, the point has been well made that the Legal Aid Board could play a more pro-active and advisory role in processing legislation. As legislators, we would gain from its knowledge and experience. From time to time we tend to deal with matters in splendid isolation.  It is vital to glean knowledge from those who process cases on a day to day basis.  We would have a greater understanding of the difficulties which confront people in litigation if the board were allowed to play a more pro-active role.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that there will be a gender balance on the Legal Aid Board. However, the question of community involvement should have been addressed.  Those who have availed of the services of law centres and who work in organisations which are aware of the difficulties should be represented on the board as they may be able to highlight other ways by which disputes can be resolved instead of going through the courts.  Unfortunately, this will not happen unless the Minister appoints such people.</P>
    <P>The Minister could use the Environmental Protection Agency as a model. Various organisations were invited to nominate members for appointment to the board, an open and refreshing approach and it would send a good signal to those involved in the service if such an approach was adopted.  There is no reference in the Bill to consultative committees.</P>
    <P>During Committee Stage in the Seanad and again today the Minister said that the Employment Appeals Tribunal heard 5,710 cases in 1993 and that it is estimated that 99 per cent of those involved would qualify for legal aid. This view is not shared by FLAC and the Coolock Community Law Centre. They argue that not everyone who takes a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal requires legal aid.  The example they quote is that 3,480 of the 5,710 <Col N="789" /> cases in 1993 came under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act and related to whether the claimant was entitled to notice of dismissal.  They deduce that most of the claims would not involve complex legal argument because they relate to straightforward issues of entitlement and that a merits test applied by the local law centre would eliminate many of those cases.</P>
    <P>These are the people working on the ground and their argument is that the principal need for legal aid at the Employment Appeals Tribunal is in the area of unfair dismissal claims, particularly those involving the transfer of undertakings, regulations or insolvency and maternity matters.  In 1993 only 936 cases considered were unfair dismissals, 439 of which were represented by a barrister and-or solicitor.  They say that nearly half the claimants are in a position to afford private legal services and, therefore, would not qualify on means test for legal aid.  They argue that qualified lawyers are not necessarily needed at tribunals.</P>
    <P>On foot of the long argument in the other House the Minister stated that in so far as legal aid may be involved in Employment Appeals Tribunal cases he is reviewing the position in consultation with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment and that if a structured approach can be developed it may be possible to extend legal aid to certain such cases, depending on how the current development programme of the Legal Aid Board works out, and obviously on the Exchequer position. That is reasonable, but more could be done.  At least it is a response to the argument made.  This is a matter I would like to tease out further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that in 1993 social welfare appeals officers decided 14,115 appeals, but a large proportion of those would not have had an oral hearing and would have been decided on the facts. FLAC and the Coolock centre argue <Col N="790" /> that representation before the Employment Appeals Tribunal and social welfare appeals officers should be considered as part of an overall legal services package and not in isolation. For example, if the educational role proposed for the board were in place, law centres could train welfare rights workers and local resource and citizen information centres to provide assistance and representation in many cases.</P>
    <P>The board should have the confidence and ability to assess each individual application on its merits and decide whether legal aid is warranted.  FLAC and the Coolock centre argue that where the case is decided on fact rather than law, referral to the local welfare rights worker would be appropriate.  A full legal service approach would encourage local resource and citizen information centres to develop first year services in conjunction with a nearby law centre.  That would alleviate much of the prospective workload of the law centre.</P>
    <P>We are all familiar with the issue of equality payments to women and the difficulties that created.  Cases relating to dismissal from work and social security payments are excluded from the remit of the Legal Aid Board.  Many of these people are excluded from taking action and that is unfair.</P>
    <P>Other issues, such as means tests, must be addressed.  I welcome the Minister's announcement to increase the various allowances, which may be deducted from an applicant's gross income to determine disposable income, by an average of 13 per cent, the income threshold beyond which means related contributions are payable by 15 per cent and the income eligibility limit by 18.5 per cent.  These increases will mean that more persons will be eligible for legal aid than heretofore.  Bearing in mind that the most recent increase was in 1991, there is a very strong case to be made to re-examine the means test on an annual basis, as it done in other areas.  During the course of the scheme the means test has been reviewed only three times, which is extraordinary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="791" /> One of the difficulties with the Bill is that too much power is vested in the Minister.  Since the Civil Legal Aid Board is being put on a statutory basis, it should be seen to be an independent body.  I agree with many of the arguments made.  The board should be seen to have a degree of autonomy.  The Minister cannot deny that the buck stops with him, but greater flexibility should be given to the board to ensure a more imaginative approach is adopted in terms of developing its role.</P>
    <P>With no disrespect to my Civil Service friends &mdash; some of my best friends are civil servants &mdash; I am concerned that under the Bill solicitors and employees of the board may be civil servants.  Will this result in a position such as that in the EEA?  Will these people be appointed specifically to the Civil Legal Aid Board?  That matter must be clarified. At present &mdash; I do not know if the Minister intends to change this position &mdash; a person from the Department of Finance may be transferred to the EEA. These may be excellent people but they may not have particular expertise in this area, and that presents a problem.  Perhaps civil servants will be appointed who will feel isolated within the wider public service.  Those issues need to be addressed.</P>
    <P>There are missed opportunities in the Bill.  I would have preferred a more dynamic Bill, providing greater autonomy for the board and allowing it to plan legal aid services, a board that is more independent of the Minister.  I congratulate the Minister on taking the first step, he deserves credit for that. However, I would like to see less control over the board.  I am not saying it should be allowed do what it wants, but the parameters within which it operates should allow for greater flexibility.  All boards should be able to take initiatives. The Minister may direct policy from time to time but the board should have greater autonomy.  I hope the Minister will allay my fears in this regard.</P>
    <P>The relationship of the board with <Col N="792" /> voluntary bodies should be copperfastened in the sense that people who have a day to day role in these services should be on the board.  Perhaps the Minister will give a reassurance in that regard.  It is put before us today in a turgid way although the provisions are tight.  I do not have great hopes that the Minister will be expansive regarding this Bill but I will support it on Second Stage.  I will table a number of amendments on Committee Stage and I look forward to that debate.  I commend the Minister for introducing the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Constitution guarantees a wide range of personal rights including that to due process of law.  Legal aid ensures that a citizen's right can be vindicated in court regardless of means.  I and, I am sure, the majority of people who sought legal aid when in a crisis, were not aware that the Legal Aid Board was not established on a statutory footing.  Things have greatly improved for people who have had to seek that service, but further improvements are needed.</P>
      <P>The Domestic Violence Bill which will be introduced shortly will place increased strain on legal aid centres.  As more people realise they are entitled to representation in court regardless of means, they will be more inclined to approach legal aid centres.  People usually approach those centres when in crisis on a matter of family law.  The legal aid centre in the North Mall in Cork has a five month waiting list and given the figures produced by the Minister it would have been much longer if there had not been a huge increase in finance and allocation of solicitors and other staff to the legal aid system during the past two to three years.  Between 1992 and 1994 the funding allocated more than doubled and it has been increased by 25 per cent during 1994 and 1995.  One can only imagine the consequences if such funding and staff allocations were not given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The forthcoming referendum on divorce has impinged on us and on practically all legislation introduced during <Col N="793" /> the past few months.  Divorce will not put as great a strain on the legal aid system as people imagine.  If divorce is introduced the people who will seek legal aid in the main will be those who have already had contact with the legal aid system.  More than likely their details will be on file as they may have sought advice on barring orders, protection orders or maintenance orders.  The bulk of legal aid work involves the drudgery of gathering information and bringing cases to court is the last stage of the process.</P>
    <P>The decision to put the legal aid system on a statutory footing is long overdue. The right to legal aid is one of the fundamental pillars of a modern justice system.  As we approach the end of the 20th century, it is unacceptable that a citizen would be denied justice because of inability to pay.  I welcome the provision for citizens to be assessed in their own right.  Up until now many women were assessed on the basis of the income of their husband who may have been well off financially.  It was difficult for women to take for instance a maintenance action against their husbands if they were assessed on his income and told they were ineligible for legal aid.  I know that provision will ease the mind's of many women.</P>
    <P>The most recent figures available on the legal aid system indicate a waiting list of five months in Cork and nine months in Dundalk.  Why?  I am aware from contact with the legal aid system in Cork that it provides an extremely efficient and compassionate service.  We need to examine why there is such a variation in the length of waiting lists, particularly when we deal with the Domestic Violence Bill.  The people seeking legal aid will not only include the wives of violent husbands but mothers or fathers who may take actions against a violent child or adult living with them.  Cohabiting couples will now have similar rights.  This provision will impose an additional strain on the legal aid system.  If people could afford legal costs they would have <Col N="794" /> sorted out their domestic problems a long time ago.</P>
    <P>As our laws catch up with the changes in society, the burden on the legal aid system is likely to increase.  Measures such as the forthcoming Domestic Violence Bill will introduce new causes of action and these cases will be taken. There is not a politician or person operating in the public arena who has not been approached by an elderly person who has a violent adult, son or daughter at home who has refused to leave.  The same position applies where one partner in a cohabiting couple may have persecuted the other but refused to leave.</P>
    <P>The introduction of divorce will place an added burden on the legal aid service similar to the burden on the social welfare system to accommodate divorce. Divorce, if introduced, will not give rise to a new group of people who will wish to avail of legal aid because their marriages have broken down, as such people will already have been in contact with the legal aid service.</P>
    <P>Delays are not the only problem facing legal aid applicants.  The service is not free.  Contributions are often assessed on what seems to applicants to be an arbitrary basis.  The Bill addresses that issue.  Although the contribution required is small in some cases it may be beyond the means of applicants. Legal aid figures reveal that the bulk of applicants are women in crisis.  We are all aware of the pattern that drives women to seek legal aid services.  They may experience minor problems initially and later various punishments, one being the withdrawal of house-keeping money.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to expand the network of law centres.  Despite the major allocation of additional finances and staff there are major gaps in the system. He should allocate emergency funding to recruit additional solicitors to relieve the backlog in areas such as Cork, Letterkenny and Dundalk.  I do not know why such backlogs exist and the problem may be short term, but a trend of <Col N="795" /> long waiting lists is emerging.  In the long term we need to review the remit of the legal aid system and extend its provision to cases brought before various tribunals.  I agree with much of what Deputy Keogh said about tribunals. In particular, we must ensure that people who bring cases before new tribunals established under forthcoming legislation are eligible for legal aid.  I will be pleased to welcome the introduction of a refugee Bill in the near future and I hope it includes provisions for applicants to avail of free legal aid. While refugees will require interpreters and full support services, the legal aid system will be vital for them.  I hope they will be covered under this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is long overdue.  While it is far from perfect, any measure designed to give people who need it most greater access to the courts must be warmly welcomed.</P>
      <P>By the very nature of their position, the people seeking to avail of the services of the board's legal representatives have more than enough to deal with in the litigation in which they are engaged &mdash; often not of their choice or making &mdash; and do not need the further hassle and stress of a legal battle within a legal battle.  As legislators, we must do what we can to minimise that stress and the old maxim of justice delayed is justice denied takes on significant relevance in the context of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased this measure will at last put the free legal aid service on a full statutory basis for the first time since its inception in 1979.  We must go a step further and ensure the service caters fully for the needs of those who need it most.  There are few greater rights and no greater necessity than access to the courts of law in any country and it is the duty of legislators to ensure this is not restricted in any way through elitism or lack of financial resources.  The majority of people have never been to court, will never be in court and do not even know <Col N="796" /> what the inside of a courthouse looks like.  Their mental picture of the courts may be provided exclusively by the television coverage of, for example, the O.J. Simpson trial.  However, such people would like to be assured that the courts of law would be available to them if necessary and that they would not be denied justice for want of money.  While we may not be able to finance every trivial visit to court &mdash; it would be wrong to encourage trivial litigation &mdash; we must not only allow, but actively enable, all citizens to vindicate their rights according to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In many cases it is a lack of money that stops people taking a case to court. We must not make our halls of justice the exclusive preserve of the rich.  It is my wish that the court would be a place where people would willingly resolve disputes and refer to the court willingly and confidently.  This would take the self-imposed stigma away from court appearances and show that it is normal to consult with and abide by the decisions of our judges.  For that reason I welcome the Bill.  If it enables only one additional person to secure a right, to right a wrong or to fight an injustice, then it will have been worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I am not without my reservations on this Bill and my greatest one relates to finance.  We have passed a great deal of worthwhile legislation in this House, but much of it has proved to be ornamental in nature and deprived of teeth because of a lack of finance.  Unless the finance that is necessary to implement the proposed changes is made available, this amounts to a similar exercise today.</P>
    <P>Significantly, the majority of legal aid cases are taken by women and most of them relate to family law matters.  It is reasonable to deduce that where family law matters are concerned money is in short supply.  The family problems we know exist will remain unresolved without civil legal aid.  At least until relatively recently, the record of the treatment of women in our society has been dismal.  We should not exacerbate that now by penny pinching when free legal aid may be the last line of their defence <Col N="797" /> and that of their children.  The board's lack of resources was highlighted during the passage of the Bill through the Seanad and I want to re-emphasise the necessity for proper financing for its work.</P>
    <P>If, as stated in the explanatory memorandum, there are to be no staffing implications, then additional staff will not be employed.  If not, additional cases will not be taken.  Whereas there were 1,418 cases of domestic violence dealt with under the scheme last year, there are recorded delays of one year or more in getting such cases to court.  This is totally unacceptable and, irrespective of an embargo, the Minister must find additional money and staff to properly discharge the functions of the board.</P>
    <P>The scope of the service must be widened and while it would be unrealistic to apply it to social welfare appeals, it must be made available to those who qualify for representation at unfair dismissal hearings.  High on the list of most people's priorities is a job and if people are threatened with loosing their jobs or told that they are being dismissed, they are entitled to contest such a decision. It would be highly unrealistic and naive in the extreme to expect such people to enter their own defence as they would face very experienced legal counsel at the hearing.  Even one's union official would be a poor enough defence in such circumstances.  Surely the services of the board should level the playing pitch to some extent.</P>
    <P>Decisions taken at such hearings can have a lifelong effect not only on the financial standing of individuals for the remainder of their lives and their ability to find alternative employment, but also on their self-esteem, status in the community and, ultimately, their health.  We cannot play around with those important aspects of people's lives and, therefore, I ask the Minister to seriously consider extending the services of the board to this important area.  A person's future can be seriously and adversely affected by a botched case, badly researched and amateurishly presented by an employee already cowed by an <Col N="798" /> overbearing employer.  That person may need professional help and that does not come cheap.  It may be out of reach for a person just out of a job and fighting to get it back.</P>
    <P>Section 28 deals with cases of debt collection.  I note that while the chaser may have access to free legal aid, the person being pursued does not.  It may be the unspeakable chasing the uneatable, but mongrel foxes did not benefit much in Fine Gael led Governments.  In some cases the person defaulting on the debt can be morally more correct than the person pursuing the debt.  I would not wish for anyone to have access to the scheme to pursue a spurious, yet legal, debt while the debtor was unable to defend herself or himself in court because of a lack of money.  People need to be able to defend themselves against those who would exploit a lack of resources.  Bills incurred or commitments entered into innocently or unknowingly or when times were better should not be a millstone around people's necks forever.  Decrees should not be given uncontested and a genuine hardship verdict may be imposed in such cases.</P>
    <P>It may be difficult for a Minister to understand that when money is scarce a type of fatalism, bordering on despair, sets in and such victims would not make the best defence lawyers in court.  Such people may get proper representation only through the scheme, but the Minister appears to be denying that to them. While on the subject of money, even the £19, which is the minimum fee payable to take a case to court, represents a great deal of money for some of my constituents. If the service is to be free, let us have it free.  There are too many so-called free services which are not free, such as &ldquo;free&rdquo; education, which was never free, and free medical treatment. If the service is to benefit those who need it most it should not be dangled tantalisingly in front of them just out of reach, it should be put firmly within their grasp.</P>
    <P>The main requirements for qualification for the scheme could best be <Col N="799" /> summed up in the various levels of destitution here.  For example, I note the Minister spoke in the Seanad about including &ldquo;disposal capital&rdquo; in the means test.  In this context disposable capital includes, in the Minister's own words, a person's house.  It would be ludicrous in the extreme, and remote from reality, to suggest that the value of a person's house reflects their ability to pay for a service.  Following on the kinds of redundancies we have witnessed in recent years, many people on low incomes occupy expensive houses, or at least houses in expensive areas.  These are sometimes paid for through crippling mortgages or, if their owners were sufficiently lucky, they may have had them paid for before having to take such a drastic drop in income.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister seriously suggesting that a person should sell a house to pay for legal representation?  We must be realistic about this.  Following on the debates on residential rates, estate duty, wealth tax, residential property tax and so on we must have realised that to own and occupy a desirable residence in some fashionable suburb does not mean unsurpassed wealth.  It can often mean the exact opposite as the Minister will be aware if he attends his clinics.  While the Minister may take legitimate pride in having doubled the financial resources of the Legal Aid Board, at less than £5 million those resources remain very much lower than required. A further doubling of that figure would prove the Minister's commitment to the scheme and his ability to convince his Cabinet colleagues of the justification of his case.</P>
    <P>If divorce is introduced here &mdash; which appears to rank high in the Minister's aspirations &mdash; his Department will face an even greater demand for additional resources.  Will the Minister give the House a commitment that if the constitutional prohibition on divorce is removed he will be willing and able to pay for its consequences?  This is an issue which has not been thoroughly thought through.  The possible explosion <Col N="800" /> of costs on the passage of a divorce referendum will wreak a heavy toll on the Exchequer.  I do not think the Minister has properly addressed its implications but has adopted a Micawber-type attitude in the hope that something will turn up.</P>
    <P>On the matter of finances, I caution the Minister against the use of outside private solicitors as provided for in this Bill.  Overuse of this provision could eat into the resources of the board unnecessarily since private expertise is inevitably more expensive.</P>
    <P>Section 30 (5) warrants close examination and amendment.  In the event of a member of a legal firm giving advice to a client under the scheme and such advice subsequently being found to be defective to the extent that the solicitor is deemed to have been negligent, will that solicitor be liable personally or will it be the liability of the firm?  Put another way, will a solicitor have to seek personal insurance cover?  Will that be a requirement of the firm or of both? That is a grey area and it would be tragic if any client, having lost a case through negligence, had to experience the further trauma of discovering that he or she was not covered by appropriate insurance.  Nothing should be left to chance in so complex an area.  The Minister might address these issues directly when replying.</P>
    <P>It has been the practice for solicitors from the same centre not to take conflicting sides in a case.  One side is required to draw representation from a centre in another area.  In section 30 (6) the Minister appears to be dispensing with this ethical requirement which is less than wise.  Conflict of interest is a popular catch-cry today, with an insistence on transparency and openness in all facets of life.  This is as it should be, but if the Minister allows solicitors from the same centre to act for plaintiff and respondent, a significant step will have been taken towards diluting the heretofore immutable principle of avoiding even a hint of conflict of interest.  This places the legal profession in an invidious position.  I am not at all sure <Col N="801" /> they would want this added responsibility.</P>
    <P>Section 4 empowers the Minister to appoint a chairperson and a 12-member board, including staff representation.  I should prefer that staff would choose their representation, to be confirmed by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat concerned at the provisions of section 24 dealing with general eligibility criteria, which is woolly and unclear.  I would have an inherent distrust of and lack of confidence in the basis of this assessment, in respect of which the Minister had this to say in the Seanad:</P>
    <P>...legal aid or advice may not be granted unless a reasonably prudent person, in similar circumstances, who could afford to pay for the services of lawyers in private practice would do so at their own expense, and a lawyer would be likely to advise them to do so.</P>
    <P>While there must be some screening of applications for aid, the Minister's thinking on the matter and the provisions themselves are too full of &ldquo;ifs&rdquo;&ldquo;ands&rdquo; and &ldquo;maybes&rdquo; to be in any way precise.  While also realising that endeavouring to determine what the wealthy may do in any given circumstance is not an exact science, we must bear in mind that they are less likely to be in need of psychological reassurance of their rights, or the availability of justice, than others who have no ready access to the civil courts by cheque book.</P>
    <P>As I read that provision I imagined Richard Harris as King Arthur in &ldquo;Camelot&rdquo; wondering what the simple folk might do in certain circumstances &mdash; he too was full of conjecture and could not decide.  The simple folk are much more predictable and consistent than their better-heeled counterparts who have the financial independence to be erratic and remain out of court, a factor which must also be taken into the equation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="802" /> Section 31 (4) provides that, once selected and appointed, legal representation cannot be changed without the consent of the board.  This appears to be too restrictive and could lead to a type of conflict of interest.  For example, a solicitor could recommend that a person should not be granted legal aid, which recommendation might be subsequently overturned by the board.  If the refusing solicitor was then appointed to the case, would he or she not have a difficult task convincing their client that they would fight to the legal death for the case? Worse still, the client would have little right to object to that solicitor handling the case or to request another.  Conversely, a solicitor will have no difficulty in offloading a case, for whatever reason, to another solicitor without ever consulting the client.  This appears to be weighted very much in favour of the legal profession.  I am not sure that is good either from the point of view of public perception or the good of the client for whom the system was devised.</P>
    <P>While welcoming this Bill, it is in need of radical amendment to render its operation effective.</P>

      <P>Our thoughts today are with the family of the late Senator Gordon Wilson.  Senator Wilson had accepted an invitation to speak in my constituency this evening which was typical of his generosity and the manner in which he constantly expended his energies in the interests of the peace process.  I should like to avail of this opportunity to offer my sympathy to his family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing this long overdue Bill, from whose provisions many individuals will benefit.  I am strongly of the opinion that one's last resort should be to the courts.  While this Bill is an endeavour to provide for the first time, a comprehensive package of civil legal aid, it is equally important that we provide a comprehensive counselling and mediation service for individuals, couples and families.  Many families could avoid resorting to the courts if an <Col N="803" /> adequate counselling and mediation service were easily accessible to them, which point was made by the Minister himself.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that so much legislation is being introduced prior to the holding of a referendum on divorce later this year. While congratulating the Minister on his legislative record, much of it has been long overdue.  Had we really wanted to support individuals and families this Bill should have been enacted before there was any mention of a referendum on divorce.</P>
    <P>While this is a good Bill, the matter of furnishing people generally with greater information on what is available to them by way of legal aid services needs to be tackled urgently.  The AIM Group for Family Law Reform has spent years disseminating information to couples and individuals, in particular women, who need advice.  We must remember that all individuals experiencing family problems or marital conflict perceive their problem as unique and feel very isolated. Gaining access, whether to counselling, mediation or legal aid often can be quite difficult.  There is need to ensure that the type of work undertaken by the National Social Service Board nationwide is well advertised and legal aid centres well equipped to furnish such information.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would comment on the interesting point raised by Deputy Keogh about members of the service being civil servants.  I know from experience that difficulties arose in the Employment Equality Agency in relation to career progression and maintaining expertise in the centre.  I ask the Minister to comment on that and to consider implementing special measures to ensure this does not become a problem under the provisions of the Bill because it is an important issue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the gender balance on the Legal Aid Board.  This is the second time gender balance has been built into legislation &mdash; the first occasion involved legislation covering the RTE Authority. It is important we move in this direction <Col N="804" /> because for far too long we have had nothing but lip service about offering women decision-making positions.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that legal aid continues to be available on a comprehensive basis.  While welcoming the improvements initiated by the Minister in a short period, I urge him to develop the network of services available so that legal aid is widely accessible throughout the country.  The proposed Domestic Violence Bill will result in additional demands being placed on the service. There is no doubt that the present demand on the service is extremely high.  That was evident from the debate in the Seanad on the other services which might be covered by this Bill but which clearly cannot be funded at present.  However, we, as legislators, must examine that question in the future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  In the context of the divorce referendum there must be as much focus on counselling and mediation as there has been on the development of the legal aid service. We must ensure people are aware that the service is available because that is an equally critical aspect of the legislation.</P>

      <P>I would like to thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate in such a constructive manner. Most of the matters raised will be appropriate to Committee Stage during which we can discuss the Bill section by section.  I propose to deal now with some of the key points raised by a number of Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to clarify some points for Deputy Kenneally and assure him that the term &ldquo;disposable capital&rdquo; does not include the family home.  The family home is specifically excluded from that designation.  The Deputy expressed concern also that there should not be overuse of the private practitioners' scheme and I subscribe to that.  It was never intended by me to be a substitute for a part of the key operations of the legal aid service.  Its role will be no more <Col N="805" /> than a supplement to the work of the Legal Aid Board.  Although we now have at least one law centre in every county &mdash; some counties have more than one &mdash; certain areas are quite a distance from the location of the particular law centre.  In the case of people living some distance from a law centre, access to a private practitioner on a more convenient basis would be important.</P>
    <P>On the question of staff representation on the board, I accept the point made by Deputy Kenneally.  I have asked the staff unions to make their own nominations to the board.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies, including Deputies Woods and Keogh, raised the question of the independence of the board and the need for it to be more autonomous and independent.  The board has a large measure of independence and autonomy under the terms of the Bill.  It retains control of the staff and the responsibility for making decisions on legal aid that arise in each individual case.  The Minister does not have any role in that respect.  I would remind Deputies, however, that the Legal Aid Board operates exclusively on funds voted by the Oireachtas.  Somebody must be answerable to the Members of this House and to the Committee of Public Accounts for the expenditure of those moneys.  It is essential, therefore, that those public funds are retained overall under the control of the people who vote them through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  For that reason it is essential that that level of monetary control be exercised by the Minister who is answerable to the House on how those moneys are expended.  That is not to say that the responsibility for granting legal aid in individual cases is a matter exclusively for the Legal Aid Board and its staff.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods was concerned about the implications of the provisions of section 11 for the independence of the board's solicitors.  The Bill does not necessarily require that the board's solicitors be civil servants, but under its terms they could be designated as civil servants at some future time.  That step <Col N="806" /> would only be taken with the consent of the solicitors' unions.  Neither individual solicitors nor the solicitors' unions have any apprehensions regarding the dilution of their independence were that status to be negotiated with them. Regardless of what their status might be, they would continue to be employees of the board and, consequently, they would be answerable to the board for their actions and not to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputies Helen Keogh and Frances Fitzgerald raised the question of whether the board's solicitors could be moved around within the Civil Service. Obviously, if the solicitors were designated as civil servants, they would have opportunities for advancement within the Civil Service.  That would be good for their morale and would be reflected in their enthusiasm for their work.  It would be appropriate that they have those opportunities for advancement.</P>
    <P>Many important issues have been raised and I look forward to discussing them with Deputies on all sides of the House on Committee Stage.  I thank the Deputies for their support of the Bill.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I have examined the implications of the Government decision on further recruitment this year and expenditure for 1996.  The Government has now decided to allow further recruitment in the health service within the parameters of overall public expenditure as set out by the Government decision.  My Department is at present considering the priority to be given to certain areas and the health agencies will be notified of the position in relation to all planned developments.  I do not envisage that there will be any effect on the implementation of the Child Care Act or developments in services for the mentally handicapped and the physically disabled this year.  As I have indicated previously, on my visits to the health boards, the effect of the Government's decision in 1996 and the following years will be that the planned developments will continue to be implemented but at a slower rate than originally anticipated.  The level of additional recruitment to health agencies will reflect this position.</P>

It is a question of taking decisions now which would have a sufficient lead-in time to keep public expenditure within the targets of the Programme for Government which is plus 2 per cent in real terms. That has implications for recruitment and the overall Estimate in 1996.

The new cohort of students to come into the service in certain hospitals, for example, <Col N="809" /> in Galway and Limerick, will be attached to a university.  However, the posts their predecessors vacate can be filled by staff nurses.  There will be no suppression of posts, and no embargo on the filling of existing posts.  In theory, the situation will be improved, because the students will be replaced by fully qualified nurses.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 37 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that 249 plenary summonses have been served on the Blood Transfusion Service Board (BTSB) in relation to hepatitis C.  As the Deputies will be aware, I have published the scheme of the compensation tribunal to pay compensation to Anti D recipients who have contracted hepatitis C and their partners and children who have contracted hepatitis C, in line with the commitment in the policy document, A Government of Renewal, to fair compensation for women infected with the hepatitis C from Anti D.  A copy of the scheme has been sent to all those who tested positive for hepatitis C virus-antibodies under the National Blood Screening Programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Concern has been expressed by &ldquo;Positive Action&rdquo;&mdash; the support group for the Anti D women and their families &mdash; that the special hospital services and other arrangements put in place for <Col N="810" /> those infected with hepatitis C will be reduced or removed at some stage in the future.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Government, I wish to assure the Dáil and those who have contracted hepatitis C, that all the special additional services put in place for persons who have tested positive for hepatitis C will be available for as long as they are required.  I know there is all-party support in the House for the future funding of these services and a shared commitment to ensure the continued on-going availability of the highest quality healthcare services.  The needs of those who have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C will be monitored and re-assessed on a continuous basis to ensure that the necessary health care and support services are provided to meet their needs.</P>
    <P>All the services being provided in the public hospital system at present are being provided on a statutory basis under the Health Acts.  Similarly, the persons availing of these services are exercising their existing statutory rights to free public hospital services under the Health Acts.</P>
    <P>I am continuing to examine the question of extending and enhancing the existing statutory provisions governing the provision of health care services now and in the future.  I met last week with the executive committee of &ldquo;Positive Action&rdquo; and it has agreed to continue discussions with my Department on these issues and has also agreed to submit a document to my Department on these matters in the near future.  I assure the House that I will give serious and detailed consideration to any proposals &ldquo;Positive Action&rdquo; put forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  When the Minister last replied to questions in the House he stated that he wanted to encourage as many people as possible who had been infected with hepatitis C to go to the tribunal.  We, on this side of the House, agreed this would probably be the easiest way to compensate the women, and we were anxious, as was <Col N="811" /> the Minister, that groups like &ldquo;Positive Action&rdquo; would encourage their members to do that.  It is of concern now that such a substantial number of people have decided to go the other route.  The Minister must be aware that &ldquo;Positive Action&rdquo; have said they are not happy with the tribunal, and one of the things they have asked in advance of seriously considering the tribunal and recommending it to their members is that the Minister would give a statutory guarantee of continuing quality health care for all of those infected.  If the Minister is prepared to do that it would certainly break the present logjam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There is nothing recent about this.  The plenary summonses lodged with BTSB, some directed in the first instance to my Department, did not come in subsequent to the announcement of the tribunal but have come in over the year and a half since the question of hepatitis C infection from anti-D product came into the public domain in February 1994.  Nothing has changed in that it would be normal practice that a woman, on consulting her solicitor, would be advised to open proceedings.</P>
      <P>As regards the tribunal and the equally important issue of ongoing health care on a statutory basis, the tribunal is to deal with the compensation women will receive and it cannot deal with the issue of ongoing health care.  I have been asked to guarantee that statutory ongoing health care will be provided. Existing Health Acts already guarantee that.  The debate centres around the issue of quality and I will continue my discussions with Positive Action and others to see how that can be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fear has been expressed that Administrations change as time goes by, new economic circumstances arise and what is available now under statute may not be available in the future.  I am considering how best to deal with that.  It was never my intention that the ongoing health needs of those women who were <Col N="812" /> so unfortunate as to contract Hepatitis C would be dealt with within the terms of the tribunal.  It is an important matter with which I will deal as expeditiously as possible.  I promised the executive committee of Positive Action that we would bring forward proposals in writing for their consideration and they will submit proposals in writing to me also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Health Acts already give that guarantee, but Positive Action and others are genuinely concerned that if there are difficulties in the economy in the future there may be a tendency not to live up to a guarantee given by a previous Administration.  I am not sure if they want the statutory guarantee included in the tribunal, but if it were possible to amend one of the Health Acts to specifically write into law a guarantee for continuing health care for them and their affected dependants it would break the logjam.  The Minister might look at that proposal.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 25 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the report to which the Deputy refers describes research carried out on deaths attributed to <Col N="813" /> suicide between April 1987 and March 1988 in Finland.  It indicated that 59 per cent of male suicide victims between the ages of 20 and 34 years had suffered from depressive syndromes compared to 64 per cent in the 35-39 year age group.</P>
    <P>Investigation and detailed research into the causes of suicide has not been easy at national and international level. In the past there has been an understandable reluctance to even discuss the issue and this made the compilation of accurate data on the frequency and pattern of suicide more difficult.  It is clear, however, that reliable information on the occurrence of suicidal behaviour is essential if help is to be made available to those considered to be at risk of suicide.  While research, such as that described in the Finish study, is of value in increasing our knowledge of the factors which are associated with suicide, we should not too readily transpose data from one cultural context to another.</P>
    <P>The health strategy <i>Shaping A Healthier Future</i> expressed concern about the increase in the rate of suicide especially among young people in Ireland.  Although not all persons who commit suicide suffer from mental illness, the mental health service has a particular responsibility to prevent suicide.  The Department of Health is contributing towards the cost of a pilot project on attempted suicide in Cork, carried out by staff of the Southern Health Board under the direction of Dr. Michael Kelleher, consultant psychiatrist. The aim of this project is to reduce the occurrence of para-suicide, that is attempted suicide, and to develop intervention skills which may be applied in this area.  The study is a collaborative partner in the WHO-EURO multi centre study on para-suicide and the MidWestern Health Board has recently become involved with the study.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health also provided financial support towards the cost of the Fifth European Symposium on Suicide and Self-poisoning, which took place in University College Cork from <Col N="814" /> 31 August to 3 September 1994.  This symposium was attended by researchers from diverse backgrounds from all over Europe.  It enabled medical and nursing personnel, social workers, voluntary groups and others to exchange experience leading towards a better understanding of suicide and suicidal behaviour.</P>
    <P>With a view to gaining more information on the factors associated with suicide in Ireland, I am examining ways of involving experts in the examination of the annual statistics on suicide and to make recommendations which might help to prevent some suicides.</P>
    <P>The World Health Organisation in its <i>Targets for Health for All</i> has recommended action to reverse the rising trend in suicide by the year 2,000.  It highlights the importance of early detection and treatment for depression, alcoholism and schizophrenia.  These are all being addressed in the context of reorganisation of our mental health services as outlined in the health strategy.</P>
    <P>The World Health Organisation also suggests the need for improvements in the underlying societal factors that put a strain on the individual, such as family stress, social isolation and failure at school.  It emphasises the need to develop the individual's ability to cope with life events which is a crucial factor in preventing and managing mental illness. The Health Promotion Unit of my Department and the Department of Education are already involved in the delivery of health education programmes for young people both in and out of school settings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The report to which I referred was on research carried out by Dr. Michael Kelleher, the findings of which were published in the <i>Irish Medical Journal</i> and subsequently in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 20 June.  There was a clear finding that 17.5 per cent of young male deaths were caused by suicide. That is a high percentage.  Given those figures and the fact that it is Irish research based on empirical studies in Cork, does the Minister agree that this <Col N="815" /> is a major public health issue and the time has come for his Department to put together a multi-disciplinary team composed of professionals involved in the treatment of suicide and members of voluntary agencies, such as the Samaritans, to formulate policy which would respond to the need?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank the Deputy for her clarification.  The work carried out will be taken into consideration. The Department of Health is contributing towards the cost of work being carried out by Dr. Kelleher in the Southern Health Board and Mid-Western Health Board areas.  It is unfortunately true that the incidence of suicide has increased in Ireland in recent years. In 1970 there was 52 deaths from suicide and in 1990 there were 334.  These statistics are sometimes explained away by people claiming that the cause of death was often not stated as suicide but close examination of the figures does not reveal a corresponding fall in other causes of unnatural death &mdash; for example, from accidential poisoning, accidental drowning or open verdicts in coroners courts.  There is no doubt but that there has been an increase in the number of suicides.  I agree that there is a high incidence of premature death among young men which is attributable to suicide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a matter of major concern for society as a whole and I pledge that the health services will play their part in that context.  If we were to take the kind of initiative proposed by the Deputy we would need reasonably accurate information on the causes of suicide.  The research being carried out at present as a matter of urgency will contribute to this and it will then be a matter for the psychiatric services.  The World Health Organisation has recommended that depression, alcoholism and schizophrenia should be targeted and this is being done in the context of reforming the health strategy in respect of mental health, as set out in the health strategy document.  I have commenced ordering <Col N="816" /> the work priorities in my Department for the second half of the year and the causes of suicide will be high on the list.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to keep the focus on the 15-30 age group where the number of suicides has trebled since 1986 and doubled in the past four years. Will the Minister target this category of suicide victims and consult not only the psychiatric services but also the psychological services which are very involved and have a role to play in this area? Given that the figure for young women is 5.5 per cent, young men between the ages of 15-30 are in a high risk category. Does the Minister agree that this problem does not lend itself to simple solutions and will he ask his officials to ensure a more targeted response to this category?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I agree in general with the approach outlined by the Deputy but this problem is not as focused as he seems to believe.  In 1990, the last year for which statistics are available, there were 95 deaths among men aged 15-34.  This represented 28 per cent of total deaths from suicide during that year.  Approximately one in four victims is in this category and focusing exclusively on it would not deal with the problem which is wider than that.  In the context of the increasing number of suicides there is a sub-group which needs special attention.  My approach is to look at the full extent of the problem and if special initiatives are required &mdash; other than those already being taken in the areas of depression, schizophrenia and alcoholism &mdash; we will take them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have accurate statistics of the number of suicides but the problem is that we do not have accurate information on the causes.  We cannot solve the problem by borrowing research from abroad and transposing it into our culture.  We must, therefore, undertake significant research ourselves.  I will not delay the taking of initiatives until a research programme puts results on the table.  We can work in parallel with such <Col N="817" /> programmes and respond to data as it comes in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he does not want to wait for research but this is very important in identifying the occupational, environmental and social reasons so many young men take their lives.  We need this information to formulate policy.  If the Minister does not intend to wait for the research has his Department initiated programmes to deal with this category of suicide victims? It has been established that more young men die from suicide than from cancer or road accidents.  The figures are startling and this is why I raised the issue.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have no disagreement with the points made by the Deputy but I am dealing with the matter in a different context.  I think there would be general agreement among Deputies that the most dramatic changes in practice in the health services in the past ten years have been in the area of mental illness.  Everybody is aware of these changes and I do not have to recite them.  There is now a totally different attitude to the treatment of mental illness.  Not all suicides can be attributed to mental illness &mdash; the best figures I have suggest that approximately two-thirds of those who commit suicide were mentally disturbed at the time.  It is important to put the problem into context.  The World Health Organisation has said that the treatment of depression, schizophrenia and alcoholism reduce the incidence of suicide and the psychiatrists and psychiatric services within the health boards are targeting those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of research, it would be helpful if we had a more accurate or precise idea of the causes of suicide in Ireland and applied this to the subgroups, particularly the one identified by the Deputy.  When Ministers say they are setting up a committee or commission to carry out research this is seen by Deputies as an excuse for inactivity. A pilot study is being carried out in <Col N="818" /> Cork and data is being fed into it by the Mid-Western Health Board.  We all have access on an ongoing basis to this data.  I will not say I will do nothing about suicide until this project is put on a national basis as, beginning later this summer, I will try to collate the information with a view to bringing forward proposals in the second half of the year. The proposals will be based on hard data, anecdotal evidence, hunches within the profession or the experience of groups such as the Samaritans.  We know the numbers but we do not know all the causes or how other factors outside the health services affect the situation.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Health Research Board compiles comprehensive details on an annual basis on the persons being treated for drug misuse in the Dublin area.  The latest report, for the years 1992 and 1993, indicated that 2,240 persons in 1992 and 2,573 persons in 1993 received treatment for drug misuse.  It is accepted, however, that the actual incidence of drug misuse is much higher.</P>
      <P>Before any survey along the lines mentioned by the Deputy could be conducted, it would be necessary to define in detail what the parameters of the study should be to ensure that results are valid and reliable.  It is also necessary to ensure that they are compatible with the requirements of international bodies to which Ireland supplies data.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" /> At present the parameters for measurement of drug misuse are being developed by the European Monitoring Centre on Drugs and Drug Addiction and by the Pompidou Group.  My Department is represented on both of these groups and the Health Research Board is also liaising with them.</P>
    <P>The need for a survey has long been recognised but it has been postponed pending the development of agreed parameters by the international groups mentioned.  The indications at present are that these agreed parameters will be available by the end of the year and it is my intention to initiate a study immediately after that.</P>

      <P>I am pleased we are coming to the end of the argument on parameters because we have waited far too long for European and international bodies to set down agreed parameters.  One of the major difficulties in the whole area of drug abuse is that the figures available to the Minister represent only a tiny minority of all the incidents of drug abuse throughout the country.  In order to have a comprehensive treatment and prevention programme we need to know the extent of the abuse.  If the parameters are agreed in the middle of this year, how soon afterwards can the Minister set about providing such a programme?</P>

      <P>I am not referring to that aspect.  The health promotion unit of the Minister's Department does much work in different areas. One of the biggest areas of concern to parents is that of drug abuse and the fear that one of their children will be subject to peer pressure to begin drug abuse.  This is a genuine fear of parents. Teachers have the same fear because they are dealing with young children in their classes who are high on various substances.  In the interim it is important that a comprehensive health promotion programme, involving the Departments of Education and Justice, be put in place by the Department of Health and promoted in schools throughout the country and advertised on the national airwaves.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> All that information will be available, but it is not readily available in my brief.  I can give a breakdown of the different age groups across the range in which drug abuse occurs.  Three-quarters of the 2,573 clients are male, 97 per cent of the clients are between the ages of 15 and 39, eight out of ten are unemployed &mdash; perhaps the unemployment was due to the addiction rather than the cause &mdash; and four out of ten had left school before the official school leaving age of 15 years.  The first reaction is to target health promotion initiatives into the schools.  Frequently, the group which is in most need of the information is not school going at the time.  That was one of the findings from preliminary inquiries made into the whole area of teenage pregnancies.  The information is not necessarily being targeted at the group most at risk even if it is being made available to the schools.  There will be a lot more about this in the next couple of weeks.  I can undertake to obtain the information requested by the Deputy and forward it to her by letter.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In the first instance, I am talking about following the advice of the medical people who are running the Eccles programme. They are concerned that the issues of sensitivity, specificity and the positive predictive value of the screening would be in place.  These are the terms used. Sensitivity would be a measurement of accuracy to avoid false negative results, a 90 per cent sensitivity would mean <Col N="823" /> that in nine out of ten cases the results are accurate.  Specificity is the same and is applied in terms of false positive results.  The positive predictive value is to ensure that the proportion of people subjected to biopsy as a result of screening, in whom a malignancy is diagnosed, is not magnified by requesting people to go for unnecessary biopsies.  The reason for not announcing a national screening programme is not financial, it is to ensure that as it is systematically expanded, the high quality of the results is maintained.  This is the medical advice available to us.  In terms of expansion I will be able to put in the region of £300,000 extra into the programme and about the same amount into the Mater programme and I hope to have it extended to at least two other areas.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am committed to the early introduction of new mental health legislation to provide a modern framework within which the relatively small number of people with mental disorder who refuse or who are incapable of seeking treatment or protection in their own interest or in the interests of others can be cared for and treated.  As a prelude to the introduction of new legislation I will be publishing the White Paper on mental health legislation in the very near future outlining the Government's intentions with regard to the content of new legislation in this field.</P>
      <P>I was also pleased last week to launch a discussion document &ldquo;Developing a Policy for Women's Health&rdquo; which I see as a first step towards the definition of a women's health plan.  This document, the first of its kind in the European Union, looks at the health services from a female point of view and suggests ways in which these services could be made more responsive to the needs of women.  It notes that women's experience of mental health is different from men's and includes a commitment to the commissioning of research on the factors associated with mental illness in women in Ireland following consultation with women's health groups and mental health organisations.</P>

      <P>In reply to an earlier question the Minister said that mental health treatment has changed considerably over the last decade.  However, as we are dealing with a 50 year old Act, does he accept much needs to be done? I welcome the forthcoming legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister agree that given the figures stated, we have a bad record on mental health?  At any one time 200,000 people in the State suffer from depression.  Given these figures and the different types of mental disorders men <Col N="825" /> and women experience, is his Department considering putting together a public relations campaign on depression and enhancing the primary treatment of depression via GP services, which has been proven quite successful in other jurisdictions in terms of recognising depression at first point of contact?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> All those suggestions are part of the manner in which the mental health services are now being delivered.  The White Paper involves putting a new legislative framework in place because, as the Deputy rightly said, the 1946 Act is not only outdated but means we no longer accord with the European Convention on Human Rights, more specifically the case law flowing from it.</P>
      <P>The context is that the White Paper will be published in a couple of weeks, there will be a short consultative process and the heads of the Bill will go to Government.  It is the legal framework which is being dealt with; the changing patterns of care are already within the system and what the Deputy refers to is being treated.  It is difficult to assess whether we have a higher incidence than other countries.  Before the changes, when mental illness was treated in hospitals behind high walls in locked wards, significant numbers of geriatric patients and persons with mental handicap were kept in those hospitals.  The statistics were not accurate when one simply relied on the complements in the hospitals.</P>
      <P>That is not to diminish the problem; the admission to psychiatric hospitals and units in 1993 for all diagnoses were 14,567 males and 12,438 females, although many of those would be short stays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will note from these statistics that alcoholism is heavily represented in the figures for males, as are depression and other psychotic disorders in the figures for females.  So there are separate profiles in terms of mental health difficulties.  He <Col N="826" /> indicated there would be a short consultative process before the publication of the Bill.  Who will be consulted and will there be a corresponding consultation with the psychological as well as the psychiatric services?  Does he agree that when the new Bill is introduced there will be a need to redress the imbalance in the old legislation, which was in favour of the medical-psychiatric approach as distinct from the under-utilised and under-appreciated psychological services, which are unevolved and under-resourced in this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There is some evidence in the statistics of gender bias in alcoholic disorders.  The figure for males is 4,405 and for females 1,313, a very big discrepancy.  For depressive disorders, the figure for men is 3,141 and for women 4,688 and for schizophrenia the figures are 3,257 for men and 2,363 for women, so the gender bias is not as pronounced as suggested, except in relation to alcoholism.</P>
      <P>On the consultative process, a Green Paper on mental illness was published. Anyone with a particular interest was consulted and the White Paper is the distilled wisdom of all those involved in that process.  When the White Paper is published submissions will be invited and people who feel they have a contribution to make will be free to do so.  I will invite submissions from people who consider themselves relevant.  We will then draft the heads of the Bill and when they are accepted by the Government I hope to bring it to the House in 1996.</P>
      <P>It is complicated legislation and it does not impinge on treatment, it is more concerned with the committal of those who either refuse to be committed or are unable to make the decision; and an appeals process and review system which will be necessary to bring legislation into line with international provisions.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> No; no more than any other illness treatments would be enshrined in Statute.  If they were made a matter of Statute, when treatments and medical procedures changed no doctor could apply the new treatment without a change in the law. Treatment is a matter of practice and practice changes.  That is happening in any case because there has been a high level of practice change in the last few years and that has been effective.  The most dramatic changes in the health service have been in respect of mental illness.</P>
      <P>The legal framework will deal with some elements of treatment, for example, if elements of restraint were involved.  It would be along the lines of protecting the rights of patients, rather than getting into the area of what the appropriate medical treatment should be.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I understand that the Western Health Board has indicated that the bed complement agreed on the medical side for the development of Phase 2 at the hospital is adequate to meet any needs arising for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients.</P>
      <P>The board is arranging to have this matter examined in conjunction with the appropriate members of the consultant medical staff in Mayo General Hospital, with a view to the formulation of an appropriate policy for the treatment of CF patients.  The board has indicated that such a policy would be based on the maximum use of facilities in the community, with reliance on hospital support where necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 30 paediatric CF patients in Mayo at present.  As the Minister knows, the unfortunate people with this condition are living longer on account of medical treatment and the progress which has been made with this condition over a number of years. Therefore, these children will become adults and they need to be cared for in a local setting.  That is why the question asked if there will be a local service. They do not even need a unit but a service which would mean an extra physiotherapist, an extra dietician and an extra nurse with an interest in cystic fibrosis. There are already paediatricians and adult physicians there.  Could the Minister give a commitment to giving such a service in Mayo?</P>

      <askee>Minister for Health</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the means test for subventions for patients in nursing homes does not allow for mortgage interest relief and medical insurance relief, as is the case of grants in general; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, which accompany the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, came into effect on 1 September 1993 and ensure that those most in need of nursing home care and without the means to pay for it receive assistance towards the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to draw the Deputy's attention to the Third Schedule of the subvention regulations.  The Third Schedule directs the health board to take into account mortgage repayments on a principal residence, payments towards life assurance and payments towards membership of the Voluntary Health Insurance scheme, not already taken into account <Col N="831" /> in income tax exemptions of an applicant's son or daughter, when calculating the assessment of circumstances of a person who has qualified for a nursing home subvention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have another case with the South Eastern Health Board where these matters are not being taken into account with regard to a nursing home in my constituency.  There seems to be a lack of communication or maladministration, I am not sure which.  I would appreciate if the Minister advised the health boards of the changes which he has outlined.  I have no doubt that he is correct, which means that an injustice is being done in this case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There are no changes.  The original subvention regulations have a third schedule which states that mortgage interest and life insurance can be taken into account when assessing the means of a son or daughter in respect of a parent applying for this subvention.  If the Deputy gives me the details of the case, I will take it up with the South Eastern Health Board.  However, if that is the only outstanding issue preventing a person from being awarded a subvention, then the regulations say that can be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will provide the Minister with details of the case because it has been ongoing for some months.  Those items have not been taken into account by the health board in assessing the eligibility of the patient for a subvention. There is such a yawning gap between those who are allowed care in the health board's own institutions and those who are allowed a subvention in private nursing homes, that the whole <Col N="832" /> area needs to be re-examined.  Some families have to pay enormous sums of money and if their income was a little less they would not have to pay anything. There is a need for a graduated scale rather than a definite cut-off point, besides the issues which I have already raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There is very wide discretion in the application of the scheme.  I have seen health boards allocating all levels of subvention, from £20 to £120, depending on their own assessment of need.  It is graduated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The scheme has not been in place for very long and there are regional disparities, both in how the regulations are being applied and the level of subvention being awarded.  We will have a look at the situation.  It is also true that the scheme is well beyond budget, so whatever restrictions are there, it is still well ahead of what was estimated when it was introduced.</P>

The health services will have to be delivered by the health <Col N="833" /> boards.  They have very large staffs and are well funded.  It is up to them to make the decisions on these matters.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Available figures indicate that there are in the region of 2,000 women awaiting tubal ligation procedures in public hospitals.  A number of hospitals do not maintain formal waiting lists in respect of patients requiring tubal ligations since there is no waiting time in these hospitals once the decision to proceed with the operation has been made.  Over 3,600 tubal ligations were performed in 1994 in 27 public hospitals.  This figure does not include those procedures carried out privately.</P>
      <P>I have today announced details for the allocation of the £8 million 1995 Waiting list Initiative funds, and gynaecological procedures, including tubal ligations, will be one of the speciality areas targeted.  There are in excess of 700 such procedures scheduled to be performed for patients currently on waiting lists under this year's Initiative.  I am confident that these measures will help to further alleviate the waiting times for those currently on waiting lists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the information which the Minister has just announced.  Is he aware that the findings <Col N="834" /> of a recent Eastern Health Board survey on family planning services show that women who present at Holles Street, for example, and seek sterilisation are placed on a waiting list for up to 12 months?  In Portlaoise they are placed on a waiting list for over 12 months. Does he agree that women who present at a hospital, be it public or private, and seek tubal ligation should not have to wait so long?</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the findings also show that 30 per cent of general practitioners have no expertise in the area of family planning services and that of the 139 general practitioners surveyed only 27 were women?  Does he agree that if family planning services are to be enhanced throughout the country &mdash; this is the stated aim of the recent policy document &mdash; there is a need to ensure that GMS patients will have access to suitably qualified general practitioners who have received specialist training and to increase the number of female general practitioners offering this service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The reason the Eastern Health Board conducted the survey was that in the spring I issued guidelines on family planning services.  It was asked to comply with these guidelines and report to the Department of Health by the last day of May with the necessary data relating to the effectiveness of the services.</P>
      <P>There are inadequacies in the family planning services.  The guidelines were promulgated so that the inadequacies could be identified by the health boards and remediated.</P>
      <P>There are waiting lists for tubal ligations. The waiting lists in many of the 27 hospitals where this procedure is performed are not long as the statistics include those who have only been waiting for a fortnight.  At 1 March there were 88 on the waiting list at Holles Street and 37 at Portlaoise General Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This does not seem to indicate that they will have to wait for up to 12 months.  Difficulties were encountered at the South Victoria Hospital in Cork when a particular gynaecologist was ill.  The waiting list seems to service women who live a long distance from Cork who attend the hospital for reasons of privacy and confidentiality. This makes it difficult to validate the list.  One does not want to write to a general practitioner where a woman has attended the hospital for reasons of privacy and confidentiality.</P>
      <P>Family planning services will be improved.  The health boards have been instructed to provide a range of services to which women throughout the country will have easy access, to identify the inadequacies and report back to me.</P>
      <P>The waiting list initiative covers gynaecological waiting lists.  A total of 700 cases will be dealt with.  Some hospitals because of their ethical code will not perform tubal ligation where it is sought for family planning reasons. There is an obligation on the consultant concerned to refer the patient to a hospital where this service is provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The findings of the same survey show that many GMS patients find it extremely difficult to obtain IUDs and diaphragms from their general practitioner.  What proposals does the Minister have to ensure that all GMS general practitioners will provide a comprehensive family planning service? The findings also show that only 40 per cent of the general practitioners who responded have family planning leaflets in their surgeries.  Does the Minister accept that if general practitioner services are to be improved a pro-active approach must be adopted, particularly by those general practitioners who provide a service to medical card holders who are most in need of such a service due to their socioeconomic circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The reason the survey was commissioned by the Eastern Health Board was that I <Col N="836" /> issued guidelines on family planning services. Most health boards reported during the month of June.  The position is being assessed.</P>
      <P>On the question of whether general practitioners have been educated in providing family planning advice, they have spent seven years in college and completed several years postgraduate training. Surely, they do not expect a misfortunate layperson such as myself to hold their hands.  Professionals have to take responsibility for the delivery of the service and if they do not have leaflets they should obtain them from the health promotion unit in the Department of Health or health boards.</P>
      <P>On the question of the availability of IUDs, it is stated in the guidelines that all contraceptive devices other than condoms will be available through the GMS for medical card holders.  The Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979, contains a conscience clause for general practitioners. This enables a GMS general practitioner who does not want to provide contraceptive devices to opt out. There is an obligation on service providers, through the Department of Health, to ensure that a service will be provided by another general practitioner.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 23 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Food Safety Advisory Committee has made a recommendation for a <Col N="837" /> national surveillance programme for all foodborne diseases, report No. 17, April 1994.  Such diseases include, E.coli 0157 infections.  That recommendation is being examined at present in my Department and I will also be seeking the views of the new Food Safety Advisory Board on the matter.  Meanwhile steps have been taken, especially among health board staff engaged in food controls, to raise awareness of the problem and to highlight preventative steps, with particular emphasis on the cooking of minced meat and hamburgers.  I believe those steps are adequate for the present. I will nevertheless be keeping the position under close view.</P>
    <P>In reply to another recent question from the Deputy on this matter, I informed him of the current position on screening and reporting procedures for hospital patients for the presence of E.coli 0157.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that, despite the steps which have been taken by the health boards, there was an outbreak of food poisoning at UCHG recently? What is most worrying is that it occurred in the gynaecological department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Any outbreak would be the source of grave concern.  This question relates specifically to the E.coli 0157 infection.  No major difficulties have been encountered.  This infection was first discovered in the late 1970s and information is now coming on stream from the World Health Organisation. Surveys have been conducted in both America and Europe.  We would be concerned if there were a serious outbreak of a foodborne disease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Whereas there is no statutory obligation on health boards in this matter there is a very good reason for that; health boards cannot be judges of their own cases.  Since 1950 health authorities have been informed, and have been circularised to the effect that food regulation requirements are the minimum expected of them.  Even though health boards are exempt from the regulations the onus is on them to report on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>This relates to the same matter.  The relevant health board official made a statement to the effect that hospitals are not obliged to comply with the statutory food hygiene regulations. The Minister said health boards are exempt because they should not be judge in their own cause.  Will he agree that is completely unacceptable?  Health boards, and particularly hospitals, should be monitored and supervised, perhaps by a section of the Department of Health, to ensure they comply with the statutory food hygiene regulations. Surely the <i>status quo</i> is not acceptable given that there was an outbreak, of salmonella in Galway and there are no <Col N="839" /> supervisory regulations to ensure such an outbreak does not occur in another hospital.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Health boards are enforcement agencies in terms of these regulations.  In addition to the matter of being judges in their own cause there is also the matter of justice being seen to be done.  I do not have knowledge of the information to which the Deputy referred and I would be glad if she would pass it to me.  The Department of Health made it clear that the regulations are the minimum required of health boards.  The present regulations are being reviewed in preparation for implementation of the EU directive dealing with this matter.  In that context the points made by both Deputies will be taken on board.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 29 together.  As the Deputies may be aware, I met with representatives of the Irish Wheelchair Association earlier this year and one of the issues raised with me was the threatened closure of the association's driving school.  I was anxious to ensure that this service <Col N="841" /> should continue and, accordingly, asked officials to carry out a detailed examination of the operation and the funding of the school in conjunction with the Irish Wheelchair Association.  Following that examination, I made arrangements for the provision of additional funding of £100,000 on an annual basis to ensure the continuation of this service.  This additional funding includes new arrangements for capitation payments which will apply also to the driving instruction course provided by the Disabled Drivers Association in Ballindine, County Mayo.  A capitation fee of £466 will now be payable for those who undertake a course of driving instruction instead of the previous arrangement where payment was made only to those who passed the driving test.  I am confident that this additional funding will ensure the survival of the invaluable services proved by both driving schools for people with disabilities.</P>

Will the Minister set up funding on a statutory basis for the association's driving school, which the Department accepts is an extremely useful and worthy service?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The grant of £100,000, which is being made through the Eastern Health Board, will provide some of the core funding for the driving school.  The ongoing arrangements will involve a capitation grant of £466 which will be applicable to all those who undertake the course rather than those who pass, as was the case previously.  The Irish Wheelchair Association is satisfied that the financial future of both schools is secure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise the matter of a local resource centre in Kilbarrack in my constituency which will lose its core staff with effect from tomorrow and does not have access to other resources. Kilbarrack on the north side of Dublin has suffered serious unemployment and other social ills for a long time.  The parish concerned is made up of approximately 1,200 houses and 100 flats and the unemployment rate is approximately 40 to 45 per cent.  Recently that area has been included in the Northside Partnership area which extends around it.  The local community has made a major effort during the past ten to 12 years to bring about local socio-economic development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>St. Benedict's steering group established a little over two years ago embarked on a feasibility study and was funded to the tune of £10,000 initially for an area action plan and later received £50,000 to implement it.  That group has been busy implementing that study.  The resource centre was launched approximately 15 to 16 months ago and the group has been busy implementing its action plan which has been successful and impressive.  It has a full-time community worker and a number of core staff in charge of after-school projects, women's projects and other activities.  A wide range of activities are organised in the centre including a crèche, a community information service and various <Col N="927" /> small enterprise developments.  A jobs club is projected and other major groups in the area share that building and use the administrative services provided in it.</P>
    <P>Why is there a threat to pull the plug on that centre when great efforts and expense, almost £80,000, were incurred during the past few years to establish, fund and staff it? I accept that the Minister for Social Welfare and his Minister of State have been sympathetic to the representations made on behalf of the centre and they will meet the management group next Monday, but tomorrow evening the basic funding for the administration of the centre will cease.</P>
    <P>It appears that the Taoiseach and his Minister of State have a responsibility for this matter because the project was originally funded through the ADM company.  The Minister of State is a former member of the Committee of Public Accounts of which I am a member. This morning it discussed local groups funded under the Department of Social Welfare or other Departments.  If the achievement of a group is measurable and impressive, as in the case of this group, why can we not continue to fund it to ensure that the group's objectives will be ultimately successful?</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister of State at the Taoiseach's office to sort out the problem and to ensure that adequate funding will continue to be made available through the Department of Social Welfare and the ADM company to ensure that the project is successful.</P>
    <P>This area is written about extensively in literature.  Roddy Doyle and one or two other famous local writers have written about it.  It is sad and while State support has been provided for a major initiative to address some of the problems identified and published in Roddy Doyle's literary output, the horrendous level of local unemployment and its associated problems, at the end of the <Col N="928" /> day we are not addressing them effectively. I ask the Minister to take action on this matter.</P>

      <P>St. Benedict's Parish Resource Centre Limited received £10,000 in September 1993 under the global grant for local development 1993-94.  This was by way of technical assistance to develop an integrated area action plan.  This support was provided by Area Development Management Limited, an independent company designated by the Government and the European Commission to support integrated local, economic and social integration.</P>
      <P>When this plan was submitted St. Benedict's received an allocation of £50,000 in December 1993 to develop the strategies and actions within its plan. The period for carrying out these strategies and actions was up to December 1994, subsequently extended to March 1995.  At the end of this period it was given additional time up to the end of June 1995 to complete its actions and final reports.</P>
      <P>St. Benedict's is one of the many groups that received funding under the global grant which is part of the last round of Structural Funds.  There is no commitment to further funding beyond the life of the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>St. Benedict's Resource Centre is situated in Kilbarrack, which is within an area designated by Government to participate in the local development programme, that is, within the extended area of the Northside Partnership.  The partnership is in the process of finalising its local development plan which will shortly be submitted to Area Development Management for appraisal.  On the basis of this appraisal, financial support will be made available to the Northside Partnership from then until the end of December 1999.  Continued support for St. Benedict's under the local development programme is a matter for the partnership to determine consistent with the priorities it has set for itself. <Col N="929" /> The Department of Social Welfare has no remit for the continued funding of project work carried out under Area Development Management.</P>
    <P>St. Benedict's Parish Resource Centre has also applied for inclusion in the community development programme of the Department of Social Welfare and an assessment process is under way and, discussions have taken place with St. Benedict's in relation to its application.</P>
    <P>The community development programme has clear criteria and entry qualifications.  The recommendation arising from this assessment process will be considered in due course by my Department.  There is no mechanism for interim funding within the budget allocation of the community development programme.  In the event of the application satisfying the criteria for entry into the community development programme, St. Benedict's Parish Resource Centre will be notified of the outcome.</P>
    <P>Funding of £2,000 under the scheme of grants to locally-based men's groups was made by the Department of Social Welfare to St. Benedict's and £5,000 was allocated under the scheme of grants for locally-based women's groups.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the concerns of Deputy Broughan on this matter and, notwithstanding the work that has already been carried out and operating within the confines of the particular schemes, we will do our best to ensure the Deputy's aspirations are attained.</P>

      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me raise this matter, one of the many occasions on which it has been aired.  It is vital that the matter is addressed immediately.  Will the Minister make known to the examiner his decision on the Competition Authority's report? It is now both material and central to clarification of all the issues involved, particularly the examiner's urgent request for potential investors for the Irish Press group of newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="930" /> In raising the matter again this evening I draw the House's attention to the fact that on 31 March the Minister received the report of the Competition Authority, when he stated he would make known his decision within a month.  There was ample time for him to declare his hand before the crisis evolved in the Irish Press group.  The crisis developed partly because the Minister bobbed and weaved and dodged and ducked but did not make known his decision.  At the outset I put it down to a dilatory way of doing his work but I am now forced to believe that he deliberately set out on a manipulative path of concealment and deceit in not making known his decision on the report.  That manipulative path affects 600 people.  Now that an examiner has been appointed surely it is vital that potential investors are made aware of the exact Government thinking on the report submitted to the Minister four months ago.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will outline his decision on the report this evening as it is essential to the examiner's deliberations and to those whom we are told wish to invest in the Irish Press group of newspapers.  While unemployment is central to this issue, we must also have a wide diversity of opinion expressed through the print medium.  The citizens of this land will suffer if that is not the case.  It is facile to say that all newspapers express different points of view, but it would be unfortunate if there was an increasing acceleration towards a unitary state of mind within the print medium.  That would not be for the good of the country or its citizens.</P>

      <P>I reject out of hand that any part of the crisis in the Irish Press newspapers is due to a delay in making a decision on the report of the Competition Authority.  The problems in the Irish Press group have an entirely different source and any fair observer of the position would recognise their true source.</P>
      <P>I welcome the decision of the High Court to place the Irish Press group of newspapers under examinership.  My counsel advised the court that I supported the court's consideration of the petition by the workers for the appointment of an examiner under the Companies (Amendment) Act so that the question of new investors for the group could be pursued.  Of course any new arrangement must respect competition law and my objective is to find new investors for a successful relaunch of <i>The Irish Press</i> with maximum employment. The examiner requested a meeting with me and I propose to meet him to discuss all the issues relating to the examinership on which he is embarking. I commend the examiner's proposal to seek new investors.</P>
      <P>The Deputy raised the question of the Competition Authority report which, as she is aware, recommended that under section 6 of the Competition Act I should proceed to take a High Court action in respect of all alleged breach, by the agreement entered into between <i>The Irish Press</i> and the <i>Irish Independent,</i> of sections 4 and 5 of the Competition Act.  Such a course would involve a lengthy court action.  Precipitating a lengthy court action at this stage would not assist the process on which the examiner has embarked.  I will reserve my position on the Competition Authority report.  It is not appropriate at this stage to make a decision in respect of the agreement entered into between <i>The Irish Press</i> and the <i>Irish Independent.</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this issue because of the serious deterioration of the TB eradication scheme given its vital importance in ensuring the maintenance of the disease-free status of our national herd.  My concern is to get the scheme back on the road but the approach adopted by the Minister and his Department will ensure that will not happen. Unnecessary confrontation has been provoked.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Deenihan, who had been involved in these discussions since late 1993, had been endeavouring to deal with these issues competently when, unfortunately, he was shunted sideways by the Minister who has treated him very unfairly.  Indeed, the Minister's threats when the ballot took place led to an unnecessary hardening of attitudes.</P>
      <P>The Department appears to be hung up on a proposal that £4 million available from the European Commission is dependent on adequate rotational testing this year, whereas the Commission is seeking to have one-third of the tests rotated in order that the £4 million can be drawn down.  Already one-third of the tests has been undertaken; therefore, in order for the proposal to be practical this year, half of the remaining tests will have to be implemented under the new system.  That is impractical and will not happen.  The Department should look beyond this issue to resolve this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The saddening factor from the point of view of the public and the farming community is that the principle of rotation is not a problem between the Irish Veterinary Union, the Department and farming organisations.  There is a large number of issues to be addressed here if we are to get to the bottom of this problem.  Quite clearly, the comparative tuberculin test used since the mid-1950s was the proper one which was successful in reducing the incidence of the disease from one-third of the national herd in the 1950s to its present low level.  However, we have failed to <Col N="933" /> make improvements in the level of the incidence since then.  A different, more comprehensive approach must be adopted for which the scientific evidence is available from the TB Investigation Unit of UCD &mdash; a subsection of the Veterinary College who have said:</P>
    <P>On the basis of scientific evidence currently available and the progress of the national eradication programme in the Republic to date, it would appear that bovine-to-bovine transmission of the M-bovis virus is no longer the primary source of new outbreaks here.  Effective means of addressing the other factors involved in the transmission of tuberculosis will be required to achieve the final eradication of the disease in the Republic.</P>
    <P>When the Department talks about the possible loss of £4 million drawdown this year, it should be remembered that of the scheme funding 30 per cent goes to compensation for reactors, another approximate 30 per cent on veterinary fees and 30 per cent on its administration. Therefore, almost £20 million, or five times the amount being disputed represents the administrative cost of the scheme, an outrageous reflection on the efficiency of the Department in terms of its management.  In other words, bad management is at the heart of this matter.</P>
    <P>Neither can we maintain the <i>status quo</i>&mdash; which I certainly would not advocate.  It is incumbent on the Minister and his Department, in the interests of protecting the disease-free status of our national herd, ensuring that the bottom will not fall out of cattle prices as it did in the case of sheep prices over recent months, to abolish what I can only describe as this Jono Lomu-type approach, this unnecessary belligerence and address not merely the rotation but all the other issues involved on a tripartite basis between the vets, farming organisations and departmental officials as a matter of urgency.  In that way a comprehensive review of the programme could be undertaken, to deal with all of the issues of concern to farmers, who pay the levies, to officials who <Col N="934" /> manage the scheme and the vets at the front line of its implementation.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of vital national interest.  It is wrong to put the image of our country and agricultural industry at risk because of a threatening approach by the Minister in endeavouring to resolve the problem.  We must address all the issues and ensure that we achieve a negotiated settlement to resolve them not merely the matter of fees or rotation, but also those of animal welfare. We must ascertain to what extent wildlife is responsible for the spread of the disease, and to what extent we can deal with tamper-proof identification of cattle, all of which must be addressed simultaneously so that farmers and the taxpayers begin to get value for money.</P>
    <P>While the scheme operated has served us well in reducing the incidence of the disease to its present level &mdash; just 3.5 per thousand cattle &mdash; it is crucial that we sit down and work out a tripartite solution.  The social partnership has worked <i>vis-à-vis</i> our economic affairs, and it can in this departmental matter.  I am satisfied that, with any modicum of negotiating skill, the Minister will solve this problem without placing the disease-free status of our cattle herd in jeopardy.  It is unfortunate this has been the third successive term of office of a Fine Gael Minister during which a veterinary strike has been in the offing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I endeavoured to put in place exactly what Deputy Cowen seeks today.  I endeavoured to be conciliatory to the Irish Veterinary Union and negotiate with them on a professional basis and to maintain our discussions within the negotiating room.  Unfortunately they decided to engage in a different course of action.  My ultimate proposal was that they adopt a minimalist approach, one which should have been acceptable to the veterinary profession nationwide, which I had discussed with a number of veterinary officers who seemed to agree with it.  They accepted that some changes were necessary to draw down the funding offered to us <Col N="935" /> which we did not want to lose.  Unfortunately the veterinary profession rejected my offer, in addition to my offer to sit at the table with them to discuss a large number of related issues just as important as rotation, which confirmed my willingness to include farmers and all other interested bodies in those discussions.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the Irish Veterinary Union became totally hung-up on the overall issue of rotation to which, incidentally, they had agreed in July 1994 and on which they had more or less shaken hands with departmental officials.  For whatever reason, they changed their thinking and decision leaving us with a set of circumstances the Minister and I would prefer did not obtain.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the background to this issue relates to efforts by my Department to introduce revised testing arrangements as required under the terms of the programme approved for EU funding.  The IVU recently rejected proposals on revised testing arrangements and increased fees.  In the light of that rejection the Minister Deputy Yates has no alternative but to proceed with measures which involve the degree of rotation required to meet the terms of the approved programme.  Arrangements are being finalised for the issue of the next phase of the 1995 round on an area basis and every effort will be made by my Department to ensure that this testing is undertaken.  I am determined to protect the health status of the national herd and all my efforts are directed to that objective.  I do not believe the health status of the herd will be jeopardised by the current actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Veterinary Union have indicated to me and the Minister that it is not their intention to withdraw from testing.  The farm organisations as representatives of the owners of the national herd have made it clear they are fully committed to effecting new approaches to secure a more effective eradication programme and to meet the <Col N="936" /> requirements relating to the drawdown of EU funding.  The primary requirements is that the testing of one-third of herds nationally will be rotated over the next three years.  This requirement is minimal in that one test only in the period will be carried out by veterinary practice other than the practice which normally tests the herd.  The arrangements will be fully under the control of the district veterinary office.</P>
    <P>The 1995 round of TB testing is well advanced &mdash; and indeed the Brucellosis testing regime is ahead of schedule.  In consequence the House, the Deputy and our trading customers can have confidence that the health status of the national herd is fully protected.  In global terms, the TB incidence level is small &mdash; less then 1 per cent of the 7 million animals in the national herd have infection.  This indicates that over 99 per cent of animals are clear of the disease.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Cowen said, when this scheme began in 1954 one-third of the national herd was infected whereas now less than 1 per cent is infected so it will be clearly seen we have achieved much over the years.  Indeed, we should recognise the trojan work of a large number of veterinary officers nationwide.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, progress toward final eradication is proving difficult and costly, requiring new, innovative approaches to increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the programme. While research may inject new technology into the programme, ultimately its degree of success will depend on the combined efforts of all concerned in the implementation of the eradication programme.  In that respect, I fully recognise and acknowledge the input of the veterinary profession into our generally high animal health status level which continues to be a major selling point for exports and our customers generally.</P>
    <P>I appeal to all parties involved to cooperate with arrangements for testing the remainder of the herd in 1995.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 4 July 1995.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Responsibility for the provision of educational services for pupils with special needs is primarily a matter for the Department of Education. The main responsibility of the health boards is to provide a broad range of specialist support services, such as speech therapy, occupational therapy and physiotherapy services.  Pupils with special needs have benefited in recent years from the increase in specialist staff recruited to the community based services by the health boards and voluntary agencies.</P>
      <P>The report of the Special Education Review Committee recommended the establishment of an interdepartmental co-ordinating committee between the Departments of Education and Health, which would address issues of mutual concern relating to the provision of services to pupils with special needs.  My Department has recently been in touch with the Department of Education regarding the establishment of this committee. I anticipate that there will be a positive development in this matter shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> In August 1990 the then Minister for Health established a working party, chaired by Mr. David Kingston, to consider possible future management arrangements for the new Tallaght Hospital.  The working party comprised representatives of the three hospitals transferring to Tallaght, the Adelaide, Meath and National Children's Hospitals.  The working party in its report submitted to the then Minister for Health in November 1991 stated that the three hospitals had agreed that the legal instrument governing the new Tallaght Hospital would be an amendment <Col N="844" /> of the existing Adelaide Hospital Charter, 1921.  This amendment would be made under section 76 of the Health Act, 1970.</P>
      <P>A Government decision to commence the construction of a new acute general hospital at Tallaght was taken on 3 November 1992, subject to agreement between the three hospitals transferring to Tallaght on the outstanding issues relating to board structure and management. Following discussions between representatives of the three hospitals transferring to Tallaght under the chairmanship of Professor David Kennedy and Mr. David Kingston agreement was reached on 25 May 1993 on the composition of the board of management for Tallaght Hospital and other issues.</P>
      <P>Following the acceptance of the heads of agreement of May 1993 by the boards of the three hospitals and approval by the Government, negotiations between the three hospitals continued under the chairmanship of Professor David Kennedy with a view to agreeing upon the text of a revised charter which would reflect the interests of the three hospitals and form the basis for the future governance arrangements of the new hospital at Tallaght.</P>
      <P>Professor Kennedy has recently informed the Department that agreement has been reached with the chairmen of the Meath, Adelaide and National Children's Hospitals on the text of a draft charter for Tallaght Hospital.  The draft charter has now been approved by the boards of two of the hospitals, the Adelaide and National Children's Hospitals.  The draft charter has been formally submitted to me with a request for Government and Oireachtas approval of the various amendments to the existing charter. However, I am informed that the draft charter has yet to be approved by the full board of the Meath Hospital and will be considered further by the board at their next meeting on 13 July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that consideration of the draft charter has been deferred to allow for a written submission to the board by the unions representing staff from the <Col N="845" /> Meath Hospital transferring to Tallaght. While it is understandable that agreement on sensitive and difficult issues must take time, I am now very concerned that despite a protracted period of detailed and intensive negotiations between the three hospitals, based on heads of agreement which were accepted over two years ago by the boards of the three hospitals and approved by the Government, it has still not proved possible for the Meath Hospital Board to agree on the draft charter.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to see the board of the new hospital put in place at the earliest date under the provisions of an amended charter, so as to provide a unified management structure which will allow for a speedy and efficient transfer of the three hospitals to Tallaght.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I have obtained the views of the South-Eastern Health Board in this matter.  Board policy in relation to property which becomes surplus to requirements is to offer it in the <Col N="847" /> first instance, to the local housing authority and, if they are not interested, to sell it to the highest bidder.

      <P>The South-Eastern Health Board has confirmed that they would prefer to sell this property rather than lease it.</P>
      <P>However, I agree that it would be a pity to allow the building to lie idle indefinitely and eventually become derelict.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The report, <i>Zero Tolerance &mdash; A National Strategy on Eliminating Violence Against Women,</i> prepared by Women's Aid, was presented to me two weeks ago.  The report makes a number of important recommendations <Col N="850" /> for tackling the problem of domestic violence.</P>
      <P>In so far as my own area is concerned I fully recognise the essential role of women's refuges as a a key element in the range of support services required to address this problem.  I am particularly conscious of the fact that, while comprehensive information on the number of women who are unable to obtain accommodation in women's refuges is not available, there does appear to be a shortfall in the overall provision.</P>
      <P>I want to assure the House that I am committed to the development of appropriate services within the health area for victims of domestic violence.  It is my intention to build on the developments, costing in the region of £350,000 which were approved last year. These included:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Eastern Health Board</i>
      </P>
      <P>an increase of £50,000 annually in the level of financial support to women's refuges in the Dublin area;</P>
      <P>
        <i>Midland Health Board</i>
      </P>
      <P>the provision of new counselling services for victims of domestic violence in Athlone and Tullamore;</P>
      <P>
        <i>North Eastern Health Board</i>
      </P>
      <P>the setting up of new services for victims of domestic violence in Dundalk;</P>
      <P>
        <i>North Western Health Board</i>

      <P>additional funding for Women's Aid, Letterkenny;</P>
      <P>
        <i>Mid-Western Health Board</i>
      </P>
      <P>increased financial support for Adapt Refuge, Limerick to employ a child care worker;</P>
      <P>
        <i>South Eastern Health Board</i>
      </P>
      <P>increased funding for Oasis Hostel in Waterford and for the development of additional refuge places in the region;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="851" />
      <i>Southern Health Board</i>
    </P>
    <P>increased support for Adapt Women's Refuge, Tralee and for Cuanlee Refuge in Cork;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Western Health Board</i>
    </P>
    <P>the development of a facility in Castlebar for victims of domestic violence.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, it is my intention that continued progress will be made in this very important area this year.  As a first step, I have approved the payment of £55,000 towards the running costs of the freephone national helpline service provided by Women's Aid and £20,000 to the National Federation of Refuges for Abused Women and their Children to support their co-ordinating activities. My colleague, Deputy Austin Currie, Minister of State at my Department, will shortly be announcing further developments in this important area this year.</P>
    <P>The House will also be aware that earlier this year the National Federation of Refuges for Abused Women and their Children launched their policy document for Womens Refuges.  My Department circulated this document to all health boards for urgent consideration in the context of their service development plans.</P>
    <P>The discussion document &mdash; Developing a Policy for Women's Health &mdash; which was launched on Thursday last 22 June identifies violence against women and children as a priority area for development.  This discussion document will form the basis for widespread consultation with women including women who are victims of domestic violence.</P>
    <P>The publication on Friday last of the Domestic Violence Bill, 1995 marks a renewed commitment on the part of the Government to tackle with greater effect the problem of violence in the home.  The Bill has been drafted following extensive consultations with organisations such as Women's Aid.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="852" /> It is clear from the various elements which arise in the context of domestic violence that this is a very complex issue which no one Government Department or agency can tackle in isolation.  Given the co-ordinating role which I have in the three Departments of Health, Education and Justice I will ensure that this report is considered fully from the perspective of the three Departments.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 26 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>Open heart surgery operations for adults, including coronary artery by-pass grafts are currently performed for public patients at the national cardiac surgery unit in the Mater Hospital, Dublin and at Cork University Hospital.</P>
      <P>In 1993, a sum of £1 million from the waiting list fund was allocated to enable the necessary facilities to be put in place at the national cardiac surgery unit, Mater Hospital to increase the annual throughput of open heart surgery at the hospital from 750 to 1,000 &mdash; an increase of 33 per cent.  In addition, in 1993 and 1994 funding of £2.8 million was provided to facilitate the doubling of cardiac surgery at Cork University Hospital from 200 to 400 patients each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over 1993 and 1994, in excess of £2 <Col N="853" /> million revenue and £3.5 million in capital was allocated to the Mater Hospital for cardiac surgery and related developments. The building works which were associated with this development, were completed in mid-1994, include additional cardiac maintenance beds, intensive care facilities and high dependency facilities which are required to support the cardiac surgery programme.</P>
    <P>Additional resources of £200,000 are being provided in 1995 to the Mater Hospital to ensure that throughput in cardiac surgery in 1995 reaches the target of 1,000 open heart operations per year.  An additional permanent cardiac surgeon has been appointed to the Mater Hospital and is expected to take up duty in August 1995.  In addition, a second cardiac surgeon is being recruited for Cork University Hospital.</P>
    <P>The developments at the Mater Hospital, together with the developments for cardiac surgery at Cork University Hospital will have the effect of increasing the number of cardiac surgery operations performed on an annual basis in the public hospital sector by 47 per cent from 950 to 1,400.</P>
    <P>The question of the provision of further additional facilities for cardiac surgery will be considered as sympathetically as possible in the context of the many competing demands for resources throughout the health services.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Services for adolescents, whose primary need is for psychiatric care, are generally provided by child and adolescent psychiatric services. In recent years, there has been <Col N="854" /> significant expansion in child and adolescent psychiatric services in each health board with additional recruitment of child psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers.</P>
      <P>My Department is in discussion with the health boards concerning their priorities for the further development of child and adolescent psychiatry.  We are also commencing the formulation of a policy for the development of these services.</P>
      <P>While the provision of psychiatric services for adolescents will receive due attention in my Department, attention must also be paid to the prevention of potential mental health problems among young people.  The Department of Education and the Health Promotion Unit of my Department are involved in the delivery of health education programmes for young people to help them develop the ability to cope with events in their lives.  The policy document on health promotion which will be published shortly will also address this issue.</P>
      <P>Early identification of problems is also important and I am pleased that my colleague the Minister for Education is expanding the psychological service for primary schools.  This service could in many instances intervene at an early stage in cases of learning difficulties to prevent the onset of subsequent emotional problems which would require the input of the child and adolescent psychiatric team.  Likewise resources made available towards the implementation of the Child Care Act, 1991, will benefit child and adolescent psychiatric services in that emotional problems which may derive in children who have been assaulted, ill-treated, neglected or abused or who are at risk will have a better chance of being detected and treated at an earlier stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I intend to take Questions Nos. 28 and 31 together.  The recently published discussion document on developing a policy for women's health draws attention to the level of teenage pregnancies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1993 there were 2,637 births to women under 20, of which 57 were under 15 years of age.  While the total number of births to teenagers has been falling, the number of births to single, teenage mothers has been rising.  Only 9 per cent of births to teenagers in 1993 were to married women, compared to 60 per cent in 1980.  The increase in births to teenage single mothers is a matter for concern.  The document suggests that a multi faceted programme is needed to educate young people, both male and female, in more responsible <Col N="856" /> attitudes to sexual activity and relationships and about the responsibilities of parenting.</P>
    <P>On the question of co-operation with the Department of Education in this matter, the present position is that representatives of my Department at the invitation of the Department of Education are working to identify health education initiatives currently under way with a view to further development and dissemination of good practice in the context of relationships and sexuality education.  It is a matter for the Minister for Education, in the first instance, to consider appropriate programmes for introduction in the schools setting.</P>
    <P>With regard to initiatives within my own area of responsibility, I am satisfied that many efforts are being made to tackle the problem of births to young unmarried women.  Under Section 8 of the Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Act, 1992 and Article 2 of the Health (Family Planning) Regulations, 1992, health boards are responsible for the provision of a comprehensive family planning service.</P>
    <P>My Department's Health Promotion Unit has provided a grant to the Eastern Health Board to develop a pilot programme to reduce teenage pregnancies. The programme has been developed by public health doctors on the staff of the board, in conjunction with teachers and parents.  The present position with regard to the programme is that it has been extended in the pilot area and that the recommendations of the report on the programme are being considered by my Department and the Department of Education in the context of the interdepartmental work to which I referred.</P>
    <P>I intend to publish a national health promotion strategy shortly.  The strategy will propose initiatives involving health boards with regard to sexually active people.  There are already a number of programmes supported by my Department's Health Promotion Unit which address relationships and sexuality education in the context of a broad health <Col N="857" /> education programme and these education programmes seek to promote responsibility in the area of sexual health.</P>
    <P>However the challenge remains to ensure that all young people including early school leavers have access to appropriate information and education in the area of relationships and sexuality. It is also extremely important that those who are sexually active are aware that family planning advice is available and that they are encouraged to make use of family planning services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> In 1991 the Government published a strategy to prevent drug misuse.  The strategy recognised that the problem of drug misuse is a complex and difficult one to which there are no easy or instant solutions.  It proposed, therefore, a multi-disciplinary approach requiring action in the areas of supply reduction, demand reduction and increased access to treatment and rehabilitation programmes, together with a comprehensive co-ordinated structure geared towards their implementation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the publication of the strategy my Department has been working on the implementation of its recommendations and has been concentrating on developing a comprehensive network of services in order to provide an effective response to the problem.  Particular attention has been paid to the provision of services in the Dublin area where the intravenous drug abuse is a feature, because of the need to prevent the spread of HIV through the sharing of dirty needles.  Each year since 1992 substantial additional funding has been <Col N="858" /> allocated to the Eastern Health Board to allow it develop a wide range of services. During 1995 it is intended to open additional satellite clinics, a new detoxification unit and additional rehabilitation spaces to cater for drug misusers. The Eastern Health Board has also established an Eastern Region Co-ordinating Committee with representation from the board, the Department of Justice, the Garda, the Prison Service, the education sector and voluntary organisations. This committee will monitor the drug misuse situation in order to ensure that the response of the various agencies involved is delivered in a co-ordinated fashion.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the need to keep the issue of drug misuse under continuous review and it is my aim to continue with the development of preventive, treatment and rehabilitation services as appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> As I have previously indicated to this House, I do not regard the use of bed and breakfast accommodation as an acceptable response to the problem of youth homelessness.  My Department has made it clear to the health boards that if, in cases of emergency, there is no alternative to the placement of a homeless child in this form of accommodation, immediate steps should be taken to secure an appropriate hostel, residential or family placement for the child.  It is my firm <Col N="859" /> intention that the use of this form of accommodation as a response to the problem of youth homelessness should be eliminated at the earliest possible date.  At the same time, I recognise that the occasional case may arise where the provision of bed and breakfast accommodation may be appropriate for a youngster who is only seeking overnight accommodation in response to a specific unforeseen situation.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board, in whose area the problem of youth homelessness is mainly concentrated, is pursuing a number of strategies to reduce its use of bed and breakfast accommodation and the number of young people in such accommodation has been reduced significantly.</P>
      <P>My Department has finalised, in consulation with the Eastern Health Board, a range of important new child care developments including the provision of additional hostel and other residential places and an expansion of the board's out-of-hours social work service into a 24 hour crisis intervention service for children.  These services will be funded out of the £10 million set aside in this year's Health Estimate for the further development of child care services and will greatly strengthen the capacity of the board to provide appropriate accommodation and services for homeless young people.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Responsibility for the respite care grants scheme and the <Col N="860" /> scheme of grants to voluntary organisations was transferred to my Department from the Department of Social Welfare this year.  The decision to transfer these schemes was made following a review of funding for voluntary organisations by the Minister for Social Welfare and myself.  Following this review it became clear that there was an overlap between my Department and the Department of Social Welfare in terms of funding of voluntary organisations involved in the health care services.</P>
      <P>A total £1.54 million was transferred to my Department of which £0.258 million was already committed in respect of eight on-going projects for Barnados, Crosscare, Disability Federation of Ireland, Incare, Federation of Refuges for Abused Women and their Children, Parentline, Soroptimists, County Clare and Women's Aid.  I fully honoured the approved funding for these voluntary organisations thus ensuring continuation of these projects after the transfer of funds.</P>
      <P>In line with the National Health Strategy, it was decided to allocate all moneys through the health boards which would have the responsibility for administering these schemes on behalf of my Department.  Health boards have been instructed to ensure that the spirit of the former social welfare schemes continues to be maintained by them and that the commitments made to voluntary organisations by Social Welfare be honoured.  To this end each health board has been furnished with a list of the voluntary organisations funded under these schemes by the Department of Social Welfare in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Responsibility for the administration of the respite care grant scheme and the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations has been transferred to the health boards as an extension of the national lottery block grant scheme of £1.75 million for voluntary bodies already operated by the boards.  Following the allocation of funding to the eight aforementioned projects, a total of £3.032 million was made available to the <Col N="861" /> health boards for the voluntary sector on this basis.</P>
    <P>The breakdown of funding to each health board area is as follows:</P>

    <P>The process of transfer has been acted on speedily by my Department in consultation with the Department of Social Welfare and the health boards. Health boards have been directed to advise all local voluntary groups in their respective functional area of the new procedures for applying for funding under these schemes.  My Department has also contacted the various umbrella bodies for people with disabilities concerning the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the change will simplify procedures for voluntary organisations seeking funding and ensure more coherent planning in the delivery of services by voluntary organisations.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The long-term illness scheme entitles persons who suffer from certain specified illness to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of the particular illnesses.  The scheme has not been extended since <Col N="863" /> 1975 and there are no plans to expand the number of illness covered by the scheme.</P>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme, however, is only one of a number of schemes in operation which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines for persons with ongoing medical conditions.</P>
      <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses &mdash; general practitioner fees, prescribed drugs etc. &mdash; due to a long-term medical condition these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  In some cases a medical card may issue to a family member on a personal basis.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
      <P>Persons who suffer from an ongoing medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for people who do not have a medical card or long-term illness book and are certified as having a long-term medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of an amount per month, currently £32.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
      <P>Under the drug refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.  I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of drug schemes to those in the community with long term medical conditions.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Non-consultant hospital doctors work a &ldquo;basic&rdquo; 39 hour week. However they are liable to be rostered for an average of 65 hours per week. Figures are not available on the number of doctors who worked in excess of the 65 hours or on the maximum number of hours worked by any one doctor in any one week in 1994.  The absence of this information is largely due to the absence of mechanisms to record unapproved or unrostered hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report on the Joint Pilot Study on Unrostered Hours of Non-Consultant Hospital Doctors carried out in 1994 by a group representative of the Local <Col N="866" /> Government Staff Negotiations Board, the Irish Business Employers' Confederation, the Irish Medical Organisation and my Department identified the problem of unrostered hours in certain specialties.  Following this report, my Department and health service management representatives entered negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation and agreement has now been reached on a mechanism to deal with the problem of unrostered hours.  Stage 1 of this mechanism which involves procedures being established for hospital management to record all hours claimed will be introduced with effect from 1 July 1995.</P>

      <P>The rationale for capital acquisitions tax, CAT, which was introduced in 1976, is that benefits received by way of gift or inheritance increase a person's resources and should therefore be taxable just as income receipts are taxable. CAT is payable by the beneficiary and all property inherited since 1 April 1975, including residential houses, is potentially liable to tax.  The liability of residential houses to inheritance tax depends on:</P>
      <P>&mdash; the value of the house at the relevant valuation date, normally the date on which the beneficiary receives the inheritance;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the amount of prior aggregable gifts/inheritances taken by the beneficiary; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;the relationship between the deceased and the beneficiary.</P>
      <P>There are no special reliefs under CAT for residential houses except where elderly brothers or sisters were living together in the same house.  In such situations, relief is available if a brother or sister of the deceased inherits a house or part of a house and if the beneficiary is aged 55 or over; has lived in the house with the deceased brother/sister for at least five years prior to the date of death; and owns no other residential property.</P>
      <P>If these conditions are satisfied, then the value of the house or part of the house is reduced for inheritance tax purposes by 60 per cent or £60,000 whichever is the lesser figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While transfers between spouses are exempt from CAT, it would not be appropriate to provide similar treatment for transfers between brothers and sisters as to do so would be inconsistent with the basic principles underlying this tax.  In addition to the reliefs available for elderly brothers and sisters, there are hardship provisions under the CAT <Col N="872" /> code which allow for postponement of the tax until the property is sold or passed on to the next generation.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The health strategy published on 21 April 1994 was endorsed by this Government in the policy agreement <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> as the basis for its programme in the health area.  The main theme of the strategy is the reorientation of the system towards more effectiveness and efficiency by reshaping the way that health services are planned and delivered. The strategy is underpinned by three important principles, equity, quality of service and accountability and is accompanied by a four year action plan which sets out specific targets for each of the main health sectors.</P>
      <P>It is not yet possible to give percentages relating to the extent of implementation as many of the targets are to be achieved over a four year period. However, all areas identified in the strategy have been the subject of substantial preparation and achievement since it was launched in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="874" /> A number of initiatives have taken place in order to achieve the targets set out in the four year plan.  These include:</P>
    <P>&mdash;a detailed health promotion strategy which will be launched in the immediate future,</P>
    <P>&mdash;a discussion document on women's health which has just been published and which analyses the health of Irish women and suggests priorities for improvement,</P>
    <P>&mdash;drafting of new sets of regulations required to give full effect to the remaining provisions of the Child Care Act by the end of 1996,</P>
    <P>&mdash;preparation of new foster care regulations and new guidelines on standards in residential centres for children,</P>
    <P>&mdash;introduction of a new procedure for the notification of suspected cases of child abuse between health boards and gardaí,</P>
    <P>&mdash;preparation of amending legislation to improve the position of the natural fathers of non-material children in the adoption process in the light of the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of <i>Keegan-v-Ireland.</i></P>
    <P>&mdash;expansion of residential and day places for people with mental handicap,</P>
    <P>&mdash;expansion of day care, respite care, home care and residential care/independent living services for persons with physical handicap,</P>
    <P>&mdash;improved organisation of general practice, including infrastructural developments,</P>
    <P>&mdash;implementation of a dental health action plan launched in 1994 and which is being implemented over a four year period,</P>
    <P>&mdash;discussions with health boards on the future role of acute hospitals and the provision of appropriate links to primary care,</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="875" />&mdash;continuation of the waiting list initiative to bring waiting times down to a more acceptable level &mdash; £8 million has been provided for 1995.</P>
    <P>&mdash;improvements in the ambulance service where significant progress has been made in the replacement of the ambulance fleet.</P>
    <P>&mdash;introduction of comprehensive family planning services in each health board area,</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Under the dental treatment services scheme which was introduced by my Department on 1 November 1994 dental treatment will be extended to all adults with medical card eligibility on a phased basis.  In the initial phasing of the scheme persons aged 65 years and over have been identified as a priority group and additional resources have been made available to health boards to enable them to provide dental treatment, including denture treatment, for this group.  Emergency dental treatment for the relief of pain is available under the dental treatment services scheme to all medical card holders irrespective of age.  However, where their existing resources allow, health boards will continue to provide routine dental treatment to adults who have not yet reached 65 years.</P>
      <P>I propose to extend routine dental treatment under the scheme to an additional group of adult medical card holders before the end of this year.</P>
      <P>All health boards also operate a priority waiting list for dental treatment for medically compromised persons who are given priority irrespective of age on production of a letter from their general medical practitioner.</P>

    <P>It is Department of Health policy that, on medical grounds, the delivery of babies should take place in consultant-staffed maternity units.  This policy is in line with the recommendations of the Comhairle na nOspidéal report, Development of Hospital Maternity Services, which examined in detail the objectives of health care in relation to maternity services.  It is generally accepted that this policy has been responsible for the marked decrease in the level of maternal, perinatal and infant mortality.</P>
    <P>I am aware that regardless of departmental policy and professional advice some women will choose a domiciliary birth.  If there are no medical contraindications, appropriate provision must be made to cater for their needs.  How this may best be achieved is among the issues now being considered in the context of a working party report on the maternity and infant care scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The age-standardised death rate from cancer has increased slightly from 253 per 100,000 population for the period 1978-82 to 273 per 100,000 for the period 1988-92.</P>
      <P>The main types of cancer mortality recorded in 1992 were as follows: digestive organs, 32 per cent; lung, bronchus and trachea, 21 per cent; genito-urinary organs, 16 per cent; breast, 9 per cent.</P>
      <P>This small increase in cancer mortality is associated with a variety of risk factors.  Approximately one third of cancer deaths are caused by smoking and a similar proportion may be associated with diet.</P>
      <P>Lung cancer is the most common form of specific cancer in Ireland. However, recent data suggests a slight decline in mortality.  While a reduction in smoking prevalence among men is a major factor in this reduction, mortality is increasing among women due to cigarette smoking.</P>
      <P>Colorectal cancer is the second most common cancer in this country and the risk of this cancer may be reduced by following a prudent diet.</P>
      <P>Breast cancer mortality in women has risen slightly in recent years.  This year I am making funding available to facilitate the phased expansion of a breast cancer screening programme to women aged 50-64 years.  The expert committee on cervical screening services which was reconvened has reviewed all aspects of the cervical screening service.  I propose to reorganise this service and in doing so to take into account the recommendations made by the expert group.</P>
      <P>The medium-term target set in the health strategy is to reduce the death rate from cancer in the under-65 age group by 15 per cent in the next ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I became Minster for Health I set as a priority the development of services to combat cancer.  The Department is now working on a comprehensive cancer strategy which is concentrating on four main areas: prevention, including screening, treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care.  This <Col N="882" /> strategy is due for completion later on in the year.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Information in the format requested is not routinely collected in my Department, however, I can state that 403 vasectomies were performed in public hospitals in 1994.  This figure does not include those procedures which were carried out privately.</P>
      <P>The Medical Council guidelines on ethical conduct and behaviour and fitness to practice recommended that doctors make every effort to ensure that patients understand the nature and purpose of medical procedures.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 75 together.  A total of £8 million has been allocated to health agencies under the 1995 waiting list initiative.  A breakdown of the allocation is set out in the following tabular statement.</P>
      <P>Following the success of last year's waiting list initiative the Government has committed a further £8 million in 1995 to continue to reduce waiting times in a number of target specialities where waiting times are considered excessive. The initiative commenced in 1993 when the Government provided £20 million to address the problem.  A further £10 million was provided in 1994.</P>
      <P>In June 1993 when the first initiative commenced the total in-patient waiting list for all specialties was 40,130.  By 31 December 1994 this figure had been reduced to 23,835.  Since it commenced the initiative had reduced the overall in-patient waiting list figure by 16,295 or 40 per cent over a period of 18 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Approximately 700,000 people are treated each year in acute public hospitals throughout the country.  The total in-patient waiting list figure at end <Col N="891" /> of 1994, therefore, represents approximately 3 per cent of the annual throughput of the acute hospital sector.</P>
    <P>The main aim of the initiative remains the elimination of in-patient waiting lists in excess of 12 months for adults and six months for children in the problem specialties and a target of 10,294 additional procedures has been set for 1995.  In addition, the 1995 initiative will also target out-patient waiting lists, where waiting times are excessive and here an additional 6,728 persons at present awaiting an out-patient appointment will be seen.</P>
    <P>This year's in-patient initiative will involve additional work in the following specialties:</P>

    <P>The procedures to be performed under the initiative are in addition to the level of baseline activity to be carried out in each agency, within their approved current expenditure allocation. This is fundamental to the success of the initiative and as was the case in previous years, activity, both additional and baseline will be continually monitored to ensure that targets are being achieved.</P>
    <P>This year's waiting list initiative will also focus on out-patient appointments where waiting times are excessive.  A total of 6,728 additional out-patient appointments will be issued under this element of the 1995 initiative.  The out-patient initiative will in the main cover the same specialities as the in-patient initiative as well as a number of other <Col N="892" /> priority areas which have been identified during this year's discussions with health agencies.  The extension of the initiative to out-patient activity has taken place as waiting times for in-patient treatment have been reduced and is in line with the principle underpinning the initiative that those agencies which have been successful in reducing waiting times for in-patient treatment should continue to benefit from the funding available for the reduction of waiting times in the out-patients area.</P>
    <P>As with the in-patient initiative this out-patient activity is in addition to the level of baseline out-patient activity and where agreed targets are not achieved funding will be clawed back.</P>
    <P>My Department has no proposals at present to send public patients abroad or to private institutions in this country as part of the 1995 waiting list initiative.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): My Department made arrangements in 1994 for the establishment of a software accreditation scheme as a means of ensuring that general practice software being sold in Ireland would perform in accordance with minimum standards which were agreed with the Irish College of General Practitioners. GPs have been advised that they should ensure that software being purchased has been accredited by the scheme which is operated by the centre for software engineering at Dublin City University.</P>
      <P>Resources have been earmarked from the General Practice Development Fund and the Indicative Drug Target Scheme for the implementation of an information technology programme within general practice.</P>
      <P>Health boards have reported that considerable progress is being made with many new systems installed and that significant numbers of GPs have expressed interest in acquiring computer systems.  Investment in this area will continue to be given priority in the next few years with a view to achieving the target set out in the strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Within the closing months of the term of office of the Sixth Comhairle, a request was received from the North Eastern Health Board to undertake a comprehensive review of consultant manpower in the area.  In April 1992, a Comhairle committee commenced activity on this task.  During the latter half of 1992 and early 1993, extensive consultations took place between representatives of the committee and the consultants based in each of the acute hospitals in the north-east.</P>
      <P>In September 1993, the North Eastern Health Board adopted a policy statement entitled &ldquo;A New Direction for Acute Hospital Services&rdquo; which guaranteed that each of the five hospitals &mdash; Cavan, Monaghan, Dundalk, Drogheda (a public voluntary hospital) and Navan &mdash; would have an active role in the delivery of a comprehensive acute hospital service for the region.  This involved a corporate and regional approach to the delivery of services including the grouping of hospitals and the setting up of joint departments within each group.  The following month, the Comhairle was notified by the North Eastern Health Board that they had decided on two groupings of hospitals &mdash; (i) Cavan and Monaghan and (ii) Dundalk, Drogheda and Navan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="895" /> In view of the high degree of uniformity between the health board's proposals and the thinking of the Comhairle committee, it was decided that the work of the committee should not be progressed further.  The Comhairle expressed its support and admiration for the considerable advances made by the health board and its management team in dealing with its problems.</P>
    <P>In February 1994 ten consultant posts for the Cavan-Monaghan Hospital Group were approved by my Department and subsequently cleared by the Comhairle in November 1994.  These posts are now in the process of being filled.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Louth-Meath Hospital Group, six consultant posts were approved by my Department in February 1995 and all of these posts were approved by the Comhairle at their meeting on 28 June 1995.</P>

Before a patient is referred abroad, certain procedures must be complied with, including the certification by his-her medical consultant that (i) the treatment concerned is not available in this country; (ii) there is an urgent medical necessity for the treatment; and (iii) there is a reasonable medical prognosis.</P>

    <P>Detailed information on the individual costs involved is not available as in many instances the invoices have yet to be submitted to the health boards.</P>
    <P>The majority of referrals abroad relate to specialised treatment such as bone marrow transplants, heart-lung transplants and liver transplants and are necessary due to the unavailability of the service or the shortfall in facilities for such operations in this country. However, the recent upgrading in services, including the bone marrow transplant unit at Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin and the new oncology-haematology-bone marrow transplant unit at St. James's Hospital should allow most of the future bone marrow transplantation cases to be treated in this country.</P>
    <P>In relation to liver transplantations for adults, the National Centre for Adults at St. Vincent's Hospital has achieved a high success rate since its establishment in 1993.  A working group chaired by the Department and comprising representatives from Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin and St. Vincent's Hospital, Elm Park is currently examining the feasibility of developing a liver transplantation programme for children.</P>
    <P>Developments such as these will allow Irish patients to avoid the disruptions associated with travelling abroad for treatment.  However, it should be <Col N="897" /> recognised that because of the high cost of some techniques and limited resources it will not be possible to make all highly sophisticated surgical procedures available in this country.  It will, therefore, continue to be necessary to refer patients abroad for certain procedures. The position regarding referral abroad for treatment is kept under continuous review by my Department and specialist developments will continue to be made as resources permit.</P>

      <P>The introduction of the leaving certificate applied has been deferred rather than cancelled.</P>
      <P>My intention of revising the structure and content of the senior cycle from September 1995 in the following manner had been conveyed to school authorities through circular letters earlier this year:</P>
      <P>(i)  revised leaving certificate syllabuses, at higher, ordinary and foundation levels, for certain subjects;</P>
      <P>(ii)  the introduction of the leaving certificate applied for a selected number of schools;</P>
      <P>(iii)  the admission of additional schools to the pilot phase of the restructured leaving certificate vocational programme.</P>
      <P>As a result of action taken by the Association of Secondary Teachers, Ireland and the Teachers Union of Ireland, it has not been possible to provide for the inservice education of teachers necessary for the successful introduction of the programmes. Accordingly, it was with regret that I decided to postpone the introduction of the above changes.  I informed the Education Partners and the schools by circular on 31 May 1995 which was in advance of the commencement of the certificate examinations.  Additionally, I made a statement in the Seanad to this effect on 31 May 1995.</P>
      <P>The level of inservice envisaged was to hold a two day introductory inservice course for programme co-ordinators and two other teachers from each school approved to deliver the programme. This would be supplemented by a further programme of ongoing inservice to cater for the needs of the participants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of 132 schools has applied to <Col N="908" /> participate in the first developmental phase of the Leaving Certificate Applied in the 1995-96 school year and 85 of those had been selected for the programme.  The 85 schools selected had proposed to offer the programme to a total of approximately 2,000 pupils.  My Department has no information on the number of pupils who transferred to schools for the purpose of taking the leaving certificate applied nor has it received any complaints of this nature.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I have decided that schools that offered the Senior Certificate Programme or the Vocational Preparation and Training Programme 1 (VPT-1) may continue to offer these programmes pending the introduction of the leaving certificate applied.  This decision has been brought to the attention of the schools which were selected for the leaving certificate applied.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>the wage level at which the reduced PRSI level applies; the manner of its application, whether in a weekly or cumulative basis; the similarities or differences with income tax collection; and specifically how a worker on £170 per week wage but receiving quarterly bonus payments of £250 will be assessed.</Quest>
      <QRef>[12125/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa) Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>Pay-related social insurance contributions are payable on a shared basis between employers and employees.  Arrangements were made in this year's budget and implemented with effect from 6 April 1995, to reduce the overall burden of PRSI for both employers and employees, particularly in labour-intensive industries involving low or moderate wage levels.</P>
      <P>In the case of employers, PRSI at the reduced rate of 9 per cent is payable where the employee's earnings fall between £30 and £231 per week, increasing to 12.2 per cent for any week in which wages above £231 are paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="911" /> This year, the Government also introduced a new PRSI-free allowance of £50 per week for employees paying PRSI at the Class A rate.  A lower allowance of £10 a week applies to workers insurable at the modified rate of PRSI and self-employed people insurable at Class S.</P>
    <P>Employees earning £60 or less per week do not pay PRSI.  Employees earning more than £60 per week liable for PRSI at 5.5 per cent.  An additional 2.25 per cent, comprising health contribution and employment and training levy, is due for any week where the total earnings exceed £178.</P>
    <P>The thresholds are applied on a weekly non-cumulative basis.  Therefore, liability for PRSI and levies can differ for any week where additional reckonable amounts are payable.  A total of 7.75 per cent, which includes the 2.25 per cent levies, is due for any week in which the reckonable income, including any additional payments, exceeds the £178 threshold.  For example, an employee normally earning below £178 per week but entitled to a quarterly bonus of £250 would be liable for the levies for each of the four payment weeks in which the bonus payments are made.</P>
    <P>Similarly, employers are liable for the full 12.2 per cent PRSI rate for any week in which additional or bonus payments increase the total earnings of an employee to above the £231 threshold.</P>
    <P>PRSI and PAYE operate independently of each other.  Under the PAYE system, an employee will normally be entitled to tax-free allowances, including a personal allowance of £3,440 per annum at the single rate or £5,940 for a married couple with one earner. Additional allowances and reliefs may be due in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>Income tax at a rate of 27 per cent, calculated on an annual cumulative basis, is payable on the first £8,900 &mdash; £17,800 for a married couple &mdash; of earnings in excess of the tax-free allowances and a tax rate of 48 per cent applies thereafter.</P>

      <P>An occupational pension scheme is a voluntary arrangement organised by an employer to provide pensions and/or other benefits to one or more employees on retirement or to their surviving dependants on death.</P>
      <P>There is no legal requirement on employers to provide pension benefits for employees under an occupational pension scheme.  Many defined benefit pension schemes are integrated with the old age contributory pension where allowance is made for the basic social insurance pension payable to a fully qualified single contributor.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1994 extended the categories of clients eligible to receive six weeks payment after death.  The further extension to all social welfare recipients would have financial implications and could be considered only in a budgetary context.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is currently in receipt of a retirement pension at the weekly rate of £72.80.  Disability benefit is not payable in conjunction with retirement pension.  The most financially beneficial option for this person would be to revert to a survivor's pension at the weekly rate of £66.10 and disability benefit at the weekly rate of £14.05 which would be a total payment of £80.15.  I have arranged for this to be done.  All arrears will be paid as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The free schemes administered by my Department include free travel, free electricity allowance free natural gas allowance, free telephone rental allowance and free television <Col N="914" /> licence.  Free travel is available to all persons in the State aged 66 years and over and to certain disabled people under age 66.  The other free schemes are available to persons in receipt of a welfare type pension and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy the living alone conditions.</P>
      <P>The position regarding entitlement to the free schemes in the case of couples where the qualified spouse dies is that the surviving spouse can qualify in his/her own right at age 60 provided the other conditions of the schemes are met. In the specific case mentioned, the late husband was not awarded the free electricity allowance or the free telephone rental allowance at any stage.  Consequently, his widow, who is 63 years old, does not qualify for the schemes in question.  However, she will qualify in her own right on reaching 66 years of age.</P>
      <P>Information as to the number of people in circumstances such as this is not available.  The estimated cost of the free schemes this year will be in excess of £90 million.  Further extensions to those schemes will be considered in the light of perceived need and the availability of additional financial resources.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the first Operational Programme for Tourism, 1989-1993 as this was the programme under which visitor centres were approved for funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally, progress on the implementation of that programme was overseen by a National Monitoring Committee chaired by the Department of Tourism and Trade &mdash; formerly, by the Department of Tourism and Transport &mdash; and <Col N="915" /> including representatives of Bord Fáilte, SFADCo, the Office of Public Works, the tourism industry, the trade unions, the EU Commission and the Departments of the Environment, Labour, Finance and the Taoiseach.  The role of this committee was to seek to ensure full consistency as between programme activity and key strategic objectives.</P>
    <P>To assist it in this work the monitoring committee was advised by a co-ordinating committee whose functions were (a) to advise on all technical matters, (b) to ensure maximum integration of measures and (c) to ensure standard application of assessment procedures by the implementing agencies for all project applications for funding.</P>
    <P>As to the question of direct administrative responsibility for advancing the development of the visitor centres, while the Department of Tourism and Trade was the national authority in charge of the overall management of the operational programme, the Office of Public Works was the statutory body charged with, <i>inter alia,</i> maintaining and managing national and historic monuments and parks.  In this capacity it was responsible also for the administration and implementation of all programme activity falling within its realm of responsibility, including visitor centres.</P>
    <P>Recent developments in relation to the centres are the responsibility of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, whose Department now exercises responsibility for the formulation of national policy in relation to, <i>inter alia,</i> national and historic monuments and parks.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109, 110, 111, 112 and 113 together.  I made my position clear in this matter in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 36 of 21 June 1995.</P>
      <P>It is not correct that Aer Rianta has a monopoly over all commercial development in and around Dublin Airport. It is not my policy nor that of Aer Rianta to restrict private sector development in the environs of the three State Airports.  There are at present ten Industrial Parks around the perimeter of Dublin Airport and a number of private sector developments within the Airport itself.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta has one BIOCYCLE system at Dublin Airport and proposes to instal a second system.  I am informed that these two systems are located at remote sites and are for the use of a small number of Aer Rianta staff.  The planning permission given by Fingal County Council provided for the installation of seven BIOCYCLE systems on a site of about twelve acres, in a commercial use context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Rianta, as my agent, did not object to the Cargobridge proposal <i>per se</i> but to specific technical conditions imposed by the planning authority in their planning approval.  As I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Question <Col N="921" /> No. 36 of 21 June 1995, An Bord Pleanála has the technical expertise and, in my opinion, is the best forum to adjudicate in the matter.  I assume that the promoters of the project have made their views on the technical aspects of the case referred to in the Deputy's questions known to An Bord Pleanála. My decision to await the outcome of An Bord Pleanála's deliberations in the matter stands.  I should add that neither I nor my Department have made any representations to An Bord Pleanála regarding the planning appeals referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>In view of the commercial sensitivity of the information requested, it would not be appropriate for me to give details in relation to efficiency levels for each of the various generating stations currently operated by ESB.</P>
      <P>However in overall terms, the estimated thermal efficiency for fuels used in 1994 in the production of electricity is as follows:</P>

      <P>The proposed peat-fired generating station to be located in the East Midlands will be designed to provide 120 MW of generating capacity.  Studies undertaken on behalf of Bord na Móna show that the station would have: &mdash; a capital cost, including contingency of £90 million (1993 prices) &mdash; annual operating costs of £5.5 million (1993 prices) &mdash; consume 1 million tonnes of peat per annum &mdash; employ 64 on a permanent basis and 20 to 25 on a contract basis &mdash; support 250 permanent and 250 seasonal jobs in peat extraction &mdash; employ 450 at peak during construction &mdash; a direct income impact of £19 million during construction and £8 million per annum during operations.</P>
      <P>The latest &ldquo;state of the art&rdquo; technology will be used in the operation of the new station.  The net conversion efficiency envisaged is 36.7 per cent compared to around 25 per cent in the existing older peat fired stations.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications will be asking the Government in the near future for approval of the necessary arrangements for a competition on the open market for the construction, ownership and operation of the new peat-fired electricity generating station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A memorandum of understanding with the EU Commissioner for Regional Policy, signed on 12 April 1995, sets out the basis for the provision of EU Structural Fund assistance of £21 million towards the new peat station for the East Midlands.  The balance of the <Col N="925" /> funds required will be a matter for the successful bidder.</P>
    <P>Studies undertaken on behalf of Bord na Móna, in 1993, calculated that, at £13 per/tonne, peat yields a price of 1.69 £/Gj, and the studies also gave the following cost comparisons with other fuels:</P>

    <P>With the EU grant of £21 million, the Bord na Móna studies calculated that the new station will be able to supply electricity at a tariff of 3.67 p/unit.  This compares with a tariff of approximately 3.1 stg/unit from a &ldquo;stand alone&rdquo; gas fired power station of 225 MW constructed in the UK and to a figure ranging from 4.3p to 8p from other ESB peat burning stations.</P>
    <P>The socio-economic cost benefit analysis completed by an international firm of consultants put the additional cost of generating electricity from the new peat-fired station, over the life of the station, at £24.5 million above the best alternative (i.e. use of gas).  This is outweighed, however, by the wider socio-economic benefits, estimated at £36.1 million, leaving a net overall benefit of £11.6 million to the Irish economy.</P>
