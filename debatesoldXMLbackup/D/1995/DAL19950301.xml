    <Title>Adoptive Leave Bill, 1993   [Seanad]:  Committee Stage.</Title>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 is simple but <Col N="1990" /> important.  The first subsection states that this Act may be cited as the Adoptive Leave Act.  However, the second subsection provides that it shall come into operation on such day as the Minister shall by order appoint.  It is important that we give consideration to the commencement date.  It must be seen in the context of another Bill from the Department of Social Welfare for which we have been waiting for at least two years.  In 1993 we were prepared to introduce a scheme to provide for adoptive leave benefit which must be provided by the Department of Social Welfare in parallel with the measures in this Bill.  The Bill from the Department of Social Welfare must be published by the end of this week as it must be brought into operation before 6 April.  There are good reasons why this must be so. Changes in PRSI have to be implemented by that date.  There is, therefore, a fairly short time scale for the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
      <P>It is important that this measure, which is a very simple and inexpensive one, should be implemented in parallel with the Social Welfare Bill and that both should operate from 6 April.  There is no reason why this cannot be done as the cost in a full year is negligible.  The Estimate is about £200,000 and, in practice, the cost will probably be less than that.  In the context of a budget of £4 billion in the Department of Social Welfare, this is hardly a matter of consequence.We should, therefore, not leave adopting parents without the cover which would be provided by the Adoptive Leave Bill and by the parallel Social Welfare Bill.  On that basis I propose that the Minister should bring this Bill into operation by 6 April.  I expect the Minister would want to do this in any event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to have the measure brought in as quickly as possible.That has to be done in tandem with the social welfare legislation referred to by Deputy Woods.  The House can be assured that we will bring the measure <Col N="1991" /> into operation at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's sympathy, but I would like him to make a commitment on that date.  Perhaps he would cross check to see if it is possible to bring it in by that date. Otherwise I would consider putting down an amendment on Report Stage. These things are left too long.  I know it is not the Minister's fault because he has to deal with the Government, the Department of Finance, etc. in the background.</P>
      <P>We make our points honestly and openly in Dáil Éireann &mdash; there is transparency &mdash; and the Minister is willing and anxious to facilitate and to be helpful but someone in the background will probably say that for some reason this legislation will not be implemented by that date.  This is distressing and I would much prefer if the wishes of the House were respected.  Unless there are serious problems there should be a sense of urgency.  Is there any impediment which would prevent this legislation from being implemented from 6 April?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1993" /> In page 5, subsection (1), line 26, to delete &ldquo;a male employee&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;a man including an employed adopting father&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Bill &mdash; this is disturbing &mdash; discriminates against men and treats working mothers unfairly by excluding adoptive fathers from the scheme.  The Government, instead of eliminating inequality, is providing for it.  This is a simple measure which will allow a small number of people annually to take adoptive leave.  An estimated 500 adoptions take place each year.  Consequently &mdash; I am conscious that the Minister is anxious to ensure equality &mdash; it would be simple to provide for equal treatment.</P>
    <P>Under these amendments either the adoptive father or mother would be allowed to take the ten weeks' adoptive leave provided for in the Bill and to receive the accompanying social welfare benefits.  Alternatively they could decide to share it.  That is the proper way to approach the matter.  It is essential that both parents have an opportunity to bond with an adopted child.</P>
    <P>Unlike maternity, adoption is not a health matter.  Issues such as childbirth and breast feeding do not arise.  Both parents need to become familiar with the child.  As adoptive parents do not have physical ties with the child, unlike natural parents, it is important that they be allowed to take leave to bond with the child.  This is regarded by those involved in adoption services as extremely important not only for the mother but also for the father.  This becomes even more important when children with special needs are adopted.  Children with physical and mental disabilities need greater support and attention. Consequently, it is important that either the mother or father be allowed to take leave or, alternatively, to share it.</P>
    <P>Fathers now play a much more active role in adoption and parenting.  In today's society where, increasingly, both parents work parenting is a shared responsibility and it is right that either <Col N="1994" /> parent should be allowed to take adoptive leave.  The leave arrangements in the Bill are welcome.  Leave should be available on an equal basis depending on the choice of the adopting father and mother.</P>
    <P>The total cost of this provision is insignificant in terms of the social welfare budget and the number of people affected is small.  It is clear, however, that the Government could face a legal challenge if it does not provide for equal treatment in this scheme.  Regardless of whether there may be a legal challenge, it is wrong to return to old practices.</P>
    <P>The beneficial scheme provides an opportunity to put into practice some of the points that have been made on both sides of the House.  If we do not do that those who listen to what we say about equal treatment are bound to ask whether we are being honest in what we are doing or merely hypocritical.  This is a simple Bill in which equal treatment can be applied.</P>
    <P>A number of the other amendments relate to this amendment but do not have any adverse effect on the costs involved.  They will be beneficial for men and women and would meet the needs of people by making suitable provision for equal treatment in the case of adoptive leave.  That is essentially the purpose of this amendment about which I feel strongly.  I understand there are faceless people who are not present and who might have a different view on this. I am sure the Minister would want equal treatment for all but I must say what I believe to be right.  The Minister should accept this amendment, and the consequential amendments, and provide equal treatment to adopting parents through this scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Woods said I may have some faceless people behind me on this issue.  One section of faceless people behind me on it was the Cabinet of which the Deputy and I were members and who approved this measure.  The Bill passed all Stages in the Seanad with the support of the Government parties of the day, namely, Fianna Fáil and <Col N="1995" /> Labour.  It is a little surprising, therefore, that Deputy Woods has tabled 50 amendments to change the entire focus of the Bill when he was a member of the Government which approved this measure.  I realise that a Deputy in Opposition is free to take a somewhat utopian stand on many issues but Deputy Woods has lost sight of the nature of the proposal before the House.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to extend to adopting mothers at the time of placement of a child leave arrangements in line with those available to a natural mother at the time of the birth.  It is straightforward legislation to remedy a serious anomaly in the way we treat working adopting mothers.  My concern in this Bill, as it was in the recently enacted Maternity Protection Act, 1994, is the provision of maternity leave for mothers.  Both pieces of legislation, however, make provision for similar leave for men in certain exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods's arguments in favour of extending the leave to all adopting fathers are interesting but I cannot regard them as valid in the context of the present proposal.  The arguments may well be relevant in regard to parental leave but a proposal for parental leave is not before the House today. Parental leave is a separate issue and is one to which I am well disposed.  As a matter of policy, however, I cannot agree to granting parental leave to adopting fathers in isolation from an evaluation of the merits of the proposal generally for working parents whether adopting or natural parents.  Accordingly, with regret, I must reject Deputy Woods's amendments on this issue.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for outlining his position.  The Minister referred to the previous Cabinet.  I cannot say exactly what I said at Cabinet meetings on this issue but the Minister should not be surprised about my position because reports will verify that I made similar points in regard to the Bill on previous occasions.  I am therefore, <Col N="1996" /> being entirely consistent but I am now Opposition spokesman on Equality and Law Reform and it is my duty to make points in the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on an issue about which I feel strongly.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to a utopian stand.  That suggests that the proposition is lavish, extensive and part of a utopian world.  It is not; it is a simple and inexpensive measure.  The Minister did not reply to my point about a potential legal challenge to a benefit scheme. He will recollect that a series of decisions between 1984 and 1986 &mdash; I was not a member of Government at that time &mdash; on equal treatment for women raised a large number of legal issues which were resolved only recently.  Those decisions resulted in enormous expense for the Government. It would have been better if the Government of the day, which included the two major parties now in Government, Fine Gael and Labour, had implemented equal treatment for women in social welfare matters at that time.  When equal treatment was finally granted in 1986 retrospective payments should have been made at that time.</P>
      <P>The legal cases which arose from that continued up to the time of the decisions taken in this House in 1992. There were further challenges and the written formal judgment on the matter was issued in the past ten days.  The Minister is aware that the estimates of the cost of that run to £240 million.  If the decision had been taken to implement equal treatment when the Bill was first brought in the matter would not have been challenged in the European Court and the cost would have been minimal by comparison with the approximate cost at this stage of £240 million.  Fewer are involved in adoptive leave and I really believe the Government should not at this stage go ahead with unequal treatment of men and women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1997" /> The Minister said the purpose of the Bill was to extend the leave arrangements essentially to adopting mothers and in certain circumstances to adopting fathers.  Adopting fathers are recognised in certain exceptional circumstances in the Bill but why not go the whole way and recognise the rights of men on an equal basis?  This is the age of equality. The Minister is responsible for equality and law reform and I believe men and women should be treated on an equal basis.  The Minister has obviously been advised that this may have implications for parental leave.  That is the kernel of the issue but it has nothing to do with the Adoptive Leave Bill.  I am quite certain the Minister wants to go ahead with adoptive leave on an equal treatment basis but the Government will not back that.  Why?  Not because of the cost of adoptive leave, nor that it does not want equal treatment of men and women but because someone has suggested that in some way this can be compared to parental leave.  The Government is very reluctant to address that issue or acknowledge that in this age most younger men and women are working. It should be addressing the issue of parental leave from the long term point of view and making out a programme to deal with it even if it has to be done on a step by step basis.  Parental leave has very little to do with adoptive leave which, as the Minister said, replaces maternity leave for those who are adopting.  It is for a very specific period.</P>
    <P>I believe parental leave is a separate issue and must be addressed separately. What is at issue in this case is the extension of arrangements under the maternity leave scheme to those who are adopting children and it is specific to that purpose.  The Minister should go ahead with equal treatment, with the other issues being addressed in due course.  I ask him to consider so doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of parental leave is being considered in detail in my Department and the Government will consider it in due course.  The purpose of the Bill before the House is limited. <Col N="1998" /> It seeks to remedy an unfair anomaly in our laws in the way in which we treat working adopting mothers compared with the way the law treats natural mothers.  The purpose of the Bill is to bring about parity between adopting mothers and natural mothers.  The question of parental leave which, of course, would apply to both natural and adopting mothers is a separate, very important and worthwhile issue with implications in a number of areas.  I can assure Deputy Woods that the matter is being considered both in the Department and at EU level and I would like to see progress being made on that in due course.</P>
      <P>As we are considering the group of 50 amendments, I should perhaps address the other issues raised in those amendments.</P>

      <P>Deputy Woods has proposed 20 amendments that would insert both the masculine and feminine personal pronouns and possessive adjectives in the legislation wherever only the feminine form occurs in the Bill as published.The approach proposed by the Deputy is a departure from the normal practice in this House and from legal correctness.  Normally only one personal pronoun or possessive adjective, either masculine or feminine, is used because the interpretation of each such adjective or pronoun is informed by the Interpretation Acts, 1937 and 1993.  The 1937 Act requires that words importing the masculine gender shall be construed as if they imported the femine gender, unless the context requires otherwise. The Interpretation Act, 1993, legislated for a similar interpretation of words importing the feminine gender.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1993 Act was widely regarded as a significant step towards more equal language in legislation.  The legislation gave practical effect to a recommendation of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  In the light of the 1993 Interpretation Act, Deputy <Col N="1999" /> Woods's amendments are quite unnecessary as under that Act the valid legal construction of &ldquo;her&rdquo; and &ldquo;she&rdquo; embraces also &ldquo;his&rdquo; and &ldquo;he&rdquo;.  Accordingly the text of the Bill as published refers appropriately to both male and female adopting parents even in the wider context envisaged in the Deputy's amendments.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also put forward quite a number of amendments which would seek to insert in the Bill a right to leave for a sole female adopter.  The Bill as drafted already gives a right to adoptive leave to every adopting mother, whether she is adopting with or without a partner.  Accordingly, the Deputy's amendments in this regard are quite unnecessary as the objective he seeks through these amendments is already achieved in the Bill as drafted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the substantive issue and leave aside the question of pronouns and adjectives for the moment.  The Minister has said that the Government will consider parental leave in due course and that this Bill is a measure relating to adopting mothers. The Bill should address the needs of mothers and fathers who are adopting a child.  It is not a health matter, it is different from maternity.  It is not just a simple question of the needs of the father as well as the mother but the needs of the mother if she is working as she may wish to share the time with her husband for very valid reasons relating to her work.  It is a potential benefit to the mother as well.  Our amendments are designed to meet that need.  In the case of adopting parents the needs of the father and the mother in many cases can be equal and, consequently, they should have the opportunity of being treated in an equal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of amendments which the Chair says should be taken together make it difficult to follow.  Amendment No. 1 is the major issue and I intend to call a vote on it as it is fundamental to the Bill.  Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 are consequential and amendment No. 4 <Col N="2000" /> introduces the sole female adopter explicitly.  The Minister said he considers the sole female adopter is adequately covered by virtue of the fact that every adopting female parent is covered.  If the Minister can assure me about that I would be happy to withdraw the amendment.  There is provision for a sole male adopter but not explicitly for a sole female adopter.  The female could adopt a niece or nephew in the event of a tragic car crash or a child of the family generally.  Amendment No. 6 is related to that and amendment No. 5 is consequential on amendment No. 1.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 13 seeks to delete section 6 and insert a new section. Section 6 as it stands gives ten week's adoptive leave to the employed adopting mother or the sole male adopter. Our new section gives ten weeks to an employed mother, an employed adopting father, a sole male or a sole female adopter.  Subsection (2) limits the adoptive leave to ten weeks between the father and the mother.  We are saying that the ten weeks' adoptive leave should be available for either the mother or the father or the sole male or the sole female.  Acceptance of the amendment would involve deletion of section 6 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 14 to 25 are consequential and the Minister referred to them in his comments.  I am trying to ensure gender balance and I accept what the Minister said about the amendments.Amendment No. 26 is consequential and is to cover the situation where both adopting parents share leave.  The employers must be informed and it also covers the sole male and sole female adopter.  We could have a difference of opinion on that.  The Minister would presumably claim that the sole female adopter is covered already.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 27 to 32 are consequential and deal with the question of gender balance.  In amendment No. 33 we include the employed adopting father and the sole female adopter for the extra four weeks' leave.  Amendment No. 34 relates to gender balance. <Col N="2001" /> Where the father and mother take additional leave amendment No. 35 seeks to ensure that they cannot have more than four weeks between them.  It states:</P>
    <P>In page 9, subsection (1), line 46, after &ldquo;leave&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;provided that the total amount of time taken by either or both adoptive parents as additional adoptive leave shall not exceed 4 weeks, or such other period as the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister for Finance, by order prescribe.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 36 is in the interests of gender balance and states:</P>
    <P>In page 10, subsection (2), line 1, after &ldquo;mother&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, employed adoptive father and sole female adopter&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is Fianna Fáil front bench approval for the line I am taking.  This is the approach in terms of equal treatment in the Adoptive Leave Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position now. The Minister will have to move with the times.  He will be surprised to find that people keep addressing new problems. He was in the other House for a good while with this Bill, he may have become a little detached from what is happening.  Amendments Nos. 38, 39, 40 and 42 to 48, inclusive, are similar to some of the earlier gender balance amendments.  Amendment No. 49 proposes to delete the three sections. Amendment No. 50 makes provision for the father to get leave where the mother dies and our amendments provide that either the father or the mother can take up the remainder of the leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 9 deals with the ten week period, section 10 deals with the four additional weeks and section 11 deals with the foreign adoptions.  Where the additional leave is before the date of <Col N="2002" /> placement in the case of the foreign adoptions, either parent can take it up. Our amendments provide the notifications and the other consequential changes, so essentially this is to provide that either the father or the mother can take up the remainder of the additional leave.  Amendment No. 52 which I will not press is similar to earlier amendments on gender balance as is Amendment No. 53.  Amendment No. 54 relates to an employed adopting father or a sole female adopter and its purpose is to ensure that the sole female adopter is included.  The Minister has given assurances that that is the case.  Amendments Nos. 59 and 60, also relate to gender balance.</P>
    <P>We will have an opportunity to speak on the sections, but the substantive issue comes up on amendment No. 1, that is the question of providing equal treatment for the father and the mother.  Will the Minister think hard about this, consider what he is doing and the desirability of providing for equality in this Bill and in the accompanying social welfare legislation.  Equality in the social welfare scheme was to be in the Bill in 1993 and 1994 but had to await the passage of this Bill through the Houses so presumably it will be in the Bill in 1995. I assure the Minister that I want to facilitate him in getting this Bill through the House quickly.  I do not want to see it delayed, but if he wishes to reconsider the position on equal treatment I will be very happy to facilitate him in that as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure Deputy Woods that the sole female adopter is provided for in the Bill as it stands.  That is the advice I have and I am satisfied that is the position.  I am also well satisfied that the gender descriptions, having regard to the Interpretation (Amendment) Act, 1993, are adequately covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of equality and inequality, this Bill is an equal treatment measure, because it provides equal treatment for adopting mothers as compared with the position of natural mothers.  If one widened this Bill to <Col N="2003" /> extend the leave facility to adopting fathers, an inequality would have been introduced; it would immediately introduce an inequality between adopting fathers and natural fathers.</P>
    <P>The present position is that natural fathers do not have the leave entitlements under the maternity protection legislation, so a new inequality would be introduced there which would not be acceptable.  That is what I meant when I said earlier that the question of parental leave is the next stop and that would involve leave arrangements for both adopting and natural fathers.  As I said <Col N="2004" /> before that is a proposal with which I have great sympathy.  The matter is being examined within my Department and at European Union level and I hope progress will be made on that in due course.  I cannot really put the matter any further, we have debated it adequately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that I cannot agree with the Minister.  It is a simple measure.  We should have equal treatment in this measure and I will press amendment No. 1.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 3 deals with orders and regulations.  I note that the Minister has included fairly stringent procedures in subsections (3), (4) and (5).  For instance, subsection (3) states: &ldquo;Where an order is proposed to be made under this Act, a draft of the order shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Subsection (4) states: &ldquo;Before making an order or regulation under the Act the Minister shall consult such organisations [that is fairly straightforward] or other bodies of persons representative of employers and such organisations or other bodies of persons representative of trades unions or bodies analogous to trades unions as the Minister considers appropriate&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reality that just leaves it to the <Col N="2007" /> Minister as he considers appropriate. That is a consultative process.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) requires a resolution of each House approving the draft.  Subsection (6) states: &ldquo;Every regulation made under this Act shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as practicable after it is made and, if a resolution annulling the regulation is passed by either such House within the next 21 days on which the House has sat after the regulation is laid before it, the regulation shall be annulled accordingly, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under the regulation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Why has the Minister included these provisions?  Does he not trust himself or does somebody not trust him?  He is putting in a procedure which, in subsection (3), requires that where an order is proposed to be made under this Act, a draft will be laid before the House and the order shall not be made until a positive resolution is made.</P>
    <P>Without doubt, the Minister has some good reasons for doing this.  However, many regulations, resolutions and orders are dealt with by exemption in the sense that they are laid on the table and, if there is no objection within 21 days, they are deemed to be approved. This is a positive provision as it states that, when dealing with orders and regulations under this Act, a resolution must be passed.  Will the Minister explain why he is adopting that approach?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (3) refers to orders, whereas subsection (6) refers to regulations.  The nature of the items contemplated by each are different.  The nature of an order would be more crucial to a term of the Bill than a regulation.For example, altering the period of ten weeks or four weeks would require an order as that goes to the root of the Bill.  It would be appropriate to have a positive resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas before that comes into play.  A regulation would deal with more ancillary matters and it <Col N="2008" /> would be more appropriate to have the negative procedure under which the regulation is laid and which would come into effect unless annulled by a resolution of either House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his explanation.  I understand the difference between regulations in subsection (6) and orders in subsection (3).  The regulations in subsection (6) can be laid before the House and if a negative resolution is not passed they will come into operation.  The Minister must allow sufficient flexibility in the Bill for developments, without the necessity to move a motion.  I have no objection to the Minister's point.  People often insist on such an arrangement, although it creates a barrier even if people want to implement the beneficial elements.  This means one must find a suitable time for the House to meet in order to get agreement.This does not apply in many other areas.  Improvements, such as extensions of a certain period or equal treatment, can be made.  I appreciate the point made by the Minister, and I have no objection to it, but I wonder why it was set so tightly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government takes the view that it should be transparent about these matters.  If an important change is contemplated, such as altering the period for leave, an opportunity will be given to both Houses to debate that issue, if Members feel it is appropriate. This is important because it suggests a change in the law.  As a result, it would be appropriate for the Houses to vote positively for that change which should be transparent.  That is the Government's view and is the reason it appears in the format before the House.</P>

      <P>The Government can be transparent without being administratively tied in.  This legislation is upfront, especially when an extra benefit is being given.  Most people agree with improvements in benefits, although some employers might not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2009" /> This is unusual because we are arguing the opposite viewpoint.  The Opposition usually argues for restrictions to be put on a Minister, but, because of my experience, I am arguing for the opposite.  The Minister should have the flexibility to be efficient, effective and administratively expedient in his work and we would like to facilitate him in this regard.  Transparency is a separate question.  It is easy to be transparent if one wants, especially when the media is always present.  I would not confuse the two issues.  It is a question of efficiency and getting things done without being tied up for too long.  I made the argument for the Minister and he made mine.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>(1)  In this section &ldquo;agreement&rdquo; means an agreement, whether a contract of employment or not, and whether made before or after the commencement of this Act.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 12 is the substantive amendment in this group.  Amendments Nos. 7 to 11, inclusive, are related; they are technical amendments.  I will outline the purpose of the substantive amendment, amendment No. 12, and then describe briefly the related technical amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 12, which is the substantive amendment in this group of amendments, replaces section 4 (3) of <Col N="2010" /> the Bill with two new subsections.  The new subsection (3) is similar to, but broader in scope, than the subsection it replaces and it is a fairly common provision in labour legislation.  It makes clear that a contract of employment or a collective agreement may provide arrangements which are more beneficial to an employee than the minimum provisions in the Bill.  Examples of the more beneficial arrangements permitted by the provision would include 11 or more weeks adoptive leave instead of the ten weeks' statutory minimum or payment during the period of leave.  The new section 4 (4) ensures that an employer who gives more beneficial arrangements to an adopting parent will not be obliged to make similar provisions for employees who are not adopting parents.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the related technical amendments 7 to 11, inclusive, is as follows.Amendment No. 7 extracts a definitional element in the existing section 4 (1) and makes a new subsection (1), which deals only with the definition of &ldquo;agreement&rdquo;.  There is no change to definition of &ldquo;agreement&rdquo;. Amendments Nos. 8 and 9 are technical amendments to the existing section 4 (1) consequential on amendment No. 7. Amendment No. 9 deletes the definitional element in existing subsection (1) which is now contained in the new subsection (1).  Amendment No. 8 replaces the reference to &ldquo;any&rdquo; agreement in the existing text with a reference to &ldquo;an&rdquo; agreement so that it is clear the references are to an agreement of the kind defined in the new subsection.  Amendments Nos. 10 and 11 similarly amend the existing section 4 (2).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is amusing because we are making a provision for employers to make arrangements without the need to have them approved by the House.  The Minister does not trust himself to make a simple approach to the House.  This is desirable because it allows the employer to provide more leave if he or she so wishes.  We are in favour of this if it is appropriate.  One <Col N="2011" /> could ask if it is necessary to introduce legislation which states that one may provide more beneficial arrangements. but there is no point arguing about it. This is as a result of other labour law which was necessary at the time.  It is not about parental leave because it is not for the non-adopting parent; it addresses that issue for employers.</P>
      <P>Perhaps, on Report Stage, the Minister will introduce an amendment to use this in section 2 and give the male and female equal treatment and include a clause which states that it should not apply to anyone other than adopting people.  We accept these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides an additional four weeks' adoptive leave and two points should be considered for Report Stage.  While wanting to facilitate the Minister I regret that Report Stage is being taken immediately.  I would have been happier if there had been some consideration of the points <Col N="2018" /> made on Committee Stage before embarking on Report Stage, even if that were to be a matter of hours, a day or something of that nature.  In that sense, it is not good practice.</P>
      <P>Since the amendment I had tabled on section 6 was not agreed, a possible amendment should be considered to entitle an adoptive father to four weeks' unpaid leave, in any event, after the mother's ten weeks.  It does not really matter whether such leave is paid or unpaid because the cost of payment is a joke in the sense of the schemes about which we are talking.  I have spoken to adoptive parents and ascertained that fathers would welcome a period of even four weeks' unpaid adoptive leave, relieving them from their normal working duties, enabling them to bond with the children, thus helping in the overall adoption process.</P>
      <P>The second point that comes to mind on this section is that whenever children have special needs, physical, mental, other incapacity or disability, the 14 weeks' leave should apply in all such cases in any event.  As we are all aware, the period of ordinary maternity leave is 14 weeks.  The argument can be advanced that, where there is no medical or health aspect to the leave, ten weeks is adequate, with an optional four weeks' unpaid leave thereafter, but there is every argument to be advanced in favour of having the 14 weeks leave applied in the case of children with special needs when, obviously, the adjustments, bonding and support needed will be all the greater.  The reality is that there will be no great cost involved, no burden would be imposed on the Exchequer or anybody else, to provide the full 14 weeks' adoptive leave in the case of parents adopting children with special needs.</P>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister consider such an amendment for Report Stage but it is my firm conviction that we should build in any worthwhile, necessary provision while discussing these issues.  I introduced the 14 weeks' maternity leave, it was 12 weeks at one point.</P>

      <P>If the Minister can see his way to extending the adoptive leave period to 14 weeks in the case of children with special needs I do not think anybody will beat his door down because the cost would be negligible and there are no real indirect precedents involved.</P>

      <P>Section 13 deals with a certificate of placement to be issued.</P>
      <P>Section 13 (3) states:</P>
      <P>The certificate of placement referred to in subsection (1) shall state the following&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) The date on which it is issued,</P>
      <P>(b) The day of placement,</P>
      <P>(c) The sex and date of birth of the child,</P>
      <P>(d) The name and address of the adopting parent or parents,</P>
      <P>and it shall be signed by a person authorised to issue it on behalf of the issuing authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2021" /> An issue has been raised about the certificate to be issued in the case where the natural mother becomes the adopting mother and the names of the adopting parents appear on the certificate.  I presume that the names of both parents will appear as adopting parents on the certificate.  Where the adopting mother is the natural mother, she may wish to have that fact reflected on the certificate which issues.  Is the Minister aware of that request and has he views on it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter would fall more within the ambit of my colleague, the Minister for Health.  It is an adoption matter rather than an adoptive leave matter.  This section deals with the certificate for the purposes of adoptive leave.  The certificate will verify the date of placement, date of issue, sex of child, the name and address of adopting parents and so on.  I do not believe that the issue raised by the Deputy is a relevant factor in adoptive leave.  It may well be relevant in the adopting context which comes under the responsibility of the Department of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but the certificate which will be issued under this section will show both names. Where the natural mother of a child marries a man other than the natural father of the child and they adopt the child as a married couple, under the 1952 Act the certificate they receive is an extract from the adopted children's register as set out in the second schedule to the 1952 Act which shows names of the adoptive parents.  The 1952 Act did not envisage circumstances where a natural mother would adopt her own child and her name would not be shown as the natural mother but as an adopting mother.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 15 preserves the employee's rights while on adoptive leave.  It ensures that while the employee is on adoptive leave the employer cannot infringe or alter the employee's rights and that they are fully preserved during that leave period. Section 15 (6) states:</P>
      <P>An adopting parent shall be deemed not to be an employed contributor for the purposes of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) act, 1993, for any contribution week (within the meaning of that Act) in a period of absence from her work on adoptive leave or additional adoptive leave if she does not receive any reckonable earnings (within the meaning of that Act) in respect of that week.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister explain why that subsection has been inserted?  This section relates to employment contracts and it provides for the preservation of the rights of an employee while on adoptive leave, but subsection (6) appears to provide something different.  It states clearly that an adoptive parent shall not be deemed to be an employed contributor for the purposes of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993.  It would be helpful if the Minister would explain the subsection.</P>

      <P>Where a female employee does not receive remuneration from her employer during any week of her adoptive leave because, for example, she is receiving payment under the new Department of Social Welfare adoptive allowance scheme instead, she will not by virtue of subsection (6) be insurable for the purposes of the social welfare code during the week <Col N="2023" /> or the weeks in question.  The reason for that provision is that under the social welfare code a person is not insurable for any period during which he or she is receiving payment from the Department of Social Welfare.  She would be in the same position as any person in receipt of social welfare benefit.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister for Social Welfare have to introduce a provision to extend credits to this category of people.  If that is the position, we would want to ensure that it happens? One does not get credits automatically, it is only if they are defined.  It seems a strange way of dealing with the issue. One could just as easily say, you will get credits in that time and your social welfare position will not be disrupted. Section 15 (6) states that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;An adopting parent shall be deemed not to be an employed contributor for the purposes of the ... Act...&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a fairly heavy handed statement. Is it necessary?  I ask the Minister to look at the subsection again before Report Stage.  If we were to have Report Stage tomorrow I would consider tabling an amendment as I would <Col N="2024" /> like to have heard what the Minister had to say.</P>
    <P>The language is very strong and consequently it is clear that an adopting parent is not regarded as an employed contributor.  What are the implications other than that somebody will presumably extend credits to cover that situation but that is not mentioned?  That point occurred to me when examining the section.  The section is fine so far as I am concerned, it brings in other provisions which preserve the entitlements of employees but that question bothered me when I saw the language in which it was expressed.  I would like to be assured about the operation of the section in all circumstances, not just in some of the more obvious cases.  An adopting parent shall be deemed not to be an employed contributor for the purposes of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 &mdash; that means everything in social welfare.  The manner in which that is expressed in the Bill is disturbing.  I ask the Minister for clear assurances on it on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Woods knows well the position is that under the social welfare code a person is not insurable for a period during which he or she is receiving payment from the Department of Social Welfare.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not explain the sections.  Section 18 deals with the general right to return to work and is similar to the Maternity (Protection of Employees) Act, 1981. Section 19 deals with the right to suitable alternative employment in the event of the same work not being available.Section 20 deals with the notification of intention to return to work. This could cause a difficulty in some instances.  It requires notification from the person returning to work to be given four weeks in advance and in writing. Section 20 (1) states:</P>
      <P>An adopting parent who has been on adoptive leave or additional adoptive leave shall, not later than 4 weeks before the date on which she expects to return to work, cause her employer (or, where she is aware of a change of ownership of the undertaking concerned, the successor) to be notified in writing of her intention to return to work and of the date on which she expects to return to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister think that is how it would happen in practice or is that normal?In many cases people just ring up and say they expect to be back at a certain time.  There are fixed times in that one has ten weeks and four weeks optional time afterwards.  This section requires the employees to say in writing that she will be returning to work in four weeks.  In most practical situations, I wonder how necessary that is in this age of openness and modern methods of communication?  As I understand it, most people would ring up and say they expected to be back at such and such a time.  This section will require the employee to give the notice in writing. The provision could have practical importance if the employer insisted that the employee had not given notice in writing but had telephoned the office saying they expected to be back - in <Col N="2026" /> that case one could have an argument about it.  I would like to hear the Minister's view.</P>
    <P>We go through these sections which have all types of clauses that are practical for people outside.  Somewhere in the drafting process somebody takes out a clause which existed previously and it is inserted again.  As we do so we should look at how practical the sections are and whether they are necessary.  In the past we may have had to have provisions to force a situation either on the employer or the employee but times change as do methods of communication.A small proportion of the people with whom I shall be dealing are not able to write.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point Deputy Woods has made.  The section gives a reasonable balance to the position, first, of the needs and rights being granted to mothers who take adoptive leave and, secondly, of their employers.  One cannot overlook the position of the employer.  They are entitled to know exactly, and without doubt or equivocation, what the position is regarding the work availability of their employees. They have their own arrangements to make.  They have to plan their production schedules, work arrangements and all the rest of it.  It is better that the notification be provided in writing as, otherwise, there can be a doubt as to what was indicated.  The person returning from leave may be under the impression that she gave a particular date whereas the employer may have taken it up in a different way.  This is an important matter from the employer's point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are obligated to give reasonable attention to the needs of the employer and the person taking leave.  It is very specific in what it says but I would draw the Deputy's attention to section 20 (3) which will allow the tribunal or Circuit Court in special cases to accept a lesser notice than is provided for in section 20(1).  That subsection will cover hard cases which will occasionally arise. <Col N="2027" /> This is a reasonable balance which will meet the needs of the adopting mother and the employer.</P>

      <P>I am concerned in particular about the question of providing 14 rather than ten weeks adoptive leave for parents of children with special needs.  The Minister will have to make a decision off the top of his head now not to include such a provision in the Bill.  As it would not create a precedent the Minister should take some time to consider the matter.</P>
      <P>During the debate I suggested a number of other worthwhile amendments that could be dealt with on Report Stage, but we will not have an opportunity to table them now.  I asked the Minister to consider section 15(6) which provides that an adopting parent shall be deemed not to be an employed contributor for the purposes of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993. There should be some provision for such a person and I would prefer if it were included in this Bill.  The Minister will have to depend on the Minister for Social Welfare to introduce credits to cover that position.  I would prefer to have that matter teased out further on Report Stage.  The Minister has stated that he will communicate with the Minister for Social Welfare to ensure that credits are awarded, but that is a separate measure about which a regulation must be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section should be considered more fully before the Bill is passed. There are a number of other issues I would like to have teased out further, but as it has been agreed between the <Col N="2032" /> Whips that Report Stage should be taken now, I will not object.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on bringing it to this stage.  I have supported him in getting it through the House in a short time and I would like to see it on the Statute Book as soon as possible.  I also stressed an early date for the implementation of its provisions.  I assume the Social Welfare Bill will come before the House this week because it must be passed so that the Revenue Commissioners can commence their work in implementing its provisions on 6 April. The same date should also be set for the implementation of the provisions of the Adoptive Leave Bill.  As its provisions were prepared in 1993 and 1994 I know the Department of Social Welfare will have no difficulty in including them in the Social Welfare Bill.  I am happy with the assurances the Minister gave about the early implementation of these measures.  I would have liked, however, if he had accepted my suggestion about the parents of children with special needs.  Perhaps he might consider that matter before the Bill is enacted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not happy with the lack of equal treatment provisions in the Bill.  Men and women should be treated equally in terms of adoption.  The case is clear-cut and the expense would be negligible. I am sure in time the Minister will look over the Bill and say his one regret in what is otherwise an excellent Bill is that, as Minister for Equality and Law Reform, he failed to provide for equal treatment.  I welcome the opportunity, as Opposition spokesperson on equality and law reform, to make that point.  As <Col N="2033" /> this is my only major reservation about the Bill, it is regrettable that my suggestion was not considered but, in the nature of things, I understand how that provision could have been excluded.</P>
    <P>From now on we should not hesitate or waste time in regard to equal treatment measures.  I know I am speaking to the converted when speaking to the Minister because I am aware of his conviction and commitment to equality issues and reform of the law.  We have an opportunity to reform the law here and we should do so.</P>
    <P>Young people will be disappointed with the Minister's failure in this regard. I have spoken to a number of young parents who fail to understand why we could not provide equal treatment in this Bill.  They see equal treatment as the way forward and they know we know it is the way forward.  In practical terms, the measure could be adopted, with no financial consequences.  The Minister plans to deal with the question of parental leave, but the great fear is that this Bill would in some way act as a precedent for such leave.  That is why we are doing something today which we do not want to do.  I know the Minister does not want this Bill to pass without providing equally for men and women in regard to adoption.  We must address the issue of equality because young people, in particular, do not understand why we are holding off.  The only reason is the fears of people in the background &mdash; who are not with us today &mdash; about a precedent in terms of parental leave. That is regrettable.  The Bill should not be regarded as a precedent for parental leave, which is a separate matter that will be phased in eventually.  Some people will oppose it and be fearful of the costs involved but we must find a proper way of dealing with the issue.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is anxious to bring forward measures as soon as possible, and other people are convinced of the desirability of acting in that area, in however small a way initially, in order not to frighten the horses, so to speak. One has to advance one step at a time, but I felt strongly that this would have <Col N="2034" /> been a worthwhile measure which would have achieved full equality of treatment as between men and women. I regret that that was not possible today. I congratulate the Minister on bringing the Bill to this stage and have great pleasure in supporting its passage.</P>

      <P>I would like to join the Opposition spokesman in congratulating the Minister on steering this Bill through the House.  It is a much needed and welcome reform for the small number of parents who are directly affected.</P>
      <P>I welcome the remarks of the last speaker and would encourage the Minister to act on this unexpected consensus brought about by the change of positions in the House.  As in so many other areas there was no sign, when in Government, of the enthusiasm for reform that has been demonstrated by Fianna Fáil in Opposition, and this is an opportunity that we should not let slip. There are many Opposition Members who argue that the reason this measure was attractive is that it would not be very costly.  If that was the measure by which the worth of any legislation was judged, there would not be a very warm environment.  However, I have great confidence that the spokesman opposite will be able to bring his party with him in this matter.  It is time, when there is consensus in the House, to strike and move on parental leave also.</P>
      <P>Last Friday I spoke to spokeswomen from other parties about what prevents women from moving ahead in their careers.  Certainly family issues are the critical ones.  In the virtual absence of child care there is very little support given by the State.  The issue of parental leave must stay on the agenda and it would seem that this is the time to move, given that there is such a broad consensus in the House.  The Commission on the Status of Women asked that, as a gesture, we should begin with one week's parental leave and I ask that we attempt to move on at least that minimum in the period of office of this Government.</P>

      <P>This Bill does not purport to deal with parental leave.  It does purport to be an equal treatment Bill because it brings about equal treatment for adopting mothers with natural mothers.</P>
      <P>Parental leave will remain on the agenda and its time will come, hopefully in the not too distant future.  Deputy Woods said it was not appropriate to deal with parental leave when he brought in maternity leave.  However, I believe it will be introduced and the sooner the better.  An examination of all aspects of it is continuing and it is being actively considered at EU level also.</P>
      <P>I will clarify with the Minister for Social Welfare the position in regard to social welfare.  However, that section has to be included because otherwise the contribution position of a person receiving social welfare payments would be called into question.  The provision of credits must be secured and that will be done in the same way as it was done in connection with maternity legislation.</P>
      <P>I would like to thank the officials of my Department who have worked long and hard on the technical details of the Bill which is a surprisingly long and complex one in the context of its net purpose.  It achieves its purpose well and fairly, and strikes the appropriate balance between the needs of adopting mothers and that of employers whose position must also be taken into account.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 11 and 12, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(g) railways and related buildings,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I argued at length for the inclusion of railway lines and railway buildings as items of heritage.  I did so for a variety of reasons which I will not expand on at any great length now because, happily, the Minister has accepted the substance of my amendment. I am grateful to him for so doing and am convinced that we have in place a much better Bill.</P>
      <P>Most of us will recognise that railways have a place of honour and affection in the folk memory and social history of Ireland.  In most rural parishes through which railway lines pass generations of families worked in the construction of the railways and later in the running of the railways and the delivery of a public service which was, for its time and, indeed, for any time, an excellent one for the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to keep all that alive in terms of our heritage.  In addition the architecture of the railway buildings &mdash; by that I do not just mean railway cottages in which railway families lived, which are beautiful in their own right, but railway station houses, bridges, viaducts and battlements that were built in conjunction with the laying of the tracks &mdash; almost without exception, is of very great beauty and ought, as far as possible, be preserved as part of our heritage.  They are a testimony to a level of craftsmanship that was in Ireland at that time and ought to be honoured and, hopefully, maintained and passed on to <Col N="2037" /> another generation.  It ought not to be lost.</P>
    <P>Very fundamentally, railway lines ought to be maintained and preserved as public rights-of-way.  They are the property of the general public and ought to be held in trust by this generation for subsequent generations.  I have found in recent times, to my utter dismay, that farmers are beginning to encroach and extend their holdings across railway lines and railway tracks, thereby incorporating them into their own holdings as if they were private property which they are not.  That practice should be stopped.</P>

I am indicating the interests that will be represented but not the strength of their representation.  The role of the consumer will have to be taken into account.</P>
      <P>There is an insurance ombudswoman and to some degree the VHI is co-operating with her.  I would prefer if everybody involved had a wider consultative role and the consumer better access.  The health strategy states that there will be greater sensitivity to the right of the consumers to a service which responds to their needs in an equitable and quality driven manner.

      <P>Does the Minister believe that the introduction of competition in the health insurance market would bring benefits for the consumer as happened in the case of airfares and car and home insurance?  The Minister stated that the VHI is co-operating &ldquo;to some degree&rdquo; with the ombudswoman.  Does this indicate it has not been forthcoming and that the ombudswoman is encountering difficulties in seeking the full co-operation of the VHI, which is not what one would expect?</P>

I would like it to co-operate more fully with the ombudswoman for the insurance industry until a wider consultative framework is put in place.  Competition is inevitable but we should not rush into it because if one is young and healthy and pays low premiums it can lead to a great service whereas if one is old and in need of care it may not lead to such a great service at a cost one can afford.  In any discussion on competition we should keep in mind the kind of cover provided for many years.  It would be a pity if we departed from the formula or framework of universal cover.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>Under the charter of rights for hospital patients, patients have the right to be given an individual appointment time for out-patient services.  My Department has reviewed the implementation of the charter of rights for hospital patients and I am satisfied that, in general, health boards and hospitals have implemented its provisions.However, I am aware that a small number of hospitals are experiencing some difficulty in giving individual appointment times to patients attending out-patient clinics.  In some of these cases, individual appointments are being gradually introduced to out-patient clinics.  My Department is pursuing these matters with the hospitals involved.</P>
      <P>In addition, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> contained an undertaking by the then Government to evaluate the effectiveness of the charter of rights for hospital patients to make any necessary improvements and to ensure that it provides a properly structured system of patient rights.  This work is ongoing and is now being viewed in the context of the health strategy's provisions in relation to service quality.  The strategy gives an undertaking to reorientate the health services so that they are more responsive to patients' needs. This Government is committed to the whole area of service quality from clinical outcome through to patient satisfaction.This commitment is shown in the programme <i>A Government of Renewal</i> which has endorsed the health strategy as a basis for Government policy in the health area.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister believe that consultants recall patients far too often to out-patient clinics and that their role, following a consultation, should be to refer a patient back to the general practitioner and <Col N="2041" /> that if this was to happen on a more regular basis fewer people would be waiting at out-patient clinics throughout the country?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am not sure if the Deputy has a particular case in mind but difficulties are being encountered with individual consultants in making appointments for public patients.  It is the policy to make individual appointments for public patients but in some hospitals individual consultants will not co-operate and continue to make block appointments.  This leads to delays.</P>

I appreciate that many hospitals and consultants no longer do that but the practice continues in certain hospitals.  Has the Minister any plan to ensure that the general provisions in relation to this area in the charter are enforced?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Programme for Competitiveness and Work provides for a review of the charter of patients' rights. That review is ongoing and it is now being viewed in the context of the health strategy provisions in relation to the quality of service.I can control the situation in public hospitals and the health boards are co-operating fully in this regard.  The policy of health boards now is to allocate a 15-minute appointment to a public patient. Some individual consultants are not co-operating fully with this practice but they are small in number.  I understand the health boards expect to make further progress in this regard.  The same level of direction is not available to the health boards in voluntary hospitals but progress is being made there also. Rather than trying to direct <Col N="2042" /> these hospitals or to impose mandatory conditions on them I will continue to seek their co-operation. I believe the situation is improving on a monthly basis.</P>

In regard to my commitment to the charter of patients' rights, that is absolute.  The Deputy is advocating that I take vigorous action but I prefer to adopt a &ldquo;softly softly&rdquo; approach at the moment. The ongoing review, which is part of the commitment in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> is progressing satisfactorily and there is co-operation.  I hope it will be possible to grant what the Deputy requests, namely, that there should no longer be block booking of public patients in outpatients clinics and that every patient will be allocated a 15 minute appointment.That would eliminate the possibility of a delay stretching from early morning until late afternoon.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> On the question of the statistics, it is important one should know precisely what is happening before formulating policy. It is my policy to attempt to reduce the need for many women to travel to the United <Col N="2044" /> Kingdom for abortions.  I will deal with the way and means we will do that in the course of the debate on the Bill. Information available from the United Kingdom and available research shows that the majority of women with Irish addresses who go to the United Kingdom for abortions do not consult with any medical professional, be it family doctor or advice agency, prior to travelling.  For example, a study of Irish women seeking abortions was undertaken in Liverpool University in 1991. A representative sample was taken of 53 women.  Four of those women were referred by pregnancy advice agencies, five were referred by a general practitioner and the others relied on family, friends or advertisements in British magazines and made the arrangements themselves.  Those figures are interesting.  There is some research available also in the universities to which I have access. That shows that a considerable number of women who went to the United Kingdom and who were counselled subsequently decided against abortion.  In the context of Irish women deciding against abortion having been counselled in the United Kingdom, the evidence varies but between 14 per cent and 25 per cent decided not to go ahead with the abortion.The statistics I gave in reply to the original question deal with the information available from the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys in the United Kingdom.  They would not include Irish women who use English addresses or relatives of friends.  They simply refer to the number of women who used Irish addresses when they attended termination clinics in England.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 47 together. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is the internationally accepted Charter for Children, was ratified by Ireland in 1992.  Work is proceeding urgently in a number of Government Departments on the preparation of Ireland's first report to the UN, as required by the convention.  It is intended that this report will be submitted to the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child in the first half of this year.</P>
      <P>In my own area of responsibility the Child Care Act, 1991, reflects the key principles enshrined in the United Nations Convention.  The Act provides a comprehensive statutory framework for the protection of children from abuse and neglect and for the provision of accommodation to children who are homeless.  It requires health boards and the courts to: regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration; and have regard to the wishes of a child having regard to his age and understanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2047" /> It also contains new legal procedures to enable the health boards and the Garda Síochána to intervene where children are being neglected or abused, grants the health boards powers to provide child care and family support services and provides for the introduction of new legal controls on pre-school services and children's residential centres.</P>
    <P>As indicated in our policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal</i> we are committed to the rapid implementation of the Child Care Act.  Those parts of the Act which deal with the protection of children from abuse and neglect will be brought into operation before the end of this year and it is our intention that the entire Act will be fully implemented by the end of 1996.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister agrees that those in the community most vulnerable to abuse are children and that their first avenue to turn to would be their parents. However, very often the abuser is either a member of the extended family or a close family friend and the ISPCC has been calling for a long time for the response to the UN Charter for Children which was ratified in 1992 to be published.  It has also said we should enshrine in law a specific charter for children that would lay down very clear guidelines in this area and give a voice to those who do not have one, other than the ISPCC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the point the Deputy raised.  She may be aware also that the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  May I draw her attention to the fact that less than a week ago the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, replied on that matter in the House?  On that basis I said that we hope to have the matter sorted out in the first half of this year.</P>

      <P>I presume in reminding me that the UN Convention <Col N="2048" /> on the Rights of the Child is a matter for the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Currie is not washing his hands of the matter.  After all he has specific responsibility in this Government for child care and, therefore, his Department will have a very crucial part to play in suggesting what might be included in the response of the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>On the question of co-operation between the health boards and the Garda Síochána, is it correct to say that there are a number of outstanding cases of child abuse being investigated by the Garda which had gone through a period of investigation of up to nine months by health board officials in advance of the Garda Síochána being told that such an investigation was in progress?</P>

      <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn is aware of the facts as she has stated them from her recent previous experience and I am also aware of the difficulties in this regard.  We are at an advanced stage of consultation with the Garda authorities on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement that consultations with the Garda authorities are at an advanced stage seems to indicate that the difficulty lay on the Garda side but I am sure the Minister is aware the difficulties do not lie with the Garda Síochána and that the recommendations of the Kilkenny report clearly state that when an investigation starts the Garda should be informed immediately.  That has not been happening in a number of cases currently under investigation.  I am asking the Minister to use his good offices to ensure that all staff working in health boards who come in contact with <Col N="2049" /> child abuse cases will, having investigated a report, ensure the Garda Síochána are involved immediately so that case conferences can be planned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>As I outlined in my reply on 26 January 1995 to Parliamentary Question No. 5, regarding orthodontic services, it is estimated in the dental health action plan, which is now being implemented by my Department, that a total of nine consultant orthodontists, supported by appropriately trained dental staff, are required by the health board dental service to meet orthodontic treatment needs at secondary care level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in each health board area regarding the recruitment of consultant orthodontists under the action plan is as follows: Mid-Western &mdash; a consultant is in post since 1985; Southern &mdash; a consultant took up duty in January 1992; North-Western &mdash; a consultant took up duty in February 1992; South-Eastern &mdash; a consultant took up duty in September 1992; Western &mdash; a consultant took up duty in October 1992; North-Eastern &mdash; the board was <Col N="2050" /> again unsuccessful in recent attempts to fill the vacant post through the Local Appointments Commission.  The board has made arrangements with private specialists to provide services; Midland &mdash; the board was again unsuccessful in recent attempts to fill the vacant post through the Local Appointments Commission.The board has made arrangements with private specialists to provide services; Eastern &mdash; a joint appointment of a professor-consultant between the Dublin Dental Hospital and the board to replace a recent resignation is expected very shortly.  The board is also awaiting a response to advertisements for a further two consultant appointments.</P>
    <P>In addition to their own direct clinical involvement the health board consultants organise and carry out a programme of education and training in orthodontic procedures for health board dental staff.  These dental staff will provide a high service level of secondary care orthodontic services under the overall direction and supervision of the consultant.</P>
    <P>My Department and the health boards will continue to develop the orthodontic services over the course of the dental health action plan so that the level of service provision will be brought to the level of actual treatment need.</P>
    <P>I will be making a further £1 million available this year to health boards for further orthodontic developments.</P>
    <P>I have also recently asked my Department to review, in consultation with the health boards and their consultant orthodontists, the provision of orthodontic services throughout the country having regard to the provisions in the health strategy, the dental health action plan and the additional resources provided to health boards over the past number of years for developments in orthodontic services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the grading system in the public orthodontic service?  For example, it appears that the grading system used in private orthodontic services is different from that of public orthodontic services and that decisions in public orthodontic services bear little relevance to the needs of the patients?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not accept that is correct. There are three categories in the grading system &mdash; category A are the most severe cases such as cleft lip and cleft palate; category B are cases with functional handicap, for example, marked disproportion between the upper and lower jaw and, therefore, marked disproportion between the teeth when they close; category C are non-handicap cases but which still need treatment.  The problem is not with the grading system but with the fact that, pending the appointment of consultants, health boards compiled provisional waiting lists.  The consultants applied a more vigorous categorisation and some people who had previously been excluded were included while many who were on the provisional lists were excluded.  We have all had the experience of parents coming to clinics saying their child was taken off the waiting list.  The reason is the categorisation is in accordance with the consultants' instructions and is causing annoyance, to put it mildly, to parents who expected their children would be treated and now find they are not on the waiting list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All I can do is develop the service in line with resources.  An extra £1 million is being given this year.  The problem is a difficult one.  The latest figures would suggest that, in the opinion of the children and their parents, 55 per cent of them are deemed to be in need of orthodontic treatment.  Much of it has to do with medical gain but some has also to do with social gain.  In the health strategy there is a commitment to treatment which gives both medical and social <Col N="2052" /> gain.  We should move away from distinctions used previously which designated some treatments as cosmetic.  I do not accept that.  There is a social gain.</P>
    <P>Other health boards have a more refined system within the categorisation. They have a points system and give treatment in accordance with resources up to a certain point.  The demand is far in excess of available resources.  Until quite recently sufficient orthodontists were not available to do the work and now there are not sufficient of them to fill vacancies in health boards.  Two vacancies exist in two major health boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaireGeoghehanQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Minister think there is such difficulty in attracting orthodontists to work in the public sector?  Has he any plans to extend the training available to other dental staff to allow them carry out partial orthodontic work which would reduce the waiting lists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East)</i>
        <b>:</b> The primary difficulty is to get people who are prepared to work in the Irish public sector at the rates of pay provided in that sector.  Consultant orthodontists are a scarce resource.  The health boards and the Department have only recently moved to a consultant driven service.  It is highly remumerated.</P>
      <P>As regards training, in health boards led by consultants there is a team of dentists.  A number of them are involved in training dentists up to orthodontic level.  They are increasing the supply of orthodontists but, quite frequently, when they train a group who have worked with them in the health board area they may lose them to the private sector.  However, it increases the supply of specialists in the community at large and the price of private treatment has come down somewhat as a result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the difficulties which arose in the Eastern Health Board region when a consultant orthodontist was appointed?  The person appointed was a former constituent of the Minister.  Is he <Col N="2053" /> aware of the concern raised at the time that adequate co-operation was not forthcoming?  The consultant had a salary of £50,000 per year and resigned, it is alleged, because there appeared to be a conflict between what the appointed consultant understood to be the <i>raison d'être</i> and pressure from private consultants to continue to operate contracts within the service.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This matter has been in the public domain for a long time.  The person in question is a consultant orthodontist in Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's constituency and provides a good service there.  It took a long time before health boards were convinced that the service should be consultant driven.  There were policy and administrative difficulties within the health boards but they have now accepted this policy.  In the Mid-Western Health Board a consultant orthodontist has been appointed since the mid-eighties and it is further ahead than areas such as Dublin where arrangements will be made shortly.  Progress is being made.  It will be a consultant driven service.  They will train other dentists and bring them up to orthodontic level.  As regards waiting lists, the worst cases will be taken first.  Extra money will be given and £1 million extra has been provided for orthodontics.</P>

      <P>Given the difficulties experienced in the Eastern Health Board region, will the Minister monitor on an ongoing basis the development of the orthodontic services given the huge level of dissatisfaction among the consumers of those services with the long waiting lists?  Does he accept that this programme needs to be accelerated? There is a need for monitoring given that this person could be successful in another health board area having resigned from the Eastern Health Board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that some of those who are ineligible for State care and opt for private treatment have been so outraged at the high cost of orthodontic treatment here that they have gone to the North where similar services are approximately one-third less in price?  Has he any view on that given that many people will not be eligible for the State's scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The scheme is not means-tested.  If people have a medical or social priority for treatment they will receive it regardless of means.  The parents of those children who do not get on to the public list may decide to go privately for treatment.  On some occasions, it was cheaper to have the treatment carried out in Northern Ireland but the free market is something that is dear to the Deputy's party.  There are more othodontists operating in Northern Ireland and, consequently, the cost of treatment is less.  Orthodontic treatment qualifies for tax relief and that is a serious issue for many parents. It is not generally known that it may be claimed against income tax at the marginal rate.  This means that people going privately may claim such expenditure against their income tax liability at the marginal rate of tax.  Frequently, in the case of children, parents are quoted figures of £1,600 and £1,700 but if they pay tax at the top rate of 48 per cent the cost can work out at about half that amount.</P>

Would he agree, however, that there can be a risk, albeit slight, to the mother's life by a pregnancy?  Can he inform the House whether he or his Department had any consultations with the medical profession as to how a woman, whose life is deemed to be at risk by reason of a pregnancy, could have that pregnancy terminated in this State following on the judgment of the Supreme Court in the X case?</P>

        <b>:</b> The decrease in incidence is not due solely to improvements in obstetric practice &mdash; while we agree that such improvements have taken place &mdash; but also to improved living conditions, nutrition and antenatal care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House might be interested in hearing of trends over the years, as follows: in the years 1960 to 1964 the rate of maternal deaths was 45.5 per 100,000 births; in the period 1965 to 1969 the rate had decreased to 29.6; from 1970 to 1974 it had gone down to 26; from 1975 to 1979 it had decreased to 12.4; in 1980 to 1984 it was 6.9, between the years <Col N="2057" /> 1985 and 1989 it was 4.2 and in 1993 it was down to 3.4.  Looking at a table of statistics &mdash; for EU countries &mdash; I can supply it to the Deputy, I noted that from 1970 to 1993 there was one year only in which Irish rates were slightly above the EU average, which I would think was an aberration in those stastistics because, for all other years, the rate for Ireland was substantially below the EU average.</P>
    <P>The X case does not really arise on a statistical question like this.  I will deal with all of these issues in the course of the debate on the relevant Bill.  The Deputy is probably aware that there is a conflict among medical practitioners on whether there is a choice, at times, between the life of a woman and the life of a child; some doctors say there might be and others say there never is in modern medicine.  We can explore all of these issues in the course of Committee Stage.  Anything I might say in reply to a supplementary question, of necessity, must be taken out of context of the information Bill which does not deal with the X case, but is simply an information Bill.  That would not be fair to anybody in this House or to the public at large.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East)</i>
        <b>:</b> I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>Admission for open heart surgery in the public hospital service is determined having regard to the medical condition of patients and not on the basis of whether they are classified as public or private patients.  Admission is based solely on the patient's condition and not on the length of time on the waiting list. Emergency cases are given priority.  In these circumstances, the average waiting time is not a critical indicator of the adequacy of the service available. Nevertheless, the need to provide additional facility for open heart surgery for adults, including by-pass surgery, has been recognised for some time and the following steps have been taken to improve the position.</P>
      <P>In 1993, a sum of £1 million from the waiting list fund was allocated to enable the necessary facilities to be put in place at the National Cardiac Surgery Unit, Mater Hospital to increase the annual throughput of open heart surgery at the hospital from 750 to 1,000, an increase of 33 per cent.  In addition, in 1993 and 1994 funding of £2.8 million was provided to facilitate the doubling of cardiac surgery at Cork University Hospital from 200 to 400 patients each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over 1993 and 1994, in excess of £2 million revenue and £3.5 million in capital was allocated to the Mater Hospital <Col N="2059" /> for cardiac surgery and related developments.The building works associated with this development, were completed in mid-1994.  They include additional cardiac maintenance beds, intensive care facilities and high dependency facilities required to support the cardiac surgery programme.  These new facilities at the hospital have now become operational and the additional cardiac surgery activity has commenced.</P>
    <P>Additional resources of £200,000 are being provided in 1995 to the Mater Hospital to ensure that throughput in cardiac surgery in 1995 reaches the target of 1,000 open heart operations per year.</P>
    <P>The developments at the Mater Hospital, together with the developments for cardiac surgery at Cork University Hospital, which were opened in November, 1994 will have the effect of increasing the number of cardiac surgery operations performed on an annual basis in the public hospital sector by 47 per cent from 950 to 1,400.</P>
    <P>I have no information on waiting times in the private sector.</P>
    <P>The question of the provision of further additional facilities for cardiac surgery will be considered as sympathetically as possible in the context of the many competing demands for resources throughout the health services.</P>
    <P>I have written in detail to Deputy Deasy regarding the specific case mentioned and I would draw the Deputy's attention again to the central role of the patient's general practitioner who would be in the best position to highlight the case to the consultant concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it there is no waiting period for a particular operation, such as a heart by-pass, which would appear to be the gist of the Minister's answer.  Is the Minister saying it is merely a matter for the patient's doctor or relevant consultant to decide whether that patient is sufficiently critical to warrant an operation and that, if not, he or she could be waiting forever?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is an area of surgery for which there is very strong demand and in which there is not sufficient capacity to deal with every patient who, in the opinion of his or her doctor, needs treatment.  There is no distinction drawn between private and public in public service hospitals.  The sorting of the waiting list depends on the priority needs of a patient, ensuring that patients who most need treatment are treated ahead of others whose need is not as acute.  There is a list of people in need of surgery, who are requesting surgery and whose doctors are requesting surgery.  Progress has been made over the past two years to bring cardiac surgery facilities in line with the demand, in the Mater Hospital in Dublin and at Cork University Hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>My Question No. 49 refers specifically to a public patient, to a man with a medical card, who has been awaiting a heart by-pass operation since October last and who has been given no indication if and when he will have one.  Obviously he and his family are very concerned about it.  What are the realistic hopes of such a person having an operation before becoming so critically ill that his or her health condition would be irretrievable?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Sometimes the health of a patient on a waiting list deteriorates unexpectedly or more than was expected by his or her general practitioner.  In those circumstances the patient's general practitioner resubmits his or her name to the consultant involved on the basis of a changed medical condition and there can be a reordering of priority on that basis.  The only advice I can give to people on the waiting list is that if their circumstances have changed they should return to their general practitioners and ask them to approach consultants to prioritise their patients' needs in light of the new information.</P>

      <P>As the Minister rightly said there are two public <Col N="2061" /> facilities which carry out cardiac surgery, one in Cork and one in the Mater. In the light of extra finances being available, does the Minister have proposals to extend the cardiac surgery facilities at any other location in the country, particularly at UCHG in respect of which proposals have been submitted by the local health board and the private sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East)</i>
        <b>:</b> A number of suggestions have been made to my Department about the extension of such facilities, but I am not in a position to reply positively to any of them.  As I mentioned on the last occasion I replied to Dáil questions, the case being strongly pressed is St. James's Hospital from where cardiac surgeons travel to the Mater Hospital to carry out cardiac surgery.  They want a facility at St. James's Hospital.  However, when the matter was investigated thoroughly it was found that by maintaining and centralising facilities at the Mater and bringing the surgeons at St. James's to the Mater the throughput was better in terms of the number of people who could be dealt with than if there were two separate facilities.  Cardiac surgery is like any other service, there comes a point where there is a better return on the centralisation of facilities.  For the sake of having a better geographic spread, I am not prepared to reduce the number of people who can be treated to enable those who are being treated to be cared for nearer home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree there is a high demand for cardiac surgery because it is life-enhancing and, for many people, often life-saving surgery?Will the Minister agree that there is great inequality between the private patient who can elect to have a life-enhancing operation and a public patient's access to such surgery?</P>

Is the Minister aware of the level of concern and the perception among public health patients awaiting heart surgery, that a private patient lying in the next bed will be transferred immediately to the Blackrock Clinic while a public patient will be told to go home and he or she will be called back.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East)</i>
        <b>:</b> I note the Deputies points and it is easy to agree that additional services should be provided for any area of medicine.  I am sure that in dealing with later questions Deputies will request that the weighting of resources should be given to other areas.  There is a constant demand for additional facilities for the mentally and physically handicapped.  I have just dealt with a question in regard to which there were demands from Deputies on both sides that the waiting list for orthodontic treatment should be cut.  I will try to allocate resources to areas of greatest need without neglecting areas of lesser need.  In doing that in terms of cardiac surgery, I am following the policy of my predecessor and the previous Government because facilities have been <Col N="2063" /> improved fairly dramatically.  Pre-1994 750 operations were carried out in the Mater Hospital and 200 were carried out in Cork University Hospital.  By the end of this year the Mater Hospital will be carrying out 1,000 operations and there will be a doubling of the number of operations in Cork to 400.  A total of 1,400 operations will be carried out by the end of this year against 750 operations carried out pre-1994 and I will continue to progress that.  I understand the throughput of cardiac patients from the Blackrock Clinic and the Mater Private is 700.  Comparing those private facilities to the public facilities, the throughput of cardiac patients at Cork and the Mater General is twice the throughput of the Blackrock Clinic and the Mater Private.  There are significant improvements and I am committed to continuing the improvements, but there is always a competing demand for available resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 19 and 81 together.  Under section 61 of the Health Act, 1970, health boards may make arrangements to assist in the maintenance at home of persons who but for the provision of such a service would require to be maintained otherwise than at home.  This <Col N="2064" /> section empowers, without obliging, health boards to provide support services such as home help, laundry and meals.</P>
      <P>At present there are 11,215 part time and 126 full time home helps employed throughout the country.  As the part time home help service originated with the concept of the good neighbour, the level of payment to home helps reflects the voluntary ethos of the service.  The rate of remuneration varies considerably throughout the country.  In all boards the rates are determined by the requirements and type of task undertaken in individual cases.</P>
      <P>My Department is considering, in consultation with the chief executive officers of the health boards, a number of aspects of the home help scheme, including the overall organisation of the service and the variations from board to board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>Do the rates under the scheme differ among health boards?  We have heard that a rate of £1 per hour is paid under the scheme.  Does the Minister consider that rate is sufficient and will it induce people into the scheme? Has he made any provision in his budgetary estimates for that service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East)</i>
        <b>:</b> The rates under the scheme vary.  Stated remuneration rates would not attract people into the scheme.  Under the scheme there was an element of expenses in lieu of good neighbourliness and people helping on that basis.  In the Eastern Health Board the rates per hour under the scheme are between £2 and £4, £2.50 in the Midland Health Board, £2.60 in the Mid-Western Health Board, £1.45 in the North-Eastern Health board, £2.61 in the North-Western Health Board and £2 in the SouthEastern Health Board, £1.40 in the Southern Health Board and £1 in the Western Health Board.  There is a big variation in the rate per hour under the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On checking on the origins of the policy on home help, I discovered that the <Col N="2065" /> home help service was based on a circular letter in the first instance and because of that individual health boards decided to provide the service.  There is not, in effect, a national home help service, there are individual health board services stemming from that central decision which was notified a long time ago.  I asked my Department to consult with the chief executive officers of the health boards to see if the service can be put on a better footing.  A working group has recently reported to the chief executive officers on this.  There are regular meetings between senior officials of my Department and the chief executive officers and I have asked them to discuss this at their next meeting.  Progress will be made.</P>
    <P>I understand what Deputies are saying.There are difficulties but the service is a very good one.  Without imposing some mandatory service on individual health boards I would like standardisation and a review of what is happening in order that the service can be more effective.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The needs are as great in urban areas as in rural areas.  Sometimes we look at a rural area and say people are isolated and far apart.  Elderly people, who are the main beneficiaries of the scheme, can be isolated in the middle of a city. They can be isolated in a terrace of houses because nobody calls in and nobody helps.  Many of the houses on the terrace may be rented.  It is quite normal to find an isolated elderly person in an urban community so I would not weight it in that direction.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East)</i>
        <b>:</b> No, I have not seen any figures to suggest such a correlation.  The service cost £14 million in 1993 and it involved 10,041 home helps.  It is a relatively small sum of money for a national scheme but involves a huge number of people. Those home helps assisted about 17,000 clients.  The assistance is mainly cooking, cleaning etc.  Some of the home helps are trained nurses who would carry out minor medical procedures such as dressings but always under the supervision of the public health nurse. There is a range of circumstances which differ.  It will not be possible to have a smooth national scheme where the same rules, regulations and procedures apply everywhere as the divergences are too wide.  This is not simply a question of divergences in the payment rate per hour, there are other divergences as well.  If one were to equalise the payment rates per hour by upping the payments the service would still be in need of a serious examination to achieve the objectives I have suggested.</P>

Given the importance of the <Col N="2067" /> service provided by home helps, will he agree that there may well be a strong correlation between the rates of pay and the fact that the vast majority of the home helps are women?  Will he agree there is a danger that the State could exploit the good neighbourliness of women and their natural kindness to help their neighbours by paying such a low rate of remuneration?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply stating that he is interested in taking on board Members' views and that a working group will report.  The position in the Western Health Board area is dire.  The rate since 1990 has been £1 per hour.  There is a national variation on average of about 300 per cent in the rate paid by other health boards as against the Western Health Board which has the highest percentage of elderly people deserving of the service.  The rate of £1 per hour is equivalent to about half the rate paid to babysitters looking after children in their homes.  Is the Minister aware of a practice in some health board areas whereby old age pensioners who are the recipients of the service are asked on a voluntary basis, but in the main comply with the request, to contribute towards the hourly rate of the home help?  There is no home help in Ireland who will work for £1 per hour.  Accordingly, the old age pensioner is asked to contribute on a cooperative basis an additional £1 or £1.50 to avail of the service two or three hours per day or twice a week, as the case may be, when home helps visit to carry out the essential duties referred to.  Elderly people who depend on social welfare allowances are asked to contribute additional resources.  I ask the Minister to take those views on board.</P>

        <b>:</b> I will take the Deputy's views into account. Neither the Minister for Health nor the Department of Health sets the rates; the rates are set by the health boards.  Why do we have health boards if every problem comes to the Department of Health?  Deputies who are members of health boards have a role to play.  If the rate of £1 per hour in the Western Health Board is resulting in the collapse of the home help scheme the primary responsibility rests with the members of the health board.  That is what local democracy is about.</P>

In addition health boards provide community based services for those with mental illness, mental handicap and physical disabilities in the psychiatric and services for the handicapped programmes, which are generally encompassed in the health boards' special hospital programme.  The Deputy should also be aware that in this year's Estimate there has been substantial additional funding, excluding pay increases, amounting to £32.7 million allocated to the community care services.</P>

The Department of Finance has made it a condition of approval that of the total £0.5 million should be sourced from the sale of surplus lands by the Western Health Board not later than 1996 and that £0.2 million be provided from within the board's allocation from the European Regional Development Fund for training workshops.The Department of Finance queried the necessity of siting central stores in Castlerea and proposed that unused space in the Sacred Heart Home, Roscommon, be converted for this purpose.</P>

      <P>When my husband was recently hospitalised in University College Hospital in Galway I saw the difficult conditions under which the nursing and medical staff work, not to mention the difficult conditions for the patients.  Will the Minister indicate when he will give formal ministerial approval to the Western Health Board? That would be a concrete indication to the board that the Minister and the <Col N="2076" /> Department are serious about phase 1 of the development going ahead as soon as possible.</P>

        <b>:</b> I appreciate the Deputy's interest and support which she, as Minister and Deputy, gave to the hospital over the years.  She may be interested to know that the scope of the work envisaged will include extensions to existing departments.  Ward accommodation will be improved by the provision of four 13 or 14 bed units.  Two additional rooms and ancillary accommodation will be provided in the X-ray unit as well as two additional operating theatres with ancillary accommodation.  Extension and alteration works, including the provision of observation beds, will be provided in the accident and emergency department.The Deputy can take it that all that is required to process this work is formal approval, informal approval has been given.  It is my intention that funding will be allocated in the capital programme for 1995 and work can proceed as soon as the design team selected process the final documentation.  I expect that to be completed before the end of the year.</P>

The design should be finished by the end of this year and funding will be provided in the capital programme to commence the work.  Once that happens the project is in a contractual position and I wish to inform Deputy McCormack, who has constantly pressed me on this issue since I took office, that once it is in that position the money required to complete it will be provided in 1996.</P>

    <P>Today we are in the business of making our society more democratic; we are putting forward far-reaching and detailed proposals which will make the Government more clearly accountable to the Dáil and the Dáil more accountable <Col N="2175" /> to the people.  We will also be getting the Dáil to work more effectively; all new legislation &mdash; and the spending by each Government Department &mdash; will be examined more thoroughly and more efficiently.  This must be done.  It is of critical importance that the Dáil changes so that it can respond to the needs of our rapidly changing society.</P>
    <P>The months of November and December 1994, were arguably among the most dramatic and far reaching in Irish politics.  Events and debate in Dáil Éireann led directly to a change in Government &mdash; the first time in the history of the State that there was a change of Government without an election.  The people who viewed these events as they unfolded were able to immediately form their own judgment as to what was happening.This was a very good thing.  The people were actively involved, through the medium of television, in the democratic process.  This would not have been possible without the televising of the Dáil, a reform measure that was first proposed, and pushed by the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, more than ten years ago.</P>
    <P>The events of last November and December taught us much about the nature of our system of parliamentary democracy and our political maturity, and it is upon those experiences which the present Coalition hope to build.</P>
    <P>First, they taught us that our democracy works.  For all its faults, for all the procedural wrangles, the Dáil is the central democratic institution where debates on the most significant events of the day have the capacity to affect the entire country and the Executive cannot neither take it for granted nor ignore its ability to examine complex issues.</P>
    <P>Second, they taught us that we have reached a level of political sophistication where the will of the electorate is no longer expressed in simple terms of party or indeed coalition allegiance. It can transfer quickly and with conviction in response to political events.</P>
    <P>The successful role played by the Dáil in recent events had a major influence <Col N="2176" /> on the framing of the Oireachtas reform section of, A Government of Renewal, the policy agreement between Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left.</P>
    <P>As stated in A Government of Renewal many of our laws are based on laws which were passed in another century for another administration. The same applies to many of our institutions and systems of public administration.Nowhere is this more in evidence than in the Houses of the Oireachtas, which are largely based on the Westminster model.</P>
    <P>While acknowledging that limited Oireachtas reform has taken place in the past 12 years or so, we are all aware of the need for fundamental Oireachtas reform to make it responsive to the needs of a modern democratic society. Reforms of the Oireachtas at this stage must aim to make it an Oireachtas geared for the 21st century.  To achieve this, the Government believes that reform must be fundamental and radical.As outlined in our programme it must aim at: making the Dáil more efficient and business-like; enhancing the role of Members as legislators; ensuring that the various organs of State and holders of high office in the State are more answerable and accountable to the Legislature; and ensuring that the Dáil has real powers to investigate matters of serious public concern.</P>
    <P>In pursuit of these aims, measures are being put in place which affect all Oireachtas procedures and activities. Today, on behalf of the Government, I move a number of motions with the effect of amending the orders of reference of eight of the existing Oireachtas committees and establishing four new committees.</P>
    <P>The measures relating to Oireachtas committees of themselves constitute a radical approach to Oireachtas reform affecting the dual role of the Oireachtas, namely holding the executive to account and the effective operation of the Oireachtas as a legislature.</P>
    <P>The development of the committee <Col N="2177" /> system in recent years has given rise to the comment that the Oireachtas has acquired a third chamber, i.e. one in addition to both the Dáil and Seanad.  I believe that this comment has some validity, and like a new child growing up, it is developing ways and means of doing things in its own fashion, unencumbered by the rigid procedures which govern the other two Chambers.  It is my firm belief that once the reforms, which we propose to introduce, are put in place, every Deputy will see the benefits, both in the expanded committee system and in this Chamber.</P>
    <P>We have all seen recently, in the sub-committee on Security and Legislation, how effective committees can be in teasing out complex issues through the in-depth questioning of witnesses, and I want to develop that further.</P>
    <P>For the first time, Ministers will be available to appear before committees as a matter of routine to discuss current policies and their implementation in their Departments.  This will allow for a much more exhaustive questioning than is allowable during Question Time, which operates under severe time constraints and has set procedures.  It will of course be a matter for each committee to invite Ministers to attend for the purposes stated.</P>
    <P>In addition, holders of high office in the State, subject to the legal constraints of their office, may also be called before Oireachtas committees where appropriate to the matters under discussion.  The provision further strengthens Oireachtas committees and will ensure that all institutions of the State are accountable to a much greater extent than heretofore.  Again, it will be a matter for each committee to consider whether they wish to call relevant office-holders before them.  In that context, the Government hopes to introduce, at the earliest possible opportunity, the Houses of the Oireachtas (Privilege and Compellability) Bill which will provide privilege for witnesses and others in connection with proceedings of Oireachtas committees <Col N="2178" /> as well as compel witnesses to attend before the committees.</P>
    <P>The legislative role of committees is also being enhanced.  The Government recognises the contribution made by the four legislative committees established by our predecessors, which have proved extremely successful in breaking the log-jam whereby legislation could be with the Oireachtas for lengthy periods before being considered.  These committees have also ensured that departmental Estimates are given proper consideration and it is now the norm to have in-depth and exhaustive discussions on Estimates where previously consideration, if at all, was cursory and consisted of set speeches.  This development, which was first proposed by Fine Gael in Opposition, was implemented by the previous Government.  Like my predecessor, Deputy Noel Dempsey, I will look in a constructive fashion at any reasonable proposal the Opposition might make.</P>
    <P>While the work of the legislative committees is extremely valuable it is clear that their role could be enhanced by making them more proactive.  Members of committees are gaining in expertise through involvement in the processing of legislation.  It is important that this expertise is harnessed in such a way that the input of Deputies on legislative proposals is heard at an early stage where their views can be incorporated into the legislation at the time of drafting.</P>
    <P>It is also important that where Members themselves have ideas for legislation there is a suitable forum where Ministers can hear suggestions and discuss them fully and dispassionately with Members.  Too often in the past good ideas put forward during the passage of Bills were ignored because Ministers were reluctant to accept amendments because of fear of delaying the enactment of the legislation.</P>
    <P>I do not foresee that the empowerment and consultative role being conferred on the legislative committees in relation to preparatory legislation will prejudice the role of Members, whether Government or <Col N="2179" /> Opposition, when Bills are eventually brought forward by Ministers on behalf of the Government.</P>
    <P>When considering legislation on Committee Stage it is vital that Members are informed on all the implications.The public generally and members of interested organisations in particular should have access to Members considering the Bill, first, so that the Members are better informed and, second, so that the public, who are most directly affected by the legislation, are able to inform Members at first hand of their views, thereby increasing democratic accountability.</P>
    <P>There is much talk of a democratic deficit when the institutions of the State are removed from the people.  It is essential, and the legislative committees provide fora in a direct way, that the public believe that their representatives are listening to them, particularly when laws are being discussed which directly affect the public.  It is for this reason that the Government is proposing that committees may, if they so wish, receive submissions and hear evidence from persons and organisations regarding Bills. In line with the Government's commitment to increased openness and transparency and with our commitment in A Government Renewal, we are proposing that the Committee on Legislation and Security should review on a regular basis the Official Secrets Act and all other statutory provisions which restrict access to information in order to bring them into line with the best international standards of public information provision.</P>
    <P>The Committee structure is also being enhanced by the addition of four new committees.  A Committee on the Family will consider the impact of social change and State policies on the family, in both its extended and nuclear forms, with particular reference to the protection and enhancement of the interests of children and the elderly and measures which can be taken to support them <Col N="2180" /> especially with regard to child care, education, juvenile justice, and care of the elderly.</P>
    <P>A Committee on Small Business and Services will examine how to improve the operating environment for small business and services, particularly following the reports of the task forces on these sectors.</P>
    <P>A Committee on Sustainable Development will identify, in prospect of the National Sustainable Development Strategy being prepared by the Government, measures designed to maximise the advantage to Ireland of environmentally sustainable sectoral policies; and, in particular, will consider, by way of case study or otherwise, the extent of Irish participation in the growing world market for environmental goods and services and the means by which this market share can be increased.</P>
    <P>These three committees have, essentially, an advisory function.  They will be empowered to gather information from all sources.  They will be able to send for persons, papers and records and call witnesses to give evidence.</P>
    <P>The Government has proposed the establishment of these committees because the issues involved are fundamentally important in social, industrial and environmental terms in the years approaching the turn of the century.  All three committees will be required to report back to the Houses of the Oireachtas within two years.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a separate Joint Committee on European Affairs emphasises the crucial role that Europe plays in all aspects of our lives and we must always keep a clear focus on European issues and developments in Europe.  It will also allow the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs to concentrate on other aspects of Ireland's international relations.  Provision is being made in the orders of reference of the joint committees for European affairs and foreign affairs for the attendance of Irish Members of the European Parliament, including those from Northern Ireland, at meetings of the joint committees or their sub-committees.  To <Col N="2181" /> enable the Joint Committee on European Affairs to examine EC secondary legislation, it will be necessary to amend the European Communities Acts.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs will be bringing forward a short Bill giving effect to this shortly.</P>
    <P>The reduced membership of the legislative committees is necessary to help the better functioning of these committees and to take into account the establishment of the four new committees. The Government had also proposed a reduced membership for the joint committees on women's rights and the Irish language but on representation from the Opposition parties we have agreed to hold them at their present size so as to ensure maximum participation by all parties in the House.</P>
    <P>The proposed composition of Oireachtas committees reflects the important contribution the Seanad has made and can make in the future to our consideration of the most important issues facing the country.  The expertise of all Senators as well as Deputies must be harnessed in the most effective way possible to ensure the successful development of policies to address these issues.  It is for that reason we are providing that all Members of both Houses may, if they so wish, attend and contribute at committee meetings, other than the legislative committees which already have the facility in respect of the attendance of all Deputies.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the proposals on Oireachtas committees which we are discussing today are but a part of the package of Oireachtas reform proposals which I, on behalf of the Government, put before the Opposition parties on 24 January.  The other proposals related to Matters of Concern, Dáil sitting hours, promised legislation and streamlined voting procedures.</P>
    <P>The Government has already published a list of promised legislation which will be of assistance to the Ceann Comhairle and Members.  I will be pursuing the other proposals in discussions with the Opposition Whips and in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2182" /> I would like, however, to refer briefly to the Government's proposals on sitting hours since they are closely related to our proposals for Oireachtas committees.The Government had envisaged that non-legislative Dáil committees would meet from between 10 a.m. and 2.30 p.m. on Tuesdays.  The Opposition parties, however, have pointed out that the early start would not be convenient to many rural Deputies.  I accept this point.  The Government is disposed to refix the starting time to 11.30 a.m. or 12 noon.  There is agreement between the Government and Opposition that Friday sittings should be devoted to committee meetings.  The Government also proposes that committees would meet during the months of July and September and that the Dáil would sit in plenary session during those months to take reports from the committees.</P>
    <P>Members of the House and staff have rightly expressed concern about the workload which the proposed reforms will place on them and above all about the need for enhanced facilities.  As a recent and former Opposition spokesman, I am very well aware of the need for the provision of sufficient research and secretarial staff to Members and committees as well as a proper physical environment for Members and staff.  I am very pleased that those aspects were recognised in the Government's programme.I am further pleased to be able to tell the House that consultation is ongoing on those matters and I hope that the results of those consultations will be seen in the very near future. Arrangements have been put in place to ensure that staff concerns and suggestions are taken into account.  Deputies and staff must, however, appreciate that all our expectations cannot be immediately realised.  There are long term accommodation issues relating to the Leinster House complex which need to be addressed and, in that context, I hope to receive proposals from the Office of Public Works within the next month on the different options which can be put in place at a realistic cost and <Col N="2183" /> with minimum disruption to Members and staff.</P>
    <P>In my introduction I spoke about the effect of televising Dáil and committee proceedings and the resultant interest generated among the public.  I have no doubt but that experience has led to a greater interest in our parliamentary activities.  The Government's programme referred to the possibility of using the new channel being put in place for Teilifís na Gaelige for, among other things, Oireachtas coverage.  It is my hope that such coverage would include committees as well as plenary sittings.  I have taken up this matter with the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, who is favourably disposed.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to undertake a full and comprehensive review of Dáil Standing Orders as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to examine and report on the procedures and remedies required to ensure that privilege afforded to Members is carefully used at all times and that the rules of misconduct as they apply to any misleading of the House are revised.</P>
    <P>The Government is reviewing the repeat role in so far as parliamentary questions are concerned.</P>
    <P>Oireachtas reform is an essential part of our work as legislators.  It is absolutely necessary that our central democratic institution changes to take account of the evolving nature of our society.  It must be responsive to the needs of the people and organisations representing sectors within society.</P>
    <P>The range of measures which the Government is introducing now and proposes to introduce address the crucial issues of accountability of the Executive and the role of the Deputy as a legislator and community representative.The Government is aware that each Deputy can make a contribution in proposing changes which can improve the way in which the Oireachtas works. From time to time the Government will advance further proposals for reform.</P>
    <P>In that context, the Government will <Col N="2184" /> accept any constructive proposals for change which it believes will add to the effectiveness of our democratic institutions.I hope that I have shown this openness to consider proposals from the Opposition in the discussions which have taken place to date on Oireachtas Reform and in the proposals relating to Oireachtas committees which I am happy to put to the House today.</P>

      <P>The Government Chief Whip used the word &ldquo;openness&rdquo;. The Government however has not treated the House properly because in dealing with the terms of reference of the committees the Government Chief Whip made no mention of a payment for the chairpersons of the four new committees.  I understand that it is the Government's intention to introduce an order to provide for such remuneration. The Government Chief Whip should have indicated this in his speech.</P>
      <P>The Government Chief Whip indicated that he was adopting a more democratic approach.  At the first available opportunity the Government introduced a Bill to provide for the appointment of two further Ministers of State. The proper approach in this instance would be to introduce the Bill providing for the privilege and compellability of witnesses at the first available opportunity.The nub of the problem is that committees do not have the power to compel witnesses to attend.  The sub-committee of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security, of which I was a member, received a favourable response.  If a person had refused to attend the sub-committee would have been powerless and unable to do anything.Rather than setting up new committees the Minister should tell the House he is prepared to bring forward that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State gives credit to the Taoiseach for pushing forward with the televising of the Dáil.  I was a member of an all-party subcommittee on law reform established by a Government of which my party was a member.  For some reason this Government does not <Col N="2185" /> seem prepared to reactivate that committee.I have in my possession a Fine Gael policy document which is signed by Deputy John Bruton and Deputy Jim Higgins, who was the Chief Whip at that time.  They brought forward in Opposition various proposals for change, one of which refers to committee chairpersons.It states that committee chairmanships would be distributed on a broadly proportional basis between parties. There is not anything in the Minister of State's speech to indicate that this will be put in place, yet it is a measure his party called for when in Opposition. Why is Fine Gael not putting it in place now?  The Opposition parties should get chairpersonships of committees in proportion to their strength in this House.</P>
    <P>I do not agree that these proposals are fundamental and radical.  The Minister stated that, from time to time, he will bring in proposals to this House.  It should be the remit of the Members of this House, by way of an all-party sub-committee on law reform, to bring forward reforms.  I accept the Minister of State has been more than amenable to me and the other Opposition Whip, Deputy O'Donnell, but the Government should not foist its proposals on this House without taking into account the proposals of the other parties.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the sub-committee of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security, of which I was a member, was debated in this House.  Fianna Fáil is on record as saying at that time that that was not the proper way to proceed. I said in this House that the order put down by the four parties involved &mdash; they were not in Government at the time but the likelihood was that some form of Rainbow Coalition would be put in place in the near future &mdash; was the genesis of the sub-committee.  I made the point that if that was the type of order the new Government was going to put in place as its first order, it did not augur well for the future.</P>
    <P>Having been a member of that sub-committee I can confirm that the attitude of Fianna Fáil has been vindicated. <Col N="2186" /> The fact that the committee felt constrained in making any findings as a result of the evidence it heard is a vindication of the stance we took in this House.  The committee members, because of constitutional and legal difficulties and the way in which the committee was set up initially, were unable to make any findings.  We knew we would be unable to make any findings based on what we heard.  Unfortunately, that is what happened but we should learn from that mistake.  I am not saying the setting up of the sub-committee was a useless exercise, but we must learn from mistakes.</P>
    <P>The compellability and privilege Bill should be brought forward immediately. Rather than setting up new committees we should concentrate our efforts on six or seven separate areas of Government and give those committees real powers to investigate and make the Executive more answerable to the Dáil.  The Minister of State said that his Government wants to ensure that the Executive is more answerable to the Dáil but the way in which oral questions have been dealt with by this Government is deplorable.The Taoiseach has transferred questions willy-nilly to other Ministers, a practice which was deplored by the Minister's party when in Opposition. Fine Gael, in its 1990 document on Dáil reform, stated:</P>
    <P>It is important that the Taoiseach be seen to answer to the Dáil for issues of overall Government policy. A practice has grown up whereby Taoisigh transfer questions put down for answer by the Taoiseach himself to other Ministers.  Fine Gael will introduce clear and transparent rules governing this practice so as to ensure that questions may not be arbitrarily transferred to other Ministers.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is rowing back on that. The former Taoisigh, Charles Haughey and Albert Reynolds, answered all questions tabled to them but the Taoiseach is not prepared to do that.</P>
    <P>Last week, Deputy O'Hanlon asked the Taoiseach if he was attending the <Col N="2187" /> Washington conference.  The question was transferred in such a way that it lost all relevance.  Deputy O'Hanlon wanted to know if the Taoiseach was going to the conference; he got a reply from the Tánaiste that he was attending it but we are still unsure about whether the Taoiseach will attend because we did not get an answer to the original question.  That has happened time and again over the past few weeks and the Minister of State should not come into the House saying that the Government wants to make the Executive more answerable to the Dáil. The Taoiseach has been evading questions during Question Time and I take no pleasure in saying that.  I put down a number of questions to the Taoiseach which were transferred to the Tánaiste. I was unable to ask questions of the Tánaiste when they arose because they were lumped together with the priority questions.  Those questions concerned issues raised by Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left when they were in Opposition.  I challenge them to change the rules which they castigated when they were in Opposition.</P>
    <P>In relation to the committees, Fianna Fáil gave a response to the Dáil reform package.  We agree with many of the proposals contained in the package but as a principle we feel it is wrong that new committees are being set up without reference to whether the chairpersons will be paid or the conditions they will work under.  It is wrong of the Government not to give a commitment on the staffing of the additional committees when one considers that we now have 17 committees of this House. Fianna Fáil is in a position to ensure that its members will attend all those committees but Democratic Left and the Progressive Democrats, with their small numbers, will find it difficult to assign personnel to these committees. That is unfair to those parties because, in effect, they will be unable to participate properly in what are supposed to be all-party committees.</P>
    <P>The Government is proposing that <Col N="2188" /> the committees be given power to discuss draft proposals for legislative change.</P>
    <P>We have no problem with that. However, the proposals on hearing submissions and evidence would cause us difficulties.  For example, if it was open season for the committees to hear evidence a myriad of lobby groups would wish to meet and put their views to them.  It is not that we do not wish to hear the opinions of people but the delay in dealing with legislation would be detrimental.</P>
    <P>We have no grave problem with all appointees to high office attending before committees but the Government should specify to whom it refers.  I tabled a Parliamentary Question on this matter recently but I did not get a specific answer.  The Minister has not indicated his position.</P>
    <P>We are in favour of some of the new committees such as the European Affairs Committee and the Small Businesses Committee but perhaps it could have been dealt with by a sub-committee of the Finance and General Affairs Committee.  The work of the proposed Environment Committee and the Sustainable Development Committee could also have been dealt by one of the major committees and the work of the Family Committee could have been dealt with by a sub-committee of the Social Affairs Committee.  I wonder why three of the new committees are being set up for a two year period.  Is it coincidental that this is the expected lifetime of the Government?  Are committees being created so that the Government will be able to give out more prizes to some of those who were disappointed because they did not fit into the first 15, the second 15, or the next two posts that were created to keep everybody happy?</P>
    <P>The Government proposes to allow Members to raise matters of concern at a particular time to which the Minister would reply by letter.  This ludicrous suggestion which flies in the face of accountability was discussed at a meeting of the Whips.  We want Ministers to come into this House and respond, <Col N="2189" /> though not necessarily immediately. Fianna Fáil proposes allowing debate on topical matters for 30 minutes immediately after the Order of Business.  This would allow Members to discuss without notice matters of urgency involving Ministers or State bodies.  The Minister with responsibility in this area could reply immediately or alternatively reply on the next available day during the same period.  We think there should be provision also for a question and answer session on the Minister's reply.</P>
    <P>We made suggestions on the proposed sitting hours.  While we want this Dáil to work and to be seen to work &mdash; the televising of the proceedings of the sub-committee on Security and Legislation changed the public perception that this House does not work &mdash; I am happy to hear the Minister say that he is prepared to change some of the proposed times.  It can take some Deputies up to six and a half hours to travel to this House.  It is unreasonable to expect people to come up on a Monday night to be here at 10 a.m. on Tuesday.  It should be remembered also that the staff have to work for hours after the House adjourns and if we are to extend the hours further there should be a commitment to further staffing.  This is something we tend to forget.  When I was Government Whip, I was the first in recent times &mdash; the late John Kelly was the first &mdash; to suggest we should sit not later than 8.30 p.m. otherwise it is unfair to staff and to the Deputies who travel considerable distances home and return the following morning.</P>
    <P>The question of grouping votes poses problems.  When Fianna Fáil was in power it made a similar proposal but on the basis that electronic voting would be in place.  We will not support the grouping of votes without electronic voting. People may absent themselves from the House and that would not be good for the way the House is perceived.  I have suggested at meetings of the Whips that there should be a standing committee to deal with Oireachtas reform, reviewing the procedures continuously to make the Oireachtas more relevant and <Col N="2190" /> accessible to the general public.  I would heartily recommend any proposals to televise this House further.  Perhaps the question of transmitting the Order of Business live should be discussed with RTE.  RTE should also be asked to make time available every day to transmit some items live.  The proceedings of the sub-Committee on Security and Legislation were viewed avidly, which proves the great public interest in the work of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>We do not wish to divide on this motion and we will accept what the Government proposes on the basis that we have not the numbers to object.  I have found the Minister of State amenable but the Government should not take the opposition for granted as we have probably done more for Dáil reform than any other party and our views should be taken into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Progressive Democrats Party agrees with the aspirations as laid out in the Government's agenda for Dáil reform, the Government's proposals are far from radical and do not hold out the possibility of achieving its aspirations for radical reform.  Nobody could disagree with aspirations to make this House more accountable, to enhancing the role of Members as legislators and making the Executive more accountable to Parliament and ensuring the Dáil has real powers to examine matters of serious public concern, particularly in a House which champions the role of Deputies in holding the Executive to account.</P>
      <P>I agree with much that Deputy Dermot Ahern has said.  If we are to reform this House in a real way, serious consideration will have to be given to the resources available to the Members of the House and to the staffing in order to beef up the performance.  It is simply unfair to expect the existing secretarial and administrative staff to resource the new committees as well as the existing committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When talking about the role of Deputies as legislators, it is important to consider the attraction to people who <Col N="2191" /> may consider entering politics.  We must take into account the responsibility of Members to their families and constituents.More work needs to be done if the reform is to be radical.  The Government's proposals fall flat because they tend to be unfocused and are nebulous apart from the proposal to have four new committees, which is very specific.</P>
    <P>Compellability of witnesses and privilege are crucial matters which have not been dealt with adequately.  It would be appropriate for Ministers and Ministers of State to be questioned at committee on a regular basis.  Any broadening of the role of committees carries with it the possibility that they will be bogged down in unfocused work.  Lobbying by interested groups is a legitimate activity in a democracy and public lobbying would be preferable to private lobbying which has been a feature of policy making.It would be better to have members of the tobacco industry or licensed vintners state their case publicly rather than do deals privately with Ministers or Members of the House.  However, it would need to be regulated otherwise committees would be bogged down in hearing endless processions of vested interest groups.</P>
    <P>The proposal that there should be a role for committees in the pre-drafting stage of Bills is interesting but it would have to be contained in some way otherwise legislation would be delayed.</P>
    <P>We would argue for increased resources for existing committees and are opposed to the expansion or proliferation of committees.  Given the constrains within which they operate, the existing legislative committess work well but they need extra resources.  Anyone who has been at a committee will vouch for the fact that, for the majority of the time the committee sits, the Minister is present with officials on one side of the table and the Opposition spokespersons on the other.  Members do not adequately attend committees and there is a temptation for them to leave matters to the spokespersons.  It is ridiculous in a democracy that they are the <Col N="2192" /> only people who scrutinise the legislation in detail and spend hours pouring over it.  The Minister has officials, programme managers, advisers and the entire Civil Service at his disposal but there is an imbalance in that the Opposition is badly resourced in challenging the Executive.  Apart from the intellectual burden imposed on the spokespersons, they are confined for hours on end and cannot attend to other work for which they may have responsibility in the House.  Levelling the playing pitch in terms of giving resources to the Opposition front bench must be looked at particularly in view of the proliferation of programme managers and advisers at the disposal of the Government.</P>
    <P>The expression &ldquo;all appointees to high office in the State&rdquo; is so vague as to be meaningless.  There is also a proviso: &ldquo;subject to the legal constraints of their office&rdquo;.  Which appointees to high office do we mean?  Is it the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Garda Commissioner and so on?  Surely this is just an expression of the status quo.  This area must be dealt with in greater detail.  It is desirable to have Ministers attend committees but I am not sure it is a good idea to enable Ministers to demand to attend at committees.The committees should have some degree of autonomy.</P>
    <P>We have experience to date of the legislative role of committees but the inquiring role has not been dealt with. The reference to the Official Secrets Acts and the fact that the Government commits itself to regularly reviewing it and other statutory provisions which restrict access to information is tinkering around with an inadequate system. We urgently need a public information Act and I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerld, is working on this.  We need to open up the organs of Government to public scrutiny.  Our democracy is based on the Westminster model with all its faults.  It is an obsessively secret model based on the fact that it is almost a challenge to the Assembly to extract information from the Government.We must get away from that mind <Col N="2193" /> set and have transparency.  One of the main objectives of an Assembly is to hold the Executive to account.</P>
    <P>In looking at reform and expansion of committees, the first priority must be compellability of witnesses and privilege.Much lip service is paid to accountability.If we are to learn any lesson from the fall of the last Government and the beef tribunal it is that the ability of a Deputy to ask questions and get a decent, honest and straightforward reply is vital in a democracy.  We may need to retrain civil servants in how to reply to Parliamentary Questions.  I recall an extract from the beef tribunal report where a civil servant was questioned by the chairman as to how he replied to parliamentary questions.  The indicators were, one was promoted if one had the skill to reply to a Parliamentary Question without offering any information. One gives the bare amount of information and the Minister is delighted because he is giving the exact answer in the minimalist way.  This is no use to the Deputy.  On one piece of paper there was a note written, whether by an administrator or a civil servant, saying: &ldquo;this reply should confuse the Deputy&rdquo;. We heard that when Eoghan Fitzsimons was Attorney General he was drafting a reply to the Taoiseach and had cause to write a letter stating: &ldquo;this does not answer the question but it is the best I can do&rdquo;.  We must examine this attitude of giving minimalist information in reply to Parliamentary Questions.</P>
    <P>If a matter is raised on an Adjournment debate or a Deputy puts down a similar question this precludes the admissibility of the Parliamentary Question.There is a need to examine how replies to Members' questions are drafted and presented, or indeed admitted, for Question Time.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said he was examining the overall matter of Members' privilege, indicating that he was somewhat concerned that Members might abuse that privilege.  I would strongly oppose any restriction of Members' privilege which constitutes a <Col N="2194" /> vital tool to enable Members raise matters of public importance or interest. The Minister of State said he had requested a subcommittee of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to examine the overall matter of Members' privilege, to ensure that it is used responsibly, with possible sanctions being imposed for abuse.  That is very dangerous, carrying the inherent presumption that something derogatory said in the House is untrue whereas, as we have experienced in the past, when Members have raised issues of public importance under privilege, as is their right, such allegations have been proved to be correct.  It is the only way in which a Member can raise matters of public importance, to challenge the parliamentary system, without threat or the danger of being sued for libel.  Therefore, any attempt to restrict or penalise the use of privilege on the part of Members to raise matters of public importance, should be frowned upon. The use of this privilege should be protected, in particular by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, that being one of its roles.</P>
    <P>We, the Progressive Democrats, have argued constantly for the establishment of a separate committee on foreign affairs with a remit to deal with European matters.  It could be argued that one of the reasons the Maastricht vote was almost lost throughout Europe was the inadequate debate on European issues within all of the parliaments of member states.  Many member state Governments, including our own were shocked to discover, when they put the Maastricht Treaty to their electorates, that their people were not with them at all, were unaware of what they had accepted, and that there was a general dearth of knowledge on all matters relating to the European Union, the information deficit already referred to. Such was the shock experienced by Governments of member states of the EU on that occasion that there has been established a Committee of Reflection, a classic EU solution, to examine the failure of the first committee system. <Col N="2195" /> The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell, is our Government representative on that committee.  Perhaps it is that people are right and that Governments must fool them into believing that Europe is good for them and their welfare.</P>
    <P>Such a subcommittee, if established would be one of the key tools of this House in rendering Europe real to our electorate, in scrutinising directives emanating from Brussels before implementation, whether in relation to agriculture, fisheries, horticulture, cheese production or whatever, a whole range of issues which have an enormous impact on people's lives.  Up to now such directives have been agreed and implemented without being subjected to any substantive debate in this house.  I would warmly welcome MEPS being given access to the deliberations of such committee, there being an enormous vacuum in such access as between Members of the European Parliament and of this Assembly.</P>
    <P>We are opposed to the establishment of the three new committees on the grounds that they have not been justified by the Minister of State today, nor in any policy document produced. There is no reason these important aspects of policy could not have been dealt with on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by the existing committees.  Such proliferation is unnecessary, the only justification being to provide paid chairmanships for each of the three chairmen.  While attending a conference in Europe &mdash; at which delegates were debating what was a region within the context of Europe &mdash; I overheard a Euro cynic say: &ldquo;A region is a place whose fund is coming&rdquo;. In relation to these three new committees proposed it could be said that a committee is reform whose paid chairmen are awaiting appointment that is the reality, all the more so because these three committees are being established for a particular time, to coincide with <Col N="2196" /> the expected lifetime of this Government.What is needed is an enhancement, a strengthening of existing committees and their resources.</P>
    <P>It is also most important that committees' budgetary proposals and expenditure be scrutinised by the relevant committees, to ensure that moneys allocated to them are never disbursed without first being fully scrutinised.</P>
    <P>We strongly oppose the proposal to put votes in the House in abeyance, to be held on a particular evening.  Such proposal is designed merely to make life easy for the Government and its Whips. If such a proposal were to be implemented, it would have to be introduced in tandem with electronic voting because we waste 20 minutes at present going through the lobbies.  If we are talking about achievable reform, surely the greatest reform to eliminate the wastage of time would be the introduction of electronic voting?</P>
    <P>I accept much of what the Minister of State said with regard to his bona fides and goodwill to listen to proposals put forward by the Opposition Whips but there are many other Members in this House who have very good ideas to contribute to this debate.  As little as possible should be left to the Whips.  After all we are talking about enhancing the role of this parliamentary Assembly, and its power, to adequately reflect real democracy, which is seen to be transparent and of genuine benefit to our electorate.</P>

      <P>I want to express my appreciation to the Minister of State and Government Chief Whip on the manner in which he has approached the various committees and their terms of reference as well as overall Oireachtas reform, on which he has been consulting consistently all concerned, his partners <Col N="2197" /> in Government and the Opposition parties, with a view to streamlining/ expanding the role of committees, in particular their legislative role, establishing new ones and reviewing our Standing Orders to render business conducted in this Chamber, in plenary session, much more efficient than unfortunately was the case over very many years.</P>
      <P>The establishment of those new legislative committees by the previous Government changed the overall manner in which this House dealt with its business, having provided a thorough, expert analysis of legislation, with relevant Bills being referred to each for indepth consideration in their committee rooms and acceptance or otherwise of amendments tabled.  Anybody who will have participated in any of their deliberations to date, as I did, will have realised how benefical those deliberations have been, how that exercise expedited the progress of legislation which up to now had been log-jammed at different stages in the Chamber.  We must remember that committee Stages are most important in that Members, with the co-operation of Governments Ministers, can attempt to have worthwhile amendments agreed and implemented.  That is why our contribution on the legislative committees has been so important.  The procedure laid down in respect of the committee system has ensured that a record amount of legislation was passed by the previous Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the points raised by many speakers &mdash; and addressed by the Minister in his opening remarks &mdash; is the question of staffing, accommodation and assistance for all parties involved in committees.  It is vital that all parties involved should be properly resourced and have the facilities of research officers to prepare members and groups, particularly non-legislative committees, to participate on committees at the most efficient level.  The Minister gave that commitment in his opening remarks and allayed the fears and concerns which he recognised were rightly expressed by <Col N="2198" /> members of the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas who on reading the original proposal presumed they would be put into operation without consultation. I assured them, through my response to their representations and in my consultation with the Minister of State, Deputy Barrett, that their concerns would be properly addressed.  In this regard we need the co-operation of the staff who may be required to work different rosters, longer hours and so on.  Of course the Government intends to discuss with the representative body of staff the changes required in the overall context of the reform package.  I want to dispel any doubts in the minds of staff that the Government will proceed without that consultation and agreement.  That was mentioned, in particular, by Opposition Whips and it is important that the Government Chief Whip and I put on record that we intend to address those concerns.</P>
    <P>The Minister also confirmed that he will bring forward the other necessary legislation which is essential for the expanding role of committees, particularly the Bill dealing with compellability.My colleague, Deputy Kavanagh, will develop that point.  As the chairperson of a very important committee of the House, he will be able to put on record the difficulties he encountered when people whom he sought to question refused to come forward.  The Bill dealing with the freedom of information must be introduced also.  Not only are committees entitled to information from Ministers, officials and holders of high office as mentioned in the documentation, the public are insisting on the right to information.  When that legislation, which is being prepared by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, comes on stream, it will ensure an openness and transparency not only in the plenary sittings of the Oireachtas but in committees, legislative committees and others which have a specific role.  I believe that when those changes are made this House will become more user friendly <i>vis-á-vis</i> the attitude and perception of the public in <Col N="2199" /> terms of being aware of the work being done by their legislators on a daily basis. I welcome the fact that the Minister is making arrangements to ensure that time slots on television channels will be available to broadcast the excellent work carried out in committees.  Such work is normally conducted behind closed doors and competes for viewing space with the plenary sitting.  This should be an incentive for committees to meet outside plenary sitting times as television coverage would be available and it would give credit to committee members who in the past few years have put so much into jobs given to them under the previous terms of reference.</P>
    <P>I am delighted also that the procedure followed for the first time with the establishment of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs was followed in setting up the new committees. When the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs was established it absorbed the then EEC legislative committee, the committee on statutory instruments and other important work evolving from Europe which has a fundamental bearing on our lives.  I am glad the Government has since confirmed that a special committee will be set up to deal with difficult issues arising from membership of the European Union, its enlargement and the possible accession of states as Cyprus, Malta and Eastern Bloc countries which would have a direct impact on our country.  It is important that not only is a committee set up to consider that particular aspect, but also to deal with legislation relating to Europe and to have at its disposal Ministers and Ministers of State with responsibility in that area.  The terms of reference of that new committee in particular are a welcome development in the changing role of Parliament which can address specifically all those areas of concern.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to the lack of an expanded role for the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  As the then Opposition Whip said, it was <Col N="2200" /> set up following a good deal of disagreement but with the agreement of four parties.  That was the beginning of a new procedure giving Members power through a sub-committee to investigate matters, to invite people to make submissions and to confer on witnesses a privilege that Members had enjoyed in the past.  It was a major breakthrough and experience was gained in that committee and from references made by Members who sat on it, although my colleagues, Deputies Derek McDowell and Eamon Walsh expressed disappointment that its terms of reference were not broad enough.  They made some useful suggestions in that regard which, I am sure, will be considered when dealing with legislation on compellability of witnesses.  I welcome the establishment of the committees which must deal with a number of Bills on which they had deliberated previously. There are hundreds of Bills from Europe which affect our daily lives and there is no committee at present to deal with that legislation.  Statutory instruments which have piled up for at least three years have not been dealt with.  It is a matter of urgency that they be dealt with.  The sooner the committees of selection are in place, meet and elect chairpersons and get on with their business, the sooner the Oireachtas can be seen to be as efficient as the Minister wants it to be.  The Minister identified that it is his aspiration that they should be efficient for the remainder of the life of this Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Ferris, for sharing his time and allowing me to contribute on this important subject.  I warmly welcome the Minister of State's initiative today in tabling the motion to set up the various committees of the House.  As Deputy Ferris said, I am the outgoing chairman of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies and have been a member of that committee since 1987. That committee is one of the oldest joint committees of the House &mdash; I understand it was set up in the 1960s &mdash; and <Col N="2201" /> has had the responsibility to investigate the activities of commercial semi-State bodies the number of which have increased over the years.  Since that time the committee has written to the previous Taoisigh and various Ministers to appeal for more powers to give the committee more teeth to enable it do its job more efficiently.  I am glad the Minister confirmed that additional terms of reference will be provided for committees. This will mean that a body such as the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies will be able to operate more efficiently in investigating semi-State bodies.  I am speaking about a committee with which I am most familiar.Today's motion will improve its workings.</P>
      <P>The demand for compellability of witnesses etc., has been answered by the Minister in that he intends to introduce separate legislation in the near future.  I would remind the Minister of State that down through the years I have heard similar replies from various Ministers for Finance that legislation would be introduced shortly.  I can show him a good deal of documentation which contains that type of phrase.  I know the Minister of State has this subject at heart and that he will introduce the Bill, I hope before the summer recess.  That is a reasonable time span in which to expect him to do the necessary work.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the new terms of reference whereby Ministers, senior civil servants and chairmen and chief executives of semi-State bodies will have to attend at committees.  My experience and that of other chairmen was that on many occasions chief executives and chairmen would not attend for one reason or another and Ministers were not required to attend the committee.The Minister of State will have to go further and not only will chairmen and chief executives of semi-State bodies be required to attend but the boards of semi-State bodies, when requested, will have to attend at meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past legal problems prevented the board of the semi-State body <Col N="2202" /> attending and giving evidence on a particular topic.  The board of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation refused to come before the committee during the past five years because it claimed to have an ongoing legal problem with suppliers and that it was not capable of being investigated so long as that problem continued.  There is no urgency to solve that problem because it cannot be investigated under the terms of reference we had prior to this. I am pleased that such problems can now be overcome.</P>
    <P>The problems of Aer Lingus Holidays received a great deal of public attention in the past.  It was an item of great public concern and involved a huge loss of money in that company.  Under the terms of reference it was not possible to investigate that company.  I hope that between the powers being given today and those we will be given under compellability will ensure that items of importance to the public, including the spending of public moneys, are voted by this House to semi-State bodies, can be investigated.  I welcome the proposals on today's motion which provides that substitute members can attend at committees for members who have other urgent business to attend to.  There has been a problem in keeping up the numbers of committees due to questions or debates in the House which members of the committee have to attend.  There were occasions when it was difficult to get a quorum to start the business.  It will be the responsibility of each party who has a member on the committee to substitute a member if the member is unable to attend.  It is important that Members of either House can attend and become involved in the discussion although they cannot participate in a vote if one is called.</P>
    <P>These changes will require additional staffing or existing staff will be required to work inordinately long hours.  I expect there will be a demand for additional staffing and, therefore, additional funding.  Not alone will funding but specialist staff, capable of giving legal advice, be required.  If witnesses <Col N="2203" /> are compelled to attend they will probably arrive with legal advisers.  Therefore chairmen and members will have to be similarly advised.</P>
    <P>Those of us who are in this House for some time know the shortcomings and hope the motion will eliminate them. An issue which is near and dear to all our hearts in that in past committee members, attending committees, suffered from the lack of publicity.  The general public visit this House and there is televising of the Dáil chamber.  Many people ask where are the other Members when many of us are attending committee meetings.  I hope we can televise all committee meetings, especially public hearings in the case of a Joint Committee where evidence is given and where the press and the media are in attendance.  Those hearings would be topical and would attract television audiences.  We became aware recently that people have a great desire to see how these Houses operate and how we conduct our business.</P>
    <P>There is much more we could say at this time.  I welcome the motion and look forward to the further legislation required to overcome the difficulties of existing committees and to provide for setting up new committees, as a result of Government policy in this area.</P>

      <P>This is my first opportunity in the House to congratulate Deputy Seán Barrett on his appointment as Government Chief Whip.  I wish him well in that post and offer him any assistance or advice he may need from time to time in his onerous task.  So far as the proposals go, they are a good start for the Government Chief Whip in furthering the reform of the House of the Oireachtas and building on the <Col N="2204" /> experience and the reforms of the past eight to ten years.</P>
      <P>A hobbyhorse of mine is that when the Houses rise from plenary session in June or July you, a Cheann Comhairle, make the announcement that the House has adjourned to some date in October. The media do their usual thing saying we are all gone on holidays for three or four months.  The public believe that because they want to believe it.  I ask the Minister of State to ensure that the announcement makes clear that the Dáil is adjourning to take committees during July and September.  Despite the impression some people seek to give, the work of the House continues during those months.</P>
      <P>We can spend as much time as we like talking about Oireachtas reform but unless it is part of a wider institutional reform programme we will be wasting our time.  While the legislative committees were successful in what they were originally set up to do.  Members were put to the pin of their collar to attend committee meetings because of the pressure of Dáil business and other business outside the House.  Oireachtas reform should be seen in the wider context of institutional and local government reform.  If the changes we make are not accompanied by changes in other areas they will amount to nothing. In future it may be decided that Members should not have a dual mandate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday the sub-committee of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security presented its report.  I have heard much weeping and gnashing of teeth by Government Deputies at the failure of the sub-committee to adjudicate on the evidence presented to it. Some of these Deputies are hypocritical in the extreme.  Fianna Fáil put forward a motion to ensure that the sub-committee would have the power to take evidence, cross-examine witnesses and adjudicate on the evidence presented, but it was rejected by all the other parties.We also proposed that the sub-committee should be chaired by a senior <Col N="2205" /> judicial figure so as to protect the constitutional rights of witnesses.  The sub-committee could not adjudicate on the evidence because of the way it had to be presented and the consideration which had to be given to the constitutional rights of witnesses.  We put forward a proposal which would have protected those rights and would have given the sub-committee the power to adjudicate on the evidence.</P>
    <P>One must ask why the other parties did not support our motion.  Most of the Members who led the charge for an investigation were more interested in blood letting, political posturing and revenge than in knowing the truth.  I very much regret their decision to reject our motion.  The people who are crying on the public airwaves and issuing statements to newspapers should examine their consciences as they are the ones who decided that the sub-committee should not have the power to adjudicate on the evidence presented to it.  It is hypocritical of them and people in the media, who knew the terms of reference, to express surprise at the failure of the sub-committee to adjudicate on the evidence.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State said that proper secretarial and research facilities would be provided for Members and that proper accommodation would be provided for the staff.  These issues are very dear to my heart and I will support any proposals in this regard.  Deputy Kavanagh was one of the best chairmen of the Joint Committee on Semi-State Bodies. I will probably be shot for suggesting that instead of a Joint Committee on Women's Rights we should have an equality committee.  The Minister of State should consider changing the title of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights so that it is more inclusive.  This positive move would be very much welcomed.Consideration should also be given to extending the terms of reference of the Joint Committee on Semi-State Bodies.  The aborted Fianna Fáil-Labour Programme for Government contained proposals which would have <Col N="2206" /> given that committee the powers to which Deputy Kavanagh referred.</P>
    <P>While the proposals on Oireachtas reform in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, have been taken from the Fianna Fáil-Labour programme, the Government, which has committed itself to openness, accountability and transparency, failed to take on board the proposal for a Taoiseach's question time for a period of ten or 15 minutes on Wednesdays and Thursdays to deal with additional matters of a topical nature, notice of the general matters to be raised to be given at 10.30 a.m. before the questioning would take place.  I wonder where the Government of openness, accountability and transparency has disappeared to.  I ask the Minister of State to seek Government approval for the introduction of this proposal.  He can be assured of our support in doing this.  We need to do more than pay lip service to the concepts of openness, accountability and transparency.  We should put our money where our mouth is and put in place a procedure whereby the Taoiseach can be questioned in the House.  As Deputy Ahern said, it is very difficult to get the Taoiseach to answer questions and I can understand why he may be reluctant to discuss topical matters.</P>
    <P>Much work was done in a very short space of time in regard to the compellability and privilege of witnesses.  A Bill dealing with these issues should be brought forward as a matter of urgency. There is little point in setting up committees if witnesses are able to run for cover every time they are asked to attend a meeting and answer questions.</P>
    <P>Provision was made in the Estimates for the appointment of a legal officer to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Will the Minister of State confirm that position will be filled?</P>

Ach sílim má dheinimíd a leithéid go <Col N="2207" /> gcaithfidh sé a bheith feicthe go bhfuil dul chun cinn á dhéanamh againn agus nach bhfuil athruithe á dhéanamh againn ar mhaithe le athruithe amháin.</P>

      <P>Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sin ceart. Sílim go mba cheart go mbeadh athnuachaint cheart á dhéanamh ar an Dáil seo.  Sílim gurb é an rud atá ag teastáil ón bpobal ná go mbeadh freagracht ag institiúidí uilig an Stáit don Dáil.  Sin mar ba cheart dó a bheith.</P>
      <P>When people talk of reform the agenda is normally reduced to one or two matters, namely, more committees, longer hours and more legislation.  The general public do not consider that a proper agenda, the people want simple answers to simple questions.</P>
      <P>It is important that legislation is brought forward and dealt with speedily, but it is also important that we do not get caught in the trap of introducing legislation for the sake of introducing it. It concerns me when people judge the work of the Dáil by the amount of legislation it passes in a year, as if we were producing shoes in a factory.  We should examine the way our legislation is written.I understand the format used in other countries is different.  Could legislation not be written in a more intelligible fashion?  Both the ordinary punter and legislator would need many reference books to understand the legislation and other Acts to which they are referred.  While there are many things in Europe with which I do not agree, its directives appear to be written in a much more intelligible fashion than is our legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am allergic to committees.  I detest rushing in and out of committees or when I can only attend one of two committees of which I am a member.  I believe in continuity of attendance at committees and, rather than the plethora of committees proposed under this <Col N="2208" /> reform, I would prefer a smaller number of committes with a larger number of members present and more continuity in attendance.</P>
    <P>I support calling witnesses before committees and the proposal under which the various quangoes, semi-State bodies and authorities could be called before not only the Committee of Public Accounts but before other committees.</P>
    <P>I am sure all Members favour more television coverage and I would welcome greater coverage of Dáil proceedings and speakers.  This would avoid questions on how the proceedings to be televised are selected.  I would welcome total coverage of Question Time and the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>On the question of sitting hours, because a small section of the media based in Dublin believe we do not sit enough hours, we sometimes fall into the trap of believing that if we do not sit day and night, the public will think we do not work.  The time broadcasters spend in the studio broadcasting is very small compared with the time they spend working.  We must consider not only the legislative role of a Deputy, but his or her total role.  The sitting hours of the Dáil must allow us to do our work properly.  I live in a constituency more than 100 miles long which includes offshore islands.  I live 160 miles from this House.  On average, I travel in excess of 50,000 miles per annum and I have no occupation other than as a Member of this House.  I am lucky if I can spend four or five hours at home on a Sunday afternoon.  It is time we were realistic about Dáil sitting hours.</P>
    <P>If the Dáil sits earlier on Tuesdays and committees sit on Fridays, the rural Deputies, who cannot travel home each night, will have four nights at a maximum, if Sunday night is included to attend the plethora of meetings which we must attend in our constituencies.  It is pointless comparing ourselves with other parliaments.  Many of them operate list systems and I would not support <Col N="2209" /> the Oireachtas introducing such a system.The beauty of our democratic system is that the average punter knows his or her public representative.</P>
    <P>Rural Deputies have a right to attend all sittings of the Dáil.  If the Dáil sits at 11.30 a.m. on Tuesdays I would have to get up at 5.30 a.m. and leave my home at 6.30 a.m.  As I frequently travel 40 or 50 miles to a constituency meeting on Monday nights I may not arrive home until 1 a.m. or 2 a.m. on Tuesday.  An 11.30 a.m. start on Tuesdays would mean a long day's work for me with perhaps only four or five hours' sleep the previous night.  I do not know of any other job in which people would consider that reasonable.  Friday sittings will exclude rural Deputies.  We know the reality but we do not like to admit it. Rural Deputies will come into the House on a Friday morning and head for the hills or wherever as quickly as possible.  We should not cod ourselves, we do not want a scandal over nonattendance during these unrealistic sitting hours.  It would be much more acceptable to have realistic sitting hours during which we could give our full attention to the work.</P>
    <P>The question of sitting hours must be reviewed taking into account the total workload of Members.  We need additional resources and full secretarial services.  At present many Members are served by the same secretary.  Under this reform package the Government should institute an analysis of the workload of Members to assess the work they do and the resources to do it.  Until we do that, talking about extending sitting hours is pie-in-the-sky.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of discussing the question of Dáil Reform.  There is general consensus that such reform is long overdue.  The purpose of reform must be to make the Executive more accountable and to make Ministers more easily and quickly accountable on issues of the day. Reform should enable all Members to perform better as legislators.  People frequently ask how much time Members <Col N="2210" /> allocate to legislative work and how much they allocate to constituency work.  Of course, in some instances the two overlap.  The general view is that Dáil Deputies spend about 80 per cent of their time on constituency work, leaving 20 per cent of their time to deal with legislation.  That is not how it should be. When I was first elected I had the idealistic view that I would change the world by bringing in all forms of legislation that would be benefical to my county and country but that is not how things worked out.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that in Great Britain the situation is the opposite; representatives spend 80 per cent of their time legislating and 20 per cent in their constituencies.  When we see their equivalent of &ldquo;Oireachtas Report&rdquo; on television, the House of Commons is normally full.  This Chamber is not full because our colleagues are in their offices snowed under with clinic sheets from last weekend and having to make telephone calls on this, that or the other issue.  We have a long way to go and anything the Minister can do to change the situation would benefit the country. We would all welcome not having to run clinics and deal with issues that our constituency colleagues have dealt with before us or, if not, will deal with after us.</P>
      <P>In my constituency the same constituent goes to the clinic of all five TDs. That has to be wrong and I do not know how it can be addressed as we are all looking for that constituent's vote. Ironically the person who travels between the five TDs will probably not vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland the only effective body of legislators is the Cabinet.  All other Oireachtas Members are common fodder for the voting lobbies.  I accept the good intentions of the Government parties on this issue but the proposals before use are not the best way forward. We do not need more committees, but more effective committees.  The effectiveness of a committee can be judged on a number of criteria, including the powers vested in it and the time and <Col N="2211" /> resources its members have to devote to its business.  I welcome the additional powers proposed for committees.  Some of the current proposals may need to be fine-tuned.  The bottom line, however, is that an effective committee system must have the powers to summon and question witnesses.  Above and beyond the theoretical powers that may be vested in committees is their effectiveness.  This comes down to the time and resources members have to devote to committees. The present system is not working at its best for lack of both time and resources. More of the same will not help.</P>
    <P>Let me refer to what Deputy Ó Cuív said earlier about Friday sittings and the suggestion that there might even be Monday sittings.  It is well known by Dáil Deputies from rural areas as far afield as my own &mdash; and I am not the furthest from the Dáil, living 110 miles from here &mdash; that county councils, residents' associations and politicians meet on Mondays and also on Fridays.  I ask that we be practical and not run before the media and allow them to make decisions for us.  We have constituencies to run, people to look after, and as long as the system is in its present form, we cannot possibly be here on either Mondays or Fridays.</P>
    <P>Getting elected in a multi-seat constituency is time consuming and I assume nobody is saying that is not a priority.  It most certainly is, and time is a scarce resource in politics.  Deputies must feel that committee particiption is useful and by that I mean that the work done is effective and is recognised.  That means that the television camera must be in every room, because where the cameras go increasingly the print media follow, and that ensures as full as possible a House at any given time.</P>
    <P>Government is increasingly complex. As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts for the past two years, I felt hampered by the lack of backup research.  The Departments appearing before us were expert in their areas. They had a plethora of people who had days to research.  Committee members <Col N="2212" /> were barely hitting the ground in spots. We can readily say that a committee would be far more effective if its members had research facilities.  I ask the Minister to take this on board. Researchers will cost extra but if the committees are to do their jobs properly they are essential and, in the long term, may be cost effective.</P>
    <P>An effective committee system is one that has the fewest committees with the minimum number of members.  The committee should in turn have powers to enable it to reach across the length and breath of its mandate.  Its members must have the research facilities to enable them to come to meetings briefed on the issues they are to deal with. By these criteria much is lacking in the present proposals.  Committee chairpersons are to be paid.  The responsibility of the chairman, if properly exercised, is undoubtedly time consuming.  I have no objection in principle to the payment of an allowance for the position of chairperson.However, giving a chairperson £8,000 per annum while not appointing extra research staff is putting the cart before the horse.  Effective committees must have a politically appointed staff to research and develop a committee agenda.  As it is, civil servants and Government Ministers can literally run rings around the committees when they are so minded.</P>
    <P>There is a strong majority in favour of major reforms.  Goodwill exists on all sides.  I hope the Minister will accept my comments in the constructive spirit in which they are offered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no hesitation in acknowledging the Government's good intentions in restructuring the committees, forming additional committees, making the Houses more open and accountable and giving Members plenty of work to do.  The last Government, under Deputy Noel Dempsey, then Government Chief Whip, made massive strides in the area of Dáil reform.  For a number of years prior to that, successive Governments and parties tried to make <Col N="2213" /> the Dáil more relevant and to have good committees.</P>
      <P>I recognise that the Government has political problems in accommodating three parties in Government.  Not everybody can be in the Cabinet or in the second level.  Such considerations are not confined to Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left in Government.  They would also exist if the Progressive Democrats, Fianna Fáil and Labour were in Government.  A certain amount of politics has to be played and people have to be accommodated.  I have no compunction about saying that, as long as we all recognise it.  What I object to is that prople are dressing it up and saying it is being done for a certain reason when that is not the case.</P>
      <P>I may be a minority in this House in the views I am expressing but it is worth making a number of points.  I recognise that there is a need for greater participation by Senators and Deputies, that there should be more committees and they should have more power &mdash; I am sure the Government will introduce the privilege and compellability of witnesses Bill &mdash; but at this stage I can nearly pick the day prior to the Christmas or summer recess when a cerain newspaper will include an article indicating how long the Dáil will be in recess and where Deputies are going to on their holidays. I always refused as a matter of principle to indicate where I was going.  Like the Minister of State, Deputy Barrett, each year in the middle of March I visit the middle of England where we have enjoyed ourselves on occasion.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to follow me this year also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not make any difference to a backbencher, regardless of whether he or she is a member of a Government party, whether the Dáil is sitting.  When I was a backbencher the best times of the year were those when the Dáil was sitting because one could get away from one's constituents.  Ninety-nine per cent of Deputies are up to their oxters in constituency paperwork.  Some are better at this than others; I do not regard myself as being in the first division of <Col N="2214" /> constituency workers.  That is not a secret.</P>
    <P>I am tired of the newspapers every few months carrying cheap headlines denigrating all Deputies, few of whom stand up for themselves regardless of which side of the House they are on. There is a &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; factor in increasing the number of committees because the media are demanding that we should be seen to be busy.  It has become more important in Irish life to be seen to be doing something; in politics one would probably be better off doing nothing and not making decisions. One should give the impression that one will do something and never do it because then one would never be blamed for anything.  Another principle is that one should not speak too much either because there is a danger that one will get into trouble.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the proposed reforms which are necessary they are based on a false premise.  Deputy Byrne outlined what backbenchers in all parties do.  They work a colossal number of hours each week.  We should not be doing much of this work but there is a snag for most Deputies in that the brightest fellows in Wexford, Dún Laoghaire, Tipperary or Kildare think they should be representing their constituents but if they do not vote for them at election time they will not be here.</P>
    <P>Fifteen years ago I was invited to speak by an organisation on any topic I liked &mdash; it was not a political function &mdash; in an obscure part of Ireland, County Cavan.  I wrote a script, something I did not often do this at the time, about our electoral system.  I have come to the view that the best thing would be to change it.  I recognise the merits of the multi-seat, proportional representation system.  The public and the media who criticise us like it because lobby and constituency groups have an input and the elected representative is made accountable to the people.</P>
    <P>There was accountability long before the Government started talking about it. We have the most accountable system in Europe.  It is becoming increasingly <Col N="2215" /> difficult to get elected because if a Deputy is not doing the work their colleague, more often than not in the same party, is.  Deputies spend less time at election time worrying about what other parties are doing; usually they worry about what their own colleagues are doing.  Until now the Labour Party has had a single candidate in constituencies; when it has two or more candidates it will learn, as the Minister of State, Deputy Barrett, and I have learned, that it is not so nice.  Therefore we spend much time doing unnecessary work but if we fail to do it we will not be elected. While proportional representation is the best method, the multi-seat electoral system gives us much grief.</P>
    <P>The only people who will benefit from the new committee system are Government Ministers because they will not be subjected to the same glare of publicity in a committee room as they would in Dáil Éireann.  On the other hand Deputies from all parties will be running to committees all over the place with the result that their constituency paperwork will mount up.  They will neglect one at the expense of the other. If they fail to attend the committees the media will ask why did the Labour Party Deputies not attend and if they fail to look after the interests of their constituents in Tipperary South or Cork South Central they will be abused.  If they fail to turn up for the local council meeting on Mondays they will also be abused.</P>
    <P>We could avoid this if we change the electoral system.  My party tried to do this on two occasions.  It made a mistake on the second occasion by trying to replace it with a first past the post system, which I would not favour.  When I advocated change in the electoral system I never put forward that alternative. The debate on the first past the post system concentrated on the number of seats Fianna Fáil would win and the argument was that every other party would be wiped out.  There is cross-party support for the abolition of the multi-seat system, particularly among members of the Minister of State's <Col N="2216" /> party.  A former Leader of that party, Liam Cosgrave, felt so strongly about it that he would even have opted for the first past the post system.</P>
    <P>We should consider establishing an ad hoc all-party committee comprised of like-minded people to see if it could come up with a better electoral system. There are people in my own party and on the other benches, particularly in the Fine Gael Party, who would agree with me.  Their number has increased during the years.</P>
    <P>Apart from the multi-seat electoral system debilitating Deputies and giving them coronaries because they have to do much unnecessary work, the media is demanding that this should be a legislative Chamber.  It is not; the only place where legislation can be changed is the Cabinet room.  A certain procedure is adopted.  Legislation is drafted by civil servants and presented to the Government and then to the Dáil.  In theory we can change it but how many times has legislation of substance been changed in this House?  The answer is very seldom because people do not have the expertise or the time to devote to it.</P>
    <P>We will now have more committees. This is a move in the right direction but we have this albatross of the multi-seat electoral system on our back.  I have no quarrel with the Government parties because we would have done the same or something similar.  Everybody is trying to participate in the legislative process but they are unable to do so.  A single seat proportional representation system or a combination of both systems has been suggested.  I will avoid indicating my preference because I do not want the next debate on it to get bogged down like debates we had in the 1950s and 1960s.  If we had such a system we could reform local government also because it could be made a condition that one could not be a member of a local authority while a Member of Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>TDs are right to demand better backup services and research facilities and if they were provided this House and the <Col N="2217" /> committees would become proper legislative assemblies.  We must come up with a system that will provide the accountability the Irish people want from their public representatives within the proportional representation system. When I spoke on this subject in the past I did not argue that the system should be changed because it was difficult for TDs.  I said the multi-seat electoral system has led to more bad decision-making in this House than anything else because when it comes close to the time of an election, a Government will make decisions to get the last seats in some constituencies.  Regardless of what Government is in power, be it a single party or multi-party arrangement, its eye will not be on the ball and it will make bad decisions.  There is a great temptation in parties who run a number of candidates to run additional candidates who do not pose a threat to the main candidate.  Candidates for the Dáil will always hope that their party will win the majority of seats, but not want at their expense.  A person who says anything else is not telling the truth.</P>
    <P>The multi-seat system had led to ridiculous economic decisions being take over the years.  It is resulting in Governments being led by opinion polls which is the way the system operates in the United States.  Our system is increasingly going down that road and that is regrettable.  Deputy Byrne was correct when he said that, apart from the Government Ministers, Members of this House are lobby fodder because we do not have the time or the resources to devote ourselves to legislation.  Regardless of how many new committees of this House are set up that will always be the case while we have a multi-seat electoral system.</P>
    <P>I had not intended contributing to this debate but I have not spoken for some time about the electoral system.  My party in Government would have gone forward with Oireachtas reform but all this reform is built on a bad foundation. I hope that in the coming years we will set up an informal ad hoc committee to <Col N="2218" /> examine the possibility of having a better electoral system.  When that happens I will fully support proposals to have more committees with real powers. Members will then feel that they are really part of the legislative process.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy McCreevy in his view of our multi-seat proportional representation electoral system and the degree to which it militates against good legislative performance in this House.  Since becoming a TD I have proposed an alternative electoral system, namely, a single seat PR system which would be infinitely better than our electoral system.  Electoral reform is inextricably bound up with Dáil reform and if we do not deal with the issue of electoral reform we will only make slow progress in this area.</P>
      <P>There was a suggestion at one time that the House would establish a commission of people involved in political science, electoral politics and so on to do research in this area and put a number of options before the House in terms of alternative electoral systems. The Government should establish such a commission which would lay a report before the House on alternative electoral systems to be debated by Members.  I am a realist and I acknowledge that people are afraid of change and would be concerned about the impact on them of a change in the electoral system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe passionately in the need for a change in our electoral system.  I am a member of a five seat constituency and the provision of a public light on a roadway can cause 11 public representatives to attend a public meeting on the issue. There may be five TDs, one or two Senators who are aspiring to become TDs and three to four local councillors from the ward who might also have a eye on a Dáil seat in the future.  Those public representatives will agree to write to the city manager or the engineer urging them to make the requisite change.  There will be 11 replies to those letters.  There is then a contest to see <Col N="2219" /> how quickly those public representatives can get the replies to their constituencies.I used the example of a public light but there is a plethora of such genuine local issues.  One must ask whether they demand the attention of 11 public representatives.  A multi-seat electoral systems leads to massive duplication and a great waste of energy and time, particularly in four and five seat urban constituencies where there is not the same geographical demarcation as there may be in some rural constituencies.</P>
    <P>The proposals before the House have more to do with bonding the Government parties together than a genuine attempt at Dáil reform.  There is an element of &ldquo;jobs for the boys&rdquo; in the proposals before us.  The chairmanships and the convenor positions will be eagerly sought &mdash; some weeks ago Deputy Ned O'Keeffe referred to them as &ldquo;little jobeens&rdquo; on offer.  People are becoming a little cynical of this type of exercise and there is a danger that few Government backbenchers will feel they can criticise the Government in relation to various issues because they will be seeking such &ldquo;jobeens&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I took the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, at his word when I listened to his first speech as Taoiseach.  During the trauma of last November I listened intently to his reference to the lack of accountability, the need for greater transparency and so forth.  As a newcomer to the Fianna Fáil Front Bench I engaged in a Question Time debate with the Ministers for Education and Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, and I have raised a number of issues on the Adjournment and in Private Members' time.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's protestation and his oft stated objective that accountability is the number one item on his agenda is nothing more than a sham.  I tabled seven questions yesterday and the cumulative length of the answers from the Department of Education to the seven questions was six lines.  I asked such simple questions as what it would <Col N="2220" /> cost to bring mature students within the scope of the higher education grants scheme; what it would cost to bring part-time students within the scope of the higher education grants scheme and specifically what it would cost to raise maintenance grants at third level from their present level to £2,400.  The one line reply to those three questions was that data was not readily available.</P>
    <P>I had tabled the questions originally to the Department of Finance because they involved a cost to the Exchequer and I had used the phrase &ldquo;cost to the Exchequer&rdquo; in the question but they were transferred to the Minister for Education.  Is that accountability, or endeavouring to give the fullest information possible to Members?</P>
    <P>During priority questions Ministers tend to read out very long speeches.  Of the 20 minutes available for priority questions, 16 or 17 minutes are taken up by the Minister's deliberately evasive replies.  I accept that might have applied to previous Administrations but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the present Taoiseach in this House specifically condemned the evasive answers at Question Time.  There has been no change, if anything it has got worse.  The Minister for Education believes she does not have to respond to education matters on the Adjourment.  Recently we raised two major items on the Adjourment including the proposed teachers' strike which everybody would agree is an important issue.  Deputy Keogh from the Progressive Democrats Party was successful in raising it on the Adjournment and was generous enough to share time with me but it was the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare who responded on behalf of the Minister for Education.  I mean no offence to that Minister but he was not the appropriate person to respond to a debate on the Adjournment on an important matter such as threatened <Col N="2221" /> industrial action on the issue of early retirement.</P>
      <P>When I tabled questions about the respective responsibilities of the Ministers of State at the Department of Education I received a reply which indicated that Deputy Allen was &ldquo;the Minister for Adjournment debates and Private Members' debates, except major issues&rdquo;.  If that is accountability by Ministers who are statutorily responsible for the issues that are raised on the Adjournment and during Private Members' time, it is a far cry from what we were led to believe would be a change in the way the House does its business.</P>
      <P>I spoke to Deputy O'Rourke on this issue.  She took great pride in the fact that it was part and parcel of her <i>modus operandi</i> to attend all Adjournment debates relating to her Department because she felt that this was an instrument for Members to articulate issues of vital concern in their constituency.  If the Government has respect for the House, a Minister at the very least should be disposed to attending Adjournment debates.  I got figures detailing the Minister for Education's performance on Adjournment debates and out of a possible 114 we could count her attendance at 14 in the past two to three years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The first priority of Government should be the House, it is not a question of people being everywhere but of ordering priorities.  Deputy Ferris's intervention probably conveys the mind set that is informing Ministers who feel they do not have to turn up for the Adjournment.  It will make this House irrelevant.  We are elected by the people to articulate their views in this <Col N="2222" /> House and if we do not get the respect of Ministers who will attend to hear what we say on behalf of our constituents, it is a sad look out.  It makes a mockery of all the protestations about Dáil reform.  That was why I used strong language when I declared that in my view all the rhetoric about accountability and transparency is nothing more than an empty sham.</P>

      <P>Other Ministers are better but that practice should be stamped out and, where possible, Ministers should attend Adjournment debates.  If we are to have the practice where Ministers will decide whether the matter taken in Private Members' time is important enough for them to attend that is a serious erosion of the status of this House.  Deputy Allen has been listed in a written reply as the Minister responsible for Adjournments and Private Members Business, except major items.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I regarded my opening remarks as very positive in terms of the need for elected reform.  Furthermore, the points made by Deputy Hugh Byrne on the need for research facilities is critical, particularly if we are to improve the capacity of Members to contribute <Col N="2223" /> at committees.  I hope the forthcoming electoral Bill will address this issue as it will deal with party political funding.  It should be part and parcel of that Bill that such funding should be targeted to research and development particularly towards establishing proper research in political parties generally.</P>
      <P>For far too long we have been dominated by one type of expertise and very often we see Government Ministers handing out contracts to consultants. Irrespective of whether a party is in Government it needs to be building up an independent bank of expertise that produces alternative viewpoints and perspectives to the official line that one may get from Government Departments.That is not to critise the information that emanates from the public service as very often it is of excellent quality.  The fact that we lack an independent capacity for research and that political parties have not had the resources to develop such a capacity is an indictment of our political system.  As Deputy McCreevy said, legislation comes before us as a <i>fait accompli</i> and rarely are Bills substantially amended as they go through the House.  Before Bills are drafted greater use should be made of the committee system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">

      <P>There are a number of Bills on the Order Paper.  Perhaps we should go back to the drawing board and give Members an opportunity to put forward their views.  Too often there is a diktat from the centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We need to change the electoral system.A commission should be formed to set out the various options.  Research assistance should be given to Opposition Members and to members of local authorities.  As regards the length of <Col N="2224" /> time the Dáil and committees will sit, Deputy McCreevy made valid points regarding the demands of Members <i>vis-á-vis</i> local government.  Proposals for reform often do not take into account the fact that many Members travel long distances to attend the Dáil.  With our electoral system it is not possible for many people to give up their local authority seat and concentrate fully on the Dáil.  To do so could mean electoral suicide for many Deputies.  In the present context, membership of local authorities is essential for political survival.We must take that into account.</P>
    <P>I understand chairpersons of Dáil committees must retire from local authorities.That is not in the best interests of some Members, particularly if there is a change of Government after two years.  For example, if an election is called a Minister of State could lose his seat having already lost a local authority seat.  These are the issues we must take on board when dealing with Dáil reform.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the appointment of chairpersons, the previous Government made statutory provision to enable any Government to make an appropriate order.  That matter has not been considered at Government yet.  I presume chairmanships will be paid positions.  I would expect them to be so if we are to have committees which operate properly.I do not see anything wrong with that.  It is only reasonable that people who take on additional responsibility and work should be paid and should be seen to be earning what they are paid.</P>
      <P>The draft Bill on privilege and compellability has been in existence for four or five years.  As soon as I came into office I made inquiries about it because I accept the point that many of the provisions in the new terms of reference cannot be used unless we have this legislation.I accept that the legislation is urgent and I intend to pursue the matter on a weekly basis until the Bill is published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2225" /> It has been established that the Opposition will hold the chairmanship of the Committee of Public Accounts and the Committee on Women's Rights and I propose to allocate one of the chairs of the new committees to the Opposition. I reject the criticism that the additional committees are designed to facilitate some kind of patronage.  I stand over the case I made for a committee on European affairs.  It is legitimate that we should have such a committee given that our lives are controlled more and more by what is happening in Europe.  It would afford a forum for MEPs, including those elected for Northern Ireland, to attend if they so wished and give us the benefit of their experience and take part in debates.  As regards the committee on the family I make no apology for having a group of elected representatives look at the family and the role the State plays &mdash; perhaps even the damage it does.  As regards the committee on sustainable development, that is a reality we must face coming into the 21st century.  Anyone who knows about business will recognise that growth in job opportunities is in the area of small business and to have a committee examine reports, bring forward ideas, question Minister and have Ministers address it on improving the environment for small business can only do good.</P>
    <P>We are not asking every Member of the Dáil to serve on these committees. We are talking about 15 Deputies and four Senators and for the committee on European affairs it will be 11 Deputies and six Senators.  It will involve a small number of Deputies from each party, on a proportional basis.  We are not talking about giving Deputies huge workloads. Let us not fool ourselves or project a different image.  Three or four committees have been given tasks to perform within a time limit of two years.  At the end of two years, if they have not completed their work, they can come back here, have their request for an extension examined and, if they do not prove to be worthwhile, they can be replaced.  I served on a committee on crime during <Col N="2226" /> the life of the Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Government, a very good committee which produced some reports.  It was overtaken by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security. I do not believe in having committees constitute a handy way of providing positions for Members.  Of course, some such positions will arise; nobody would expect the position to be otherwise.</P>

Will he confirm whether these committees would ever see the light of day if it transpired there was no payment to those who would chair them?  Furthermore, will he agree that, in terms of resourcing the committee system, it would be better if funds were targeted at staffing and research facilities rather than paying chairmen?</P>
      <P>Has the Minister of State any proposals to address the concerns I raised about how such committees would disburse moneys allocated to them, or on how they would be rendered more accountable?</P>
      <P>Will he respond to my query about the long-promised Freedom of Information Bill on which the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, has been working since being appointed? What on earth is causing the delay in introducing that vital Bill to allow information be made more widely available publicly, rather than concentrating on the Minister's emphasis on frequently reviewing the Official Secrets Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, will he respond to the concern expressed by rural Members that committee sittings, primarily on Fridays, will exclude their participation and that there will be an <Col N="2227" /> unhelpful/unnecessary bias in policy-making in favour of urban Members.

      <P>In regard to the operation of Question Time &mdash; I was not endeavouring to be negative in my contribution but to be frank and honest &mdash; irrespective of who may be in Government, the manner in which questions are answered leaves much to be desired.  It certainly has very little to do with accountability and with furnishing Members with the fullest possible information.  It has been my experience that, since this Government assumed office, the position has deteriorated.Has the Minister any proposals to facilitate Members at Question Time, particularly in the type of answers furnished and, more importantly, in laying down clear, independent guidelines on the manner in which questions are ruled out of order, on which there would appear to be some tick-tacking between Departments and the relevant office here?</P>

Will the Minister consider introducing legislation to ensure that all holders of high office including for instance the Director of Public Prosecutions, are amenable to committees of this House?  There was much talk about accountability immediately before and after the fall of the previous Government.  While generally welcoming the provision that Ministers would appear before committees, or be requested to consider certain matters, will the Minister of State confirm that that facility will not be used to pre-empt issues being discussed in this House, that a Minister will not bat them off, saying he will discuss it with the committee, or request their consideration of the matter?</P>

It would appear to me to be unfair to any parliamentary group, that it would not be represented in a committee of that kind.  Will the Minister agree to re-examine the proposed membership of that committee in order to at least guarantee every group in this House the right to participate?  It is not as if we are endeavouring to collect committee memberships like children at the Spring Show, we merely want to ensure that at least we are members of everything, as of right, whether or not we shall have the requisite resources.</P>

    <P>The freedom of information Bill is currently in the course of preparation. <Col N="2230" /> Two Government parties had not been involved previously in dealing with draft legislation and much of it has had to be reviewed in the context of the new Government.  I hope the freedom of information Bill will be published soon and will pass through the Dáil and the Seanad this year, but I cannot give a guarantee on that.</P>
    <P>Regarding Friday's sittings, people have complained that there may be a lack of television coverage of committees.The proposal I put forward was not to change Dáil sitting times but to allow committees to sit from 12 noon to 2.30 p.m. on Tuesdays and on Fridays.  There are not very many people involved in committees but they will have to sit on those days if they are to secure television coverage to enable the people see the work being done.  The committees can advertise what matters will be discussed the following week.  Hopefully, in time, there will be live coverage of committees by Telefís na Gaeilge.  We have heard complaints today about 80 per cent of Deputies' time being spent on constituency work and 20 per cent dealing with legislation.  The reality is that a great deal of work is done here about which the public are not aware and for which credit is not given.  I would like credit to be given for it.</P>
    <P>I do not have an answer for Deputy O'Donnell regarding the Library service, but I will check the position.</P>
    <P>Regarding the electoral commission, that matter could be discussed by one of the committee.  I do not have a proposal with regard to it but the ideal committee to consider it would be the one dealing with the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>Committee meetings can serve as a substitute for Question Time, as it were, in that Ministers can be called and made answerable for various matters in committee where long discussions can take place and they are not confined, as in Question Time, to a given time slot.  I believe that provision will ensure greater openness than has been the case up until now.</P>
    <P>On electronic voting, I am aware that <Col N="2231" /> my predecessor did some work on this and I will have to take it from there.  I am aware that if we streamline voting, Members fear it will suit the Government, but Governments change.  We must be prepared to be more reasonable in the manner in which we use our time and Members should not have to traipse in here four or five times a day for a vote which can take 20 minutes.  If Members are not prepared to change the voting system on the basis that if they agree to do so they will be assisting the present Government, the present system will never change.  It is up to us to decide whether we wish to change and perhaps have group votes.  If the voting system were changed, it would not make much difference.  The chance of a snap vote and defeat for the Government is unlikely and I cannot remember one in the last 15 years.</P>

      <P>Deputy Quill and others made a case for this amendment on Committee Stage and amendment No. 3 in my name addresses the issue.  My amendment states: &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, includes railways and related buildings and structures and any place comprising the remains or traces of any such railway, building or structure.&rdquo;  It is a deliberate attempt to handle the question of buildings other than just technical buildings.  I believe that in amendment No. 3 I address both the spirit and letter of what was sought.  On Committee Stage Deputy Quill suggested that the definition of archaeology should be amended to include a specific reference to railways and related buildings and that was supported by Deputies de Valera, Ryan and Barry.  I pointed out I was in no doubt that railways and related buildings would be covered by the term &ldquo;monuments&rdquo; in the definition <Col N="2233" /> of archaeology, but that they would more appropriately come within the definition of architectural heritage.  I am prepared to make a specific reference to railways and related buildings and structures in order to remove any doubt that they are included in the definition of architectural heritage.  The dilemma in the drafting of legislation is that by naming something other things are excluded, but in this case by including in the formulation &ldquo;without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing,&rdquo; I believe I have been able to meet the Deputies' concerns.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for trying to incorporate the views expressed in the amendments.  Will he accept that to include wording such as &ldquo;industrial complexes&rdquo;&mdash; I accept the Minister does not want to give a long list as that would exclude certain issues &mdash; when referring to railways would also take in warehouses, mills, canal site complexes and any 19th century industrial sites.  It is worth while mentioning these specifically in the Bill unless the Minister believes these structures would be included under &ldquo;engineering&rdquo;.  Even if it does it leaves the position vague.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2235" /> I am sure the Minister will have received a number of letters in regard to specific references in the Bill to the whole question of genealogy and how the reference on Committee Stage is regarded by a number of societies as not sufficient.  That is the reason I propose a broadening of the definition of genealogy.I hope the Minister believes it to be an addition and an extra qualification in the reference to genealogy.  I am sure he will appreciate the importance of this matter and that he is aware of the great work done by Naoise Ó Cléirigh &mdash; in my constituency in Clare &mdash; on these kinds of records.  The question of heritage, when it comes to genealogy specifically, should be outlined to ensure that no element would be omitted from the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The intention of this amendment would appear to be to include in the definition of &ldquo;heritage objects&rdquo; a definition of genealogical records which is referred to in the former definition.  However, the wording of the amendment, as drafted, is defective in that it refers to genealogical heritage. In any event I cannot accept this amendment because, as I indicated on Committee Stage, there is a danger that the effect of specifying individual items in a definition would simply have the effect of excluding other items which properly come within that definition.  I am satisfied, and the Deputy will acknowledge, that I have already made an amendment to the definition of &ldquo;heritage objects&rdquo; to include a specific reference to genealogical records.  I am confident it will ensure that all genealogical records are included.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the question of inclusion or exclusion has arisen on practically every amendment to date in this legislation.  I understand the Minister is worried that with a long list there could be exclusion.  I would be worried about the reverse argument that there could be an exclusion due to a narrow definition.  I want to ensure that <Col N="2236" /> these definitions are not interpreted in any narrow sense; that is the great concern of those who are deeply interested and committed to the genealogical debate.  That is why I had hoped the Minister would have expanded his reference in the Bill, which obviously refers to genealogy.  He is correct in saying this amendment refers to the genealogical heritage.  Will the Minister give a guarantee, without accepting this amendment, that it will not lead to a narrow definition to genealogy?</P>

      <P>In page 8, line 28, after &ldquo;interest,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;education,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of amendments Nos. 6 and 7 is to amend section 6 of the Bill, which sets out the functions of the council, to provide that the council will promote heritage education, and in carrying out its functions co-operate with educational bodies.  I believe the study of heritage should be included in the schools curriculum.  This is something with which all sides of the House are in agreement because of its intrinsic importance and as a contribution to the protection and preservation of our heritage.The Heritage Council can play a <Col N="2237" /> valuable role in promoting heritage education.Amendment No. 6 provides for the amendment of sections 6 (3) (a) to include in the functions of the council the promotion of education in relation to the national heritage.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 provides for the amendment of section 6 (3) (b) to include in the functions of the council co-operation with educational bodies in the promotion of the council's functions.The function of the council, under section 6, includes proposing policies and priorities for the identification, protection and preservation of the national heritage and promoting interest in and appreciation of the national heritage.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage Deputy Quill, supported by Deputy de Valera, proposed a similar amendment which is now proposed as amendment No. 8.  On Committee Stage debate on that amendment I stated that the principle of the council having a link with education was important but that the wording of the amendment was defective in that it only referred to educational bodies which were public authorities.  I undertook to bring forward an appropriate amendment on Report Stage, amendment No. 7, which refers to all educational bodies not just to educational bodies which are public authorities.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Social Welfare Payments.</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Joe Walsh on Tuesday, 28 February 1995:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for its uncaring attitude towards social welfare recipients, especially the old, widows and the majority of the unemployed without children; notes with alarm that the general increase in social welfare this year at 2.5 per cent will not keep pace with inflation and is the lowest in 30 years; and calls on the Government to give a substantial increase in the amount already provided to bring it at least up to the levels normally provided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2239" /> Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann endorses the radical approach taken by the Government in the 1995 budget in:</P>
    <P>&mdash; introducing wide ranging reforms in the tax and social welfare systems to stimulate employment and thereby make significant inroads into our unacceptable levels of unemployment;</P>
    <P>&mdash; providing the largest ever shift to resources to the social welfare area, amounting to £212 million in a full year, for all those who need assistance from youth to old age, at work or in education;</P>
    <P>&mdash; targeting poverty directly by providing for an unprecedented increase of £7 per month in child benefit, at a cost of over £100 million in a full year;</P>
    <P>&mdash; allocating £60 million, as a first step, to pay the legally determined entitlements of married women to equality payment</P>
    <P>and commends the Government, in particular, for bringing forward the general inflation-linked increase in the basic rates of social welfare payments by six weeks, from the end of July as in previous years to early June and mid-June&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Social Welfare.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I wish to refer to the background to the budget and the opportunities which were available to the Minister for Social Welfare and his Cabinet colleagues to improve the lot of people in the poverty trap. The increase of 2.5 per cent is an insult to those dependent on social welfare. This is the lowest increase in social welfare for 30 years.  When the Minister for Social Welfare was in Opposition he criticised Fianna Fáil for increases of 3 <Col N="2240" /> per cent, 4 per cent and 5 per cent in social welfare benefits.  In 1989 he said that the failure to provide adequate increases in social welfare payments was particularly cruel, and this after a 3 per cent increase in social welfare and a special increase of 9 per cent for the long term unemployed.</P>
      <P>How can a Minister who in Opposition pilloried the then Government now say that an increase of 2.5 per cent is sufficient?  How can a Government which is dominated by people who regard themselves as socialists and the voice of the needy and depressed agree to this increase?  It is obvious that the Minister for Social Welfare had no clout at the Cabinet table in regard to the increases.  Recently an old age pensioner told me that the Minister for Social Welfare had given her and her husband a choice between two loaves of bread or an extra pint each week.  It is obvious that the Minister has failed in Government to deliver on the promises he made when in Opposition.</P>
      <P>Many groups are suffering enormous hardship, for example, widows whose increase is not even in line with inflation.  The cost of running a house is the same for a widow as it is for two old age pensioners.  In many cases the cost can be higher for a widow who does not have a husband who can maintain a garden which can be used to grow food. This increase will mean that many social welfare recipients have less real income to spend.  Inflation is running at approximately 3 per cent and it is likely to increase if, as predicted, bank interest rates rise.  This increase in social welfare will go down in history.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues in Fianna Fáil in condemning the Government for the uncaring attitude it has adopted towards social welfare recipients, especially the old, widowed and the majority of the unemployed.The budget has widened the gap between the rich and poor in our society.  The priority of the Government should have been to achieve the <Col N="2241" /> opposite, to redistribute wealth and resources so as to eliminate poverty.</P>
      <P>I wish to quote the following from the response to the budget of the very reputable Justice Commission of the Conference of Religious of Ireland:</P>
      <P>The 1995 Budget provided the Government with Ireland's best opportunity in more than 30 years to tackle the poverty, unemployment and exclusion which affect a substantial proportion of the country's population.The Government missed this opportunity.  Instead of addressing the substantial failures of the present framework in developing a new approach more appropriate for the 21st century it has persisted with the failed model of recent decades. Instead of giving priority to tackling poverty, unemployment and exclusion, it has once again produced a budget which benefits the better off more than it benefits the poor. Budget 1995 has failed poor people and unemployed people.  A golden opportunity has been missed.  The poor have waited too long.</P>
      <P>Later it quotes some interesting statistics arising from the budget.  For example, an unemployed couple will gain £2.40 a week from the budget changes while a married couple with no children earning £24,000 a year will gain £8.87 per week.  It says that the gap between social welfare recipients and all others has been widened as a result of the budget and that this is a staggering consequence, particularly as the numbers on the live register will average 266,000 in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Justice Commission goes on to point out that couples in the £25,000-£30,000 income bracket gained most dramatically from the budget while pensioners, widows, the disabled and the unemployed got insulting increases of £1.50 per week.  Social welfare recipients and old age pensioners living in Dublin will lose that miserable increase as a result of local authority rent increases: what is given to them by one arm of State will be taken away by another. <Col N="2242" /> This is an absolute disgrace.  It shows that the poor in our society have again been ignored, seemingly as part of a deliberate political tactic, by the Labour Party in particular, to target the middle class.</P>
    <P>We have heard constant references to the middle income group.  The Labour Party in particular is bent on using resources for their own political gain and to win the middle class vote.  This is disgraceful for any party in Government to do.  Many aspects of the budget, including the abolition of third level fees, prove that this is its strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> This must be an excellent budget because the way the poor have been treated and the 2.5 per cent increase in overall social welfare payments is a Fianna Fáil mantra.One would imagine that while in Government Fianna Fáil dished out increases of 10 per cent and 20 per cent to the less well off.  The 2.5 per cent payments were brought forward six weeks to counteract the rate of inflation.  Since I became interested in politics I do not know of a Government who, after introducing a budget, could justifiably shout &ldquo;hooray&rdquo; about what it gave to old age <Col N="2243" /> pensioners and others.  The normal increases have been 3 per cent or 4 per cent.  In 1987 Fianna Fáil gave a 3 per cent increase in overall social welfare payments when the rate of inflation was 3.2 per cent.  In 1989, when the rate of inflation was 4 per cent, it gave an increase of 3 per cent.  Yet we have to listen to a mantra about the way people were treated in this budget.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil is ignoring the fact that by bringing forward the payments by six weeks we will counteract any increase in the rate of inflation.  It also ignores the great effort made by the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, to increase child benefit by £7 per month.  People on unemployment assistance and other smallholders care for a total of 233,000 children; lone parents care for 60,000, widows and widowers for 19,000, old age pensioners for 6,000 while those on family income supplement care for 32,000.  That is approximately 340,000 children who will benefit from the £7 per month increase that is being belittled by members of the Opposition who select figures to suit them.  A couple with four children and in receipt of long term unemployment assistance will receive £8.86 per week or 5.2 per cent of an increase.</P>
      <P>Quoting the 2.5 per cent increase in overall social welfare benefit as an example of the Government's performance is merely selecting the lowest common denominator in the budget.  The fact that Fianna Fáil and others are using that to attack the Government must mean this was a good budget.  It will get the country moving by encouraging people to work and employers to take on additional employees.  The more money that is made in that way, the more there will be for the unemployed, widows and those on disability benefit. In the long term a 3 per cent or a 4 per cent increase is only a fraction of what they should get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate and I thank my colleagues for sharing time <Col N="2244" /> with me.  Like others, I would not expect anybody to jump for joy at the 2.5 per cent increase in overall social welfare payments, but it compensates for an increase in the rate of inflation which is more than can be said for the increases given in recent years.  Examining statistics in this way proves Mark Twain's saying that &ldquo;there are lies, damn lies and statistics&rdquo;.  Statistics can be read in hundreds of ways.</P>
      <P>In former budgets the then Minister, Deputy Woods, may have given an increase of 4 per cent to one group, but others may not have received anything. The overall increase does not tell the full story.  In the context of this budget it was a question of choices and a choice was firmly made in favour of families with children.  This decision was not snatched out of the air on the basis that on the day it seemed a good idea to the Minister, but because for the past five or six years reports published by the Combat Poverty Agency, the ESRI and others highlighted that the group most at risk now &mdash; the position changes from time to time &mdash; is families on social welfare with children.  It has been pointed out repeatedly that families with children, whether in low income employment or unemployed, are more at risk to poverty than any other group.  The Minister prioritised that group in the budget and allocated a substantial amount of money for that purpose. There are approximately one million children in Ireland and, therefore, an increase of £1 per child would involve £1 million overall.  A total of £60 million was provided in the budget for families with children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also honoured the commitment to make social welfare equality payments to women.  A total of £50 million was set aside to cover the first phase of those payments this year and much more will be required in the next two budgets.  When people take account of child benefit increases, the abolition of third level fees and the equality payments, at the end of this year they will realise that this Government targeted <Col N="2245" /> the family and honoured legal commitments to women, and as a result many families will be better off.  Others may not fare as well, but only so much can be done in a budget.</P>
    <P>People should consider carefully the points made by my colleague, Deputy Browne, and analyse the substance behind the claims from Fianna Fáil that it was more generous when in office.  Its increases often did not meet the rate of inflation.  When the full package of measures provided in this year's budget has its impact, the position of families, particularly those with children, will be improved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to concentrate on one element of the budget, namely, the £60 million provision for equality payments to women.  Many women fail to understand why £37 million or £38 million could be paid, not only to women but to solicitors and barristers, during the term of office of the previous Government and we can provide only £60 million over four years.  We are talking about a total of £360 million and if that were paid out over the next few months, total increases under the social welfare code would be much less.  However, women have a genuine crib because it is difficult to justify how a group of women can be paid in full while others are paid on a phased basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would consider a solution involving an arrangement with the financial institutions over the time during which this payment would be made whereby women could be given a letter of comfort from the Department of Social Welfare which would allow them to go to a financial institution and draw the money in full. As the Government will have to pay the interest anyway, why not give women that facility.  That was done before under other headings.  I understand the Attorney General is considering this matter and will advise the Government. The 28-day period is timed from 10 February and will terminate some time late next week.  I hope the Government decides to pay these women their just <Col N="2246" /> entitlements.  I advised in 1984 that this money would have to be paid.  At that stage it was about £18 million.  It was not paid then, and it is now £360 million.  It will not go away but will have to be paid and the sooner the better.  I am suggesting a way that will create the least conflict and give the women their just entitlements.</P>

      <P>None of us is ever satisfied with the amount of money paid to social welfare recipients.  There is great need, and it has always been an objective of ours to increase the level of support provided.  It is wide of the mark to say this Government is uncaring in its attitude to social welfare recipients.  We must remember that £4,121 million is being paid out in social welfare payments this year.  That represents about £4,000 per annum for each taxpayer or about £800 a week.  It represents 28.4 per cent or between one quarter and one-third of current expenditure.  It is an enormous commitment by the Government.In addition, this year there is an increase of £215 million in social welfare payments, and that represents of the order of £200 for each taxpayer.  A number of people have mentioned the very substantial increases in child benefit. Those increases were the result of research which indicated it was the best way to use the available money.  I am unable to understand how Fianna Fáil can say this is an uncaring budget and an uncaring Government in the light of those figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few items about the motion which are noteworthy.  First, it seeks to exploit concern about social welfare payments but, at the same time, it is quite vague about what can be done about it.  There is nothing beyond a vague aspirational statement that substantial increases should be made.  What does that mean?  How would Fianna Fáil fund those substantial increases?  What is the extent of them, and why has it not been specific.  It is well within its capacity to spell out the extent of the changes it feels are desirable and how they would be funded.  However, that is <Col N="2247" /> where the difficulty arises.  It is one thing to create the impression that people in receipt of social welfare payments are doing badly, but I am sure many of Fianna Fáil's taxpaying supporters would recoil from the prospect of paying more tax to fund them.  That is why Fianna Fáil are so vague. However, if it wants to raise this kind of sentiment, it has an obligation to spell out how it would fulfil its objectives.  It is noteworthy that not only the motion but the speeches made last night by Fianna Fáil speakers were vague about what should be done and the extent to which the present social welfare inadequacies should be addressed.</P>

      <P>A further factor should be considered in the context of this motion and the position Fianna Fáil took on the budget. Speaker after speaker from Fianna Fáil said that the budget should have been balanced, in other words, that the £310 million deficit should not exist.  If they want money for social welfare they must also explain how they would manage this deficit.  That they have failed to do, and I have no doubt that they do not intend doing so.</P>

I am not very good at remembering names, but I remember things that make sense <Col N="2249" /> to me and I remember that an American politician once said that when one starts explaining, one is in trouble.  It would appear that Fianna Fáil have learned this concept extremely well.  It is not explaining, but simply attacking. How can Fianna Fáil take this stand on social welfare.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil's record on social issues in the 1930s is not to be lauded either.  Let us not go that far back.  We have had enough dirt in the last two years without dredging up Fianna Fáil's ancestry.  The dirty dozen was expanded to a grocer's dozen by the time Fianna Fáil left Government.  For example, in 1993 Fianna Fáil taxed disability and injury benefit; it removed long stay beds from the elderly, which saved £200 a week and, at the same time, refused to plough this money back into the community where it had now put the elderly in order that they be cared for.  Not alone that, it cut the spending on home helps.  This is the Fianna Fáil that is now so outraged about the poor, the unemployed and the elderly.  This was the party which reduced social welfare spending as a proportion of GNP from 14.7 per cent in 1986 to 13.8 per cent in 1992.  Deputy McCreevy, when Minister for Social Welfare, cut maternity benefit by £26 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was also a Fianna Fáil Minister who cut pay-related benefit, disability, injury, dental and optical benefits and decided to means test part-time workers and deserted wives.  Deputy O'Keeffe should remember it was Fianna Fáil which decided to means test part-time <Col N="2250" /> firemen in assessing whether they were entitled to receive a call out allowance, that students should no longer be entitled to receive the dole during the summer and to tax redundancy payments.Yet, it introduced an anmesty for tax cheats.</P>

      <P>The last Fianna Fáil <Col N="2251" /> speaker mentioned that an elderly lady had said to him that the Minister for Social Welfare had given her a choice in the budget &mdash; two sliced pans or a pint for her husband.  That is 1930s politics.  I do not know of any woman in that age group who would make such a choice and I do not believe that this comment was ever made.  We will probably see more of this from Fianna Fáil in the future.</P>
      <P>Democratic Left had a substantial input to the budget.  For the first time we launched a concerted attack not on the symptoms but on the causes of poverty.The consensus is that poverty is most acute in families.  In early 1994 Democratic Left recognised the need for a ruthless assault on family poverty. The result was our document &ldquo;Ending the Poverty Trap&rdquo; in which we called for substantial increases in child benefit payments with the elimination of poverty and unemployment traps by the integration of all child income support measures into a combined child benefit payment.  The 35 per cent increase in child benefit is a step towards establishing a basic child income payment and tackling family poverty.</P>
      <P>Those who deal with social welfare recipients and people living in poverty because they are not in employment recognise that people who fall into this category are not concerned solely with how the social welfare cake is distributed; they demand that the unemployment problem be tackled so that they will no longer have to listen to jargon such as &ldquo;Is it in line with inflation?&rdquo; Those in their 40s and early 50s have come to accept that they will not find work but not that their children will not have an opportunity to work.  They are prepared to look at the budget in its totality and recognise the efforts made to create employment and help young families with mortages and other bills to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It sticks in my craw to have to listen to the craven hypocrisy from Fianna Fáil on widows and the unemployed when it failed to do anything about it <Col N="2252" /> during its seven years in power.  As soon as I sit down I will probably be subjected to an attack but I do not care for the simple reason that I believe in what I am saying and they do not.  They do not understand what it is like to be unemployed and dependent on someone else.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Browne.</P>
      <P>I support this timely motion.  This House has seen three generations of parliamentarians, thoughtful and caring men and women who were democratically elected.  They stood &mdash; and stand &mdash; for helping the poor and deprived in our society and this is one of the chief aims of the party I represent, Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>Never before has a member of Democratic Left been in the sensitive position of Minister for Social Welfare.  It comes as a shock, therefore, to discover that the plámás expressed during the years is worth nothing.  The proposed social welfare changes will not cover the increasing costs of surviving.  The many people who are not entitled to child benefit are in a worse position.  Democratically elected Members of this House should not punish the poor with grand words.</P>
      <P>In his budget speech last year the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, said at column 1880 of the Official Report for 26 January 1994: &ldquo;Clearly the Labour Party hopes that everyone has a short memory, as clearly that party has...&rdquo;.  It is not only the Labour Party which forgets as Deputy Rabbitte also said at column 1877: &ldquo;The basic increase in welfare at 3 per cent will barely enable social welfare recipients to keep their head above water&rdquo;.  There will be a 2.5 per cent increase this year.  Is this what social welfare recipients expected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Democratic Left clearly outlined its priorities and choices in the publication <i>Ending the Poverty Trap</i>.  Where is the fundamental recasting it called for?  In the debate on Financial Resolution No. 8 on 10 February 1994 the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, said, column 1464 of the Official <Col N="2253" /> Report: &ldquo;Fianna Fáil and Labour seemed to have virtually written off those on social welfare, especially the unemployed and believe that they can be re-elected without their support&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He stated also, column 1465: &ldquo;In general, the social welfare increases in the budget were minimalist...&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>What about this year?  Deputy De Rossa went on to say:</P>
    <P>The general level of increases in social welfare payments were quite inadequate.  The policy of increasing payments in line with inflation can only be acceptable if the basic rates are adequate, but this is not the case ...The derisory level of the increases speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>Those statements were made by the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, last year but it is worse this year.  In that speech Deputy De Rossa went on to say: &ldquo;These same miserable increases are applied to many of the lowest rates such as unemployment assistance or the carer's allowance&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I do not understand how a Minister for Social Welfare can treat the unemployed and old age pensioners, who will probably be on two rather than three meals a day, in this way.  In the budget debate of 10 February 1994 Deputy De Rosa stated that the budget showed no progressive reform strategy in regard to social welfare.He stated also:</P>
      <P>In a year in which the Minister for Finance went into the budget against the most favourable fiscal background for two decades, those on social welfare had a right to expect measures to substantially improve their position.  But, once again, the majority of those on welfare have been passed over, forgotten or penalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having little interest in the unemployed or others on social welfare, the Government clearly hoped that the <Col N="2254" /> major selling point of this budget would be the changes in taxation.</P>
    <P>That is what Deputy De Rossa said about us last year but, regrettably, the Minister is eating those words now.  The one third of people on social weflare are feeling the pinch and the Minister has let them down.  Since its foundation, Fianna Fáil has been a caring party and the party identified with social welfare. We always helped people put bread on the table and we gave support to those who needed it.  The Minister has failed miserably in this budget.</P>
    <P>What is less shocking is that this disregard for the disabled and the elderly is aided an abetted by an able and intelligent Labour Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn.  The new Cumann na nGael, represented in Social Welfare by Minister Durkan who is from County Kildare and who spoke here so eloquently on many occasions on the need for fairness, and in Finance by Minister Higgins, has no problem in reducing pensions in either real or absolute terms.  They do not care.</P>
    <P>This budget is not radical as claimed in the Government amendment to this motion.  Will the shift in resources, represented by reducation such as the bank levy of £36 million and corporation tax of £43 million, assist those without work?  How can the Government claim credit for paying legally determined entitlements to married women?  Recognising this does nothing for the poor, the elderly, the disabled and those out of work.  Is the Minister for Social Walfare aware that the deprived in our society know the difference between a general inflation linked increase and an increase equal to the rate of inflation for 1995-96?</P>
    <P>Old age pensioners will have two meals a day instead of three because of the miserable increase given to them in the budget.  There is a threat of inflation rising beyond 3 per cent in addition to a rise in interest rates because of the Government's failure to deal with the economy.  It is forgetting those who are deprived in our society.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> I support the motion in the name of Deputy Walsh. This Government stands condemned for its failure to adequately increase social welfare payments for the most vulnerable members of our society &mdash; old age pensioners, widows, widowers and the unemployed.</P>
      <P>I have been a Member of this House for 12 years and this is the most uncaring attitude ever adopted by any Government during that period.  Perhaps I was a little naïve but with Democratic Left in Government I expected substantial increases in social welfare payments.  In 1994 Deputy De Rossa said that the miserable level of most of the increases told their own story.  In 1989 he stated that the failure to provide adequate increases in social welfare payments was particularly cruel.  He made that statement despite the fact that there had been a 3 per cent increase in addition to a special 9 per cent increase for the long term unemployed. Fine Gael made promises in this regard over a number of years.  My constituency colleague in Wexford, Minister Yates, promised 4, 5 and 6 per cent increases in social welfare if they got back into Government but they never materialised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lynch referred earlier to the caring attitude of Democratic Left and what it had achieved during its short term in Government.  I spent a great deal of time in Cork during the by-election campaign and promises were made <Col N="2256" /> then by Democratic Left in regard to what it intended to do for the less well off sections of the community in Cork. The Government jet, State cars, foreign travel, advisers and programme managers were to be a thing of the past if Democratic Left won the seat in Cork North Central.  It won the seat and got into Government soon afterwards but the promises made during the by-election campaign were soon forgotten.  The mercs and perks, the programme managers, advisers and drivers were all retained.  Minister of State Rabbitte had to be given a ministerial car, programme managers and all the support that he felt was necessary.  Deputy Lynch has a lot of explaining to do to the people of Cork, particularly with regard to the miserly 2.5 per cent increase in social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>The 2.5 per cent in social welfare payments is the lowest in 30 years.  Since 1987, Fianna Fáil led Governments have never given increases that were less than 3 per cent and often gave an increase substantially higher than that.  There was a 3 per cent increase in 1987, which was regarded as one of the toughest years in the history of our finances. There was a 3 per cent increase in 1988 and 1989, a 5 per cent increase in 1990, 4 per cent in 1991 and 1992, 3.5 per cent in 1993 and 3 per cent in 1994.  The only party with a caring attitude to the less well-off sections of our society &mdash; and history proves it &mdash; is the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>A 2.5 per cent increase in social welfare payments is an insult to people who deserve to be looked after in a more caring way by the Government.  It is not even in line with inflation because all the commentators are now saying that the indications are that inflation will be in the region of 2.9 or 3 per cent this year.  Perhaps it is not yet too late for the Government to take action.  The Social Welfare Bill and the Finance Bill have yet to come into this House and perhaps the Government would consider increasing the social welfare payments to at least 3 per cent or even higher.  To offer an old age pensioner an <Col N="2257" /> increase of £1.80 per week this year compared to £2.10 last year is an insult to the intelligence of our old age pensioners.It certainly does not indicate a caring attitude on the part of this Government.  How can we expect old age pensioners, the unemployed, widows and widowers to live on less of an increase this year than was given to them last year?  That is an insult to those people.  I welcome the increase of £7 in child benefit but 240,000 pensioners will not benefit from that.</P>

Deputies Durkan, De Rossa, Rabbitte and others who in Opposition consistently harassed the then Government for not doing enough for the poor obviously had a lapse of memory on transfer to the other side and were more concerned about the banks, big business and the well off sections of society at the expense of the poor.  The bank levy has been written off and corporation tax has been reduced to 38 per cent.  I am amused by the Government's concern for the banks.  AIB, which announced its results last week, made £341 million profit, the highest ever in the history of the bank.  This Government has taken measures to benefit the bank, while at the same time offering the poor a 2.5 <Col N="2258" /> per cent increase, a gross insult and one that we in Fianna Fáil would never countenance.  If Members opposite are as concerned about the less well off as they were in the past they should support this motion and vote with Fianna Fáil.  They should show with their feet that they are concerned about the weaker sections of society.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i>&mdash;&mdash;there are good ideas, if the Government had the courage to implement them.  Under the heading &ldquo;Caring for the Vulnerable in our Society,&rdquo; it states that many Irish people feel excluded from the mainstream of life.  The elderly, people with disabilities and those who care for them, victims of crime, those on waiting lists for public health care and those who must wait in line for social welfare payments all feel in different ways that they do not count.  The Fine Gael Party was reflecting on Fianna Fáil in Government when this document was prepared.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> To offer those on social welfare a 2.5 increase does not say much.  Obviously this document was not read when the Government was preparing the budget and the Minister of State shied away from acting on his party's recommendations during his input to the budget.  It is hypocrisy of the highest order for the Fine Gael Party and the Democratic Left Party to try to justify the 2.5 per cent increase as adequate for those on social welfare. Time and again in the past three years we heard the then Opposition's hollow talk that 3 per cent or 4 per cent was not enough, but it failed at the first opportunity it had to do something about it.  Last night Deputy Walsh asked that social welfare payments should at <Col N="2259" /> least be brought up to the level recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare to ensure that all people on social welfare would have a decent standard of living.  It is unlikely that the Government has been listening to us during the past few days and I do not expect it to take fire brigade action.</P>
      <P>We will continue to reflect the views of ordinary people for as long as the Government lasts and we can assure the people who are listening that when Fianna Fáil gets back into Government it will give substantial increases to the less well off and will ensure they have a decent standard of living.  The Government's attitude does not reflect the speeches made by Fine Gael and Democratic Left in the past.  When the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, got the State car, the mobile telephones, the programme managers and other perks they soon forgot about the people they purported to represent in the past, the less well off and the socially deprived.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, has a very important role to play in the Department.  If Democratic Left has no interest in looking after the less well off, he could be the champion of that sector and could ensure that old age pensioners, widows and widowers and the unemployed get a decent increase in next year's budget.  Obviously Democratic Left has forgotten whom it represents.The Minister of State is a good constituency man and is very much aware of the hardship that the small increase in social welfare will cause to the people he represents.  I ask Deputy Durkan to take up the cudgels on their behalf and not leave it to Democratic Left.  Otherwise he will be dragged down with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish Deputy Durkan well during his period of office.  As Deputy Browne has just said, perhaps in <Col N="2260" /> 12 months' time he will be the pioneer for social welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>My party supports Deputy Joe Walsh's motion.  The Progressive Democrats Party believes that social welfare recipients should be given the best protection that society can afford.  Social welfare is a major factor in social cohesion and social solidarity ensuring that we all stand together and help one another.  Given the approach of the Minister for Social Welfare's party and the constant criticism that he and his Democratic Left Party colleagues levelled at previous Governments, it is simply unbelievable that he could only provide a 2.5 per cent increase for social welfare recipients in this year's budget. Of course, that is a reflection on all three parties in Government but it is an amazing performance by the Minister for Social Welfare, given that he is Leader of the Democratic Left Party.  I can just imagine the criticism that he and his party would have levelled at a Progressive Democrats Minister who was the author of this year's budget.  We would be denounced as heartless and uncaring.  There would be no end to the denunciation by the Democratic Left Party and of course from other socialist colleagues in the Labour Party.</P>
      <P>After 30 years it is shameful that this Government has hit a new low in the rate of increase for the poorest members of society.  This Government and Minister will be remembered forever as the 2.5 per cent Government and 2.5 per cent Minister.  When the Progressive Democrats were in Government social welfare recipients received a 5 per cent increase in the 1990 budget, 4 per cent in the 1991 budget and 4 per cent in the 1992 budget.  Our social welfare system is a major achievement of a modern society in that social welfare provision is strongly supported by public opinion generally.  A recent European survey highlighted the almost unanimous support for a high level of social protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government comprising Fine <Col N="2261" /> Gael, Labour and Democratic Left gave a miserly increase to the weakest and most disadvantaged members of society. These parties marched the highways and byways during election campaigns and promised the sick, the handicapped and unemployed a new deal if and when they were in Government.  They have had a chance to deliver and what did social welfare recipients receive?  An old age pensioner under 80 years of age will get approximately 30p a day, the price of a razor blade.  There are smaller increases for those on disability and unemployment benefit.  The social welfare provisions in the budget will not do anything to help single parent families. The improvement in child benefit is given to all families equally, irrespective of their circumstances.  It goes to the richest and poorest families alike. Where is the targeting and focusing of welfare in this policy and concern for the most disadvantaged members of society?  The claim by the Government that the 2.5 per cent increase will cover the increase in the cost of living this year is unlikely to be realised.  The ESRI has forecast inflation will be 2.8 per cent this year and various economists and economic commentators are generally agreed that it will be nearer 3 per cent than 2.5 per cent.  In other words, this year's social welfare increase will not match inflation and that is a shame.</P>
    <P>In the budget introduced on 8 February the Minister for Finance claimed the economy was among the best performers in Europe last year and predicted that gross national product would rise by over 5.5 per cent this year.  In that context, it was reasonable to expect that the Government might afford a slight improvement in the position of people on social welfare not to mention keeping pace with inflation.  As I pointed out, the increase this year will not keep pace with inflation.  Not only is there no improvement, the position of particular groups could be significantly worse.  Will the Minister confirm whether thousands of deserted wives who currently receive deserted wife's <Col N="2262" /> benefit will have their payments reduced under the proposed review and the pretence that the lone parent's allowance scheme is to be improved?</P>
    <P>Today 1.3 million people are totally dependent on social welfare payments and many experience poverty and social exclusion on an ongoing basis.  Social exclusion is not just having insufficient income.  It can also be seen in areas like housing, education, health and in access to various services as legal aid.  Social exclusion can lead to serious addictions such as alcoholism and drug abuse.  The challenge for society and our social policy generally is to assist individuals to take care of themselves and develop their skills to perform a useful role in society.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats believe we must come up with new ways to combine welfare and work and tackle these problems.  One of the welcome features of current welfare policy is the growing acceptance that the treatment of the unemployed has been inadequate and unacceptable.  The long standing system of paying people dole on condition that they do not work and effectively condemning them to idleness is nothing more than a system of human setaside.  Given the scale of unemployment and the fact that over 300,000 people are not engaged in full-time employment, we must find a new way to meet the legitimate needs of the unemployed, particularly the long term unemployed.For that reason the Progressive Democrats published proposals for a national community employment programme a year ago.  This was to ensure that unemployed people are provided with two or three days work each week through a system of State support.  That work could be in the public, community or voluntary sectors and is not too different from the social employment schemes which operated in the past.</P>
    <P>We must go further than providing short term or part-time work.  It is important that such schemes include a <Col N="2263" /> real element of training and certification.Ideally they should also contain an educational element.  We must get away from the stop gap approach which characterised the former social welfare employment schemes and merely took somebody off the live register for six to nine months and then left them to their own devices.</P>
    <P>If a community employment programme ensured that participants were trained, acquired real skills and were given a certificate at the end of the programme that would greatly improve their sense of worth and value and make them more employable.  I welcome the proposal in the budget to provide funding for up to 38,500 places on a community employment programme launched by the previous Government in March last year.</P>
    <P>The reality is that while there is a crisis level of unemployment we also have an enormous amount of work to be done in society.  In the community and environmental fields there is no end to the work to be done such as cleaning up the countryside, towns and villages. Such valuable work would not only improve the environment but would make us more successful in attracting tourists.  The assistance which the unemployed could give in the voluntary area would be a great help, for example, as home helps, providing assistance in schools and hospitals, sporting and other organisations.  There are other areas where the skills and talents of the unemployed could be used for the benefit of the community.  The Progressive Democrats believe that anyone who is not in full-time employment must be given an opportunity to participate in the national community employment programme where their skills will be appreciated and they can receive further training and a certificate to show that they have completed the programme and acquired particular skills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the debate last night and tonight.  I was encouraged to see Fianna Fáil embark on a voyage of discovery because it was the only positive thing it had to say.  The debate has centred around everything that is negative.  The consensus in the Opposition seems to be that the size of the increase was insufficient.At least it was an increase and not a decrease.  Compare that to what we were told a few years ago when disability benefit was cut and the pay related element removed.</P>
      <P>A widower who never missed a day's work came to my clinic with a hurt expression on his face.  He explained he had never been idle in his life.  Unfortunately, he had recently been widowed and discovered he had to have an operation.The Government had removed the pay related section from his benefit. It was the first time I realised that the Government of the day was totally impervious to the needs of people in that position.  He asked what he had done to deserve this.  He had done everything that could have been expected of him and had worked all his life.  The best the Government did when he was most vulnerable was cut what he regarded as his entitlements.</P>
      <P>For the past two evenings the Opposition spent its time ranting and raving about the insufficiency of the most recent increases in the social welfare budget.  It was reassuring to witness Fianna Fáil on its voyage of discovery claiming to have rediscovered the poor. It ran into the highways and byways, talked to various people, no doubt to its friends and supporters, and came up with the most negative comments possible on various aspects of this most recent budget.  While acknowledging it is important that there be an efficient Opposition, if it is totally negative, fails to recognise important, constructive, positive budgetary proposals, it is not doing itself justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2265" /> I would expect the Opposition spokesman on social welfare, when he contributes to withdraw the motion, apologise for having led us into fairyland, on this voyage of discovery with the suggestion that, had Fianna Fáil had its hands on the helm, things would have been different.  Of course, they would have been different; there would not have been an increase of 2.5 per cent. Given its past record there is no doubt that, in order to meet arrears of equality payments, it would have cut payments to others, something it has not told us.  I hope it will not assume office again for many years by which time it will have had time to <i>reconnoitre</i>.  In the course of its voyage of discovery, if it manages to avoid the icebergs and rocks, perhaps the electorate will allow it back into power, temporarily, of course; otherwise there are sad days ahead for it.</P>
    <P>I have listened for some time now to the half-hearted, puerile attempts by Opposition members to deride the proposed social welfare improvements.  It is obvious the message has not yet got through to them that the resources provided this year for improvements in social welfare payments are the largest ever on an annual basis since the foundation of the State.  The full annual cost of those improvements is £212 million compared to the £157 million provided last year.  Despite the fact that the Opposition engage in peculiar practices, if it compares the £212 million with the £157 million, even it will recognise that the increase is more than one-third greater.</P>
    <P>The reality is that Fianna Fáil is still on a learning curve leading eventually to graduation as an effective Opposition, which we hope will be sooner rather than later because, if not it will have misled very many people.  We must remember that people are willing to listen and seek leadership from politicians but, if Fianna Fáil mislead them <Col N="2266" /> to this extent, I shall begin to worry about them.</P>
    <P>This is a good budget, containing very positive, constructive proposals calculated to help the most vulnerable in our society.  I make no apology for saying that families will be its main beneficiaries.Whether at work or dependent on social welfare they will be better off through a substantial increase in child benefit of £7 per child per month.  In addition, child benefit will be paid for all 18 years old in full-time education and child dependant allowances for children aged up to 22 in similar circumstances.</P>
    <P>The sick and disabled &mdash; this should bring something back to the minds of those in Opposition also &mdash; will receive an increase in their weekly payments to keep pace with the predicted rate of inflation this year and will be paid that increase six weeks earlier than usual. Unemployed people will receive the same increase and at the earlier date.  In addition, they will benefit from the intensive placement and guidance service being introduced on a pilot basis for the long term unemployed, as well as extra places being made available this year in community employment accompanied by further improvements in the back to work allowance scheme. It must be remembered that unemployed people also have children &mdash; although one would not have thought so having listened to the Opposition the past couple of evenings &mdash; of whom there are 233,000 who will benefit substantially from improvements in child benefit.</P>
    <P>Workers will benefit through improvements in personal taxation and reliefs introduced into the PRSI system and employers will gain from changes in business taxation and further improvements in employers PRSI contributions. In addition, pensioners will have their weekly payments increased in line with the predicted rate of inflation this year and will receive those increases six <Col N="2267" /> weeks earlier, something they have been seeking for a long time.  Carers, who contribute so much to the disabled and incapacitated will benefit from an extension of the carer's allowance, a further improvement in the means test and a free travel companion pass for the pensioner for whom they are caring.</P>
    <P>Bringing forward social welfare payments to June from August will increase the cost to the Exchequer, and the benefit to those concerned, in excess of 3 per cent, which was what the Fianna Fáil Leader suggested would be the right type of increase to be taken on board this year.  That being the case, what was the purpose of their tabling this motion in the first instance?</P>

      <P>I support this motion in the names of Deputies Joe Walsh and Mary Wallace and thank Deputy Walsh for allowing me share some of his time. As Deputy Walsh pointed out last evening, we seek increases in social welfare benefits in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare some years ago.  Having listened to Deputy Proinsias De Rossa, now Minister for Social Welfare, complain every time my party increased social welfare benefits in excess of the prevailing rate of inflation, it is of some considerable disappointment not only to people on this side to the House but to all those dependent on social welfare to discover that this will be the lowest rate of increase in 30 years.</P>

      <P>The Minister last evening said he was particularly pleased with the social welfare provisions &mdash; this from the Minister who, in Opposition, told us how paltry were the very significant increases implemented by Fianna Fáil.  I should like him to visit my constituency and explain to old age pensioners, widows, deserted wives and those in receipt of long term unemployment assistance how he can justify such a paltry increase in the current year.</P>
      <P>Indeed the Minister last year said:</P>
      <P>On the one hand Deputy Walsh is criticising the Government for not spending enough while, on the other hand, Deputy McCreevy has been telling Fianna Fáil's corporate backers that the Government have spent too much and has been reckless with the national finances.</P>
      <P>I tell everybody the Government is reckless with the country's finances, providing for a deficit of £310 million in the current year when it was handed the national finances with a surplus of £15 million.  I have no problem telling anybody, corporate backers or others, about those facts.  Indeed there is no conflict between that and what Deputy Joe Walsh requested here last evening, that the social welfare allowances be increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one examines what the Minister and his colleagues in Government did in this budget, one discovers not alone will they spend in excess of £11 billion in the current year on day-to-day spending in addition to budgeting for a deficit of £310 million, but will reduce corporation tax from 40 per cent to 38 per cent.  That expenditure has not been targeted where Fianna Fáil have always contended it should be at employment creation.  That leads one to ask who will <Col N="2269" /> benefit.  Of course, the banks will benefit.It will be clearly realised that, when it came to a choice between banks and old age pensioners, the banks won at the behest of the Minister for Social Welfare of the Democratic Left Party.</P>
    <P>At a time when our economy is growing by 6 per cent, we should look after those needy in our society, since society always is judged by the manner in whch it cares for the less well off.  I would have expected at least that people dependent on social welfare would have benefited from the increased moneys available to the Government resulting from a sound economy having been handed over by a previous Government in which Fianna Fáil were the major partners.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister talked about a fundamentally new approach.  I would not like to tell the old age pensioners in my constituency that this idea was part of a fundamentally new approach.  The Minister also made the point that the separation of the 2.5 per cent increase from other improvements gives an unbalanced and distorted picture.</P>

      <P>Why does the Minister not defend the part of the budget that <Col N="2270" /> applies to the vast majority of recipients, old age pensioners, widows and the long term unemployed?  He also stated that if Fianna Fáil ever gets back into power, he was certain they would push payment back to the end of July because that is what it did in every budget; it was nearly the end of the summer before people got social welfare increases and he had brought forward the payment date.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, talked about the lack of constructive speeches in the Dáil during the past two nights.  One of the most constructive things the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, did was to attack the former Fianna Fáil-Labour Government &mdash; he attacked his partners in Government.He said he had brought forward the payment by six weeks.

Last night the Minister said that Members of the House already <Col N="2271" /> know his views on the issue of the married women's social welfare equality payments.  That issue stems from 1984 when the Equal Treatment Directive should have been implemented by the then Fine Gael-Labour Government. The Minister has made another attack and if I were Minister, I would attack him for insisting that old age pensioners will only get a 2.5 per cent increase in social welfare benefit.</P>

      <P>I want to refer to the carer's allowance.  While I welcome the improvements the Minister should target resources at those who care for people who are totally incapacitated. There is a good case to be made for the small number of people, mainly women, who care for incapacitated people; those carers have to stay in the house and feed elderly people three times a day.  Their number is not large and I ask the Minister to consider in the Social Welfare Bill how he might improve the lot of those people who are a few pounds outside the qualifying threshold for the allowance even with the new increases.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Woods was Minister for Social Welfare he was responsible for major improvements in every area of social welfare.  When I heard the Minister of State read the list of various improvements &mdash; minor in many instances &mdash; introduced in the budget, I recognised many of them as those initiated by Deputy Woods.  Last night it was disappointing that neither the Minister nor any Deputy from his side of the House paid tribute to Deputy Woods for his work during his time in office.

      <P>We were told by Government party speakers that this was a Government of choices, and so it was, but when it came to a choice between the banks, the middle classes and the poor, the poor were, regrettably, forgotten, which is tragic.  There is no use in pretending that they have got some sort of satisfactory deal because they have not, in fact inflation will be far higher than the increases in social welfare benefits this year.  It is a bitterly disappointing budget for the poorest in our society.  A derogatory 2.5 per cent increase in social welfare benefits illustrates one thing clearly, the powerless and ineffective role of the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, at the Cabinet table.  The Minister and his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, jettisoned their self-proclaimed cause of the underprivileged. That is the cause I heard supported so strongly for almost a decade from the Opposition benches, but, unfortunately, the Ministers have exploited the poor in a most cynical way.  Only last year on <Col N="2273" /> the budget debate Deputy De Rossa, referred to the miserable levels of increases of 3 per cent which, nevertheless, were considerably ahead of inflation.  Naturally, there were great expectations in regard to this Minister for Social Welfare because he was a friend and champion of the underprivileged.The poor looked on him as their champion.  How has the Minister measured up?  All I can say is that in Government and behind the closed door of Cabinet he has been found out. The Minister referred last night to dishonesty and people speaking out of both sides of their mouths.  I acknowledge he has a great deal of expertise in that area and for about a decade I have listened to his phoney concerns for the poorest in society.  However, when he had a great chance to do something for them, he let them down.</P>

    <P>The budget was a huge disappointment as it did not address the real issues of poverty and unemployment.  The people who can least afford it, who do not have mobile phones, State cars or powerful lobby groups, have been abandoned by the very people who purported to represent them.  In a year of financial surplus the Minister snatched misery from the jaws of abundance as far as those people are concerned.  This year, more than ever, those people <Col N="2274" /> needed a lift.  This budget could have given comfort to senior citizens in a year in which there was a record surplus, growth rate and all the indicators were good.  I am sure most people accept that the poorest in our society should have been looked after.  It gives me no great joy this evening to have to point out how badly they have been let down and I recommend strongly that they at least get the minimum levels recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, that is not asking a great deal.  The commission's recommendation for old age pensioners was £65 and that increase would not have cost a great deal.  It would not hurt the banks if they were asked this year to share a little of their profits with the less well off.</P>
    <P>Aspirations, platitudes and sympathy are no use to those people.  What they want is a few pounds to buy an extra bag of coal to provide more heating. They have heard enough cant and useless rhetoric, they need financial support, but regrettably they have been consigned to the scrap heap of society. We cannot ignore the fact that the increase for social welfare recipients is 2.5 per cent.  I reject that and the amendment and call on the caring people in the Government to support our motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently a certain political party has tended to use the public service and Civil Service as a vehicle for easy jibes and popular headlines.The Taoiseach has made it abundantly clear that the only thing which would disqualify a person from being appointed as a programme manager to one of his Ministers was being a civil servant.  In the coming months his party will realise that its loss is its partners' gain.</P>
      <P>Some weeks ago I availed of the opportunity in a newspaper article to refer to the comments made by a former programme manager who served one of my colleagues in Government.  I was afraid that the mantra, &ldquo;it is only programme managers from outside the public service who are of any use and that they run rings around programme managers who are civil servants&rdquo;, was becoming acceptable.  Several programme managers who had served the Labour Party thanked me for putting my views on the record.  I know the gentleman who made that statement and what he said was absolute nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach has changed his veiws now that he is in Government.  His attitude to public servants may earn him some cheap headlines but it does considerable disservice to good public servants who have served this State well. He has publicly attempted to contrast the honourable actions of Deputy Phil Hogan with the personal problems of an unspecified number of civil servants. Slagging civil servants is a very attractive option for any politician because they cannot reply individually and the politician can always say he was not referring to X or Y but rather to an <Col N="2278" /> anonymous person in some obscure Deparment of State.</P>
    <P>Most sections of the written media in particular delight in having a go at the Civil Service.  There are unfortunate people in the Civil Service with drink problems.  Is there any profession some of whose members do not suffer from this social problem?  If so I have yet to meet them.  I would even go as far as to suggest that the percentage of individuals with drink problems in this House, working for our daily newspapers or in RTE is just as high, if not higher, than in the Civil Service.  I recall in the mid-eighties a very colourful Minister for the Public Service, a friend of mine, who was inclined to circle over Shannon on occasions.  He made a career out of having a go at public servants and is no longer a Member of the House.</P>
    <P>Because of the Taoiseach's recent illness he must have missed Mass last Sunday, but if he had listened to Mass on the radio he would have heard the gospel advising that before one removes the splinter from one's neighbour's eye, one should remove the plank from one's own.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service run special programmes for people with drink problems and if the Taoiseach considers them ineffective I can think of nobody in a better place to put them right.  Did he ask to have such programmes reviewed before making his comments last week?  Perhaps the Taoiseach has had a bad experience with a civil servant who had a drink problem.  If so it is unfortunate, but it was wrong of him to make the sweeping, all tarring statement he made last week.  He also referred to those people as &ldquo;duds&rdquo;.  I looked up the dictionary for the meaning of that word. It is a noun, meaning a failure, a flop or a washout.  As an adjective it means broken, bust, duff, failed, valueless and worthless.  The Taoiseach stated, &ldquo;I know of cases where there are civil servants who cannot do their jobs because they are alcoholics, but in the public service it is impossible to get rid of those duds&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2279" /> Given that today is Ash Wednesday, perhaps the Taoiseach could do more penance than merely provide us with the type of comment his spokesperson made on his behalf last Monday.  I hope this cheap jibing at civil servants of the highest calibre from the most senior member of the Government will cease.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy McCreevy for this opportunity to clarify remarks about civil servants recently reported to have been made by the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>At a dinner speaking engagement in Dublin on 23 February, the Taoiseach, in the course of unscripted remarks, referred to the importance of improving public services with a view to achieving the central objective of asserting the authority of the consumer-client of such services.  Deputies may recall that in the programme, A Government of Renewal, there is a commitment that, as an important part of the renewal of public confidence in the system of Government, reforms will be introduced in the delivery of public services.  The aim is to achieve and demonstrate value for money, high standards of service, efficiency, courtesy and accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the need for everyone in public life, whether at political or Civil Service level, to be accountable for their actions, including mistakes which might be made from time to time.  He pointed to the courageous step taken by the former Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, when he inadvertently caused budget information to be released prematurely.  He then went on to refer to the difficulty of dealing with civil servants who, for whatever reason, were unable to perform their duties to an acceptable standard.He did, of course, make it clear that the numbers involved were a very tiny minority, as indeed they are in <Col N="2280" /> other walks of life where similar problems are encountered.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the Taoiseach expressed these views has caused offence to some civil servants and, as soon as this came to his attention, the Taoiseach, through his spokesman, indicated that this was not his intention and went on to regret any offence that might have been caused.  The Taoiseach wishes me to make it absolutely clear that his personal experience is that the civil servants, of all Departments, with whom he comes into contact on a daily basis meet the highest standards of professionalism, integrity and efficiency.</P>
    <P>A Government of Renewal undertakes that, in co-operation with the public service, any reform necessary in the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 will be undertaken.  The public is ultimately not only the consumer of public services but also meets the costs involved.  It is entitled to no less than the best possible services and it is up to us to make sure that it gets it.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I again put on record my appreciation, which I know is shared by the Taoiseach and indeed by all in the House, of the services provided not just to the Government but to everyone in this country by civil servants.  Since the foundation of the State, the Civil Service has served us well.  The Government is determined to do everything necessary to ensure the continuation of this tradition.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire as ucht glacadh leis an gcuireadh anocht a bheith páirteach sa díospóireacht phráinneach seo faoin eaglais Chaitliceach is sine ó aimsir na bPéindlíthe sa chontae agamsa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sa cheist a chuir mé d'iarr mé ar an Aire cuairt a thabhairt dá bhféadfadh sé ar an bhfoirgneamh stairiúil seo i Ros Eo i gceartlár Fhine Gall.  Tuigim gur <Col N="2281" /> thug clár reachtaire an Aire cuairt ar Ros Eo tráth an ama seo anuraidh.  Ach d'fheicfí an t-uafás oibre curtha i gcrích ó shin da dtabharfaí cuairt anois ar Ionad Cultúrdha Réigiúnda Saint Maur. Ar son coiste St. Maur's Trust Limited impím ar an Aire cuairt a thabhairt ar St. Maur's go luath chun an éacht oibre a fheiceáil, ag sabháil an fhoirgnimh thabhachtaigh seo.</P>
    <P>St. Maur's Church is the last major building in the Rush area left standing after the demolition of Kenure House and many thatched houses in recent years.  As such St. Maur's has great local importance as well as being the earliest example of a penal Catholic church in the Fingal area.  This fine building began as a thatched chapel in 1730 and assumed most of its present structure in 1760.  Recognising their responsibility to this and future generations, the people of Rush formed a trust to set about giving the building, no longer used as a church, a secure future and a new lease of life.</P>
    <P>Both the size and architectural merit of St. Maur's make it an ideal venue for many cultural pursuits.  Visiting theatrical and musical companies would be well suited to this historical venue, which could be used for exhibitions. Many requests have been received already by the trust to make St. Maur's available for musical and choral recitals. The committee, however, cannot allow the venue to be used until such essentials as emergency lighting are installed. The spire also needs to be reinstated, but a debt to suppliers and others, including a bank, stands at £20,000.</P>
    <P>Such is the goodwill in Rush towards the project that between £7,000 and £8,000 a year has been and continues to be raised, but the daunting task of renovating St. Maur's is estimated to cost £200,000.  As things stand a mere £30,000 would not just clear the debt which threatens to bankrupt the project, it would after ten years of voluntary community effort, put this unique project on a safe and sustainable footing, able to earn an income, promote the arts and pay for continued maintenance <Col N="2282" /> and development of this fine and unique building.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister, when visiting St. Maur's, requested a full estimate of outstanding work.  The estimate, to include various improvements, came to around £90,000.  However, £30,000 would be sufficient to save the project from bankruptcy, and this is the basic message for the Minister this evening. Applications for grant assistance are with the National Heritage Council since October 1994, and with the Arts Council since before that.  Fingal County Council originally gave £15,000 in grant assistance while the Church authorities gave £40,000.  The project has huge potential for promoting the various aspects of life and well-being which the Minister promotes so well in other areas, as a potential joint venture between St. Maur's Trust Limited, the Arts Council and the arts department of Fingal County Council.  I now call on the Minister to play his part and, in so doing, save this wonderfully unique project from bankruptcy and Stubbs Gazette.</P>

Ba mhaith liom ar an gcéad dul síos a rá gurb é an fáth gur thug mo chlár reachtaire cuairt ar Ros Eo ná gur theastaigh uaidh a fháil amach go díreach cad a bhí ar siúl.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputy Trevor Sargent for drawing our attention to this project.  It was because my programme manager, on my behalf, wanted to be of assistance, that he visited St. Maur's.  I am <Col N="2283" /> well aware of the history that surrounds the church and of the circumstances. However, I would like to clarify matters this evening.</P>
    <P>An application for grant assistance from the National Heritage Council was originally made by St. Maur's Trust in March 1989.  The application was in respect of developing the former St. Maur's Parish Church at Rush for use as a major regional cultural auditorium while keeping the church and its artefacts intact.  The total cost envisaged was £200,000, and the application for grant assistance was for £120,000.</P>
    <P>In March 1991 a further application was submitted to the council by different members of St. Maur's Trust to those who had made the first application.The estimated cost of the project on this occasion as £110,000 and the application was for a grant of £55,000.</P>
    <P>In July 1991 the National Heritage Council wrote to St. Maur's Trust informing it that the application had been considered in detail, but because of the large number of applications received and the limited funds available only a relatively small proportion of projects were being offered grant assistance.The Deputy and the House will appreciate this was quite some time before I assumed responsibility for the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>A further approach was made by St. Maur's Trust in a letter to the Heritage Council in November 1992.  It was informed that as the proposed project had not altered substantially since the original application in 1989, the council was not in a position to reconsider it. That also was prior to my holding my present position.</P>
    <P>The latest application was received at the end of October 1994.  The estimated cost of the project is now stated at £200,000, and the application was for a grant of £60,000.  I understand this application is currently under consideration <Col N="2284" /> by the council.  It will be considered first by the architectural subcommittee of the council and then by the full council. They have requested further information regarding the proposed works to enable them to come to a decision in the matter as soon as possible.  I understand that the latest request for information is in relation to the costings associated with the spire and the railings.  As soon as that information is available it can be considered by the Heritage Council.</P>
    <P>It is entirely a matter for the Heritage Council to recommend whether funding should be made available for a particular project.  It is entirely independent in this regard and I do not intervene in its decisions.  The Deputy would be among those who, I am sure, would want to support the propriety of my not intervening in bodies statutorily independent from me, such as, the Arts Council and the Heritage Council. However, I will be glad to bring the request for expedition in this matter and the circumstances to the attention of the Heritage Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity to raise this matter.  I wish the Minister of State, Deputy McManus well in her very important, complex and challenging brief.  I have no doubt she will bring her excellent talents to the role and I wish her every success.</P>
      <P>The issue now arising dates back to the late 1960s and early 1970s when the intentions for the future placement of the population growth of the greater Dublin region were cast down following the Myles Wright report of the late 1960s.  The theory was good but, unfortunately the practice was deplorable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My constituency contains two of the new satellite towns of Clondalkin/Lucan and Blanchardstown.  In North Clondalkin there are many thousands of corporation houses.  It is the only area with the <Col N="2285" /> stigma of having an interdepartmental committee to examine a task force study on urban crime which arose because a minute percentage of a wonderful 20,000 plus community caused trouble some years ago.  Many issues arose.  One was the isolation and lack of contact with Dublin Corporation, the body that constructed the homes of the people who reside in North Clondalkin.  Successive Governments can be criticised, but at the heart of the problem was the incompetence of management and what was done in County Dublin by Dublin Corporation.  Its elected council would not disagree with its management, about redressing some of the anomalies we had to contend with in the county.</P>
    <P>In regard to the properties being transferred, Dublin Corporation is retaining a ten year monopoly in the allocation of these houses to future applicants on the housing list and also wishes to ignore the deplorable level of maintenance and lack of spending on the upkeep of these residences.  It has, for years, taken the rents into City Hall, and has put nothing back by way of community facilities.  It has been an absolutely deplorable house developer and landlord.  The trenchant criticism of the corporation's approach is one that I hope the Minister will vigorously address when called upon to act as honest broker in an endeavour to resolve the matter between South Dublin Council and Dublin Corporation.  This also applies in the case of Fingal County Council.  If the corporation's scheme was implemented a heavy financial burden would be placed on South Dublin County Council which would not be allowed to meet the needs of residents as a result.</P>
    <P>The rent arrears outstanding in Dublin Corporation estates are considerably higher than the amounts outstanding in South Dublin County Council estates because of the frustration and annoyance of residents at the lack of maintenance.I trust that the Minister of State <Col N="2286" /> will intervene and inform Dublin Corporation that its housing stock and other assets will be transferred to the democratically elected local councils for management purposes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for having confidence in me, his kind words and for raising this issue.  For reasons I will outline later, there is very little I can say at this stage on the matter.</P>
      <P>It might be useful if I set out in a general way the background to the current position.  For many years, Dublin Corporation has been building houses and purchasing land for housing and other purposes in County Dublin.  The situation had developed to the point that Dublin Corporation had a housing estate of some 7,500 houses in the county.  This was clearly not an ideal situation from the point of view of efficient organisation and of proper democratic representation.  That such a large number of houses in the area of one local authority are owned by another which is responsible for management and maintenance and that the local authority members elected by the residents of these houses exercise no control over these matters is clearly undesirable.</P>
      <P>The break-up of Dublin county into three separate local authorities was bound to exacerbate an already confused position in housing.  The same arguments apply, with somewhat lesser force, to land holdings generally.  The Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993 sought to rationalise this situation by providing that, in general, houses should be owned by and be the responsibility of the local authority in whose area the houses are situated.  Similarly, lands not immediately required would be transferred from one authority to the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly, a reorganisation of this nature poses complex issues, including the terms under which transfers are to take <Col N="2287" /> place.  For this reason, the Act set out a procedure where schemes would be prepared by the managers, after consultations with each other and their elected councils.  Schemes so adopted were to be submitted to the Minister for approval.  The other authorities affected then have the right to make submissions to him.</P>
    <P>As required by the Act, Dublin Corporation has made schemes for the transfer of dwellings and land owned by it and situated in the functional area of South Dublin County Council to that council.  These schemes were received by the Minister for the Environment on 22 December 1994.  Copies were also sent to the manager of South Dublin County Council and submissions in relation to the schemes were received by the Minister from that authority on 16 February 1995.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Act, the Minister is now required to consider the schemes together with South Dublin County Council's submissions on them. He may approve the scheme as submitted, make revisions to the schemes, or direct that another scheme be made taking account of specified matters.</P>
    <P>In view of the quasi-judicial nature of the Minister's statutory functions and the short time the schemes and submissions are with the Minister it would not be appropriate to comment at this stage on the possible outcome.  The issue and the interests of all concerned will be considered very carefully by the Minister before he reaches a decision.</P>

      <P>Thank you for <Col N="2288" /> allowing me to raise this matter.  Following reports that a decision was about to be made to transfer the divisional headquarters from Dundalk to Drogheda I tabled a question last week.  Unfortunately, the wrong decisons was made. This is the second time in five years that the divisional headquarters has been transferred.  In 1989 it was transferred to Dundalk mainly for operational reasons.  I understand that at that time strong representations were made by the British authorities who could not understand that the divisional headquarters was not located in the largest town along the border.  The Government accepted this view and made the right decision.</P>
      <P>The divisional headquarters is now being transferred to Drogheda mainly for administrative reasons.  I have heard it said that this makes sense in terms of its geographical location.  Why does it make sense now?  A different view was adopted in 1989.  I have also heard it said that because of the evolving peace process there is no longer any necessity to have the divisional headquarters located on the Border.  I find this strange and if that is the case, it is premature to say the least.  Today I received telephone calls from a number of constituents who, apparently&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No; the Deputy knows some of them.  They come from the Deputy's area in Ravensdale.  Apparently, the RUC and some British Army helicopters entered the State at Ravensdale. I do not know how the Minister will be able to justify this game of musical chairs in transferring what is a very prestigious office.  Is it being transferred for reasons of convenience?  Has it anything to do with the fact &mdash; I say this jocosely &mdash; that the Minister comes from north County Dublin and might like a divisional headquarters located nearby?</P>

      <P>The wrong decision has been made.  In early November last before the fall of the last Government I was made aware by a number of gardaí that they understood that moves were afoot.  When I raised the matter with the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, she informed me that there was no such proposal and that if it was decided to make such a proposal she would take my views on the matter into account.  Did the present Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, take the views of the Oireachtas Members for that constituency, including the man who will speak after me, into account? It is only fair that their views should be taken into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing his time with me.  We are at one in protesting at the decision to transfer the divisional headquarters from the county town of Dundalk to Drogheda.  Each year the crime rate in Dundalk is at least 30 per cent higher than in Drogheda.  That will continue to be the position given its proxmity to the Border.  As the pickings become leaner in the North perhaps the rate of cross-Border crime will increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to transfer the divisional headquarters from a town which has the highest crime rate in the country after Dublin, Cork and Limerick defies logic. Is it being transferred for the convenience of high ranking members of the Garda Síochána?  Dundalk has also suffered grievously from terrorist activity which may recur in the future. The crime rate in the town is unacceptable.  I draw particular attention to the terrible road statistics in County Louth, the smallest county in <Col N="2290" /> Ireland.  Every year it heads the list of road fatalities.  Only last week six young people lost their lives.  I underline the need for a highway patrol on the Newry road.  That aspect of police activity is totally neglected in our county.</P>
    <P>I accept the Minister will say the transfer of the headquarters is a bureaucratic necessity and, while I am thankful to Deputy Ahern for sharing his time with me, I must suggest that had he been the Minister for Justice, this bureaucratic decision would have been taken.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to clarify the position regarding the proposed transfer of the Divisional Headquarters for the Louth/Meath Division from Dundalk to Drogheda, and I thank Deputies Ahern and McGahon for raising this matter this evening.</P>
      <P>As I outlined in my reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy Ahern yesterday, I recently approved a proposal from the Garda Commissioner to transfer the Garda Divisional Headquarters of the Louth/Meath Division from Dundalk to Drogheda and in the light of the Deputy's remarks I will outline the background to this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said in my reply to the parliamentary question, a new Garda station, which was approved by the former Minister for Justice is being built in Drogheda at present and it makes sense, given the new facilities being provided, that it should become the Divisional Headquarters.  There are many other convincing reasons why the Divisional Headquarters should be located at Drogheda and those were outlined by the Garda Commissioner when he put the proposal to me for approval.  For <Col N="2291" /> example, a number of units normally associated with a Divisional Headquarters did not move to Dundalk in the first place.  These include crime prevention and community relations; public service vehicles inspectors; telecommunications, and the traffic corps.</P>
    <P>Under the present arrangement the Divisional Headquarters in Dundalk does not have ready access to these units.  Dundalk is located geographically at the north east corner of the division and is over 60 miles from the furthest point in the division.  Drogheda is a much more central location within the division both geographical and in terms of proximity to all the major population centres within the division.  In the circumstances, the Commissioner is satisfied, and I agree with him, that it makes good operational sense to transfer the Divisional Headquarters back to Drogheda.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the relocation of the Divisional Headquarters at Drogheda will involve the transfer of one chief superintendent, three other members of the <Col N="2292" /> Force engaged in administrative duties and two clerical assistants.  There will be no reduction in the operational policing services provided in the Dundalk area. At present there are 66 members of the Force assigned to Drogheda Garda Station and 98 members to Dundalk Garda Station.</P>
    <P>As I have said work is underway on a new station at Drogheda and I expect it will be completed in the latter half of this year.  I will invite the two Deputies to its opening.  The transfer of the Divisional Headquarters from Dundalk to Drogheda will take place at that stage.</P>
    <P>I should add that accommodation facilities at Dundalk are inadequate and cramped with portacabins having to be used to ease accommodation pressures and it is intended that the Garda housing officer and an official from my Department will inspect Dundalk Garda station and consult with local Garda management to establish what its accommodation requirements are as a District Headquarters.</P>

This programme would incorporate homemaking skills, advice on nutrition, family planning, dental care, safety and consanguinity; the development of models of traveller participation in health promotion and prevention to ensure the health education programmes are delivered to maximum effect, ensuring the health boards make special arrangements to encourage and permit travellers to avail of primary care services, in particular GP services, dental care, ante and post natal care, family planning, child immunisation and, where appropriate, hospital based services; simplifying services under the GMS including eligibility, immunisation <Col N="2079" /> and general health records to ensure better continuity of care from one health board area to another; liaising closely with other relevant statutory and voluntary agencies providing services to travellers to ensure better targeting of services.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 38 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that certain voluntary hospitals have ethical codes which set out the circumstances in which sterilisations may be carried out.</P>
      <P>There are some 27 health board and voluntary hospitals throughout the country which provide sterilisation services.It should be noted that this represents an increase of eight hospitals since the commission reported in January 1993.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the charter of rights for hospital patients, when a recommended medical procedure is not available at a particular hospital, the patient has the right to ask her consultant to transfer her elsewhere, where the procedure is available.</P>
      <P>There are a total of 1,965 patients awaiting tubal ligation procedures in hospitals where this procedure is available.A number of hospitals do not maintain formal waiting lists in respect of patients requiring tubal ligations since there is no waiting time in these hospitals once the decision to proceed with the operation has been made.  A particular problem has arisen at the South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital in Cork, which has a waiting list of 875. The Department is in continuing discussions with the hospital to agree measures to resolve this problem.</P>
      <P>While the detailed allocation of the funding available for the reduction of waiting lists in 1995 has not yet been finalised, resources will continue to be targeted at those areas where waiting times for surgery are excessively long. Discussions with health agencies will commence shortly with a view to identifying those areas where the resources available this year can be employed to maximum effect.  The question of allocating resources in respect of tubal ligation waiting lists will be examined in this context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The central recommendation of the report of the Kilkenny incest investigation was that the necessary resources be made available to facilitiate the implementation of all sections of the Child Care Act, 1991 and in particular those provisions which relate to the care and protection of children who are being abused or neglected.</P>
      <P>The policy agreement between the Government parties, A Government of Renewal, contains a commitment to the rapid implementation of the Child Care Act.  The Government's determination to honour this commitment is reflected in the fact that the Health Estimate for 1995 includes provision for additional funding of £10 million for child care services.This will facilitate the commencement before the end of the year of Parts III, IV, V and VI which deal with the protection of children in emergencies, care proceedings and the powers and duties of health board in relation to children in their care.  These provisions will greatly strengthen the powers of the courts, the health boards and the Garda to intervene effectively in relation to child abuse and neglect.  The need for the early implementation of these key provisions was underlined in the Kilkenny incest report.</P>
      <P>The Kilkenny report also recommended that procedures for the identification, investigation and management of child abuse should be revised and that agreed protocols should be put in place which clearly identify the roles and responsibilities of the relevant staff and provide for appropriate inter-programme collaboration within health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At regional level each of the health boards has reviewed its procedures in the light of these recommendations and <Col N="2086" /> has taken specific measures to improve arrangements in this area.  For example, the North-Eastern Health Board has recently launched a manual of child protection guidelines which is intended to promote good practice by ensuring that child care professionals are provided with standardised guidelines on the detection and inter-agency management of situations where the abuse or neglect of children is evident or suspected.  Similar procedures are currently being developed by the other health boards.</P>
    <P>At national level, my Department, in consultation with the Garda Síochána, is in the process of finalising a new procedure for the notification of suspect cases of child abuse between the health boards and the Garda.  This procedure, which revolves around a standardised form for the reporting of suspected abuse, is aimed at ensuring closer co-ordination between key personnel from both agencies in order to facilitate the twin objectives of protecting the child and the full investigation of any crime. The implementation of this new procedure on a national basis in the near future will give effect to a central recommendation of the report of the Kilkenny investigation.  These measures represent the major step forward in the comprehensive review of current arrangements for the reporting of suspected child abuse.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The accident and emergency departments of the six major hospitals in Dublin operate a 24 hour service.  Because of the nature of the work, it is not possible to predict the workload of hospital accident and emergency departments at any particular time.  Accordingly, delays do occur from time to time, particularly during the winter when there has tended to be an upsurge in the number of patients presenting at accident and emergency departments for treatment.  At all times, however, priority is accorded to those patients most in need of immediate medical attention.</P>
      <P>In addition, periodic increases in the number of patients requiring admission to hospital results in patients having to be placed in temporary accommodation, pending the availability of more appropriate facilities.  Every effort is made to keep this practice to a minimum.</P>
      <P>One of the principal causes of delay in placing patients in the most appropriate type of accommodation has been the shortage of suitable facilities for elderly patients who are no longer in need of acute hospital care.  The shortage of more appropriate facilities results in elderly patients having to remain in acute hospitals longer than necessary consequently reducing the number of beds available for admissions through accident and emergency departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an immediate response to this problem.  I have recently provided £850,000 to the Eastern Health Board to <Col N="2088" /> provide additional alternative accommodation for patients in acute hospitals, including the Mater and Beaumont Hospitals, who no longer require acute care.  Placing such patients in accommodation more appropriate to their needs eases the pressure on the acute hospitals and reduces the delays in admitting patients to hospital.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to the accident and emergency departments is monitored by my Department on an ongoing basis and I assure the Deputy of my continuing concern that the accident and emergency hospitals in Dublin are enabled to respond effectively to the demands placed upon them.  I will continue to monitor the situation with a view to taking further action if required.</P>

The diseases listed in the schedule to the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981, are those caused by pathogenic organisms which are transmissible to humans and have the capacity to spread quickly and widly through the community.  The objective of the Infectious Diseases Regulations and the schedule of diseases is to enable public health authorities to quickly identify outbreaks and take measures to prevent the further spread of these diseases.Asthma cannot be considered in this category and has causative factors other than transmissible organisms.</P>
      <P>The reasons for the prevalence of asthma internationally are as yet poorly understood but much research is in progress to try and elucidate the underlying factors.  The establishment of the new public health departments in the health boards with their emphasis on epidemiology will greatly improve the level of information on the evidence of morbidity on all diseases and conditions in each local area, including that on asthma.</P>
      <P>In conjunction with the Asthma Society of Ireland my Department is endeavouring to increase awareness and understanding of the disease among the public.  The most modern and effective preventive and curative agents for the disease are available in this country.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The main income support scheme operated by my Department for people with disabilities is the disabled person's maintenance allowance (DPMA) scheme.  Recipients of this allowance are entitled to earn up to £33.30 per week from employment or training which has been approved by the health board without affecting their entitlement to this allowance.  My Department amended the disabled person's maintenance allowance regulations in July, 1994 to ensure that disabled person's maintenance allowance recipients moving into employment or training would have no difficulty coming back on to this allowance if they were unable to continue with the employment or training.  I might add that responsibility for the operation and administration of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme is transferring to the Department of Social Welfare from July, 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2093" /> The National Rehabilitation Board (NRB) which is an executive agency of my Department provides an assessment, counselling, vocational guidance and placement service to people with disabilities throughout the country.  The NRB administers the European Social Fund (ESF) training budget on behalf of my Department and a total of 3,504 whole-time equivalent training places for people with disabilities were maintained at a cost of £28.466 million in 1994.  Training is delivered through a network of over 40 vocational training centres nationwide and a wide variety of vocational and educational training courses are available to trainees.  All levels and types of disability are catered for with the ultimate aim of equipping the trainees with the skills necessary to gain employment in the labour market. People participating in these courses are allowed to retain their disabled person's maintenance allowance during the training period.</P>
    <P>In regard to employment for people with disabilities, the employment support scheme which is funded by my Department has been very succesful.  A feature of this scheme is that the employer receives a subsidy to compensate for the loss of productivity of the employee with a disability.  The numbers participating in this scheme have grown steadily since 1990 and at the end of December, 1994 there were 250 people with a disability employed under this scheme at a cost of £584,000.  I was pleased to approve an increase in funding of £150,000 for this scheme in 1995.</P>
    <P>Another important initiative has been the establishment of the three year pilot programme for the employment of people with disabilities in viable business enterprises.  My Department is responsible for overseeing this scheme with the assistance of the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  To date six businesses employing over 130 employees with a disability have been grant aided under this scheme.  A condition of the scheme is that at least 50 per cent of the employees in any viable <Col N="2094" /> business must be people who have a disability themselves.  Funding of £2 million is being provided for this scheme in 1995.  Employees on both the employment support scheme and the pilot programme for the employment of people with disabilities are also entitled to retain their secondary benefits for a one year period.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these measures are making a significant contribution to the improvement of the employment, training and education opportunities of people with disabilities.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The long term illness scheme entitles persons who suffer from certain specified illnesses to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of these particular illnesses.  The original aim of the scheme was to ensure that persons with a long term disability or disease which is treatable by drug therapy would not have to suffer expense in order to obtain their required drugs and medicines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The needs of people with significant or ongoing medical expenses are now being met by a range of other schemes <Col N="2096" /> which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
    <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses (general practitioner fees, prescribed drugs etc.) due to a long term medical condition such as spinal injury, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  In some cases a medical card may issue to a family member on a personal basis.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
    <P>Persons who suffer from an ongoing medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for people who do not have a medical card or long term illness book and are certified as having a long term medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of an amount per month, currently £32.

    <P>Under the drugs refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of drug schemes to those with medical expenses arising from conditions such as spinal injury.

        <i>Limerick East):</i> In line with the provisions of the programme <i>A Government of Renewal</i> £8 million has been provided this year to continue the progress of the past two years in reducing waiting lists.  The detailed allocation of the resources provided this year has yet to be finalised.  However, as in the past two years, resources will be allocated to those areas where the waiting times for surgery are excessively long.  Discussions with health agencies will commence shortly with a view to identifying those areas where the additional resources available this year can be employed to maximum effect.</P>

      <P>The Government regularly makes known its concern about the situation in East Timor to partners in the European Union and supports Portugal when it raises the issue.  At the General Affairs Council of EU Ministers on 6 February, the Portuguese Foreign Minister, Mr. Durao Barroso, reported to his colleagues on the fifth round of talks which took place on 9 January between Mr. Barroso and the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr. Ali <Col N="2103" /> Alatas.  Portugal considers that those talks made some progress and the United Nations Secretary-General has undertaken to invite the Timorese, both those who accept and those who reject the Indonesian presence in East Timor, to participate in a dialogue meeting in April.</P>
      <P>The issue of self-determination for the people of East Timor is a matter for the parties engaged in the talks which are taking place under the auspices of the United Nations.  The Irish Government will support any just, comprehensive and internationally acceptable solution which emerges from the talks under UN auspices.</P>

At last year's session of the CHR, the chairman issued a consensus statement calling on the Indonesian Government to continue expanding access to East Timor for human rights and humanitarian organisations.  The Indonesian Government undertook to invite the special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions to visit East Timor and the visit took place in July 1994.</P>
      <P>The current session of the CHR is taking place in Geneva and negotiations are in progress on the issue of East Timor.  It is the strong wish of the Irish Government that the CHR will seek further access to East Timor for human rights and humanitarian organisations and for relevant special rapporteurs and-or working groups of the CHR.</P>

The programme provides for a monitoring committee representative of the various interests involved which includes Commission representatives, implementing Departments and representatives of other relevant interests such as the new Border Regional Authority.

Formal adoption of the initiative is expected around end April and the operational programme is expected to be approved later in the year.  In drawing up the programme the two administrations will pay particular attention to ensure full complementarity with INTERREG and other programmes relevant to the border region, including the International Fund for Ireland.  While consideration of the structures necessary to ensure this will form part of that process it is envisaged that monitoring arrangements similar to the INTERREG programme (involving <Col N="2109" /> largely the same participants) will be put in place.</P>

In the case of both qualifying disabled drivers and disabled passengers relief is granted on fuel used in a qualifying vehicle up to an annual maximum of 600 gallons.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Deputy will be aware that the review of the general medical services scheme, carried out in 1992, considered the issue of the increased cost of prescribing to the State in some detail.  The report of the review group included a number of recommendations in this area which have formed the basis of an integrated strategy adopted with a view to rationalising the <Col N="2111" /> cost and use of prescription drugs and medicines within the State.</P>
      <P>This strategy consists of a number of elements including the use of indicative drug targets, the provision of educational programmes for GPs, the establishment of a National Therapeutics Advisory Committee, and, more recently, the establishment of a National Medicines Information Centre.  In addition, my Department has an agreement with the pharmaceutical industry which has frozen the price of drugs for a four year period from 1 August 1993.</P>
      <P>Since the introduction of this strategy, there has been a dramatic change in the trend increase in expenditure on the GMS scheme.  The end of year figures for expenditure on drugs and medicines in the scheme showed that expenditure in 1993 increased over the 1992 outturn figure by just 2.64 per cent while the indicators are that expenditure in 1994 will show an increase of less than 6 per cent on the 1993 outturn.  In both years, therefore, there has been a significant improvement on the trend increase of an average of 11 per cent per annum which had been evidenced over the previous five years.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to continue to pursue the policy of developing cost-effectiveness in the use of medicines through arrangements agreed with the professions and the pharmaceutical industry.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I understand from the Western Health Board that the waiting time for routine radiological investigations is 7 to 10 days at Mayo General Hospital.  The maximum waiting time for specialist examinations is three to four months.  However, I am assured by the board that urgent radiological investigations always receive priority attention.</P>
      <P>The provision of radiology services at Mayo General Hospital, including the identification of any additional staffing needs, are a matter for the Western Health Board in the first instance.  Proposals for the filling of additional posts are reviewed on a regular basis by my Department.  This review is undertaken having regard to service and personnel criteria in the context of the priority afforded to each post by the agency concerned and with particular regard to the availability of financial resources.</P>
      <P>Under existing personnel policy therefore, it is the responsibility of each health agency to submit prioritised manpower proposals to my Department, including details of service requirements and proposed funding arrangements.</P>
      <P>Proposals in respect of the posts referred to by the Deputy have not been included by the Western Health Board in its most recent manpower submission to my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Estimates indicate that the number of people with a significant form of dementia in this country, including Alzheimer's disease is between 20,000 and 30,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report, <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly</i>, stressed the need to develop a range of services for people with dementia and their families, including purpose-built accommodation.  The report was adopted as official Government policy towards the elderly. Between 1990 and 1992 an additional £9 million was made available to the health <Col N="2115" /> services to implement the key recommendations of the report, including the strengthening of home and community support for people with dementia and their families.  The investment by boards in additional community nursing, day care and respite services has increased the support available to sufferers of Alzheimer's disease and their carers. The care of those with dementia is clearly emerging as a priority for many boards, a development which I fully support.  All eight health boards have indicated that they have locations at which residential, day or respite care is available for Alzheimer sufferers though not all of these centres are dedicated exclusively to Alzheimer patients.</P>
    <P>In line with the commitment of the health strategy, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i>, to develop specialist assessment and community support services for people suffering from dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, and their carers, funding has been made available by my Department this year to health boards to provide additional specialist services for those with dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, in south-east Dublin, Limerick and Cork.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, has announced changes in the carer's allowance which will mean that more carers, including those caring for victims of Alzheimer's disease, will qualify for an allowance and more will qualify for a higher allowance.</P>
    <P>The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 which commenced on 1 September, 1993 widens the options available to those caring for dependant relatives with dementia.  Under the Act, health boards may pay a subvention towards the cost of care in a nursing home of a person who needs that care and who does not have the resources to pay the cost.  Almost £15 million has been made available this year to fund subventions under the Act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2116" /> As Minister for Health I am very conscious of the contribution made by carers to the maintenance of dependant people in their own homes.  I will continue to encourage health boards to develop and extend support services for these informal carers, whether by services in the home, by respite care in a hospital or nursing home or long term residential care.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick-East):</i> Information on birth defects is available from a number of sources.  Registers operate in the Eastern Health Board area and in Galway; the birth notification scheme collects information on birth defects which are apparent before a new-born baby is discharged from hospital.  Information would also be available from the hospital in-patient inquiry scheme in respect of babies with birth defects who were subsequently treated in an acute hospital.  I consider it would be more appropriate to consider how existing sources of information on birth defects can be developed rather than to develop a separate register.</P>

      <i>Notes</i>
    </P>
    <P>(1)  Data relating to 1991, 1992 and 1993 are provisional: they relate to the year of registration rather than the year of occurrence (as is the case with final figures).  In addition, it is likely that the number of suicides for these years will be revised upwards as deaths previously unclassified are reclassified as suicides as more information becomes available to the C.S.O.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2119" /> (2)  Data have been extracted from the Report on Vital Statistics (complied by the C.S.O.) for the relevant years.</P>
    <P>(3)  Considerable caution should be exercised in drawing inferences from data prior to the mid 1970's as it is generally accepted that there was significant under-recording of suicides until then. In the case of more recent data, the C.S.O. accepts that the true number of suicides could be underestimated by up to 20 per cent.</P>

The equipping and commissioning period will then take place.  The hospital is scheduled to open in 1997, as planned.  The current position in relation to the Tallaght Hospital is that the project is three weeks behind schedule.  However, the Government is committed to the completion of the Tallaght Hospital within the four-year timeframe.  I am optimistic that this target will be achieved.</P>
      <P>The total cost of the new hospital is in the region of £123 million, of which £30.4 million has been spent to date.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy <Col N="2120" /> is aware £12 million is being made available in 1995 for the development of services for people with a mental handicap nationally.  Of this, £2 million is being used to strengthen the funding base of some agencies and to meet identified needs in existing services.</P>
      <P>Eight million pounds revenue and £2 million capital will be allocated to the health board regions for the further development of new services including: additional residential/respite places; additional day care places; the further development of the home support service; the development of services for persons with autism in response to the policy document which was published in September 1994; the development of services for persons with mental handicap who are also behaviourally disturbed in response to a policy document which will be issued shortly; the continuation of the programme to transfer persons with a mental handicap from psychiatric hospitals and other unsuitable placements to more appropriate care settings; and the provision of hepatitis B vaccinations for staff working in the mental handicap services and also for client groups considered to be at risk.</P>
      <P>In addition, £4.2 million is being provided for the development of training centres which will benefit people with disabilities including those with a mental handicap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Information relating to the level of need for additional services in the Eastern Health Board region has been submitted to my Department.  However, I am not yet in a position to indicate the amount of additional funding which will be allocated to individual health board regions.  I will let the Deputy have this information as soon as it is available. The precise services to be provided in each region will be agreed with the regional mental handicap co-ordinating <Col N="2121" /> committees within the guidelines issued by the Department and approved by the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the provision of additional services for persons with a mental handicap has a very high priority within my Department.  Between 1990 and 1994, a cumulative figure of £26.5 million revenue and £6.08 million capital in additional funding has been invested in services for people with mental handicap.  From this the Eastern Health Board region was allocated £10.02 million revenue, and associated capital funding.  In line with the commitment contained in the policy document, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, the Government is committed to eliminating waiting lists and to maximising the quality of life and right of participation of every citizen with a mental handicap.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Intravenous drug misusers receive medical treatment from a number of different sources including out-patient drugs treatment centres, hospitals and general practitioners.  It would not be possible to give a total cost in respect of these treatment facilities. The cost of a satellite clinic which offers a range of services to drug misusers is in excess of £400,000 per annum.  The Eastern Health Board operates three such clinics in the Dublin area and the Board proposes to open three further clinics during 1995.  The Drug Treatment Centre, Pearse Street, which also offers a wide range of treatment to drug misusers has received a financial allocation of £1.167 million for 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware my <Col N="2122" /> Department's policy on HIV/AIDS and drug abuse are closely interlinked given that 57 per cent of HIV positive cases are intravenous drug use related.</P>
    <P>Since 1992, substantial funding has been allocated to allow for the development of services particularly in the Dublin area, where the majority of drug misusers reside.  This funding has allowed for the provision of extensive prevention and treatment services by the Eastern Health Board which, together with the Drug Treatment Centre and voluntary organisations, provides a comprehensive treatment network for drug misusers.</P>
    <P>In 1993 almost £5 million in additional funding was provided by my Department in the HIV/AIDS and drug misuse field, £3.4 million was allocated in 1994 and a further £1.627 million is being allocated in 1995.</P>
    <P>The role of the voluntary organisations in the provision of services for those affected by HIV/AIDS and drug misuse is vital.  Since 1992 my Department has provided funding, through the health boards, to voluntary organisations to support them in their work in this area.  A total amount in excess of £700,000 was made available in 1994 to the following agencies:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Cáirde</P>
    <P>Body Positive</P>
    <P>Merchant's Quay Project</P>
    <P>Anna Liffey Drug Project</P>

    <P>This represents an increase of 55 per <Col N="2123" /> cent over the 1993 allocation to voluntary organisations.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar-General that the birth in question &mdash; a home birth &mdash; had taken place in 1929, and was registered on foot of information furnished to the Registrar by the father who signed the entry in the birth register.The date of birth recorded was recently disputed and shown to be inconsistent with the true date of birth as verified by Baptismal records.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances of the case it is necessary to effect a re-registration of the birth.  All contemporary documentary evidence required by law has been obtained and a written authority to reregister the birth has issued to the relevant Registrar.  When registration has been completed a certified copy of the new birth entry will be sent to the General Register Office for transmission to the applicant.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The Deputy will be aware that no medicinal product may be authorised in this country unless the requirements of quality, safety and efficacy are met to the satisfaction of the National Drugs Advisory Board (NDAB).</P>
      <P>I am advised that the article referred to by the Deputy is misleading in so far as the requirements of the NDAB are concerned.  The controls applicable to generic products are the same as for any other medicinal product in that they must satisfy the full criteria of quality, safety, and efficacy before they may be authorised in the State.</P>
      <P>The emphasis given to the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) dissolution requirements in the article is misleading in the context of the products on the market in this country in that they are not necessarily relevant to these products.The tablets concerned are manufactured to the standards of the British Pharmacopoeia (not the USP).  In this context compliance with the British Pharmacopoeial dissolution test is but one of the tests which contribute to the overall assurance of the consistency of the quality of a product with respect to its drug release properties and in respect of its bioavailability as established in the development of the product.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that the authors of the study referred to would not have access to the specifications established in respect of each product as approved by the NDAB.  These remain confidential between the manufacturers concerned and the NDAB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has raised this question in the context of the operation of the Indicative Drug Target Scheme.  I would point out that the duty and obligation of individual doctors to provide the most appropriate management for each patient who presents and, in so doing, to utilise resources available for the optimum care of patients individually and <Col N="2125" /> collectively is emphasised by all parties to the scheme.</P>
    <P>In this context the right of the doctor to prescribe as he/she considers necessary remains absolutely in place and there is no limitation on the range of items from which he/she can choose to prescribe.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that applicants for a provisional driving licence in the category B class must also make a separate application for category W which involves the applicant paying a double fee of £24; and the steps, if any, he will take to correct this anomaly.</Quest>

      <P>An applicant is entitled to a provisional driving licence for both categories B and W on the basis of one application and for one fee.  Where an application is made to have an additional category added to an existing licence, no additional fee is normally <Col N="2135" /> payable.  I understand, however, that some licensing authorities issue, instead, a new licence for the full two year period, for which a fee is payable.  I have arranged for an instruction to issue requiring licensing authorities to adopt a uniform procedure under which no additional fee would be payable where an additional category is added to an existing licence for the unexpired period of the licence.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>As far as educational psychologists are concerned, the position is that eight additional psychologists commenced employment in my Department on 20 February 1995.  It is expected that a further two psychologists will take up appointment in the very near future.</P>
      <P>The needs of schools in the south inner city of Dublin will be taken into account when assignments are being made.  Priority will be given to schools serving disadvantaged areas.  The provision of a psychological service in the south inner city of Dublin, and elsewhere, has had to await completion of the recruitment process for the eight psychologists mentioned above. However, it is intended to begin to develop a service in the south inner city of Dublin immediately after Easter.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy is set out in the following tables.  I should point out that prior to 1989 Garda recruits were included in the overall strength figures.  Since April 1989, with the introduction of the two year training programme for recruits, only those members who have been attested to the force i.e. completed phase 3 of training, are included in the overall strength of the force.  For example, on 1 January, 1995, there were 436 recruits in phases 1, 2 and 3 of training in addition to the total strength of 10,837.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that records are not kept in such a way as to readily extract the annual cost of the Garda Drugs Unit based at Harcourt Square.  The unit consists of 28 personnel who have access to Garda vehicles, administration and forensic facilities.  The cost of the unit would include not only the cost of salaries but also the cost of these ancillary facilities.</P>
      <P>Because of the number of variable factors involved in the illegal sale of drugs, the value of drugs seized could only be estimated very roughly, if at all. For this reason, it is not possible to give an accurate value of the drugs seized. However, the quantities seized are accurately quantifiable and are as set out below:&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities inform me that 64 primary schools in the Dublin North Central and South Central Divisions were visited by members of the Garda during the period from September 1993 to June 1994 as part of the Garda schools programme.Community gardaí would also have visited post-primary schools within their areas of responsibility as part of their normal community policing duties. Raising the awareness of young people to the dangers of drug abuse formed an important part of these visits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that they have drawn up a comprehensive community based drugs awareness programme and arrangements are well advanced towards its <Col N="2141" /> implementation throughout the country. The programme will be operated by community gardaí and juvenile liaison officers and will involve visits to schools as well as attending meetings of community-based groups and the business community.  This programme will include the use of video and audio displays.Extra training will be provided for those gardaí involved in the programme.</P>
    <P>The programme has been carefully devised with the objective of advising young people of the dangers of drugs and encouraging them to resist the pressures to take drugs.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may also be aware of the mobile drug prevention unit which was launched in October 1994.  This has been used by the gardaí in the course of visits to various centres and communities, including schools, with the object of raising awareness about the dangers of drug abuse and imparting advice and assistance where necessary.</P>

      <P>A Garda sub-station was officially opened in Leixlip in 1991 and is open to the public from 12.30 p.m. to 1.30 p.m. and from 7.30 p.m. to 9 p.m. from Monday to Friday and from 12 noon to 2 p.m. on Saturday.  There are no plans to change these arrangements, which ensure that the maximum number of gardaí are available for outdoor policing duties in Leixlip rather than being confined to administrative tasks at the sub-station.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that Leixlip forms part of the Ballyfermot district and receives a 24 hour police service from Lucan Garda station.  On 7 March 1994 the Garda authorities assigned a sergeant and two extra gardaí for the purpose of policing the Leixlip area bringing the overall number of gardaí allocated exclusively to policing duties in Leixlip to one sergeant and six gardaí.  The policing of the area is also augmented by mobile patrols from within the Ballyfermot district.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that the present arrangements are adequate to meet the policing needs of the Leixlip area and do not envisage the establishment of a Garda station in Leixlip.  However, the future adequacy of those resources will be kept under review by Garda management.  I am not aware of a request for a meeting but if the Leixlip Town Commissioners wish to contact my office this will be favourably considered.</P>

      <P>A large number of measures, which were announced in this year's budget, will directly improve the position of many widows as follows: a general 2.5 per cent increase in widowed persons weekly social welfare payments which will be effective from mid-June 1995 instead of the normal effective date of end of July and will benefit all widows and widowers; for widowed persons with children an increase of £7 per month in child benefit for each child, together with an extension of the age at which child benefit is payable, to 18 years that is up to the 19th birthday, for those in full time education or attending certain FÁS courses, effective from September 1995.  The new child benefit rates will mean an increase from £20 to £27 a month for the first and second child and from £25 to £32 a month for the third and subsequent children.  Currently widowed persons care for approximately 19,000 children; child dependant allowances for widowed persons will continue up to age 22 years for those in full-time education.  An increase of £5 for each child in primary and second level schools in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, bringing these payments to £40 and £55 respectively; extension of the free colour television licence to all qualified recipients from October.  This will benefit widowed persons who currently qualify for free television licence; an increase from £5 to £10 in the amount of additional means disregarded for the purposes of qualifying for free fuel; the children of widowed persons who are in third level education may qualify for the enhanced student summer jobs scheme and widowed persons sons or daughters <Col N="2145" /> who qualify for unemployment assistance will now get a minimum of £25 per week.</P>

      <P>The situation regarding work permits in respect of the non-EU citizens employed in the dredging operations in the harbours at Cork, Waterford and Malahide has already been considered by my Department in consultation with the Department of Justice which has responsibility for the Aliens legislation.  The Department of Justice has decided that the non-nationals in question do not come within the scope of the Aliens legislation as technically they have not landed in the State.</P>
      <P>The legal provisions relating to work permits are set out in the Aliens (Amendment) Order, 1975, which states that an alien may not enter the service of an employer in the State save in accordance with a permit issued to the employer by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  As the non-EU employees in question are not regarded as having entered the State the question of work permits does not arise.</P>
      <P>This matter has already been explained to the Department of the Marine.  I have recently received further representations in the matter from the Minister of State at that Department and I will be responding to them in due course.</P>

      <P>The employment of non-EU nationals by sub-contractors on EU funded projects at very low wages was the subject of discussions between the Department of the Marine and the Department of Enterprise and Employment last year.  At that time the Department was advised that no action could be taken on this matter.  However, as this matter has come to the fore again and in view of the serious concern there is about this practice, which I share, my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Deputy Eamon Gilmore has raised the issue with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  He has asked that this matter be examined again with a view to ascertaining what steps, if any, can be taken to deal with the problem.</P>
