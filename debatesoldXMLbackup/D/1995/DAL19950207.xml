      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Taoiseach</askee>
      <Quest>if he will raise with the British Prime Minister at their next meeting the desirability of ending the system of political vetting of community work and the introduction instead of a proper system of financial accountability for the expenditure of public funds.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2136/95]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My next meeting with the British Prime Minister will be concerned principally with progress on the Joint Framework Document as a basis for all-party talks on an agreed political settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of all our efforts to advance the peace process and secure a return to full normality, the Government is determined to assist in every way community development in Northern Ireland, particularly in disadvantaged areas.  It is the Government's hope that in this new era of peace, the opportunities for social and economic regeneration in deprived communities will receive all necessary support irrespective of the political views held by <Col N="1322" /> such communities.  The Government would, of course, endorse the need for full financial accountability in respect of all such aid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the continued political vetting of badly needed community facilities, for example, Conway Mills, is indefensible in light of the ceasefire and that this is a source of great annoyance both for loyalists and republicans?  Is he aware in regard to the Conway Mills application that it was notified only ten days ago of the renewed refusal by the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the continuation of political vetting is hard to defend in the context of the cessation of voilence.  This is a matter we will take up and have taken up on many occasions in the past with the authorities but that we have had peace for such a considerable length of time strengthens our case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of deprived areas does the Taoiseach agree it appears that people of an approved political persuasion will receive all the funding in the world whereas the places where a real need exists will not receive a penny if the people concerned support certain political parties?  Does he agree that whatever rationale there may have been before the ceasefire there is none now?  Will the Government take up this issue with the British Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have taken it up and will continue to do so.  I hope it can be discussed between the political parties, all the people affected and the Government authorities in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In pressing the case will the Taoiseach remind the British authorities that as far back as 1990 the Irish Government and the leader of the SDLP, Mr. John Hume, made strenuous efforts to get the British Government to change its mind on this issue?  Does he <Col N="1323" /> agree that it will be difficult to persuade the people of west Belfast of the benefits of peace when discriminatory decisions continue unchanged?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The current situation is different from that in 1990 when the campaign of violence supported by Sinn Féin continued; that is not the case now. I would make the case to the British Government that this has radically altered the situation and it is probably best to rely on this incontestable case rather than to bring up arguments that may have been advanced in 1990 which are not as necessary at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree, in line with the commitments in the Downing Street Declaration to recognise the rights and aspirations of both communities, that the case for Meanscoil Feiriste, for example, needs to be put forward by the Irish Government? On the question of public funding both here and in Northern Ireland, does he agree it is important to ensure that it goes to genuine community organisations and not to organisations which may be a front for any political party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Full financial accountability is an essential requirement to ensure that the money is used for the purposes for which it is given only and not to support any form of political activity.  That is and will always be essential in regard to any assistance for community development anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as Meanscoil Feiriste is concerned, as the House is no doubt aware, this was one of the first matters I took up with the British Prime Minister when I met him in Downing Street before Christmas.  Generosity in assistance to this all Irish second level school in Belfast will do a great deal to establish full meaning for the sense of parity esteem to which both communities in Northern Ireland ought to aspire. <Col N="1324" /> Increasingly, the Irish language is something that unites people of both traditions. It is well known that people of the majority tradition have taken an interest in the language and are participating in activities related to it, but it is particularly important to support the Irish language in Northern Ireland as a way of establishing that people of the Nationalist community and their traditions are fully accepted in a new dispensation in Northern Ireland.  I have stressed this point strongly in my meetings with the British Prime Minister.</P>

      <P>I will call the Deputy but I had hoped to make progress on other questions.  We must not forget that 30 minutes only are available to us on Tuesdays for dealing with questions to the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it from the Taoiseach's reply that his representations and the strong efforts he made six weeks ago have been ignored by the British Prime Minister and by Mr. Mayhew?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, I do not believe they were ignored.  There are a number of problems that the British Government feels it has to overcome in regard to the establishment of precedents. All of us who have been involved in Government at various times understand the difficulties that can be created by the setting of administrative precedents.  This is the problem it is seeking to overcome in regard to Meanscoil Feiriste.  In order of importance, I believe the precedents are not of great importance here and that the establishment of parity of esteem is of great importance and I am urging them to be generous in its response in that area.  I would not like to give the impression that there are no problems to be overcome.  There are genuine problems but I believe, from my face to face discussions both with the Prime <Col N="1325" /> Minister and particularly with Minister Ancram, that there is a genuine willingness to find a solution to these problems. A number of alternative solutions have been canvassed.  For example, arrangements within an existing campus was one of the suggestions made for accommodating Meanscoil Feiriste. Those need to be looked at in a constructive way by both sides.  It is important that those who are looking for Meanscoil Feiriste to be given full assistance should seek to build, in a constructive spirit, on suggestions that may be put from the other side rather than simply saying they want 100 per cent and nothing less will do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  There are other promises contained in the Programme for Government for which legislation will clearly be needed.  Can I take it, in keeping with his commitment in relation to my question that such legislation will be treated in like manner also?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Two weeks ago the Government Chief Whip circulated a list of legislation that was to be taken between now and July.  When I questioned the Taoiseach about the absence of legislation to deal with abortion <Col N="1326" /> information, he said it was a preliminary list and that it would be updated.  Can the Taoiseach give me any idea when that particular legislation might be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but, unfortunately, he has not given me any more information. We have been awaiting this legislation since the referendum over two years ago.  The last Government, for whatever reason, was not in a position to bring forward the legislation.  Will the Taoiseach give me a commitment that the legislation will be introduced this term?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Minister for Health has undertaken a lot of work on this and I believe he is well advanced in his consideration of the matter.  I would not like to put a specific date on it yet but I am satisfied that he has been working on this issue as one of the major priority items in his work programme.  I expect he will be in a position to come to Government very soon on the issue.  Following that, a decision will be taken, the Government will announce that decision and we will be proceeding therefrom.  I do not expect it will take very long.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.  I have not received a request to meet with either organisation to date.  However, I am very willing to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the organisations will be delighted to hear that.  Has the Taoiseach received a request from the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed to be included in his new nominees to the National Economic and Social Council and has he given consideration to that request?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I urge the Taoiseach to meet with both of these organisations and to have them included.  They exclusively represent important groups in our society and I would like the Taoiseach to give consideration, first, to meeting them soon and not to wait for a letter asking for a meeting but to invite them, as I believe he did with other organisations when he took office.  Second, will the Taoiseach have representatives from the Council for the Status of Women and the Irish National Organisation for the Unemployed appointed to NESC?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No consultants are retained on an on-going basis by my Department at present.  However, consultants have been, and will continue to be, engaged from time to time.</P>
      <P>I understand it was the practice of my predecessors to employ consultants, from a limited number of firms, on the basis of their proven record of skills.  I see an obvious advantage in this, especially where there are time limitations. However, I have come to no conclusions about the extent to which this practice should continue &mdash; my preference would be for whatever system results in the most efficient and effective outcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste and I had a very useful meeting with reprepresentatives of the SDLP on 26 January. The SDLP delegation comprised Mr. John Hume, Mr. Seamus Mallon and Mr. Eddie McGrady.</P>
      <P>This was the first in a series of meetings with Northern Ireland political parties. We reviewed the ongoing peace process.  The SDLP delegation emphasised the importance of the early completion of the framework document and the commencement of political dialogue leading to an agreed settlement.  The Tánaiste and I made clear our commitment to achieving this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept the urgency to see the publication of the framework document? Both Nationalists and Unionists want to see this document.  In my view, when it is published it will allay the fears of the Unionist Community because I believe it will be fair and balanced.  Can we expect to see this document this month?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have studiously avoided putting a date on the publication of the framework document because I believe that an attempt by any of the directly involved participants to set dates, where final agreement has not yet been reached, creates artificial pressures that are not in the interests of the process or of getting a fair and balanced framework document which the <Col N="1330" /> Governments concerned intend to achieve and which I know the Deputy wishes us to achieve.  I will not set a date on it, no matter how many times or how many different ways I am asked that question.  I have said repeatedly that 95 per cent or more of the work on the framework document is completed. There are, of course, many ancillary matters relating to and flowing from the framework document on which discussions between the Governments would be useful before publication. That is as far as I can go at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that when the Taoiseach met the SDLP the case of Lee Clegg was raised and I know the Taoiseach sought a report on this matter. Unfortunately, my question to the Taoiseach was transferred to the Minister for Foreign Affairs but, given the current publicity surrounding this particular case, has the Taoiseach received any response to his request for a report on this matter?  Has he or the Tánaiste discussed it with the Secretary of State or with the officials on the British side?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Inquiries were originally made on our part through the Maryfield secretariat and we have expressed our concern on the matter.  I am not aware that we have received a specific report on the subject at this juncture but I have no doubt that when the Tánaiste comes to answer the question now tabled to him on this matter he will be able to give the Deputy a more full statement in regard to it than I can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I asked the Taoiseach if he would take important questions on Northern Ireland on a weekly basis and he stated that he would.  He has just answered a question from Deputy Harney, whom I congratulate on being able to get an answer from the Taoiseach.  All our questions on Northern Ireland today were ruled out, with the exception of one asking the Taoiseach what further progress, if any, he had made towards completing the <Col N="1331" /> framework document, which he answered. Nineteen questions in my name have already been referred to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  We can ask the Taoiseach questions on Northern Ireland only once a month, and the General Office has written to me today to the effect that as I have now tabled more than two questions for oral answer by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, I should contact the office. That means that of my 19 questions, which will probably have increased to 39 by next week, I can have answers to only two.  Either the Taoiseach is not instructing his people or he is being very unreasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>Basically, questions about negotiations being conducted primarily by the Department of Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Government, such as negotiations about the framework document, are appropriately answered by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  Questions about meetings that I have as Taoiseach and questions in that area are appropriately answered by me. On assuming office I discovered that there is a well established criterion as to which questions are referred to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and which are retained in the Department of the Taoiseach.  The criterion I am following is exactly that followed by my predecessor. There has been no change.  If Opposition Deputies, and particularly party leaders, would like to be briefed <Col N="1332" /> on how precisely this criterion operates, I would be happy to do so.  In Opposition I sought such briefing from the then Taoiseach's Department which was not forthcoming.  However, I am more than willing to offer it to Deputies Ahern and Harney so that they will have all the necessary knowledge of the precedents set when their own parties were in office to frame their questions appropriately and get appropriate answers.</P>

      <P>If the Taoiseach says he is trying to be helpful, I accept that. Deputy Reynolds, when he was Taoiseach took all questions on Northern Ireland.  Somebody in the Taoiseach's office &mdash; I do not believe it is the Taoiseach &mdash; is referring all questions on Northern Ireland to the Tánaiste. Already today the Taoiseach answered a question we tabled.  Earlier he said that when he meets Prime Minister John Major he would be primarily discussing these issues.  However, that is a contradiction. If the Taoiseach is discussing these issues with Prime Minister John Major, he should answer questions about them in this House.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that the SDLP has not been shown the framework document or briefed in detail on it, as Unionists allege?</P>

Will the Taoiseach brief Opposition leaders on what is going on in relation to Northern Ireland?  The positions adopted by parties in this House, in Government and Opposition, are reasonable and fair &mdash; everybody wants to be helpful.

      <P>Minister of State Seán Barrett has special responsibility as Government Chief Whip and for the implementation of the Government's programme of Oireachtas reform.  In addition, he has responsibility for the Central Statistics Office.  He is also Minister of State at the Department of Defence.</P>
      <P>Minister of State Gay Mitchell has special responsibility at both my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs for European Affairs generally and for the preparation for the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference. He also has special responsibility at my Department for the Irish Financial Services Centre and Local Development initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Minister of State Avril Doyle has special responsibility for Consumers of <Col N="1334" /> Public Services at my Department and at the Departments of Finance and Transport, Energy and Communications. Her brief is to develop and implement a package of measures designed to make public organisations more transparent and efficient, and crucially more responsive to the needs of the public.  She will also chair the inter-departmental committee to co-ordinate the commemoration of the Irish Famine.</P>
    <P>Minister of State Donal Carey has special responsibility at my Department for co-ordinating the Government's commitment to western development and rural renewal and for the development and improvement of living conditions on our offshore islands.  Minister of State Carey also has special responsibility for the Gaeltacht at the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not wonder the building is sagging.  Why have all questions addressed to the Minister of State for western development and rural renewal been transferred to the Minister for Finance?  Does the Minister of State have any ministerial responsibility? In the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> of 4 February Deputy Carey is described as the Minister with a long title for a man with no budget and no schemes to administer.  Will the Taoiseach tell us if we can put questions on western matters to the Minister of State as today some of the questions were transferred to the Minister for Finance, others to the Minister for the Environment, etc?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If there had not been quite so much circumlocution in the supplementary questions from the Opposition we might have reached the question that Deputy Carey, the Minister of State, will be answering today or tomorrow on the matter.  He does have responsibilities in my Department for which he will answer in this House.  The responsibilities of Deputy Carey and Doyle as Ministers of State are not confined to, or primarily involved with, the <Col N="1335" /> administration of any schemes.  The problem we face in our public administration is that, on the one hand, individual Departments pursuing their own agendas frequently ignore the impact of those policies on rural areas and the contribution that those policies make to rural depopulation and depopulation, particularly in the west.  Deputy Carey's political role in the Department of the Taoiseach, the most senior Department of State will be to influence change in policy, practice and public administration in all Departments to remove the in-built bias that currently exists in many policies pursued by State agencies and Government Departments which is antipathetic to the interests of rural areas.  It is a trans-departmental role.</P>
      <P>A similar trans-departmental role is envisaged for Deputy Doyle, Minister of State in the Taoiseach's office who will be responsible for providing a charter of rights for consumers of public services so that people who deal with State services, which as a general rule are monopoly services, will have such a charter.  She will be responsible for ensuring that such charters of rights are put in place and subsequently acted on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>My announcement in regard to the provision of relationships and sexuality education followed an extensive report on the matter by an expert advisory group, set up by me in April 1994 to advise on how relationships and sexuality education might be introduced into schools.  The group, established by me following the announcement in 1994, sought and received over 50 submissions from interested bodies and individuals, which were taken into account in the group's work.</P>
      <P>The report of the expert advisory group was referred to the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment for its views.  The NCCA is representative of all the partners in education.  The NCCA considered the report between June and December 1994.  Following consideration of the report and of the response of the NCCA, my Department has issued the report, and Circular number 2/95 (primary schools) and M4/95 (post-primary schools), to all schools.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that there is broad agreement in Irish society on the need for a programme of relationships and sexuality education in the formal education system.  Support for such a programme has been articulated by Church bodies, educational groups, teacher unions and national parents' representative bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also point out that many schools are already making good provision for relationships and sexuality education and for the wider aspects of social personal and health education, <Col N="1338" /> and many teachers are experienced in teaching these programmes.</P>
    <P>I am now requesting schools to begin the process of developing their policies so that they may include relationships and sexuality education and wider aspects of social, personal and health education in their curricula in the school year 1995-96.  I have asked the NCCA to prepare curriculum guidelines and teaching-learning strategies which will assist schools in this work by Easter 1995.  My Department will continue to provide leadership, support and guidance by outlining the overall direction of relationships and sexuality education and by facilitating and supporting the involvement of the partners in education in planning for implementation.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that, with the co-operation of school authorities, teachers and parents, all children and young people will have access to good-quality programmes in relationships and sexuality education.</P>

Would it not have been preferable also for the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment to have completed its work in this regard in advance of the public announcement &mdash; in other words that the schools would have the programme and would then be in a position to develop a policy on the provision of such a programme particularly as the boards of management would have preferred to be in a position to advise parents on the provisions of such a programme at the time of enrolment of first year students.</P>

      <P>I made the announcement, arrangements were put in place to circulate the two circulars mentioned and I am not aware that there has been an inordinate delay.  The announcement was made at the beginning of last week.</P>
      <P>The Deputy made suggestions on the development of the programme, guidelines and the manner of advising parents about it but this has been in the public domain for nearly 12 months.  The subject matter of the programme which it is proposed to implement was considered by other administrations and has been the subject of debate for ten years. Despite support from church bodies, parents and teachers' unions we are only now in a position to involve all concerned in the guidelines devised by the advisory group and to put the sexuality and relationships programme on the timetable for September 1995.  I am apprehensive that repeated attempts to slow down the process in which the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, a large body representative of every interest in education, has been involved both on a consultative basis and in the preparation of material, will result in the good practice and good experience available in a number of schools not being made available to the wider body of school children.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not conscious of anyone asking the Minister to slow down implementation of the programme, rather I am conveying to her the fact that many school principals have voiced their concern that they did not receive the circular for up to ten days after the public announcement. Surely the Minister would accept that <Col N="1340" /> the successful implementation of such an important programme depends primarily on the teaching staff, parents and their involvement in schools.  There is genuine concern and confusion.  Is it the intention to make the programme mandatory in all schools?  Will it be implemented by way of ministerial directive or will there be flexibility for local boards of management to devise programmes and implement them?</P>

      <P>The Department of Education sees itself in a leadership role.  I am asking all concerned to spend this term and next term in consultation at school level and to examine guidelines and programmes.  The normal way for the Department to express its wishes to schools is through issuing circulars. The Department has issued a circular to all schools stating that it wishes the subject of sexuality and relationships to be included in the school timetable.  At second level we will recognise the teaching hours for salary purposes in order to ensure that the subject is timetabled.  I accept that some schools did not receive the circular for ten days after the announcement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The first stage in that is the appointment of someone within the school to co-ordinate the discussion and consultation process.  It is our intention that it will be dealt with in all schools.  I hope the Deputy read the guidelines.  It is evident from the circular, guidelines and expert report issued by the Department that schools are doing this mindful of the ethos of their own school.  We were able to record practically a universal welcome for the programme among the partners in education.</P>

      <P>I should first explain the status of the report referred to by the Deputy.  In December 1993 I requested the Higher Education Authority to establish a steering committee to advise me on a broad range of issues, including those now raised by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The interim report to which the Deputy refers is a report to the steering committee from a technical working group.  The steering committee has yet to draw up its own conclusions and make recommendations to me.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the details of the interim report before the steering committee has had an opportunity to complete its own work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made it clear in my press release at the time of publication of the report that I looked forward to receiving the <Col N="1342" /> conclusions and recommendations of the steering group.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on a submission made to a committee which I established to provide me with advice.</P>
    <P>With regard to my plans for the third level sector, I am pleased to say that I have already put in place a £120 million capital programme, aided by the EU as well as a broad range of further developments wholly funded by the Exchequer.  The provision of further capital investment in the higher education sector will be considered in the normal way in the context of the annual Estimates for my Department.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of interventions at first and second level to counteract underachievement and early school leaving, the Deputy will be aware that I am consistently developing and implementing policies in those areas.  I agree with the Deputy that the achievement of equality in higher education requires significant intervention at first and second level to counter underachievement and early school leaving.</P>
    <P>At first level these include: the development of pre-school provision; targeting of resources on disadvantaged areas; the provision of educational support services for students e.g. psychological, remedial teachers etc. and the continuing development of the home-school liaison service.</P>
    <P>Initiatives taken at second level include: a major restructuring of the senior cycle curricula to adapt it to the needs of the wider spread of ability levels and backgrounds proceeding to senior cycle; The provision of programmes such as Youthreach, a programme to help break the cycle of educational disadvantage to cater for the needs of children who leave school early or are at highest risk of leaving early; the introduction of the school cert for pupils who have difficulty in coping with junior cert; the provision of educational support services for students e.g. psychological and guidance services, career guidance teachers and remedial; the continuing development of the <Col N="1343" /> home-school liaison service, and continuing financial support for special initiatives operated by a number of third level institutions which involve linkages with post-primary schools in order to provide greater opportunities for students from the disadvantaged areas concerned to enter college.</P>
    <P>I await with interest the final recommendations of the steering committee regarding disadvantage.  As is evident, I am committed to progressively increasing retention at second level and to taking appropriate initiatives to support transfer to third level.</P>

      <P>Given that the Minister has agreed it is important to intervene in the early stages, will she guarantee the House that after the abolition of third level fees she will have the necessary resources to ensure such intervention at pre-school and primary levels? Why go to the bother of having reports such as this one and commissioning studies when the Minister makes decisions in advance of them regarding third level institutions and their placement, for example, Dún Laoghaire, and ignores the thrust of many of these documents such as the de Buitléir report and this one?</P>

However, Governments put emphasis on different aspects of their programmes. That work is continuing, but it cannot prevent a new Government from having an agreed manifesto.  I am sure the Deputy will recognise that the commitment given by the previous Government, and certainly by me as Minister for Education, is to ensure that we invest to break the cycle of disadvantage as early as at first-level.

      <Quest>her views on the recommendations of the advisory committee on third level student support, particularly those recommendations relating to means and equity of access to education.</Quest>

      <P>I welcome the report of the advisory committee which reflects the expertise and commitment that the members brought to their task. The report contains significant recommendations aimed at improving the equity and fairness of the student support arrangements and the quality of service to students.  The report highlights a lack of public confidence in the present system, particularly in relation to the operation of the means test.</P>
      <P>It has elicited a widespread response from various interest groups particularly in relation to the most appropriate arrangements for the assessment of means.  I am anxious to take careful note of the debate which the publication of the report has generated before reaching conclusions on the more contentious proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the commitment in the Government of Renewal Policy Agreement, and taking account of the recommendations of the advisory committee, I will be pursuing the reform of the higher education grants scheme as <Col N="1345" /> resources permit.  My objective will be to ensure that available resources are used to benefit students in most need and that the quality of service to students will be of the highest attainable standard.</P>
    <P>The perceived inequities and anomalies in the third-level student support means-testing arrangements have led to considerable debate in recent times.  As part of my continuous review of the schemes, I will give particular attention to the procedures for means assessment in order to ensure that they serve, and are seen to serve, most effectively the objective of ensuring that available resources benefit students in greatest need.  In this regard I will take particular account of the public reaction to the committee's recommendations.</P>
    <P>I have already implemented a number of recommendations for improvements made by the advisory committee in its report.  These include&mdash;the abolition of the separate academic attainments for eligibility for a grant; this will ensure that all students who have secured a college place will now qualify for a grant subject to their satisfying the means test; the introduction of new rules for second chance cases; the provision of a discretionary budget to institutions from 1994 to set up a hardship fund; the provision of financial support to assist students with physical disabilities and the simplification and earlier issue of the student support schemes to facilitate students with their grant applications.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister read my question somewhat more closely.  I asked for her views on the recommendations of the advisory committee on third-level student support.  I did not ask what would be her conclusions, once she had listened to everybody else or had ascertained the way in which public opinion was veering.  It is very important that we ascertain the Minister's views in view of the conclusions reached in the de Buitleír report.  It is not good enough for her to waffle through her reply, as she has done, she should be prepared to give her views now.</P>

      <P>I listed for the Deputy some of the recommendations of the advisory committee that have already been put in place.  I take the point that the Deputy asked for my views but I would point out that the advisory committee was established to come up with recommendations which have only just been released into the public arena.  Before I form my views, those recommendations must be discussed with my Cabinet colleagues.  My views will be better founded having ascertained the opinions of those interested in responding to the committee's recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 14 and 126 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Post-leaving certificate courses, which are provided in schools and colleges outside the third-level sector, have constituted one of the significant growth areas in education in recent years.  I am committed to supporting the development of this sector in a number of important respects.  First, I intend to establish the National Education and Training Certification Board to provide <Col N="1348" /> a comprehensive framework of certification for all vocational education and training programmes, including post-leaving certificate programmes.  This will build on the work already under way by the National Council for Vocational Awards, which has already started to provide national certification for a range of PLC programmes. Second, I am actively considering, in the context of the proposal for the abolition of tuition fees for third-level students, the abolition of all fees for PLC courses where they exist.  Third, my Department is examining the most appropriate structural arrangements to provide for the ordered and co-ordinated development of post leaving certificate courses in the future.  Subject to Government approval, I will be outlining these arrangements in the forthcoming White Paper on Education.</P>
    <P>These initiatives demonstrate my strong commitment to support the structured development of post-leaving certificate courses for the future.  As these changes are progressively implemented, I will keep under continuous review the question of the provision of maintenance grants to students on these courses. However, my priority at present is to address the issues I have set out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from the Minister's reply that the Government will not provide maintenance grants for PLC students in the coming year?  Given the Minister's reply it appears that following the budget it will be cheaper for some students to go to university than to attend a PLC course.  An article this morning by Christina Murphy states that following the budget there will be the potential for a student in a family with an income of, say, £16,000 to qualify for a maintenance grant to go to Trinity, but a student in a family with an income of £8,000 will not get a maintenance grant to attend Ballyfermot senior college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have outlined my priorities in this area which I have expanded at a tremendous pace.  This <Col N="1349" /> area has been considered as part of the second level provision and it has developed into post leaving certificate courses.  There is an urgency to ensure we adopt a structured approach as to how these courses develop and their availability is a matter of great concern to me.  It is important that students attend post-leaving certificate courses which have a proper certification framework. I am pleased that I will be bringing forward legislation on the establishment of the National Education and Training Certification Board.  In order to move forward to deal with the priorities. I must order and co-ordinate this rapidly growing sector in which there are 17,500 students and ensure that what we put in place in the post-leaving certificate area is structured.  I cannot make presumptions on what announcements will be made by the Minister for Finance in the budget tomorrow, but there is a commitment in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to restructure the students' support framework which includes the abolition of fees for post-leaving certificate courses.  That was the subject of a debate last week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give a simple one line answer to my question? Can she confirm that the Government will not be providing maintenance grants for PLC students this year?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on whether PLC <Col N="1350" /> students will be entitled to a maintenance grant.  We and the 17,500 PLC students are entitled to a straight answer to that question.  Despite the Minister's protestations that she does not wish to make presumptions about tomorrow's budget we all know what will happen or have a fair idea about what will be announced by the Minister tomorrow because it has been telegraphed.  The Minister should be straight and let us know whether PLC students will receive maintenance grants.  She should stop the con job and insulting PLC students by talking about abolishing fees.  Maintenance, not fees is an issue with PLC students.  Many PLC students are not charged fees&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There is a commitment in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to restructure third level student support schemes.  I made the point in my reply that post-leaving certificate course students are still considered as part of the second level provision.  The Deputy is anticipating a debate that has not taken place.  I spelt out my priorities in the area and I cannot anticipate what the Minister for Finance may say regarding this.  I outlined my priorities and there is a specific commitment in the Government programme to restructure third level education and the development and availability of post-leaving certificate courses.  While the abolition of fees may not be an issue in the Cork area represented by the Deputy, from the available figures, it appears to be a bigger issue than the Deputy believes it to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the policy enunciated by the Minister could create an injustice and a major inequity for PLC students and colleges, does she consider that as many of the students attending PLC courses come from the lower socio-economic group that it should be a priority concern?  As a Labour Minister in Government, does the Minister not consider that priority should be given to providing assistance for such students by way of maintenance grants?  Deputy Martin has said that many schools providing those courses do not charge fees.  Given the social inequity that will arise following the adoption of the Minister's policy, in the interests of those students will she consider redirecting resources towards alleviating the major hardship experienced by many of the families of PLC students?</P>

      <P>Up to September 1988 when a member of the Opposition was Minister for Education, an ESF funded maintenance allowance was in place.  At that time a decision was taken to encourage students to attend post-leaving certificate courses locally. Despite the fact that the maintenance allowance was withdrawn by one of my predecessors, the number participating in the PLC courses was not affected.  In my reply I referred to the framework from which PLC courses would be developed.  I find it amazing that students travel from one county to another to take up a place on a PLC course when such a course is available locally.</P>

That will be included in the White Paper because as this is a new and rapidly developing area it must be developed in a coherent manner that responds to students' needs.  It is a fairly new departure and one which would benefit from having a framework in place similar to that from which we decide the number of places and needs of third level students.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 134 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the school mentioned by the Deputy has applied for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  The case made by the school will be taken into account in the context of measures which I propose to take in the current year to address the needs of pupils in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>The Government's programme of renewal contains a range of commitments which have the specific aim of improving access to educational services for pupils from disadvantaged areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures proposed include a commitment to significant reductions in class sizes in primary schools, with special emphasis on areas of disadvantage, increasing capitation grants for primary schools with a special emphasis on schools which include pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, and adequate <Col N="1354" /> provision for the establishment and maintenance of school book loan schemes.</P>
    <P>In my statement on the 1995 Estimates, I indicated that it is proposed to retain some 340 teaching posts in the primary system which would otherwise have been lost because of falling enrolments. The availability of these posts will allow me to further address the needs of disadvantaged pupils in primary schools.</P>
    <P>I also confirmed that the allocation to the disadvantaged areas fund is being increased by almost £1.3 million or 61 per cent in 1995.  This increase follows a 40 per cent increase in 1994 and will enable me to target significant extra funding on disadvantaged pupils.  In addition, I indicated that the book scheme provision at primary level has been increased by 26 per cent.  This increase follows a 15 per cent increase in 1994.</P>
    <P>The increased allocations to which I referred represent a substantial input of targeted resources aimed at addressing the needs of pupils from disadvantaged areas and will enable me to build on the significant progress achieved in this area in recent years.</P>
    <P>I am close to finalising my thinking on the development of these resources.  I expect to make an announcement on the matter very shortly.</P>

    <P>I propose to reduce the pupil/teacher ratio for primary schools from 23.4:1 in <Col N="1355" /> September 1994 to 22.9:1 in September 1995.

      <P>It is difficult to ask a question on this matter because the Minister is playing for time.  That being said, does she realise that hundreds of children with disability will be accepted into the mainstream school system, but will need the backup of the visiting support teachers?  However, as some children will not be supported by that system they will not be accepted into the mainstream system.  Unless schools know such a teacher will be made available to them some children with disabilities will be excluded from mainstream education. The parents of such children want to have a choice in the matter.</P>

      <P>The programme of renewal attaches priority to &ldquo;Granting special consideration to the needs of schools enrolling children with handicaps or severe learning difficulties&rdquo;.  The Deputy referred to the appointment of visiting support teachers to help children with disabilities.  I presume she is referring to the visiting teacher service to which 37 teachers have already been appointed.  Their role is to support the staff of schools, but their remit extends only to children with visual or hearing impairment or Down's Syndrome.  The Department has recently put in place a system called &ldquo;the resource teacher&rdquo; and, unlike the visiting teacher who is not attached to a specific school and visits schools on an infrequent basis, the resource teacher is attached to a specific <Col N="1356" /> school or group of schools and is, therefore, in a position to provide a more intensive level of service to the pupils involved.  Given the commitment in the Government's programme and the fact that the visiting teacher service has been so successful we are prepared to move forward in this regard.  In the near future I hope to announce a development of that service so that we are able to meet the commitment involved.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that a serious position prevails in primary schools regarding children with various disabilities, that considerable numbers of such children are falling out of the primary school system and not attending school on a regular basis? Does she agree, therefore, that the response from her Department should be far more thorough, that it should identify such children and provide the additional resources required?  While I welcome the additional resources to which she referred, will she agree that her response to date on this issue is inadequate to deal with an emerging serious position particularly, but not always, in disadvantaged areas?  Will the Minister examine the question of extending the school psychological programme which her predecessor put in place on a pilot basis?</P>

      <P>We have appointed 37 visiting teachers and 26 resource teachers, 13 of whom were recently appointed.  There has, therefore, been a response to the growing demand in this area.  The position that obtained in the past has changed somewhat, there is now a growing demand for services to be delivered in a local environment.  The Government has given a commitment in its programme which acknowledges the growing demand.  I am pleased to tell the Deputy that the Department has appointed ten additional psychologists who will be placed in the educational service.  The success of the pilot scheme has not only been welcomed but <Col N="1357" /> acknowledged in a recent announcement I made regarding the extension of the psychological service.</P>

      <P>Now that the Department has agreed to provide computers for children with physical disability to assist in their education, have the various facets of our curriculum been placed on disk so that those children can fully avail of the equipment provided?  If not, when will that information be put on disk?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should discuss that question with the Deputy at a later stage.  In saying that the Department has agreed to provide computers for children with disability to assist in their educational needs, the Department has not agreed to provide all such children with that facility.  It will assess the needs of individual children and respond accordingly.</P>
      <P>I hesitate to answer the question relating to placing information on disk without having further discussion with the Deputy.  UCD operates a very good system for translating textbooks into Braille, but it is laborious because it has difficulty getting the copyright of the textbooks to allow them to be put through a machine.  While technology may be far advanced there are still difficulties. I am only aware, because I have visited UCD, that the difficulties associated with what they are doing has much to do with the fact that publishers seem reluctant to make their material available on disk.  On this matter I would probably benefit from a discussion with the Deputy outside this House as I do not have the information with me.</P>

      <Quest>the changes, if any, she intends to make in the administration of third-level grants for 1995; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2607/95]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the <Col N="1358" /> advisory committee on third level student support was published on 25 January 1995.  Prior to publication and following the recommendations in the report the following improvements in the administration of student support were announced and implemented in 1994: the requirement of separate academic attainments for the award of a third level grant was abolished; applicants who have secured a place on an approved third level course are now deemed to have automatically satisfied the academic requirements; new rules have been introduced for second-chance cases; for the first time students who dropped out of college can qualify for a grant to study at the same level as they studied previously after an interval of five years; the provision of a special budget to assist students at college who are encountering financial hardship; and the issue of the student support schemes at the end of April 1994 which was months earlier than the date they were issued in previous years.</P>
      <P>The changes considerably improved the service to students and their families. Prior also to the publication of the report decisions in principle to implement the following recommendations were announced in 1994: the processing of grant application and payment by the Central Application Office; transfer of the means test to the Revenue Commissioners; and transfer of the appeals function from the Minister for Education to the Appeals Commissioner under tax law.</P>
      <P>These administrative changes which have been agreed in principle are complex and far-reaching and a considerable amount of detailed planning work is required.  I have decided not to proceed with their implementation for 1995-96.  The higher education grants schemes, the vocational education committee scholarships schemes and the ESF grants scheme will therefore issue this year, as they did last year, by the end of April and the existing organisational arrangement for processing and paying grants in 1995 will therefore remain the same as in previous years.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="1359" /> I will be giving further consideration to the other recommendations in the report of the advisory committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deeply disappointed that the system for the processing and payment of grants will remain the same for 1995 as in previous years.  Will the Minister accept that one of the key shortcomings in the system is the delay in making payments?  Is she aware of the extreme hardship visited on grant aided students who are forced to commence college year after year without their grant moneys being paid in advance?  In many cases the grant moneys are not made available until well into and sometimes close to the end of the first term in college.  As a result students or their parents are forced to go to credit unions and banks to borrow money to enable them to buy text books and essential equipment to enable students to start college.  Is there any good reason students should not know in advance of their leaving certificate results whether they are eligible for grants?  It is a huge problem for grant aided students.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  A decision in principle has been taken to process grant applications and payment by the Central Applications Office.  There is much planning involved in this.  The committee heard submissions from interested parties including the vocational education committee and the local council who deal mainly with the grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked to issue the scheme early to facilitate decision making.  While the scheme was delivered in April rather than July or August, as in previous <Col N="1360" /> years, I do not have the evidence to hand to suggest that the plight of individual students improved as a consequence. The de Buitléir report recommended a much earlier announcement. This area involves people with many different interests and we have to ensure that what we put in place is something to which students will have easy access.  We envisage that applications for places and for grants could be made around the same time.  I have to be careful that in centralising the processing of grant and payment applications I am putting in place a system to which students will have easy access.</P>
    <P>Because this is a complex area and a considerable amount of work remains to be done, the existing schemes will issue by the end of April, as in previous years, and we will continue to plan to implement three administrative proposals which were agreed in principle: central processing, transfer of the means test to the Revenue Commissioners and transfer of the appeals function from the Minister for Education to the Appeal Commissioners under tax law.  Those recommendations have been agreed in principle but have to be formulated for easy delivery.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was one issue to which I expected the Minister would address herself this year, it was the issue of making payments on time so that grant aided students would have their grant money in advance of the commencement of the college term.  The Minister in her reply has talked about other interests and interests she has to take into account.  I respectfully suggest to the Minister that the interest of the students and their parents and the means of the students and parents will have to take primacy over every other interest.  Will she acknowledge that there is no good reason the system cannot be changed to a centralised system which would enable the grant moneys &mdash; taxpayer's money, voted by taxpayers to help students who cannot afford to pay their own college fees &mdash; to be paid to students on time to enable them to <Col N="1361" /> make a good start in their college career?  It is disgraceful that the Minister has not addressed herself to progressing that change&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>My primary concern is for the student.  I have to be assured that a centralised system for the processing of grant applications and payment will facilitate students and parents. I am very conscious of my responsibility in that area.  This is a complex issue and rather than create uncertainty about this year's schemes I would prefer if they operated as previously and to address the issue of centralising the processing of grant applications and payment so that we have a system that responds to students' needs.  That cannot be achieved this year unless we push the grants scheme back to August.  The small step I took last year by bringing the scheme forward to April benefited students but I do not have the evidence to confirm that.</P>
      <P>Last year's position remains, but that does not suggest the work in responding to the administrative recommendations in the report stops.  The work will continue and students do not have to worry.  I have responsibility to ensure the recommendations on the administration side will be implemented and the measures put in place to benefit the student.</P>

Will the Minister set a final date for the provision of these facilities to all primary school children?</P>

      <P>We have identified 167 schools which would not be dealt with under the general programme and which would not be closed due to falling numbers or amalgamation.  The boards of management of schools were invited to apply for assistance.  A total of 202 applications were received, 17 schools indicated that they were not seeking grant aid and 48 schools did not apply. Ninety-one projects have been sanctioned at a cost of £0.5 million.  In most cases the Department is awaiting the preparation of specifications and estimates from the Office of Public Works.</P>

    <P>Last year I made a specific attempt to inform schools that the day of the outdoor toilet was gone.  All schools built in the past 20 years have indoor toilet facilities.  Last year we identified schools and invited them to apply for grant aid. Grants totalling more than £0.5 million have been sanctioned.  Last year the <Col N="1368" /> Department carried out a survey of the condition and size of school buildings and one of the questions related to this area.  We are ready to input that information to the Department's computer system, after which I should be able to ascertain if schools have escaped this net.  I hope that all schools in need will have been identified by the end of the year and that work on indoor toilet facilities will be completed in most cases.  However, some schools may still have to be identified.  I think the information required is at my disposal in the Department.  We are talking about approximately 265 schools.</P>

      <P>I cannot believe the Minister could say she did not know the number of schools affected.  She then went on to say that she initiated a survey last year.  Will it take her years to accomplish everything that has to be done?  The same difficulty arose with the de Buitléir report.  How can the Minister say that satisfactory progress is being made when she does not know the starting point?</P>

      <P>A survey was carried out in 1991 and that information is available to me.  Last year a survey was carried out of the complete itinerary of school buildings and this will specifically identify those schools which did not avail of grants for general refurbishment. Before I initiated the scheme last year we did not differentiate between the installation of indoor toilets and the refurbishment of schools. This problem came to my attention at a local level when I discovered that a school in Sallynoggin which I would have considered to be fairly modern still had outdoor toilet facilities.  This school did not apply for a grant for refurbishment. People should not have to leave a school building, regardless of the weather, to use sanitary facilities.  Last year we identified 267 schools with outdoor toilet facilities and most of these are being dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the existing scheme boards of management have to apply for funding <Col N="1369" /> and I would be somewhat concerned that a small number of them do not apply to the Department for grant aid. Aid is available to these schools and I will be satisfied when all the schools we have identified and the few which may come to our attention this year have adequate sanitation facilities, which means indoor toilets and not outdoor toilets in the school yard.</P>

Is 100 per cent grant aid given for such facilities?  If not, is there a danger that some schools, particularly those in poorer areas, will be unable to provide matching resources?  This may be one of the reasons some schools have not been in a position to provide proper indoor sanitation facilities.</P>

The boards of management were invited by the Department to apply for normal grant assistance which amounts to 85-90 per cent of the cost.  A total of 202 applications were received, 17 schools indicated they were not seeking grant aid for improvement works and 48 schools did not apply.  I will be able to ascertain the condition of the schools which did not apply when the results of the 26 county survey are inputted to the Department's computer system.  We are talking about a very small number of <Col N="1370" /> schools, but nevertheless we expect proper facilities for pupils.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I pay tribute to the memory of the late Deputy Des Foley. When most of us heard the news of his death as a result of a heart attack at the age of 54, someone who had been throughout his life an outstanding sportsman, who had kept himself in good physical condition and who was in every sense a man of good health, it reminded us of our mortality.  On behalf of the Government and my party, I convey to his wife, Rita, his family and all those in north County Dublin who will <Col N="1523" /> miss him so much our deepest sympathy.</P>
      <P>Des Foley was both a fine sportsman and politician.  As a sportsman and member of St. Vincent's, he captained the Dublin team which won the All-Ireland in 1963 and was a member of the last Dublin team to reach an All-Ireland hurling final in 1961.  On St. Patrick's Day 1962 he won Railway Cup medals in both football and hurling.  I do not believe any other player has achieved such a feat.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that if Des Foley got a great deal out of Gaelic games, in his latter years he put an even greater amount back into the games.  His commitment and support for clubs in his native area right up until the end of his life are well known.  He and his brother, Lar, were constant in their work to promote the games among young people in their area.</P>
      <P>He was also a fine politician.  It is worth recalling that he took a stand on principle and lost his party's whip because he stood for his beliefs.  This is not an easy thing to do and certainly it does not assist anyone in their political career but he believed sufficiently sincerely in the issues on which he took a stand at that time and paid a large political price.  He served as Fianna Fáil Deputy between 1965-71 and sought reelection in 1973.</P>
      <P>I ask Members of the House to remember him in their prayers and convey on behalf of Fine Gael and the Government our deepest sympathy to the Fianna Fáil Party on the loss of a loyal member and all his family and friends for the void that has now opened up in their lives.</P>

      <P>I join with the Taoiseach in paying tribute to a great sportsman, an excellent Fianna Fáil Member of this House and outstanding gentleman, the late Des Foley who died so tragically on Sunday night.  On my own behalf and that of the Fianna Fáil Party I extend our deepest sympathy to his desolate wife, Rita, and all his family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1524" /> His sudden death came as a great shock to all who knew and admired him. There were many reasons for admiring Des Foley.  He was a tremendous character, quiet in his own way but extremely tough and physical in other ways.  Whenever he donned the number 8 shirt for his county in either hurling or football he was somebody to be feared but who still had tremendous respect from all of those sporting opponents whom he came up against in his long playing career.  Like all great sports people, he made it look easy.  He had a natural style as a player and whenever he got into difficulty he had the great benefit of having his brother Lar on the same pitch.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach has stated, St. Patrick's Day in 1962 was his great day when he played in both of the Railway Cup finals and was on the victorious Leinster side on both.  Those of us from this county remember him best in September 1963 when Alf Ó Muirí presented him with the Sam Maguire Cup.  That was a tremendous day for him.  Des was a lifetime member of St. Vincent's Football and Hurling Club. The club was very proud of Des and he was very proud of it.  In 1959 he won the coveted Hogan Cup medal, which is a rare feat by a person from Dublin.  Playing with St. Joseph's Fairview he was a member of the All Ireland Colleges winning team, having starred as a Dublin minor the previous year, 1958.  As the Taoiseach stated, Des served in so many ranks in local years.  He was a selector in both hurling and football and he was a mentor to the young St. Vincent's stars of later years.  He will long be remembered in that part of Dublin for all he achieved on their behalf.</P>
    <P>It seemed only right and proper that Des Foley became a Teachta Dála representing his constituency of North County Dublin.  He was elected in 1965 and he served with great distinction.  He will be remembered fondly by all his constituents and party colleagues and, in particular, by the people of Fingal whom he was very proud of and for whom he had an abiding affection. <Col N="1525" /> Being a man of the soil, he gave Fianna Fáil his own particular insights into the difficulties and the opportunities of the farming community and those engaged in horticulture.  He continued to put forward his views on agriculture and horticulture, in particular, up to the time of his death.</P>
    <P>The city and county of Dublin owe Des and his family a great debt of gratitude for the days of glory and honour he brought to its citizens.  It saddens us all that Des departed from our midst in such a sudden manner.  Both on and off the field he had a magic aura about him. He was special and we all knew it.  Ar dheis lámh Dé go raibh a anam.  Fear uasal go deo: ní dhéanfaidh a mhuintir dearmad air go brách na breithe.</P>

      <P>Like other colleagues in this House, I would like to join in the messages of sympathy on the untimely death of the late Des Foley.  As has been said, Des Foley left his mark on the playing fields in both traditions of hurling and football.  He made an enormous contribution in his playing days and later on in his coaching capacity.  He also held strong political views and made a contribution to the events of this House.  On behalf of the Parliamentary Labour Party I wish to express our sympathy to his wife, Rita, to his family and indeed to his wide circle of friends in St. Vincent's Football and Hurling Club, in Dublin hurling and football circles and the many people he represented on the north side of Dublin. He will be missed and mourned and his untimely death is a sad occasion.</P>

He entered this House at the very young age of 24 and he also left national politics at a relatively young age.  As the Taoiseach said, his untimely death is a reminder to us all of where our destiny ultimately lies.  We can realise how <Col N="1526" /> young he was when we consider that some weeks ago we expressed sympathy to the family of the late Phil Brady who was nearly 50 years older than Des Foley.  That puts into context just how young he was.  His death was indeed untimely.  He was a great sportsman, obviously very fit, and I know his death comes as a great shock to his family and to his many friends, some of whom I spoke to earlier today in this House.  I wish to join with other speakers in extending my sympathy.</P>

      <P>I wish to join with the Taoiseach, my party Leader and others who have spoken in paying tribute to the late Des Foley.  His untimely death has been a source of great sadness to us all in Fingal since word reached us on Sunday night.  Des was very much a farmily man and I particularly join in the expressions of sympathy to Rita and the children.  He was more than just a family man to his wife and children; he was a family man to the extended Foley clan. He was, in many ways, the leader of the clan and he was the one to whom the whole family looked for guidance and advice.  He will be sadly missed by the whole family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have known Des Foley since we were both young men.  He entered public life in the general election of 1965. He came into this House as a sportsman but it did not take him long to learn the <Col N="1527" /> trade of politics.  He had strong beliefs and was not afraid to stand for them at all times but he was also a great constituency worker.  He worked for the people of Fingal, irrespective of class or creed.  His love of the soil was referred to by Deputy Ahern.  He had a special interest in matters agricultural, both in his job and his way of life but also in trying to improve the lot of those he served in Leinster House.  He continued that interest having left this House. Tribute has been paid to his belief in and love of all things Irish in relation to the sports field but it carried much further than that, right through all Irish culture and the Irish language.  He will be a great loss to the people of North County Dublin and to the Fianna Fáil organisation in Fingal in which he played such an active part.  He is a great loss to me personally as a friend.  May the Lord have mercy on his soul.</P>

As a TD and a sportsman, Des made a major impact on the lives of ordinary people, both young and old, in Dublin, and particularly in Fingal.  The shock and genuine sadness being expressed in the constituency, right across the political divide, is an indication of this.  Des will be a great loss to sports in North County Dublin.  He was a person whom young people looked up to.  He was an idol and, in many ways, he was a gentle giant.  May he rest in peace.</P>

He was always ultra courteous to me.  We had great time for each other and many conversations. Across the party divide there is a sense of loss for this man who has left his mark, in so many ways, on the Fingal <Col N="1528" /> area.  One could always pick Des out at gatherings, funerals and celebrations, in the Fingal area because he was tall and easily seen and could move among all parties and people in the area.

I did not know Des Foley well but such was his reputation and influence that for a long time I thought there was two Des Foleys, the sportsman and the politician. That is a reflection of the measure of the man, of what he achieved and was known for.  It was moving to see how hundreds of people at St. Brigid's GAA Club in the Castleknock area stood to remember a lost colleague and friend.

His politics were republican and he possessed the quality of loyalty whether to country, party or club.  His achievements on the sporting field have been well documented here.  He was loyal to his GAA club, St. Vincent's.  As a Dublin city councillor I worked with him when St. Vincent's moved to its new clubhouse in Marino.  He was also a first class clay pigeon shooter and, with his brother Lar, represented Ireland in many international competitions.  The shooting fraternity will also miss him a great deal.  Des Foley is a prime example for the young sporting enthusiasts of the city.  It should be noted that many young people in north Dublin refused to eat their vegetables unless they were Des Foley's vegetables: if one ate Des Foley's vegetables one would end up playing for the Dublin team.</P>

His principles and convictions were, perhaps, the cause of his ceasing to be a Member of this House after a short sojourn here. He was not only a strong character, tough on the sports field and in politics, a good representative of his constituency and a good worker, he was also a man of strong convictions, and those convictions, on the whole sorry saga of the Northern conflict that began in 1969, led to his departure at a very young age from the ranks of Fianna Fáil and from membership of this House. More is the pity that that should have happened because, without doubt he had an assured future as a Deputy representing his constituency in north Dublin. He would, no doubt, have achieved high office in this parliament in the intervening years.  To his wife, particularly to his children, all his friends and near family and the people of north Dublin I extend sympathy and join everyone in wishing him eternal rest.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach comment on the inspired leaks on the budget, which are presented as fact and not as speculation?  If the Taoiseach reads the Official Report, he will see that he had no reason to raise this matter last year as the one small item leaked eventually turned out to be half right and half wrong.  This year journalists and others are making absolute statements saying they were told about it either at meetings or by Ministers of State, programme managers, advisers and so on and they seem to be correct. The Taoiseach is probably one of the Members most committed to high standards and he has argued for this on many issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby resolves, pursuant to sub-section 3º of section 3 of Article 28 of the Constitution, that the national emergency created by the armed conflict referred to in the Resolutions, pursuant to the said Article, of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann of 1st September, 1976, has ceased to exist.</P>
      <P>I would like to put the motion in its historical context.  This country has been under a state of emergency since 1939. The state of emergency was first initiated by the outbreak of the Second World War which became euphemistically known here as the &ldquo;Emergency&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1539" /> It is worth recalling, in this the 50th anniversary of the end of that war, a war which defeated the most appalling tyranny Europe has ever known, a total of 46 million people were killed in its six year duration.  Six million Poles were killed under the Nazi occupation, half of whom were Polish Jews.  Six million Jews altogether were killed, just because they were Jews.  Many sacrifices were made to end this tyranny.  Our nearest neighbour &mdash; Britain &mdash; lost more than a quarter of a million service men and women and an estimated 10,000 people from the island of Ireland made the ultimate sacrifice and were killed in action seeking to end that tyrannical regime.</P>
    <P>This puts our remaining troubles and disagreements in context.  It points to the need to build a single European economy with each part so inter-dependent on the other that war in Europe becomes impossible.</P>
    <P>The more immediate cause of the continuation of the state of emergency from 1976 to date was violence associated with the troubles in Northern Ireland.  In those troubles, over 3,000 people lost their lives.  We owe an incalculable debt to all those who helped bring that violence to an end.  Some have been publicly acknowledged. Others, by choice, remain anonymous. Yet others, who did not take part directly in the peace process, contributed by their silence, by their discretion or by their willingness to accept the good faith of people they would not normally have been inclined to trust.</P>
    <P>That is what the peace process now requires from all sides: from Sinn Féil right across to the British Government, from Unionists as well as Nationalists &mdash; a willingness to trust those one would normally not have been inclined to trust.</P>
    <P>The Government is asking both Houses of the Oireachtas, through this motion, to bring to an end the national emergency resolved by the Dáil and Seanad Éireann to have existed on 1 September, 1976. <Col N="1540" /> The declaration of a national emergency at that time, in accordance with Article 28 of the Constitution, was occasioned by the need to secure public safety, and to preserve the State against the background of the armed conflict then taking place in Northern Ireland. Events that summer, notably explosions at the Special Criminal Court, the murder of the British Ambassador Christopher Ewart-Biggs and Miss Judith Cooke, represented disturbing new developments which were seen by my predecessor, Liam Cosgrave, to present a direct challenge to the authority of the institutions of State and to their continued ability to discharge the functions entrusted to them under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The declaration of the national emergency on 1 September 1976 coincided with the ending by Dáil and Seanad Éireann of the national emergency which had been declared in 1939.  The ending of the national emergency now, in 1995, is not without significance and, hopefully, opens a new phase in our history when threats to our security, from whatever source, are a thing of the past.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House gives effect to the commitment contained in the Government Programme &mdash;<i>A Government of Renewal</i>&mdash; to expedite the lifting of the state of emergency with a view to consolidating the peace process. A decision to move such a motion was signalled by the former Government on 25 October last but had not been acted upon prior to the change of Government.</P>
    <P>The Government believes it is right to bring this motion before the House at this time.  It represents a further positive response to the new situation created by the complete cessation of all military operations by the Provisional IRA as and from 31 August 1994 and the decision of the combined loyalist military command on 13 October 1994 to universally cease all operational hostilities. Those developments represent a decisive change and a turning-point in the history of our island.</P>
    <P>The ending of the national emergency <Col N="1541" /> will signal our confidence in the developing peace process and our continuing determination to harness its opportunities for a just and lasting peace.  Moreover, declaring the end of that emergency will help underline the return to normality which the developments of recent times represent for so many people in both parts of the island.</P>
    <P>The ending of the national emergency will have more than symbolic meaning. It will have legal consequences as well. The Emergency Powers Act, 1976, enacted immediately following the declaration of the national emergency in 1976 will, in accordance with the provisions of section 3 of that Act, automatically expire on the passing of this resolution by both Houses.  Moreover, section 15 of the Criminal Law Act, 1976 &mdash; which empowers members of the Defence Forces to arrest and search in certain defined circumstances when acting in aid of the civil power &mdash; will also cease to have effect.  This is because that section had effect only as long as the Emergency Powers Act, 1976 was in force.</P>
    <P>The powers conferred on the security forces of this State by those legislative provisions are, of their nature, exceptional in our &mdash; or in any &mdash; legal system. This is evident from the fact that the extended period of detention for up to seven days, allowed by the Emergency Powers Act, was allowed to lapse in 1977, although the possibility of bringing it back was preserved at that time: that power has now gone.</P>
    <P>The motion has no direct implications for the continued operation of the Offences Against the State Acts, 19391985. That legislation is a separate matter and the issues which arise are quite distinct from those arising in connection with the ending of the national emergency. The Government nevertheless intends to review that legislation as well, in line with the commitment contained in its programme to review all legislation and court arrangements associated with the management of the conflict over the past 25 years.</P>
    <P>I want &mdash; as I am sure all Members <Col N="1542" /> of the House will want &mdash; to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the security forces of the State for their dedication and professionalism in safeguarding our security during a troubled and turbulent period in our history.  We owe the men and women of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces a great debt for their steadfast and tireless efforts on behalf of all our people.  We remember, at this time in particular, those members of the security forces who made the ultimate sacrifice and paid the ultimate sacrifice in defending the security of the State: Garda Dick Fallon, Inspector Samuel Donegan, Garda Michael Reynolds, Garda Michael Clerkin, Garda John Morley, Garda Henry Byrne, Garda James Quaid, Garda Patrick Reynolds, Sergeant Patrick McLoughlin, Garda Peter Garry Sheehan, Garda Francis Hand, Sergeant Patrick Morrissey, Chief Officer Brian Stack of the Prison Service and Private Kelly of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>In asking both House of the Oireachtas, through this motion, to bring to an end the national emergency, the Government is guided by the desire to consolidate and advance the peace process.  The ultimate requirement remains, of course, the achievement of an agreed political settlement that would secure the support and allegiance of both traditions on this island.  To that end, the Irish and British Governments are determined to complete as soon as possible our negotiations on the Joint Framework Document, as a basis for the process of dialogue involving the two Governments and the political parties in Northern Ireland.  That document will be of immense importance in terms of all our efforts to realise the full potential of this new era of peace.  I encourage all to be guided in the days ahead by the hopes of so many for a fair political settlement in an environment of lasting peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this motion to bring an end to the state of national emergency, following through on the pledge given by the former Taoiseach, <Col N="1543" /> Deputy Reynolds, and his Government last autumn after the IRA and Loyalist ceasefires.  It represents a symbolic acceptance of and recognition by this House that the conflict is over.  In that regard we accept the good faith of both the republican and loyalist paramilitaries.</P>
      <P>Both Governments and political parties must embrace the new circumstances and the opportunities for peace. Reconciliation and mutual forgiveness is hard after all that has happened and both Governments and Parliaments must give a lead and set an example. Former enemies in other parts of the world have managed to work together productively and constructively; it is not too much to ask that they begin to try to do so in the North.  If genuine engagement takes place then practical but important questions like arms and prisoners become subsidiary and can be resolved in an easier atmosphere.  The conflict in Northern Ireland, in large part, occurred because one community was treated as second-class citizens.</P>
      <P>We &mdash; and the Downing Street Joint Declaration &mdash; made it clear that if those engaged in or associated with campaigns of violence fully embraced the democratic way forward and abandoned violence, they would be able to participate fully in the democratic system on the same basis as other parties. This House and Members at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation have acted on that basis without distinguishing between loyalists and republicans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I very much regret that not even a junior British Minister has yet been able to meet Sinn Féin, or the small loyalist parties for talks, that there are still lingering suggestions that Sinn Féin and the loyalists will not be able to participate fully in the talks on the framework document until various preconditions are satisfied.  I have made it clear that, as far as my party is concerned, we consider that position to be totally unrealistic as far as either side is concerned and pointed out that, if persisted with, it will <Col N="1544" /> constitute a recipe for disaster.  Political figures and leaders of opinion from across the water have put to me the amazing proposition: &ldquo;Can you not persuade them even to give up ten bullets?&rdquo; This proposition is definitely not serious and seems to indicate that what is wanted is a symbolic surrender, whereas the reality is that, in the long war, no side was victorious and everybody was the loser.</P>
    <P>Of course, I welcome the continued search for and discovery of weapons by the Garda and Defence Forces whom I am sure would welcome whatever public assistance and co-opeation can be given them.  The last Government made it very clear to all concerned, at the time of the declaration of the ceasefires, that such searches would continue.  I congratulate them on their success today on the borders of Meath and Westmeath; there is no doubt that continued recovery of weapons will help to boost public confidence.  If peace is to be consolidated we shall all have to be prepared to show trust and magnanimity, no side involved in resolving this problem &mdash; Governments or other political parties &mdash; is entitled to claim positions of moral superiority.  By sins of commission and omission we all &mdash; not just the paramilitaries &mdash; share some responsibility for the intensity and length of the conflict. The British Government also has a duty to examine its conscience.  What is now needed is political pragmatism.  If negotiations are to have any chance of success they must be inclusive and should not create undue difficulties for other parties if initially organised on a bilateral basis.</P>
    <P>When the Constitution was drafted in 1937 Europe was in the shadow of war; Ireland, as a young, emerging nation, had no means of foreseeing the extent of the calamity which was to befall the world.  One decision which had to be taken in 1937 was the extent to which the Constitution would permit rights to be frozen or suspended in times of armed conflict, rebellion or emergency. Article 28 of the Constitution sought to achieve that delicate balance between <Col N="1545" /> the needs of the State and the rights of individual citizens.  With the benefit of hindsight, we can now see that the correct balance was struck.  The need for any State to have in place constitutional and legislative mechanisms to protect itself and its democratic institutions from attack is not now in dispute but the need to introduce those measures, and the manner in which they are operated at any given time, is always a matter of judgment.</P>
    <P>On two occasions in our history it has been necessary for this House to assemble to consider whether the circumstances of the time warranted the agreement and announcement of a declaration that a national emergency existed.  As, inevitably, declarations of such nature are made in times of great pressure and concern, it is appropriate that they be reviewed calmly in times of greater tranquility.  The first occasion on which this House was asked to declare a national emergency was on 2 September 1939; the previous day Germany had invaded Poland and the following day Britain and France entered the war.  The entire continent of Europe and the greater world were on the threshold of a war of unparalleled magnitude.  The House declared a national emergency and immediately thereafter the Emergency Powers Act, 1939 was passed. This was followed over the subsequent six years by a further eight Emergency Powers Acts.  The principal Act lapsed in 1946 and thereafter no legislation was in place on foot of the declaration of emergency although it continued in force until it was rescinded in 1976.  The state of emergency and the need for emergency legislation was undoubtedly real.  Ireland, as a young nation, survived the war intact.</P>
    <P>The second occasion this House was asked to declare a national emergency was in late August 1976.  On that occasion the perceived threat to the State was internal rather than external. A certain member of the national Government had predicted an imminent and armed assault on the institutions of this State to be followed by a bloody <Col N="1546" /> and sectarian war.  Events, such as the murder of the British Ambassador and the explosion at the Special Criminal Court in Dublin, fuelled those fears. The House declared a national emergency and the Emergency Powers Act, 1976 was passed.  That Act provided for up to seven days detention following arrest for an offence scheduled under the Act.  It was strongly opposed at the time as an excessive infringement of civil liberties.  It remained in force for one year and was allowed to lapse in 1977 by the incoming Fianna Fáil Government.  Since then no legislation has been in force on foot of this most recent declaration of emergency.</P>
    <P>The abiding feature of both emergencies has been their duration.  It is appropriate to ask on an occasion such as this whether there ought to be some mechanism which would automatically bring a state of emergency to an end unless this House intervened to continue it.  There is much merit in the recommendation in the report of the committee of the Constitution published in 1967 that Article 28.3.3º be amended so that resolutions declaring an emergency shall have effect for three years only unless renewed by further resolutions in the Dáil and Seanad and provisions such as that would avoid the continue existence of a state of emergency long after legislation introduced on foot of the declaration had lapsed. Perhaps this could be considered by the Taoiseach's proposed constitutional committee to which he referred during Question Time last week.</P>
    <P>In the interests of closing a painful chapter in our history this is a time when there is a need for an expression of regret for wrongs committed.  In this connection there is one further matter which should, as a requirement of honour and decency, be addressed by the Taoiseach in the course of this debate. In 1976, when the declaration of emergency was announced, he was an office holder in the Administration.  That Administration introduced the Emergency Powers Bill, 1976 which, having passed the Dáil and Seanad, was sent to <Col N="1547" /> the President for his signature.  The late President Ó Dalaigh exercised the power given him under Article 26 of the Constitution and referred the Bill to the Supreme Court.  This prompted a serving Fine Gael Government Minister at the time to make a shameful and unprecedented attack on the President.  He was not required to resign.  It is deplorable that the then Fine Gael-Labour Coalition took no step to defend the Office of the President which is foremost among the institutions of the State. A constitutional crisis was allowed develop and one of our most distinguished Presidents was forced to resign to protect the independence and dignity of the Office of President. Before this chapter in our history is closed with the formal ending of the state of emergency declared in 1976 the Taoiseach, who was an office holder in that former Administration, should express his regret at the manner in which the late President Ó Dalaigh was forced to resign, and pay posthumous tribute to his contribution to the dignity and the independence of the Office of President and the way he responded to the crisis.</P>

      <P>We are trying to close a chapter of history and this matter has not been dealt with in this House.  We are talking about what happened in 1976 and it would be a failure on the part of any Member to forget what happened here at that time.  I invite the Taoiseach to place those matters clearly and unequivocally on the record of the House and I welcome this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this motion.  It is bizarre and incredible that <Col N="1548" /> for 55 of the 57 years since this State came into existence under the 1937 Constitution we have been in a state of emergency.  It is regrettable that a state of emergency in breach of the spirit and letter of the Constitution, was allowed continue without much debate.  There has been much criticism here over the years about the prevention of terrorism legislation in the United Kingdom, but at least that legislation originally had to be debated annually before it could be renewed.  For the Oireachtas not to have the power to hold a debate, at least on an annual basis, before such an emergency can be renewed is incredible.  In the current review of the Constitution planned by the Government I hope there will be a limited life on any future state of emergency.  That was one of the recommendations made by the Progressive Democrats when they published a new draft Constitution in 1986.</P>
      <P>Over the years there has been a good deal of criticism of that state of emergency and many have questioned whether it was appropriate.  The late Eamon de Valera in 1947, the late Seán Lemass in 1960 and 1964, Jack Lynch in 1969 and 1971 and the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, defended the need for this state of emergency.  I am delighted we can now pass this motion with the support of all sides of the House.  That is significant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, while it is understandable that the first state of emergency was announced during the Second World War, it is ludicrous that it remained until 1976 and was only rescinded to provide for a new and different emergency due to the murder of the British Ambassador and his assistant and because explosives were used to release prisoners from the Special Criminal Court.  The only legislation passed under the present emergency was the Emergency Powers Act, 1976 which lapsed after one year when the 1977 Fianna Fáil Government allowed it to do so.  As the Taoiseach and the Fianna Fáil Leader said, that provided for the detention of suspects for seven days and <Col N="1549" /> led to a good deal of litigation with allegations and suspicions about a heavy gang and so on.</P>
    <P>There are a number of matters we must realise today.  The passing of this motion does not in any way affect the Offences Against the State Act. Although it is referred to as emergency legislation it is part of the permanent legislation of this State and, unfortunately, it is still vitally necessary.  The Offences Against the State Act is the legislative base for the establishment of the Special Criminal Court.  It is not just political subversion to which this State has been subjected in recent times. Crimes, such as, the recent Brinks-Allied robbery, the serious crime of shooting a journalist and trading in illegal drugs are all indications of the necessity for a Special Criminal Court because, unfortunately, ordinary courts are not capable of dealing with criminals who believe in intimidating witnesses, murdering competitors, shooting journalists and the mutilation of others in order to prevent a prosecution and subsequently a conviction.  I urge the Government to consider Part V of the Offences Against the State Act regarding membership of that court.  We need to fulfill our commitments under the European Convention on Human Rights.  The legislation provides that army officers or lawyers can serve in that court but that is not appropriate as that court should only be manned by judges.  We need to amend Part V of the Offences Against the State Act to change that.</P>
    <P>Today it is also appropriate to consider the victims of crime.  Much emphasis is placed on the preservation of the civil liberties of citizens suspected of having committed serious crime.  The Minister for Justice recently drew public attention to the fact that Ministers for Justice are always called on to introduce draconian legislation after a crisis but when they do it is often rejected and opposed in many quarters.  Today we should remember the thousands of victims of crime in our society, North and South.  The day has long passed for the <Col N="1550" /> need to introduce a proper system for compensating victims for the awful pain and suffering they endure.  In this State victims of crime are merely awarded out-of-pocket expenses and must wait up to five years to receive them.  The Criminal Injuries Tribunal compensation fund should be placed on a statutory basis and we must amend its provisions to allow for the allocation of compensation to those who endure pain and suffering at the hands of hardened criminals in our society.</P>
    <P>Many may believe that the passing of this resolution will send out the wrong signal and that in some way the State is lowering its guard against paramilitaries. If paramilitaries return to violence or if there is any threat of violence, I believe the Members of this House will not be slow to introduce the necessary legislation and will use the full powers which a democratic State is entitled to use to protect itself against subversion.</P>
    <P>I visited Northern Ireland yesterday and used the opportunity to speak in particular to representatives of the Unionist community.  I have occasion every Friday at the forum to meet representatives of the Nationalist community. I agree with the Taoiseach's remarks that this is a time of great hope, but it is also a time of great uncertainty. The Taoiseach spoke about the need for trust, but a message that came through loud and clear to me yesterday is that the Unionist community do not really trust anybody.  They are frightened and I cannot over-emphasise the fear in which they are living.  It is, therefore, essential that the two Governments publish the framework document as soon as possible.  I have no doubt that document will be fair and balanced and will reassure both communities.  We must not lessen our resolve to bring to a conclusion the current talks between both Governments because comprehensive political talks between all representatives in Northern Ireland must commence. We cannot return to the position that prevailed in the past.  Northern Ireland must be transformed into a real <Col N="1551" /> political society to which Nationalists and Unionists can give their allegiance. It must be a place in which there is parity of esteem and for which a bill of rights should be enshrined in a Constitution which would give permanence to whatever is agreed.</P>
    <P>The fears of Unionists, in particular, run very deep.  That is one message I recall from yesterday's visit to Northern Ireland.  I met not only politicians, academics and business people but community leaders whose message was very clear, namely, that they want the politicians to get on with it.  They want arrangements in place so that we can work together on this island.</P>
    <P>There must be a North-South dimension to developments between the two Governments and the publication of the framework document.  Irish Nationalism must be fully represented because Northern Ireland is as Irish as it is British and although Nationalists have great hope and expectation and Unionists live in fear and trepidation, on balance, if we give it time and if people are calm and reasonable, we can find the framework to allow us work together on this island. It will require give and take and, particularly, it will require people on this side of the Border to be generous in their attitude to the necessary changes.  In the Downing Street Declaration the Taoiseach committed himself to examining aspects of Irish life that may cause offence to many people in Northern Ireland and, indeed, that may cause offence to many on this part of the island also.  Under the provisions of the Downing Street Declaration, has an examination in that regard been carried out in the Taoiseach's Department?  I have not heard of such an examination being carried out.  The people in Northern Ireland want us to be generous, it is not always a question of looking for change in some other quarter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern mentioned the referral to the courts in 1976 of the emergency powers Bill to test its constitutionality and the events that flowed from that. While I read some of the debate in the <Col N="1552" /> House at that time, one would not need to read it to recall the panic that prevailed at the time.  This is an appropriate time to recall the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and the families left without brothers, sisters or fathers as a result.  A great source of grievance to those families is the fact that nobody was charged or tried in connection with those bombrings, an appropriate inquiry was not carried out.  Despite the peace process those families still insist &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; that the Governments should not forget their plight.  They want to see justice done and the Irish Government, in particular, taking on board their case. They were real victims in the Republic of the awful paramilitary activities we had to endure for the past 25 years.</P>
    <P>It is incredible that a State as young as this has been in a state of emergency for 55 of its 57 years existence.  Some may find that surprising and other live under the illusion that the rescinding of this legislation will send a signal to certain quarters that they engaged in respectable political behaviour and that we have all changed our minds.  There was no justification for killing members of the security forces, murdering children or robbing banks 25, 15 or five years ago just as there is no justification for it now.  Those committed to the development of the peace process and to politics have a black and white choice. They must either go down the democratic political route and live by democratic political principles or choose the path of violence.  We can never condone a symbiotic relationship between violence and politics and that it is somehow respectable to have a choice between the two.</P>
    <P>Punishment beatings and the awful beating in the Ardoyne area last weekend are not compatible with peace or democratic political principles.  I am pleased the Taoiseach raised the matter with Sinn Féin representatives; representatives of other organisations should also be spoken to in this regard. Those with influence have a duty to use it to ensure that such beatings, which in many ways are more serious, painful <Col N="1553" /> and draconian than a bullet through the head, are stopped.  The awful atrocity at the weekend, about which I heard a great deal yesterday on my visit to Northern Ireland, cannot be condoned by anybody wishing to participate in the democratic process.</P>
    <P>We live in a time when many ordinary people are frightened for the security of the State and wonder why a small number of people in our society whose names, apparently, are known to the Garda Síochána, are not capable of being tried and convicted under our criminal justice system and any society in which that is the case does not have appropriate powers vested in the Garda Síochána.  While considering the passing of this resolution today it is also a time to examine more comprehensively our present laws to ensure that they equip us with the necessary ammunition to operate a fair criminal justice system.  It is a perversion of justice that for so long a tiny few have been able to make vast amounts of money because crime pays. It is even more serious if they were able to avail of the amnesty.  Such crimes involved armed robbery, illegal drug trading and parliamentary racketeering.</P>
    <P>Whatever its nature it is not acceptable in any civilised democratic society that people who are engaged in those crimes, whose names apparently are known cannot be tried because of the inadequacy of our laws.</P>
    <P>The absolute right to silence in our legislation needs to be limited.  To ensure that human rights and civil liberties are protected the pilot project in Tallaght where Garda questioning is videod should be extended.  If the right to silence is to be limited, it should be limited bearing in mind the need to protect the civil liberties of every citizen, even those suspected of serious crimes. The Garda Síochána need additional resources, not necessarily financial.  We need an anti-racketeering unit.  The Government has committed itself to the establishment of a corporate fraud office.  Its powers need to be extended to ensure that the Garda have the resources to investigate how certain <Col N="1554" /> people accumulated their wealth.  It is not acceptable to have to wait for a conviction in the criminal court before the assets of certain criminals can be seized.</P>
    <P>In welcoming this motion I hope the unique opportunity exists on this island to create, once and for all, a political society to which everyone can give their allegiance and particularly in Northern Ireland where Unionists and Nationalists can work side by side for the first time and where Northern Ireland is no longer a Unionist State for a Unionist people.  Both Governments have given that assurance in the Anglo-Irish Agreement and in the Downing Street Declaration and every party in this House is committed to the principle of there being no change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland unless a majority of the people there wish that to happen.  That should be some reassurance to the majority community in Northern Ireland.  In addition, any package agreed will be put to the people in a referendum.  That is the greatest assurance of all.  Surely nobody should be afraid of allowing their own people a say in how they are governed and what kind of political structures are put in place to order society for the remainder of the decade and into the next millennium.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to be careful with the words and language we use.  We must not talk about the peace process as if it were some kind of fragile process and as if there is some justification no, matter what happens between the Governments, for a return to violence.  No matter what is contained in the framework document there is no justification for a return to violence from the paramilitaries from either side.  All of us must make that perfectly clear.  I worry when I hear constitutional politicians talk about the fragile nature of the process as if there is some justification, if the document is not right, for a return to violence.</P>
    <P>The question of the release of prisoners is a sensitive and delicate issue. As I said earlier those who were involved in murder, armed robbery and <Col N="1555" /> crimes of that kind are not political prisoners. There was no justification for the awful crime in which they engaged.  We need to be sensitive to the way this issue is handled.  In particular we need to be sensitive to the needs and concerns of the thousands of families on this island who have been the victims of those criminals.  The Government must move extremely carefully and both Governments must act together.  Sometimes the wrong message in the way something is presented can be sent to the ordinary citizen and, perhaps, to the victims of those prisoners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Government of Renewal and as Leader of Democratic Left I am pleased to support this motion to lift the state of emergency which has effectively continued in operation since 1939.  The impact will be largely symbolic but it is nonetheless, important for that.  Few people probably realise that they have been living under a state of emergency for 55 years and they will not suddenly find that their rights and liberties have been enhanced once this motion has been passed by both House of the Oireachtas as required under Article 28.3.3º of the Constitution.  The passing of these motions will represent a vote of confidence in the Northern peace process and in the strength of our democratic structures and institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody will dispute the right of a state to take exceptional powers to protect its democratic institutions in time of war or violent turmoil, but such exceptional measures should never be allowed to become the norm in a democratic society.  I do not believe that those who drafted the Constitution ever believed that the powers of Article 28.33º would have been allowed to continue in operation for 55 years, or that those Members of the Oireachtas who voted in September 1939 and again in September 1976 to invoke the state of emergency ever believed that it would have taken the Dáil and Seanad until <Col N="1556" /> February 1995 to get around to declaring that the national emergency had ended.</P>
    <P>It was not unreasonable that the Dáil should have declared a national emergency in September 1939 given the outbreak of the Second World War, and again, given the level of violence and particularly the assassination of the British Ambassador in 1976, there was a case for the State taking special measures, but there was never any case for allowing a declaration of a national emergency to have continued without interruption for 55 years.  While there have been violent passages in our history and while the past 25 years have seen particular acts of savagery, there have been long periods when the conditions envisaged by Article 28.3.3º, i.e. a national emergency occasioned by war, armed conflict or armed rebellion affecting the vital interests of the State clearly did not apply.  It reflects no credit on the Members of successive Dála that action to regularise the situation was not taken earlier.</P>
    <P>When it comes to guarding against the potential abuse of human rights or civil liberties by the State we can never be too vigilant or careful.  As I said, it is not unreasonable that a state should have the right to take exceptional powers to deal with particular threats, but these powers have to be kept under constant review.  Constitutional powers that were appropriate for a democracy born out of violent conflict and still in its infancy in the 1930s may not necessarily be appropriate for a modern democracy, playing a full role in the European Union as we approach the end of the 20th Century.</P>
    <P>The powers contained in Article 28.3.3º are exceptional and I believe they should be looked at in the context of the review of the Constitution promised in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal.</i> A group of experts is to be established to prepare a report on all aspects of the Constitution and when they have completed their work an all party committee of the Oireachtas will be established to review that work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1557" /> It is hard to envisage the conditions referred to in Article 28.3.3º are likely to occur again, but they may well do.  Do we need powers as sweeping as those provided by that Article?  Is it appropriate that such powers, including the rendering of legislation immune from constitutional challenge, can be invoked by a simple majority in the Dáil and Seanad?  Is there a case for introducing some sort of weighted majority requiring, say, the support of 60 per cent or 66 per cent of the Members of the Dáil and Seanad before a national emergency can be declared?  If the conditions envisaged by Article 28 genuinely applied then it would be difficult to see any opposition failing to go along with the exceptional measures required, but as long as a simple majority only is required you cannot rule out a Government of the future invoking a state of national emergency when the conditions necessary to justify one do not exist.  Should a declaration of emergency not lapse at the end of a specific period of time, as recommended by the 1967 committee on the Constitution, unless it is renewed by the Dáil and Seanad, rather than the present situation where it is allowed to continue indefinitely unless the Oireachtas passes motions ending it?  Given our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and other international charters, there is a case for providing in our own legislation that any such declaration of a national emergency or exceptional powers introduced under any such emergency should be subject to international monitoring.</P>
    <P>There is a need for these issues to be discussed and addressed and I look forward to the group of experts and the Oireachtas committee considering such matters as part of their remit and reporting back at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>As I noted earlier, the most recent declaration of a state of national emergency was taken in the context of a particularly violent passage in our recent history.  The year 1976 saw not just the murder of the British Ambassador, Christopher Ewart-Biggs, and a <Col N="1558" /> civil servant, Judith Cook, but also the Kingsmill massacre in which ten Protestants were murdered in Armagh, the trial of those charged with the kidnapping of Dr. Herrema, the murder of a young Garda in County Laois, firebombs in Dublin and a man killed by a car bomb in Castleblayney.  If 1976 represented one of the darkest periods of the past 25 years, when the only reaction most people had was despair, the ceasefires of the Nationalist and loyalist paramilitaries and the six month period almost free of violence really has provided a new dawn and allowed people, especially those in Northern Ireland, to hope again.</P>
    <P>There is clearly a lot of work to be done yet to ensure that the unique opportunity to ensure lasting peace and political stability is not lost.  The whole process is now at a particularly delicate phase and there is an obligation on everyone who cares about the people of this island to consider honestly and openly what new structures and arrangements are necessary to guarantee peace and to free the people of this island permanently from the terror of politically motivated violence.</P>
    <P>I would appeal in particular to members of the Unionist community in Northern Ireland to suspend judgment on the proposed Joint Framework Document until it is available in its entirely.  It would be a mistake for anyone to rush to judgment on the basis of selected extracts from work in progress which appeared in the London <i>Times</i> last week and which were clearly designed to cause alarm among Unionists. The reaction of the Irish and British Governments to these leaks shows that London and Dublin share a common resolve not to be deflected from the work in hand and to ensure that negotiations are completed at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>It cannot be stated too often that the current talks on the Joint Framework Document are not intended to devise a solution to be imposed by the two Governments.  The document is designed to facilitate inter-party talks <Col N="1559" /> and both Governments have made it clear that any final proposals will have to go before the people in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic in referendums. A lasting solution to the problems of Northern Ireland will require a willingness on all sides to compromise, to give as well as to take.  I am confident that when the Joint Framework Document is completed it will be clearly seen to reflect this principle.  The benefits of the current process cannot be underestimated. The people of Northern Ireland have nothing to fear from the process and much to gain.</P>
    <P>In this debate, the focus of attention has naturally been on the relationship between the State and the citizen and on the anxiety to ensure that the rights of citizens are not abused by the State, but we should never forget that those who have been guilty of the greatest human rights abuses, those who have inflicted unspeakable violence on the people, have been the paramilitary organisations.  While most of the violence in Northern Ireland has stopped, paramilitaries are still engaged in acts of brutality against members of the community in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Over the past few weeks there has been a worrying resurgence in the level of so-called punishment attacks, with a number of particularly barbaric incidents reported over the weekend.  In one case in Ardoyne, a 19 year-old was left with one of his legs jammed between the steel stanchions of a security fence.  He was taken to hospital with two broken legs and other injuries.  Both loyalist and Nationalist paramilitaries have continued to engage in this brutality. It cannot be said too often that regardless of the level of petty crime and regardless of the problems of confidence in the police in certain areas of Northern Ireland, no organisation has the right to act as judge, jury and executioner in such cases and no organisation or individual has the right to inflict such violence on other citizens.  It is not simply good enough for the leaders of political parties associated <Col N="1560" /> with the paramilitaries to wash their hands of such activities.  These people have the political and moral authority to ensure that the activities of these punishment gangs cease, and they should use it.</P>
    <P>In bringing this motion before the House, the Government is fulfilling the first part of a three-part commitment given in the Programme of Renewal. The other two parts involve legislation on the Convention of the Transfer of Prisoners and a review of all legislation and court arrangements associated with the management of the conflict in the last 25 years.</P>
    <P>As with the lifting of the state of emergency I believe that a review along the lines envisaged is long overdue.  The Offences Against the State Act was originally introduced in 1939 against the background of the outbreak of the Second World War, at a time when the memories of the civil war were still fresh, at the end of a decade when political violence based on civil war differences had continued intermittently, and when the State faced the threat not just of external invasion but internal turmoil.</P>
    <P>By any standards, it is draconian legislation, with a range of powers rarely found in a democratic society. Perhaps the most exceptional power is that which allows for the introduction of internment without trial.  It should be noted that the power to intern can be introduced by a simple decision of the Government and does not even require the sanction of the Oireachtas.  The Act also allows for the banning of a wide range of organisations.  Contrary to the public perception this power is not restricted to paramilitary groups, but allows, for instance, for the banning of any organisation which &ldquo;promotes, encourages, or advocates the non-payment of moneys payable to the central fund or any other public fund or the non-payment of taxes.&rdquo; This puts virtually every residents' and tenants' association in the country at risk.  Over the years, the powers of the Act have been used against organisations as <Col N="1561" /> diverse as farmers groups and the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>Many of the sections of the Act have fallen into disuse and it is difficult to envisage circumstances in which they will be used again.  The section which makes it an offence not to account for his or her movements &mdash; once widely used against republicans including myself &mdash; is now very rarely invoked. Under the terms of the Act, every newspaper in the State has been a regular offender in the course of the past 25 years by carrying, sometimes on a daily basis, statements from an illegal organisation, the IRA, contrary to the provisions of section 10 of the Act.  I am sure nobody is seriously advocating that the newspapers should be prosecuted but in that case what is the purpose in allowing this and other sections which are no longer in use to remain on the Statute Book?</P>
    <P>The Act also allows for the establishment of special military courts to try civilian offenders.  We have not had special military courts since the early 1960s, but we have had the non-jury Special Criminal Court since 1972.  I do not believe that it was ever envisaged that the Special Criminal Court would become a permanent part of our judicial system and I think there is a very strong case to be made for reviewing the operation of the court.  Certainly circumstances have changed very dramatically since 1972.</P>
    <P>I know that there is a body of opinion which suggests that measures like the Offences Against the State Act and institutions like the Special Criminal Court should be used to combat the growing problem of organised crime.  I would urge caution in this regard.  As a general rule I believe that special legislation or measures introduced to combat paramilitary activities should be used solely for that purpose.  If the civil law and the civil court are inadequate to deal with the problem of organised crime, we should see what measures can be taken to strengthen the power or improve their procedures.  It is, I accept, a complex area and one which I hope <Col N="1562" /> will be fully examined in the course of the Government's promised review of the legislation and court arrangements associated with the activities of paramilitary organisations of the past 25 years.</P>

      <P>I support the motion before the House.  The decision of the Government to end the 56-year state of emergency, welcome as it is, is one step along a road on which many steps must be taken to bring this nation into conformity with internationally accepted human rights practices.  In 1993 a UN report roundly condemned Ireland for a number of practices including the absence of refugee legislation, censorship legislation and the continuance of the state of emergency.  The Government in its programme is committed to ensuring that the people of this State enjoy the rights taken for granted by most other democratic jurisdictions, rights which range from freedom of access to information and comprehensive free legal aid.  The rights of the individual citizen must be weighed against the rights of society as a whole.</P>
      <P>The introduction of the emergency powers in 1939 was designed to protect society during a time of upheaval and insecurity&mdash; most other European countries had similar legislation during World War II.  After the conclusion of the war Ireland maintained the state of emergency, even during a period of stability and peace that lasted for more than 20 years, from 1945 until the start of the conflict in Northern Ireland.  The emergency powers were then renewed in 1976 after the assassination of the British Ambassador to Ireland, Christopher Ewart-Biggs, and they have remained in place ever since.</P>

      <P>Most people do not know what it is to live without a state of emergency.  We have also become used to other institutions generally associated, albeit mistakenly, with the state of emergency, for example, the Special Criminal Court and the various powers contained in the Offences Against the State Acts, 1939-85.</P>
      <P>A state of emergency has been the norm for 56 years and its lifting heralds both opportunities and dangers.  It gives us the opportunity to construct a truly civilian security service, a construction in which the powers of the Garda and Army are entirely seperate and in which the Garda are seen as the prime guarantors of internal security and freedoms. However, there is also a danger of complacency. The threats which give birth to the emergency legislation&mdash; the external threat posed by World War II and the internal threat posed by the paramilitaries &mdash; have been removed, but they have been replaced by new threats.  It could be argued that organised crime poses as great a threat to civil society as the paramilitaries.  Let us be clear about it, guns have not been removed from our society.  The new guns demand new responses which concentrate on prevention, detection and punishment and which do not dilute the civil liberties of the individual.</P>
      <P>In this context, there needs to be a thorough review of the Offences Against the State Act to ensure that provisions which are only rarely used and which represent a gross infringement of the civil liberties are not reinstated on the Statue Book in case something happens in the future.  In particular, I urge the Minister to consider the abolition of the Special Criminal Court.  Article 38.5 of the Constitution guarantees the right to trial by jury, except in circumstances defined by Article 38.3.1º which states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Special courts may be established by law for the trial of offences in cases where it may be determined in accordance with such law that the ordinary courts are inadequate to <Col N="1564" /> secure the effective administration of justice, and the preservation of public peace and order.</P>
    <P>I would argue that these stipulations have held through in only a minority of the cases referred to the Special Criminal Court in the recent past.  I am particularly worried that the courts set up under Article 38.3 of the Constitution, for example, the Special Criminal Court, are exempt from the provisions of Articles 34 and 35 which guarantee the right to trial in public and the independence of the Judiciary.  There can be no justification for suspending these constitutional provisions &mdash; society and times have changed and we have peace &mdash; or for the suspending the right to trial by jury, a fundamental civil right.  The inalienable right to be tried by 12 of one's peers in open court is the hallmark of a civilised society and by suspending that right our judicial system has become something less than civilised.</P>
    <P>The challenge facing us is to ensure that our administration of justice conforms to the minimum standards taken for granted in a democracy, while still ensuring that the public is adequately protected against emerging threats, for example, drug trafficking, warlords and organised crime.  The Government's decision to lift the state of emergency, together with the full implementation of the measures contained in the programme. <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> will go a long way to meeting those challenges. I urge the Minister to take that extra step and openly review the Offences Against the State Acts and copperfasten the rights of all citizens to trial by jury.  Now that the threat of violence has been lifted consideration should be given to removing the security windows and screens which only serve to isolate the public from this Chamber.</P>

      <P>I support the motion for the cessation of the state of emergency which has existed in its present from since 1976.  When in Government Fianna Fáil indicated that it would seek to abolish the state of emergency at the appropriate time, and I welcome the Taoiseach's decision to take this commitment on board.  As my party leader, Deputy Ahern, said Fianna Fáil will support this motion.</P>
      <P>Today's action by Dáil Éireann sends a clear message to the British Government that it too must give the most serious consideration to the removal of similar legislation in Britain.  One should not underestimate the practical and symbolic significance of the removal of the state of emergency, which has been in existence in its present form for 18 years.  This is a testimony to how the conflict on this island has shaped our legislation and behaviour as a State which otherwise would not have been the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The presence of the state of emergency was a reminder of ongoing violence and terror and its removal represents a consolidation of the peace process, a necessary note of confidence in our shared work for peace.  If the scrapping of the state of emergency represents another step forward in the peace process then it contrasts starkly with last week's malicious leak of elements of the framework document to <i>The Times</i> newspaper in London.  This leak was deliberately intended to foster distrust and suspicion and was clearly designed to damage the fragile peace process.  I said then that dark forces were at work and I believe they still are. This is all the more reason to forge <Col N="1566" /> ahead with the peace process.  The removal of the state of emergency has the opposite intention to last week's leak; it will strengthen th peace process, not weaken it.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, the peace process is about forging trust, dismantling the barriers which have built up between communities and working to build a more hopeful future.  Forging this new climate requires action and compromise on all sides.  The state of emergency is one such barrier and, like section 31 of the Broadcasting Act, which I renewed as Minister for Communications, the time has come for its removal.</P>
    <P>The state of emergency has its genesis in Article 28.3.3º of the Constitution which allows the Oireachtas to invoke law for the purpose of securing the public safety and the preservation of the State in time of war or armed rebellion. According to the Constitution, a time of war includes a time when there is taking place an armed conflict in which the State is not a participant but in respect of which the Houses of the Oireachtas believe the vital interests of the State are at stake.</P>
    <P>The first state of emergency came about after the outbreak of World War II in 1939.  In September of that year the Emergency Powers Act was enacted, giving the Government control over supplies, transport and military matters. The emergency was a clear affirmation of Ireland's neutrality but it was also, as in the words of Seán Ó Faolain, our practical claim to independence.  Times have changed and momentous events have taken place since then but once again neutrality is moving to centre stage as an issue of political and public concern in the run up to the 1996 intergovernmental conference and beyond. That is a debate for another day, and one in which Fianna Fáil will take a lead role.</P>
    <P>The 1939 emergency remained in force until 1976 and was only lifted by a resolution which simultaneously declared a fresh emergency arising out of the armed conflict in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1567" /> It is worthwhile remembering the context in which the latter state of emergency was introduced, in 1976 there was a spate of violence that many feared would engulf the whole of Ireland.  There were bomb explosions in hotels in Dublin, Killarney, Limerick and Rosslare responsibility for which was claimed by the UFF and in July of that year there were bomb explosions in the Special Criminal Court; there was the terrible murder of the British Ambassador to Ireland, Mr. Christopher Ewart Biggs, and of Judith Cook of the Northern Ireland Office, by a landmine.  In September of that year the Dáil and Seanad declared a national state of emergency and towards the end of that month President Ui Dalaigh referred the Emergency Powers Act to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach will recall, there then followed one of the more shameful events in Fine Gael's history when the then Minister for Defence, Paddy Donegan, referred to the President as a &ldquo;thundering disgrace&rdquo;.  President Ó Dalaigh subsequently resigned, to, in his own words, &ldquo;protect the dignity of the office&rdquo;.  I echo the words of my party leader, Deputy Ahern, that the Taoiseach and the Government should take this opportunity to apologise to the family of the late President and set the record straight in relation to his magnificent presidency.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, the Supreme Court declared the Emergency Powers Act not to be repugnant to the Constitution with one significant caveat to which I will return later.  It is right to set down an important principle regarding emergency legislation.  Legislation of this nature has to maintain a fine balance between the aim of securing public safety as set out in Article 28 of the Constitution and ensuring that the legislation does not inadvertently foster a climate in which violence might prosper. If this balance is not maintained then the law becomes counterproductive.</P>
    <P>At the time of the introduction of the <Col N="1568" /> Emergency Powers Act by the then Fine Gael led Government Fianna Fáil expressed grave reservations about aspects of it.  Public disquiet about this special legislation contributed significantly to the Fine Gael Party's defeat in the 1977 general election.  Much unease centred on section 2 of the legislation which empowered the Garda to arrest without warrant and hold in custody for up to seven days persons suspected of offences under the Offences Against the State Act, 1939.  Section 2 remained in force for one year from the date of enactment, 16 October 1976.  Fianna Fáil returned to power in July 1977 and in October of that year section 2 was allowed to lapse.</P>
    <P>In many ways the Emergency Powers Act is the legislative sibling of the section 31 ban introduced by the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Conor Cruise O'Brien, who now acts as the <i>Irish Independent's</i> answer to Nostradamus on Northern Ireland matters. When section 31 was abolished by the previous Fianna Fáil led Government there was no small amount of criticism, not least from the Taoiseach's own party.  This criticism was wide of the mark.  Like this motion to abolish the state of emergency, the decision to scrap section 31 was a legitimate step in the development of the peace process &mdash; it was an act of faith in the process.  Fianna Fáil views this motion in the same light and supports the removal of the state of emergency.  I had my own reservations about the removal of section 31.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court pronounced the Emergency Powers Act constitutional but with a significant caveat.  In its judgement the court tempered the potential effect of Article 28 of the Constitution. While not disputing the right of the Oireachtas to enact any legislation it saw fit in order to preserve public safety and the State when an emergency had been declared, the court stated that: &ldquo;It expressly reserves for future consideration the question of whether it had the right to consider whether the Oireachtas was justified in declaring a national emergency existed&rdquo;.  No case <Col N="1569" /> has arisen subsequently to challenge the court's thinking but this statement does act as an effective counterbalance to the scope of Article 28 and should make any future Government think twice about introducing new emergency legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne commented on our courts system, in particular the Special Criminal Court.  That court has served the country well and honourably and to suggest that it is less than civilised casts a terrible slur on the honourable members of the Judiciary who have served in it; members of the Garda, particularly those who were murdered during the state of emergency since 1976; prison officers and members of the Defence Forces &mdash; they deserve better.</P>
    <P>Judicial considerations aside we must now close the book on emergency legislation. That era has passed and must not return.  The task ahead lies in forging new structures and relationships to ensure that the conditions which spawned the state of emergency of 1976 will not recur.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this motion to bring to an end the state of national emergency.  The date of 1 September is significant.  It was on that date in 1976 that this emergency legislation was introduced while 1 September 1994 marked the first day of the current ceasefire which led to this discussion. The rich dividends that have flowed from the ceasefire are apparent throughout Ireland.  The atmosphere in the North has been transformed.  This is especially evident to those of us who are familiar with the area.  Throngs of people are crossing the Border in both directions and in greater numbers than ever before.  Above all, parents on all sides of the community have much less reason to worry themselves sick about the future well-being of their children. To a certain extent this also applies to those who live in the counties immediately south of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only depraved people would seek to destroy the process which has brought <Col N="1570" /> this happy situation about.  Whoever was responsible for leaking parts of the framework document undoubtedly belongs in this category.  The malicious manner in which the story was edited was not designed to enhance the cause of peace.  I have to ask <i>The Times</i> of London to explain precisely the motive behind the exercise.  <i>The Times</i> has always been pleased to describe itself as a quality newspaper &mdash; this implies a degree of excellence, moral and otherwise, not usually claimed by the so-called popular press.  On this occasion its oft acclaimed standards have, sadly, been lowered.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the intention of the culprits who collaborated was to dangerously raise the hackles and fears of the ordinary Unionist population.  The extracts so carefully highlighted were presented as if they were a principal part of a solemn treaty signed and sealed by the two Governments without any regard to the wishes of the people of Northern Ireland.  <i>The Times</i> as well as every single politician knows full well that this is so far from the truth as to be ludicrous.  It is not surprising that some of the more extreme Unionist politicians could scarcely conceal their glee; one wonders whether these particular individuals are so frightened at the prospect of dialogue that they would actually prefer the resumption of violence. The decent, long suffering people they claim to represent are entitled to hear something better than a constant repetition of the word &ldquo;No&rdquo; to every suggestion that might prevent communal conflict from breaking out again.</P>
    <P>There was one encouraging outcome which must have deeply disappointed the perpetrators of <i>The Times</i> leak&mdash; the calm, reasoned and measured response of the political representatives of both sets of paramilitaries.  This was in sharp contrast to the hysterical claims of &ldquo;the document is now dead&rdquo;. Regardless of the content of the completed document, we should all realise that it is merely an attempt by both Governments, after several months of <Col N="1571" /> consideration, to provide a sensible basis for discussion.</P>
    <P>The preferred ultimate outcome will be an honourable compromise that will guarantee the birthright of all on this island.  It is the people of Ireland, North and South, that matter, not the territory <i>per se.</i> Just as we acknowledge the right of Unionists to express their historical ties with Britain, so also must they be prepared to afford a similar right to hundreds of thousands of Northern Nationalists who fervently wish to articulate what binds them to the rest of Ireland.</P>
    <P>At a time when so many countries in Europe are moving ever closer to harmony, surely it is possible to accommodate both traditions on our small island without threatening the rights of either. Perhaps we might eventually begin to take Christianity seriously since it is what all the main denominations in Ireland claim to practice.  That would mean that we would regard charity as the greatest of all virtues and that consequently, neither of us would ever again wish to harm the other.  We would certainly never again use the Christian religion as an excuse for the deadly bigotry that has bedevilled the political and social development of this island for so long.</P>

      <P>For five decades, we have been all too familiar with the concept of the &ldquo;state of emergency&rdquo;.  What began as a legal response to the Second World War remained stubbornly in place, and in time acquired a new basis arising out of the tragic conflict on this island.  After all of these years, instead of repeating history, we are finally beginning to let history go, and forge for ourselves a new political reality and a new future based <Col N="1572" /> on our commitment to peace and the rule of law.</P>
      <P>As originally enacted by the people, the emergency powers clause of Article 28.3.3º referred only to measures taken in time of war or armed rebellion, these being understood as referable to events within the State.  During the initial period when the Constitution was capable of amendment by the Oireachtas alone, this definition was extended twice; initially by the First Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1939, to cover cases where both Houses had resolved that a conflict in which the State is not a participant gave rise to a national emergency, and then by the Second Amendment of the Constitution Act, 1941, to cover the period following such resolutions until both Houses resolve that the national emergency has ceased to exist.  It is this latter provision we are invoking in this House today.</P>
      <P>Today's motion comes at a time of both optimism and challenge, arising out of the opportunities which exist for the consolidation of peace and the building of an agreed Ireland based on addressing the three sets of relationships, within Northern Ireland, between North and South, and between Ireland and Britain.  When I last spoke in this House on Northern Ireland, in the immediate aftermath of the IRA ceasefire, on 31 August 1994, I said that the emergency provisions which were a feature of legal systems both North and South would have to be examined further down the road.  The next stage has now come, and it is a privilege for me to give my full support to the motion now before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be further legal steps.  The transfer of prisoners, and their release, has received and will continue to receive attention.  In due course, other laws and arrangements will have to be reviewed. I do not predict the outcome of such reviews, other than to say that our objective is the full and vigorous flourishing of the democratic process in both parts of this island, a process based on the rule of law and on equality of <Col N="1573" /> respect and of treatment for every tradition here.  I look forward very much to the steps yet to be taken towards this end.</P>
    <P>Side by side with the process of building an agreement on how we share this island, the motion now before the House makes a very real statement about this State's commitment to the proper functioning of the legal process.</P>
    <P>In July 1993 when the republican and loyalist ceasefires had yet to take place, the United Nations Human Rights Committee formally adopted its comments of Ireland's first report under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  Foremost among those comments was the statement that &ldquo;[t]he Committee strongly recommends that the State party critically examine the need for the existing state of emergency&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Human Rights Committee was neither the first nor the last body to express concern about this issue.  Here in Ireland, the all-party committee on the Constitution, which reported in 1967, recommended change to Article 28.3.3º of the Constitution to impose a time limit on resolutions of the Houses of the Oireachtas under that provision. More recently, the European Commission for Democracy through Law of the Council of Europe has been examining states of emergency throughout the Continent, and has looked in particular at the need for legal protection in emergencies for certain irreducible, non-derogable human rights.</P>
    <P>Resolutions under Article 28.3.3º have existed continuously since 2 September 1939.  As the motion before the House reminds us, the 1939 resolutions were replaced by fresh resolutions on 1 September 1976.  In other words, for 55 of the 57 years in which the Constitution has been in force, a state of emergency has existed.  Anyone born after 1939 will not have known any form of legal situation other than the state of emergency. Commenting on the continuance of the emergency throughout the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, the late Deputy John Kelly once somewhat sceptically remarked <Col N="1574" /> that there were always reasons for keeping it in force.  One might have been forgiven for thinking that the day would never come when the resolutions could and would be rescinded.</P>
    <P>The cessation of the state of emergency, which the House is being asked to decide on tonight, has more than just a symbolic value.  Our decision to lift the emergency resolutions says something very important about how we describe this State to ourselves and to the world. It amounts to a new level of maturity and self-confidence in our institutions, our legal and social system, and our hopes for the future.  Above all, it is a tangible and significant staging-post in our quest for peace.</P>
    <P>Tonight's motion is a tribute to the enormous effort which has been devoted to the building of that peace, both by this Government and the previous Government, and it marks both the recognition of what has been achieved already and the determination to consolidate those gains and underpin them through further political progress.</P>
    <P>For the future, we look to the consolidation of the hard-won peace, to the building of real and lasting political progress, and in due course to further reforms aimed at normalising the legal system on these islands.</P>
    <P>For now, with the passing of this motion, we can begin to emerge from under the shadow of violence and of emergency law which has dominated our politics for so long, and we can begin to breath the fresh and free air of a normal legal system, with all of the hopes and opportunities that involves, as well as the challenges it brings. Tonight I look forward to the future and not to the past; to our hopes rather than our history; to our dreams of what could be rather than the resigned acceptance of what is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for sharing his time with me as I particularly wanted to contribute to this debate.  I support the motion ending the national emergency and congratulate the Government on its courage in <Col N="1575" /> tabling it.  The timing is right.  Living in a Border constituency I have full knowledge of what the emergency meant.  I listened with interest to Deputy McDaid, another of the Border Deputies.  We have seen at first hand the real problems of the conflict in Northern Ireland.  That this emergency was necessary when introduced in 1976 is not in doubt.  It was brought in by a Government acting in the best interests of the people of this country, by a Taoiseach who will probably go down in history as one of the finest Taoisigh ever, former Deputy Liam Cosgrave.  It was introduced at a time when armed men were running wild in the country and were seen in my constituency organising and fund-raising.  People were torn between different sides in the conflict. On the one hand there was the Nationalist population in Northern Ireland and, on the other, the Unionists. Many were sucked into the conflict because terrible deeds were being committed and feelings ran high.</P>
      <P>Thankfully that is in the past and I have no doubt that the peace will last. This motion is a further step in copperfastening the peace process.  People will see that the Government is prepared to act if people are prepared to live within the democratic system.  I have no doubt that the finding of a substantial cache of arms in Oldcastle, County Meath last night was not accidental and that people are realising that the way forward is through peace and the democratic process. The benefits since the cessation of violence in a short four or five months have been enormous.  I too will be generous in congratulating everybody who was involved, those who were publicly involved and whose names have been associated with the process and the many people in the background who worked tirelessly and continue to do so but whose names never come to the public notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past five or six months I have seen the freedom of movement in the Border region, the freedom of people to move between North and South.  I have <Col N="1576" /> spoken to people in Cavan town who, for 30 years, have not stood in Enniskillen because they were fearful that they might be in Northern Ireland at the wrong time.  Similarly people from the North have not travelled via Ennis-killen, Lisnaskea to Cavan and Monaghan in 20 years.  This movement of people must be welcomed because with it and the interaction of people will come a better understanding of the people North and South.  The benefits can be tremendous and already there have been numerous inquiries from travel agencies in America about booking tourists into the Slieve Russell Hotel in Cavan.</P>
    <P>There is tremendous interest by Irish Americans, and the Irish all over the world, in visiting and seeing what is happening in the new Ireland.  Nobody should hinder that process and public statements should be carefully considered and calculated.  If people are worried about the recent leaks in <i>The Times</i> I have no great difficulty with them.  It is said these leaks were for a purpose.  A head of steam has been let off and discussion has taken place.  I would be more interested in the recent opinion poll conducted in the <i>Irish Independent</i> that showed the move among people in Northern Ireland towards recognising that things are changing and must change and that they must be part of it.</P>
    <P>I am also aware, however, that there are in circulation in the Border region in Northern Ireland, pamphlets discouraging people from rushing madly into the peace process.  I have read these pamphlets.  Peace and the movement of people towards change will not happen overnight.  There are elements in our country that believe we are not moving fast enough.</P>
    <P>We should take things carefully and slowly.  We have moved forward fast in the past five or six months at a pace that no one would have believed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision we are taking as a courageous step by the Government. I have no doubt but that further <Col N="1577" /> benefits will result.  I wholeheartedly support the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I should like to thank Minister Taylor for allowing me this time.  I too welcome the abolition of the state of emergency.  It is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to advancing the peace process and developing lasting peace here.  It symbolises the belief that the difficulties which we experienced over the past 25 years are now over.  It is a statement of confidence by the Government in its capacity, along with the British Government and with both sides of the community in Northern Ireland, to make progress towards the development of new democratic institutions that will be accepted on all sides.</P>
      <P>Over most of the recent past and, indeed, most of the period since 1939, the state of emergency was, to a large extent, a misnomer.  Throughout my life this country was technically in a state of emergency.  I cannot say that I felt a great sense of crisis or of impending doom or a sense that we were, in the words of a song, teetering on the eve of destruction.  The state of emergency was technical and legal in nature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well to remember that since 1939 the country has made enormous progress throughout that emergency.  That would not have happened if we were bordering on the edge of crisis.  The social cohesion which was needed for that process, the capacity of people here to develop ideas which underpinned the progress, could not have happened if we were in a state of emergency amounting to crisis.  It is as well, too, to recall that it was a much different world when the state of emergency was declared in 1939.  Europe was about to engage in a terrible war which wrought the most awful carnage throughout Europe in which many Irish people from both North and South became involved.  The world has moved on and tremendous changes have taken place.  The micro-chip had not been discovered then, nor <Col N="1578" /> had DNA.  The telecommunications revolutions had not taken place.  The information technology highway that we all talk about, even if we do not understand it, was not in existence.  Europe has made tremendous progress.</P>
    <P>This country must learn not just from the capacity of the Europeans to put their wars behind them but from their commitment to building peace and their capacity and ability to found institutions which are adequate to prevent war and develop and sustain peace.  That is the great message of hope that has come from the history of Europe of the past 25 years.  It is great that this country is a part of this European movement and finally on the brink of putting an end to all our difficulties.</P>
    <P>I welcome the end of the state of emergency which was largely symbolic but nonetheless important because we are now declaring an end to it.  That indicates clearly that we have the confidence to believe that we are into a period of lasting peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Members in welcoming the ending of the national emergency which has existed since 1976.  Regardless of whether one describes it as a misnomer it is, nonetheless, an historic and extremely important occasion.  The 25 years of horrific violence on this island has now happily ended, I sincerely hope for good.  In this context, the removal of section 31 of the Broadcasting Act was the first welcome step and the next step the House will ultimately have to consider will be the question of the continuation of the Special Criminal Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one goes back in history one understands why it is embedded in the Irish spirit the desire that a person be tried by jury.  Under British rule, summary trials, detention without trial, packed juries, corrupt judges and prosecutors were the order of the day and naturally with the coming of Irish independence and the birth of the new State, the feeling was that if an individual transgressed he should be at the mercy of his own <Col N="1579" /> countrymen to decide his guilt or innocence. By tradition, most people would naturally prefer the option to be tried by jury, nonetheless &mdash; and unfortunately &mdash; we have seen in recent times why the Garda authorities and the Government might wish to continue the Special Criminal Court for the time being.  Because of the activities of organised gangs in society involved not only in major robberies but in drug trafficking, it is feared that the intimidation of juries could become a feature of our justice system and that the ordinary courts would not be adequate to secure the effective administration of justice.  If that is the conclusion we come to we must be mindful of the parallel in the North.</P>
    <P>The Diplock courts are undesirable and something we should like to see ended.  If in the future we are to argue logically for the termination of the Diplock courts, our argument would be weakened by continuing with the Special Criminal Court in our jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I believe the time is fast approaching when we will have to introduce radical legislation to deal with organised crime. Last week I outlined some of the proposals which our party would like to see put in place in due course.  In the final analysis I would seek to give the Garda the necessary armoury through additional resources and personnel and more effective legislation rather than see the Special Criminal Court continue as part of the judicial system in a democracy of a civilised society at peace with itself and with one another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for giving me some of his time.  This is an historic day and I congratulate all concerned in bringing it about.  A few weeks ago, the Leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Bertie Ahern, could walk down <Col N="1580" /> the Falls Road and other areas of Belfast which had been antagonistic to Nationalists for many years.  Last night was another historic occasion when Ken Maginnis appeared so relaxed on the television programme &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo;.  Mr. Gerry Adams can walk in the streets of this country and of England and that is something new.  We can be proud of this achievement because we are a relatively new nation founded on the ashes of a civil war.  We have had stability in every area and our record as a new nation is good.  Other nations founded in this century have experienced turbulent and difficult times and have had two or three civil wars.</P>
      <P>We can be proud of our maturity in handling our affairs.  We have made economic strides that have not been seen in other parts of the world.  We have accumulated wealth because of our hard work and good Government and not because of our natural resources.</P>
      <P>Emigration was one of our greatest difficulties and created an imbalance in the community.  We have survived the many hundreds of thousands of people leaving our shores to find prosperity in another land.  We have had other difficulties but we can be proud that we live in de Valera's island.  He was a far seeing man and his Constitution enable us to achieve the success we enjoy.</P>
      <P>Many people would say that the national emergency introduced in the 1930s was a draconian measure but there were many reasons for its introduction: among them a world war.</P>
      <P>I would like to see a change in the Offences Against the State Act, another draconian measure.  If we want to be a free people and identify with all the great national traditions we need to look seriously at this again.  I think the climate is probably right for a review or relaxation of that Act.  It is important also to consider the release of prisoners, not alone in this jurisdiction but in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.  Many people have been in jail for a long number of years and it is important to review the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1581" /> There have been great changes in the past 18 months and an historic breakthrough has taken the gun off the streets.  There is a great difference between the criminal and the person with a nationalist belief.  I think we need to look again at the right to silence in the criminal code and we need to introduce legislation in that area.</P>
    <P>I thank the Tánaiste sincerely for giving me time to contribute to the debate on this historic day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Members for their contributions to this evening's debate.  The proposal to bring to an end the national emergency resolved by the Dáil to exist on 1 September 1976 is a matter of considerable national importance.  The careful and serious contributions by Deputies to this debate indicate that the significance of this step is well understood.</P>
      <P>The Government programme&mdash;<i>A Government of Renewal</i>&mdash;makes clear that the Government's primary task over the next three years will be to consolidate progress towards peace and reconciliation on this island.  It is in that context that the Government indicated its intention to expedite the lifting of the state of national emergency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Taoiseach indicated in his contribution the declaration of a national emergency was made in very particular circumstances at a time when the institutions of the State were under direct challenge.  The horrific murder of the British Ambassador, Sir Christopher Ewart Biggs, and of Ms Judith Cooke and other violent incidents at that time created widespread alarm to which the Government of the day felt obliged to respond.  While the previous state of emergency had remained unrevoked for many years, it was nevertheless always understood that a procedure of this type, by its very nature, should be temporary and should be lifted as soon as circumstances would permit.  Indeed the decision after one year not to renew the main operative section of the Emergency Powers Act, 1976 ensured that, in <Col N="1582" /> practical terms, the consequences of the state of emergency were of very limited duration.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps a measure of the distorting effect of the campaigns of violence that while they continued there was a general reluctance to move to end the state of emergency, lest such a move be misinterpreted as signalling a weakening of our opposition to violence.</P>
    <P>As Deputies have recognised, the situation has changed dramatically since the announcement by the Provisional IRA on 31 August 1994 of the complete cessation of military activities and the decision by the combined loyalist military command on 13 October 1994 to cease all operational activities.  The former has been in force now for over five months.  Both ceasefires have been fully supported by the relevant organisations and have been effective in practice.  The state of armed conflict which has prevailed in Northern Ireland for over a quarter of a century and from which this jurisdiction has not been immune has been brought to a close.  The Government believes that with the ending of the threat posed by the campaigns of violence, it is appropriate that the national emergency should be terminated.</P>
    <P>We commend this step to the House both in recognition of these greatly changed circumstances and as testament of our commitment to maintain the highest levels of legal protection.  It is for this reason the Government programme indicated that the Government intends to review all legislation and court arrangements associated with the management of the conflict in the last 25 years, which was referred to by a number of Deputies.  This will be a broad and comprehensive review and will include consideration of a number of issues raised by Deputies in the course of the debate.  It will ensure that there is careful consideration of the various changes made since the present troubles began and of their relevance in the greatly changed circumstances of the present.</P>
    <P>The decision to revoke the state of <Col N="1583" /> emergency also represents a substantive response to the comment of the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations following its consideration of the report submitted by Ireland by virtue of it being a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  This is consistent with the importance Ireland attaches to the work of UN human rights monitoring mechanisms. Other issues raised by the committee to which Deputies referred will be considered in the context of the review to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>The step we are taking today is important in the strengthening of the peace process.  The Government, from the same perspective, has responded to the ending of violence and the consequent lifting of the threat to the community, by addresing the situation in prisons.  A number of prisoners have been released earlier than might otherwise be the case.  The Government has also made clear its intention to introduce, as a matter of priority, legislation which will permit the ratification of the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Prisoners.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, important that the British Government too should respond quickly and positively to the new situation created by the ceasefires.  We hope they will consider whether they need, in the circumstances which now prevail, to maintain on the Statute Book legislation which has proved controversial but which was defended on the basis of the exigencies of the situation.  The Government believe that to repeal or at least to limit substantially many of these provisions would be helpful in strengthening support for the administration of justice and would also make considerable contribution to creating a climate conducive to agreement and political progress.</P>
    <P>We have also asked the British Government to consider other steps which would be helpful in maintaining and strenghtening support for the peace process, particularly in those areas where the security presence has been <Col N="1584" /> especially intrusive.  The British authorities have made some adjustments in the months since the ceasefire.  Daytime patrolling by the British Army has been ended in the greater Belfast area, and in Derry, Newry and other centres the military presence is much reduced.  I look forward to further early moves by the British authorities to reduce the profile of the security forces and to scale back the level of deployment in line with the situation now prevailing.  I have been keeping and will continue to keep this matter under close review and look forward to discussing progress in this area with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, at our next meeting.</P>
    <P>It is hardly necessary to point out that peace means much more than the absence of conflict.  Now that the campaigns of violence have ended we must redouble our efforts to secure a lasting accommodation between all the traditions in Ireland, leading ultimately towards an agreed basis for living and working on this island.</P>
    <P>The process of political dialogue on this island must now be an urgent priority for all.  An accommodation, if it is to last, must be inclusive.  No significant grouping can be left outside the process or excluded from its results.  To secure an inclusive result we must have an inclusive process to search for it.  No political party that has the welfare of its people at heart is entitled to stand aloof from the commitment to comprehensive political dialogue.  No-one is entitled to say the necessary effort to find a solution must come only from others and not from themselves. Equally, I believe no political party should be excluded from the process of dialogue.  The search for a solution is a common goal and touches every significant group in Northern Ireland, and, indeed, on this island.  Once a democratic mandate and a commitment to exclusively democratic procedures is established all other differences are for negotiation at the table.  There is too much at stake to squabble about special admission tickets at the door or to use <Col N="1585" /> entry to dialogue as a tactical bargaining chip, one way or another.</P>
    <P>In the search for dialogue, the two Governments have responsibility to give the lead.  That is very different from imposing a solution.  It means rather supplying some creative thinking about avenues which the parties might profitably explore.  It means promoting the conditions which will enable the parties not just to come to the table, which they should do of their own accord, but to negotiate fruitfully once they are there. This is what the framework document is intended to achieve.  If that document is to serve any purpose, it must challenge all sides because a solution will be found only through significant movement on all sides.</P>
    <P>Both Governments wish to see the framework document concluded at the earliest possible moment and we are working actively towards that end. While the discussions on the document are confidential, it is fair to say that considerable progress has been made. There are, of course, a number of outstanding issues requiring further attention and consideration and I look forward to discussing these with the Secretary of State when we meet shortly.  As previously indicated, if sufficient progress can be achieved I would envisage an early summit meeting between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister which would agree and publish the document.</P>
    <P>In view of the entirely distorted nature of some of the published comments on this matter in recent days, it may be useful to emphasise that the framework document will represent the common understanding of the two Governments on the key issues which must be addressed in future talks.  As indicated previously, these include a balanced constitutional accommodation as well as new North-South structures and new East-West arrangements.  It will be a framework for discussion.  It will not be a blueprint to be imposed.  The proposals which the two Governments make in the framework document will be put to the parties for discussion. <Col N="1586" /> They will have ample opportunity to give a full and considered reaction and to defend their positions in negotiations. Agreement and consent are the key concepts.  If the lines envisaged in the joint framework document create difficulties, which they may well do on all sides, that is a matter to be sorted out in negotiations which will follow.</P>
    <P>I want to see a framework document which is fair and balanced towards both traditions and which invites each to recognise the needs of the other and to advance towards them.  That is the kind of document which the Taoiseach and I wish to see and it is the only one to which we will agree.</P>
    <P>We have witnessed a remarkable chain of events over the past few months one which for the first time in a generation offers real hope that an entirely new chapter of our history is opening for all on this island.  With the ending of the paramilitary campaigns there is now a unique opportunity to achieve progress towards an agreed settlement.  It is important that all concerned respond with imagination and goodwill to ensure that this opportunity to is exploited to the full.  There is, of course, a particular responsibility on the two Governments in this respect.  There is also a wider responsibility on political parties and others in the public arena to play their part in building confidence and trust so that, while reflecting genuine differences, communities can be encouraged to find a way of healing past divisions and of living and working together in the future.</P>
    <P>In recommending to the House that it approve the motion to end the state of national emergency, the Government is acting in pursuance of its commitment to promote and advance the peace process. In taking this step, it has had regard to the total transformation consequent on the cessation of the paramilitary campaigns of violence not only in this jurisdiction but throughout the island.  It is entirely appropriate that a measure introduced in particular circumstances of difficulty and danger and <Col N="1587" /> which was always regarded as temporary in character should now cease to have effect.</P>
    <P>We now have an opportunity to realise the goal of lasting peace to which all of us on this island have long aspired. The Government is determined to play its full part in that process.  We look forward to early completion of the framework document.  We look forward thereafter to comprehensive political negotiations getting under way as quickly as possible so that ultimately a lasting political settlement, based on agreement and consent, can be made a reality for all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>We in Fianna Fáil have tabled this motion because of the total inaction of the Government to date on this issue which has affected thousands of families and seriously threatened many livelihoods.  We have tried repeatedly here over the past two weeks to highlight the very serious problems created by these floods.  I regret to say that, so far, the Government has ignored our efforts, indeed has shown a complete lack of sensitivity to the plight of those affected by this disaster.  The Government has continuously ignored appeals from this side of the House to advance some positive proposals to <Col N="1588" /> what was a fairly devastating period and experience for people in many parts of the country.</P>
      <P>About two weeks ago we debated the issue of the Government appointing two additional Ministers of State, on which I criticised them not because of the individual Members they appointed but rather because as an afterthought, they decided that the west was very important.  I said it was an afterthought that they had appointed a Minister of State for the West, that they could have had another Minister at the Cabinet table from the West if they were so seriously concerned, that the need for a Minister of State with responsibility for the West emerged only when it was discovered that your position, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, was not available for Deputy Carey&mdash;was the commitment to the West.</P>
      <P>What I said last week has been borne out by what has happened over the past two weeks since these floods hit various areas, those worst affected being in the West, Galway and Clare in particular, the midlands and the south.  The west was particularly badly hit, to which there was no response on the part of the Government, no response whatever on the part of the Minister of State with responsibility for the West.  Was that not a glorious opportunity for the new Minister of State to prove his mettle by co-ordinating Government response to that disaster?  Was that not ready made for him?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it will afford him greater opportunity to address these problems about which I speak rather than those in relation to heritage.</P>
      <P>It appears to me, and all those affected by these floods, that the only decisive action and/or decision taken by this Government was to decide that the Office of Public Works should carry the can in this House and the Minister of State be here to reply to the motion on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment, when challenged in this House last week, informed us that he had no money for flood relief.  Yet today, appropriately enough in the circumstances, by way of another leak from Government we were informed that a relief package would be announced in tomorrow's budget.  I hope it is true as I am sure do the many thousands of people in the West and other areas affected by these floods.  I hope such a package will be announced tomorrow.  It would be my hope that the persistent attempts on our part over the past two to three weeks have borne fruit <Col N="1590" /> resulting in the Government announcing such a package tomorrow.  Perhaps the Minister of State might even be in a position to announce some of its details this evening.</P>
    <P>This disaster has shown, at a very early stage in the life of this Government, that it appears to be insensitive and immune to the plight of our people, particularly in rural areas.  I regret it has taken this party two to three weeks to get the message across to this Government that serious issues have to be addressed, that a serious problem exists, that serious losses having occurred, people having suffered substantial serious losses, not merely financial but also their homes.  Before entering the Chamber for this debate I saw a news item on television portraying two families rowing back to their homes to see them still under three feet of water, water up to the window-sills, their furniture floating around inside.  The woman interviewed said that compensation was not sufficient, that something more must be done in the long term, a matter I will address shortly.</P>
    <P>I regret very much it has taken this Government so long to grasp this message, one that everybody on this side of the House has been preaching in recent weeks, indeed one I received loud and clear more than 12 months ago when similar circumstances arose in certain areas, when the necessity to ammend our Arterial Drainage Act was impressed on me in order to take account of such flooding.  That message has only just got through to this Government.  I wonder why.  How has it become so comfortable so soon?  Is it so isolated and protected by its £3 million-worth of programme managers, advisers, special assistants and so on that it has become totally immune to the plight of so many of its citizens?  I hope that is not true but the initial evidence in this respect is extremely disturbing.</P>
    <P>We have seen thousands of acres of land under water, livestock isolated and lost, fodder and feedstuffs contaminated and destroyed in many rural areas; we have witnessed families, not just in rural <Col N="1591" /> areas but in urban areas also, forced out of their homes; we have witnessed people unable to walk the streets of their towns because of flooding and during all this time, we have witnessed Government inaction, even worse, Government indifference.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government tomorrow, or perhaps this evening&mdash;I hope the Minister of State will receive some compensation for having lost so much of his portfolio&mdash;will produce a relief package. It will have to be very substantial to meet the needs of the farming community in certain areas who have lost so much.  I will leave it to my colleague, Deputy Cowen, to deal with agriculture, but people in that area must be compensated.</P>
    <P>I want to address briefly a serious problem that has arisen in certain parts of the country as a result of the heavy rains, floods and frost, the destruction of many county and regional roads which are now impassable and have been almost washed away.  I want to put down a marker tonight that I am seriously concerned about the commitment of this Government to county and regional roads.  The Estimates did a good job concealing that the amount of money allocated for county and regional roads is substantially down, by as much as 20 per cent, on last year.  Whatever package in respect of roads is announced in tomorrow's budget, the Government must restore the amount allocated for county and regional roads, increase that allocation in line with the 6 per cent increase on last year's figure provided in other sections of the Estimates and make an allocation in respect of serious storm damage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I know from where it came.  It was very wisely spent and I hope the money collected from the taxpayer this year will be equally wisely spent; I hope it will not be spent before it has been collected.</P>
      <P>I advocate the provision of emergency funds to alleviate the plight of the many people affected by floods as an immediate solution.  We must plan for such matters on a longer term basis. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and farming organisations should set up a disaster fund in conjunction with the EU to relieve hardship caused by, for instance bad weather&mdash; which can result in crop losses, etc.&mdash; and other disasters.  Last year the livelihood of many potato farmers was put in jeopardy as a result of heavy rains.  If such a fund were set up many problems could be solved and many hardships addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to urban flooding, I believe the solution lies in the speedy amendment of the Arterial Drainage Act.  When I left office the amending Bill was at an advanced stage in the Office of Public Works; it was with the Department of Finance.  I hope the Minister and the Minister of State will expedite it; I was pleased that last week the Taoiseach eventually gave a commitment to expedite it.  That measure which would facilitate the relief of urban flooding would allow more targeted drainage works.  That would be of enormous assistance in dealing with the type of flooding we have been in the past few weeks.  The day of the large arterial drainage scheme is over and I do not believe such schemes will be set up again because of the cost benefit analysis which must be carried out in respect of them and EU policy which dictates that we set aside land and so on. I do not envisage the Exchequer expending money on large arterial drainage schemes to make land more viable when the EU is paying out money to have land set aside.  For that reason I believe the Arterial Drainage Act must be amended to allow the continuation of arterial drainage works to <Col N="1593" /> relieve urban flooding and flooding in specific areas, such as areas in Deputy Nealon's constituency in Sligo where there is a serious problem and other such areas.  I ask the Minister of State to introduce legislation to amend the Arterial Drainage Act as a matter of urgency.  He will have support from this side of the House for that legislation which was ready to be introduced before the previous Government left office.</P>
    <P>Action needed to be taken last week to deal with this problem; better late than never.  If today's lead is accurate, I am glad Fianna Fáil's decision to put down this motion tonight prompted the Government to wake up to its responsibilities and to take action.  I am glad the message has got through to a Government whose Ministers and Ministers of State are largely urban based, that it should recognise that there is a rural community and they have a responsibility to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Like my colleague, Deputy Dempsey, I want to underline that we are dealing with an emergency. References were made today to emergencies in this country, but we are dealing here with an emergency resulting from flooding.  The flooding was very serious in many areas, particularly in the West and my constituency of County Clare.  There has been much frustration in the county not only about the nature of the problem but about the manner of dealing with it.  As Members are aware, it is not just a question of one Department dealing with the issue of flooding. Responsibility can be divided among the Office of Public Works, the Department of the Marine, the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Department of the Environment, local authorities and sections of the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My constituency has suffered tremendously over the past two weeks.  In Ennis, where I live, not only has the business community suffered, particularly the area surrounding Parnell <Col N="1594" /> Street and the Mill Road, but many residences have been flooded in Fergus Park which is near my home.  The frustration and anxiety caused by the flooding not only to the elderly but to younger people who have put all their financial resources into their homes cannot be discounted by this Government. The Minister is only too well aware of the serious problems facing the people in Sixmilebridge in County Clare.  The people had to deal with a flooding problem on three occasions before Christmas and had to put up with water and sewage flowing into their houses. Many of those people then had to leave their homes, particularly those who live on the Limerick Road, and seek accommodation with friends and relatives.  I know the Minister is well aware of the problem and I thank him for taking the time to meet those people.  I am sure he appreciates the urgent need for a relocation of a sewerage plant in the area and recognises that a similar plant must be set up in another location to deal with the needs of a growing population within the Sixmilebridge area.</P>
    <P>Ennis and Sixmilebridge are not the only areas affected by flooding; Newmarket and particularly north Clare were badly affected.  The approach to Corofin from Ennis was flooded in a number of places.  Leaminagh, New Quay, Tuber and Boston were also badly affected; much of Tuber and Boston are still under water.  We may be given the excuse that this is partly due to the geological make up of the area, the limestone and the lakes, the turloughs etc.  Such physical characteristics add to the problem but there were no fewer than 65 road closures in north Clare alone during the past two weeks due to flooding and that does not take account of the great difficulties facing our agricultural community.</P>
    <P>As I am sure the Minister is aware, many problems will arise in respect of fodder and livestock and getting the land back into proper condition.  This will mean not only great financial hardship but will be a cause of concern to farmers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1595" /> Deputy Dempsey referred to the condition of the roads.  I echo his concern at the substantial decrease in the allocation for regional and county roads in the Estimates.  I hope the road repairs which are necessary following flood damage will be recognised and that money will be forthcoming.  The raising of the roads because of flooding will cost millions of pounds in County Clare alone.  Not only must the problem be recognised but there must be practical application to eradicate the problem once and for all and this can be done only by the provision of substantial funding to assist local authorities in their work.</P>
    <P>The Minister may not be aware of the extensive damage done in Ennis because of the flooding of the River Fergus.  I understand there has not been flooding of that magnitude since 1962, and prior to that time there had not been such flooding since 1947.  Immediate drainage work is required.  I hope the Minister will take this opportunity to ensure that the Fergus catchment area is reviewed.  The population of Ennis has trebled since the 1940s and, obviously, much maintenance work needs to be carried out.  During the recent flooding the tidal traps were out of action and this caused major problems. To emphasise the seriousness of the matter it is necessary to point out that the average rainfall is 40 to 50 inches per annum and that 12 inches of rain fell in both December and January last.</P>
    <P>Last night I visited areas of my constituency to see the problem first hand. The people in Fergus Park in Ennis are particularly concerned because the bank of the river needs to be built up.  I am told that the next spring tide will occur on 28 February.  If the Minister saw the condition of the 20 houses in that estate he would realise that immediate action needs to be taken not only to protect property but also to protect life.  I emphasise that money is needed to pay compensation.  While some families were lucky enough to have insurance <Col N="1596" /> cover others were not.  However, insurance cover will not resolve the problem because one can imagine how difficult it will be for those families to secure insurance cover again and, if they do, the price of their premium may be out of their reach.</P>
    <P>The flooding in Clare has caused great heartache not only for people in their homes and business but also for the farming community.  Clare County Council will be sending a submission to the Department which I hope will get not only a sympathetic hearing but will secure practical and immediate financial aid, the importance of which I cannot over emphasise.  The Minister may be able to get financial assistance from the European Union.  There is no doubt other countries throughout Europe which have also been affected by the recent high rainfall will seek financial aid from the European Union and I hope such aid will be made available.  I was pleased to hear a package may be made available, something which may have been encouraged by the tabling of this motion.</P>
    <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Dempsey that there is an immediate need to amend the Arterial Drainage Act, and I hope the Minister takes action in that regard.  I remind him that not only are we talking about financial damage to premises, land and homes but also the psychological effects this damage has had on many people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and support the strong arguments put forward by Deputies Dempsey and de Valera.</P>
      <P>The recent flooding was so bad that even our national and primary routes were affected.  The N17&mdash;made famous by the Saw Doctors&mdash;was impassable at Castlegar, a few miles from Galway city.  People using the road had to divert through the Ballybrit Racecourse to gain access to Galway city.  The flooding of one of our national routes brought home to me the seriousness of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1597" /> I support the proposals to endeavour to obtain emergency funding to compensate for the extensive losses incurred by rural communities as a result of the severe flooding.  I have never seen the roads in my parish and local village in such bad repair.  This was caused by flooding from heavy rain and melting snow in the Galway region in the past few weeks.  If it were not for the work of the engineers and staff of Galway County Council, the Mount Bellew fire brigade and the local people who removed water with pumps and tanks, the position would be much worse. What happened in my village was repeated in many areas throughout County Galway.</P>
    <P>I have never seen people so angry, particularly those in the farming sector, because of a lack of a co-ordinated plan at local level.  All we were told was that Galway County Council would do its best and it did that even though it was short of money.  We were told&mdash;and I am sure we will be told again tonight &mdash;that priority is not given to drainage matters at European Union level.  The opposite is the case.  There is a movement towards setting aside land and we are told that the position may not improve.  While I accept the position in regard to arterial drainage, it is important that each local authority has the necessary funding to deal with the serious problems that have arisen as a result of the recent flooding.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, on his recent appointment. I am glad he visited County Galway to see the position for himself.  I welcome the fact that on his visit to Gort he promised legislation in this area.  Farmers are very annoyed at the new cultivation systems being used by the forestry authorities and I have been told that such cultivation methods in the south Galway area are contributing to the speed at which water is running into the lawlands.  Some farmers consider that too many dykes and drains are used and the flow of water has speeded <Col N="1598" /> up adding to the problems in south Galway. Farmers have told me that the fertilisers used by Coillte is generating algae which is disrupting the flow of water.  Will the Minister investigate these matters and perhaps he can tell us if this is so?  As the Minister of State is aware from his visit, there has been very serious flooding in south Galway not only in recent weeks but for years.</P>
    <P>Because there is no priority for drainage in the Office of Public Works we have to talk about priority for the families who have suffered losses due to the flooding.  In Galway many families who had to leave their homes have not yet been able to return as they area waiting for the flood water to recede.  Galway County Council, the fire brigade and the civil defence used every available pump to try to resolve the problem which will become even more serious in the future if action is not taken.  Galway County Council distributed sand bags.  This is the first time I have seen so many sand bags used to protect people whose businesses or homes were threatened by flooding.</P>
    <P>The Irish Farmers' Association proposed that drainage grants be introduced in County Galway where it is estimated that in excess of 10,000 acres of land was under water when the flooding was at its worst.</P>
    <P>Our motion calls for emergency funding. A similar fund was established in 1990 by the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy O'Kennedy.  I hope the Minister for Finance will announce a similar type fund tomorrow.  There have been many leaks about what type of funding will be announced.  If I recall correctly, a former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, introduced a fodder scheme in the mid eighties.  We would like to know as soon as possible if a fund will be established by the Government and the position in regard to the legislation promised by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Hogan, during the course of his visit to counties Galway and Clare.</P>
    <P>There is a great fear about the effect <Col N="1599" /> on the soil of long lasting pollution due to the recent flooding and the various substances deposited on people's lands and in the villages and towns of Galway. The sad fact is that farmers who had cattle indoors for months had to release them on to unsuitable land because the slatted houses and sheds were flooded. In many instances farmers had to sell a large part of their herds.  I appeal for special help for such farmers particularly where fodder stocks are used up and more will be needed during the coming months.</P>
    <P>The rivers Clare, Dunkellin, Shiven, Suck and Shannon burst their banks and flooded hundreds of acres of land.  It is probable that the Minister of State saw some of those areas during his recent visit to Galway.  Now is the time to put together this action plan and the necessary funding for the farming community. Like other local authorities, Galway County Council has submitted an application to the Department for funding. Galway is the second largest county so obviously we now have a huge road structure in a state of disrespair, many of the problems resulting from the recent bad weather.  I hope the Government will respond positively to the submission from Galway County Council.</P>
    <P>We have had a good response from the staff of local authorities, the ESB, the fire brigade and voluntary organisations, such as civil defence but tonight we would like to hear the Government response.  It is feared there will be a cutback in road spending and that Galway County Council who has devoted moneys to keeping roads open and repaired will suffer a cutback in funding.</P>
    <P>We need a response from the Government.  It has been a traumatic time for families.  In some houses carpets, furniture and bedding had to be removed, there was serious damage to heating systems, sockets and wiring, kitchen units were ruined and clothes were destroyed.  The response of the Government cannot be: &ldquo;Sorry, we have no money&rdquo;.  I would like to hear a more positive response this evening.</P>

      <P>I welcome this further opportunity to draw the Minister's attention and that of the House to the damage caused by the recent floods and to urge him, as my colleagues have done, to make financial provision to compensate the people and to ensure, in so far as possible, that further damage is not done.</P>
      <P>I had the opportunity to address the House on the Adjournment on 1 February last and to hear the response of the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin.  The people who heard the response were extremely disappointed. I searched for positive signs in the Minister's response and perhaps I can lay them before the Minister of State in the hope that he will take positive action on foot of them.  The Minister said he did not have any direct responsibility but indicated that the health boards could be of assistance to householders.  Will the Minister of State urge his colleague, the Minister for Health, to ensure that adequate and generous funding is made available under housing aid for the elderly and supplementary welfare allowances? Some of the people the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Hogan and I have seen, particularly in Sixmilebridge, will need substantial financial aid.  The Minister also mentioned that the local authorities are unable to provide temporary housing but in some cases the local authority may wish to provide permanent housing for some of these people. That matter ought to be constructively examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of roads is one of enormous concern to all county councils and county councillors.  It is not possible to raise the matter of national roads with the Minister any more because responsibility has been passed on to the National Roads Authority, which is even more remote from elected Members.  In County Clare one national secondary road has been closed for approximately a month and was closed for about 50 days last year.  The members of a household are confined to <Col N="1601" /> their homes unless they escape through the fields.  Clearly the county council cannot respond in this instance, whereas the National Roads Authority most definitely could.  I urge the Minister to ensure that provision is made in respect of that area in New Quay, in north Clare.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Kitt said, there was a huge lack of funding for regional and county roads long before the recent flooding arose.  This means that local authorities in counties Clare and Galway are not, and will not be, in a position to address the current problems.  It will fall to the Minister or to his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, or to a combination of Ministers to make provision.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to ensure that a token provision is not made as that would add insult to injury for those who have suffered in the present crisis.  A token provision in tomorrow's budget would send a negative signal, it would raise people's expectations and would not address the problem in the way we wish it to be done.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies McCormack, Nealon and Browne.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann acknowledges the extent of high rainfall over the winter months and the hardship caused to many families and communities and notes the resolve of the Government to implement measures to deal with the resultant hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputies de Valera and Kitt for their constructive comments and congratulations. I also thank Deputy Dempsey for his congratulations on my appointment and assure him that, unlike the response of the Fianna Fáil Party in 1991 and 1993 when nothing was done <Col N="1602" /> to deal with real hardship, this Government is in tune with the flooding problems that have been the subject of much scrutiny by the media and have affected many local communities in recent weeks.  The last person who should talk about the ineffective measures put forward by this Government is Deputy Dempsey because he would have been reminded of the need to amend the legislation to which he referred when an urban area around Duleek in his own county was flooded twice in 1993.  The Deputy had ample time to do something about the matter and I regret he did not take the opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to come into the House again to address the serious issue of flooding.  The Government at its meeting this morning decided to establish an interdepartmental committee to co-ordinate its response to the effects of the recent severe flooding in both urban and rural areas.  It will be my privilege as Minister of State to chair the interdepartmental committee.  The members of the committees which I am at present in the process of establishing will be drawn from all the Departments which may have a role to play to delivering an effective response to the hardships and losses sustained by a great many people in recent weeks.  It is my firm intention to ensure that the committee will be effective and will be seen to be so and that it will produce results quickly in so far as possible.</P>
    <P>I again assure the House, as I did in responding to the Adjournment debate last Wednesday, that the Government is extremely concerned at the whole range of problems experienced by people living in areas affected by the flooding in recent weeks.  Everyone will have seen the pictures in the newspapers and most graphically on television of areas covered in water, houses and business premises flooded in some cases to very considerable depths and of course sizeable areas of agricultural land inundated. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry will make an announcement in the budget debate on <Col N="1603" /> measures dealing with agriculture.  As many Deputies will be aware, I have shared the widespread concern at these recent events and I have been to several of the worst affected areas to see the problem at first hand.  Indeed as early as Monday, 9 January, I visited Newport, Cappamore, Sixmilebridge and Gort all of which were badly affected.  Last week, I visited Graiguecullen, Carlow, to see the problems there at first hand and to meet local public representatives as I had done on my earlier tour of inspection.  I am fully familiar with the problems in Kilkenny city and county.  I and my colleagues in Government have in addition been kept fully appraised of the situation around the country by Deputies and Senators from areas affected.</P>
    <P>Three fundamental problems can be identified.  The first is related to the capacity of our rivers to discharge very heavy and intense rainfall.  The second is the addition of the effect of high tides and prevailing winds on such discharges and the third relates to the unique problems of the south Galway area where the karstitic limestone with swallow holes is unable to discharge the rainfall.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided in the light of all the information available that it is necessary at this stage to have a coherent co-ordinated response to the problems now facing individuals and communities in the after math of the flooding.  The interdepartmental committee which I will chair is the vehicle which will oversee that response and co-ordinate the inputs from the various Departments and agencies which have responsibilities in this area.  Furthermore, the Minister for Finance will be outlining the position regarding the availability of funds or otherwise to deal with the problem in his budget speech tomorrow.  The House will understand that I am not in a position to give further information on this aspect of the matter in advance of the budget.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate at this stage to pay tribute to all those who have, so to speak, been in the front line dealing <Col N="1604" /> with the immediate impact of the flooding. Many people from a whole range of services have responded magnificently to meet the needs of those affected. While it is probably invidious to mention any particular group, it is only fair to acknowledge the sterling work done by the staff of the various local authorities at all levels, the Garda, the fire services, the Civil Defence Force, the Army and Air Corps and of course the invaluable assistance lent by the many friends and neighbours to their less fortunate fellows.</P>
    <P>I will turn now to the work which the interdepartmental committee will do in the coming weeks and months.  I intend to deal with the effects of the flooding on two fronts: compensation where that is appropriate and the implementation of measures to try to mitigate wherever possible the effects of flooding because of adverse weather conditions in future.</P>
    <P>On the question of compensation, I am happy to assure the House that the Government will seek funds to assist those who have suffered losses from non-insurable risks as a result of the flooding.  I intend as a matter of urgency to approach the EU Commission to seek assistance from the fund which is being established to assist victims of the flooding throughout the European Union recently.  It will be my intention through the work of the interdepartmental committee to deliver a flexible and imaginative response to the undoubted problems caused by the flooding.</P>
    <P>It is vital, in addition to dealing with the immediate aftermath of the flooding, to also take steps to try to prevent a recurrence of at least the most severe effects of flooding of the kind we witnessed in the past month.  The House will be aware that the flooding is the result of exceptionally heavy rainfall. While precise data is not yet available, preliminary returns make it clear that in many areas rainfall for January was close to or above twice the normal levels for the month.  Rivers have been unable in many cases to cope with the exceptionally large volumes of water <Col N="1605" /> which have been discharging into them, with the result that lands and premises have been inundated.  While the exceptionally heavy rainfall has clearly been the main cause of the recent flooding, it is clear that the accelerated rate of run-off of water from hard surfaces associated with development has also been a contributory factor.  The fact that in some cases houses have been built below the flood level of nearby rivers, has given rise to flooding on this and previous occasions.  We must look closely at all the factors which have contributed to the recent flooding to see what lessons need to be learned for the future.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that the Office of Public Works is empowered to undertake drainage works under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945.  This Act has always been interpreted as only conveying power to deal with drainage on a complete catchment basis.  The Arterial Drainage Act, 1945 was introduced in response to the findings of the Browne Drainage Commission which sat between 1938 and 1940.  Among its many important findings, the Browne Commission found that much of the drainage work which had been undertaken previously on a piecemeal basis merely shifted the problem from one area to another because of the failure to take account of the effect of the improvements elsewhere throughout the river catchment.  It recommended that future schemes should be designed taking into account the effect of works throughout the entire river catchment.</P>
    <P>Since the Arterial Drainage Act was enacted in 1945, a total of 40 schemes have been completed.  One scheme, the Boyle catchment drainage scheme will be closed later this year.  The major benefit from catchment drainage schemes has arisen from the improvement of agricultural land either through bringing additional land previously unusable because of the extent of flooding or waterlogging into production or increasing the productivity of land through improved drainage.  It is an unfortunate reality that the current EU <Col N="1606" /> policy of limiting or discouraging production of many agricultural products which are already in surplus in the Community has had a drastic effect in reducing the value of increased agricultural output, and as a consequence there is at present virtually no prospect of devising a catchment drainage scheme which will give a positive or even a break-even cost-benefit ratio when it is subjected to economic analysis.</P>
    <P>This difficulty is graphically illustrated by the fact that schemes recently designed for the Mulcair river in counties Tipperary and Limerick and the Arrow and Owenmore Rivers in Sligo have so far proved to be economically unviable despite the closest consultation between the Commissioners of Public Works and the local drainage action committees to ensure that all possible benefits are included in the assessment. The Commissioners of Public Works have always acknowledged that, despite the outcome of the economic analysis, there are areas within both catchments where unacceptable levels of flooding occur on a regular basis.  This point was very dramatically underlined in the most recent flooding by the problems experienced in Cappamore, County Limerick in the Mulcair catchment.  As I mentioned earlier, I saw the situation there at first hand and it is unacceptable by any standards.  Regular flooding of houses in particular is unacceptable and it will be part of the remit of the inter-departmental committee under my chairmanship to examine this problem and to devise appropriate solutions for consideration by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Commissioners of Public Works are powerless at present to undertake work for the relief of localised flooding which the most recent events have clearly shown to be necessary.  Local authorities have some statutory powers in this area, but, for a variety of valid reasons, only fairly minor schemes have been undertaken by them.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works has both the expertise and the countrywide organisation required to undertake effective schemes to alleviate the worst <Col N="1607" /> effects of localised flooding.  The Commissioners of Public Works prepared proposals for the amendment of the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, to provide them with the necessary powers to undertake work for the relief of localised flooding by rivers.  These proposals have been under consideration in the Department of Finance for some time.  I have asked the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to give early consideration to the enactment of this proposed legislation.</P>
    <P>The first thing that must be done before an effective scheme can be designed for flood defences or for any purpose is the collection of relevant data to define the nature and extent of the requirements.  The Commissioners of Public Works, as part of their existing remit, collect a sizeable amount of data at present.  Other information is available from local authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency.  The Commissioners of Public Works, in consultation with the Department of the Environment, have compiled a list of 90 urban areas which are known to experience periodic flooding.  There is insufficient data available at present in respect of many of these areas or in respect of some rural areas which are subject to flooding and where flood defence works might be an appropriate solution to enable definitive decisions to be taken or, where appropriate, designs to be prepared.  I have asked the Commissioners of Public Works as a matter of the utmost urgency to consider the steps necessary to collect the data required.</P>
    <P>I have asked the commissioners, through their regional offices, to let me have very early reports on the precise nature, extent and, where possible, the causes of the flooding in recent weeks. These reports, together with information I will be seeking from local authorities and other agencies who may be in a position to do so, will provide invaluable information to the inter-departmental committee when it commences its deliberations.</P>

      <P>It is also my intention to try to arrange early meetings with appropriate interest groups so that their views and experience can inform the deliberations of the interdepartmental committee and influence the actions that will be taken by the various Departments, offices and agencies to deal with the consequences of the flooding.</P>
      <P>I am realistic enough to know and appreciate that given the complexities of the problems now facing us there will be areas where we may be able to offer little or no assistance.  There may be other areas where we will not be able to meet the full aspirations of individuals, communities or interest groups.  We may even have to grapple with conflicts of interests as our work progresses.  At this stage, I simply want to assure the House and every one who has suffered hardships as a result of the flooding that the Government is concerned about the problems that exist and is anxious to respond to them as effectively as possible. It will be my task, and that of all the Departments participating in the interdepartmental committee, to try to find solutions that will reflect the deep sense of care and concern which we feel and which will at the same time be prudent and realistic while also being speedy, flexible and not unduly restrictive. It is a very complex, multifaceted and difficult task we are undertaking but I am confident that with the full backing and support of the Government we can achieve worth-while results for the victims of the flooding.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Nealon and Browne. I support the amendment moved by the Minister of State.  I wish to outline the serious problems and hardship caused <Col N="1609" /> by the severe and frightening flooding in the south Galway area.  I am very familiar with this area and the problems associated with the flooding there over many years.  In recent years the flooding there has got worse and at present it is much worse than it was during the peak flooding period 1990-91.  This evening a landowner from the area told me that the highest water point is now three and a half to four feet higher than it was in 1991.</P>
      <P>The problem in this area is unusual in that the major flooding occurs in five or six areas.  The overflow from Coole Lake has isolated 40 houses in the Killamoran, Ballinasteigue, Garryland and Hawk Hill areas.  The people in those areas have no access to their houses and some families have had to be evacuated from their flooded homes.  The flooding also spreads as far as Kiltartan, where the church is flooded, Ballyaneen and Ballylee.  It also backs up further to Loughawadda in the Peterswell area and Grannagh where families have had to be evacuated from their houses.  This gives an idea of the seriousness of the flooding.  The overflow from Coole Lake stretches from near Gort town at Glenbrack, where four families have had to be evacuated, to Ballinasteague which is four miles away and covers thousands of acres.</P>
      <P>There is also serious flooding at Tarmon, Fiddane and Rathope on the Clare-Galway border and several families have had to be evacuated.  On the main Gort-Galway road at Kiltiernan, Keamsella and Carragadoo the main road is blocked and eight houses in the village of Carragadoo have been completely isolated and the only access is through approximately half a mile of land which is now almost cut off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people in this area were so frustrated at having their problem ignored over the years that they decided to organise a pilot scheme to alleviate the flooding.  When I visited the area last Sunday I was shocked at the extent of the flooding and by the damage caused. Having seen the work already carried out I believe this pilot scheme will be a <Col N="1610" /> success.  I will endeavour to have their efforts recognised and to have grant-aid provided for this work.  Their enterprising efforts are an example of what can be done through self-help and the co-operation of farmers and landowners.</P>
    <P>There is further flooding in the Cregeclare and Labane areas, at Rashane and Carrigian, where there is serious flooding, and at Roo and Tierneevan. The flooding is mainly caused by the Derrybrien river and the Cloon river between Peterswell and Ballylee. The Cloone river goes underground at Ballylee near Thoor Ballylee.  This is a feature of the terrain in south Galway &mdash; rivers suddenly disappear underground and rise again in other locations.</P>
    <P>The severe flooding is usually blamed on two factors.  Some people blame new developments and forestry on the mountains in the Derrybrien area, and believe that the new drainage structures in that area have led to water flowing down much more quickly to Gort and the surrounding areas.  Another theory is that farm reclamation and the use of more plastic in farm activities &mdash; plastic bags, plastic silage bale covers and plastic silage pit covers &mdash; has led to some swallow-holes which previously took the water being closed up.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for responding so quickly to my request and for visiting the area on 9 January.  I assure the people of that area that I will give him an update of developments on a daily basis.  The problem is much more serious now than when the Minister visited the area on 9 January, and he is fully aware of that.  I have been impressed by his determination to do something about this problem.  He is a son of the soil and he fully understands the hardships being suffered by the people in this area.  I also thank the county council and local farmers who have helped people in trouble.  When the farmyard and silage pit of one farmer was flooded his neighbours looked after and fed his cattle until the flood waters had receded.  These heroic efforts should not go unnoticed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1611" /> I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, has given a commitment to amend the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, to allow relief work be carried out. I hope that in the budget tomorrow the Minister for Finance will provide an allocation to deal with the problem.  I am aware that the Minister of State will be inundated with requests from all over the country but I will be fighting the case of the people I represent &mdash; this is the way the democratic system works.</P>
    <P>If we receive the co-operation of landowners, the local authorities and the Office of Public Works we can solve this problem.  I understand that the land around Kinvara and Ballinderreen in South Galway, where the flooding can be frightening, is between 17 and 30 feet above sea level.  People like me will not allow the Minister of State to rest until a solution is found.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">

      <P>During the past few weeks we have all seen on television the damage caused by flood waters throughout the country.  Sligo did not figure on this occasion, not because there was no flooding but because there were no cameras.  Sadly, the floods were just as bad and damaging as those in Carlow, Galway, about which we have just heard, or along the Shannon.  We also had our quota of swamped houses with the flood waters in places lapping against the duvets in the top bedrooms. Unfortunately, this is not news in Sligo.</P>
      <P>In the Owenmore and Arrow catchment areas there are floods in the middle of the summer each year, not just in an exceptionally bad year.  They cover 29,000 acres of land and a total of 3,000 farmers are directly affected, mostly small farmers, whose losses each year are substantial.  The average farm size is approximately 42 acres and on average the floods last for 21 days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case for the artertial drainage of the Owenmore and Arrow has been made constantly in this House by the Sligo Deputies since 1927, the first time it was mentioned in the House.  The <Col N="1612" /> Owenmore and Arrow drainage committee has been seeking action since 1942.  As these rivers, with the Mulcair, came to the top of the list the previous Government decided to abandon arterial drainage schemes.  I understand that the only work now in progress is the completion of the work on the Boyle river.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, intends to amend the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, to enable the Office of Public Works to consider localised flood relief measures rather than comprehensive catchment schemes.  In fairness, Deputy Dempsey carried out some considerable work in this regard.  Even this limited activity could be of enormous benefit in freeing the flow of water and preventing flooding on an annual basis on the Owenmore and Arrow.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State, who has special responsibility for the Office of Public Works, to ensure that there is no delay, that the legislation is introduced quickly and to then tackle the Owenmore and Arrow which are at the top of the list with the Mulcair.  The machines are available as they are no longer needed at the Boyle river and farmers have been waiting a long time to see the dredgers on the horizon.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister of State on taking prompt action and providing compensation.  On the question of legislation I am tremendously encouraged. The Minister of State said he had asked the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance to give consideration to the early enactment of this proposed legislation. When a Minister of State makes such a statement it means &ldquo;it is done&rdquo;.  If he delivers on his commitment we might erect a statue of him at Temple House in the Owenmore Basin above high water level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> If the Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, can rescue us in Carlow, I can save him the bother of travelling to Sligo; he can take a shorter trip to see a statue of himself on Graiguecullen bridge.  Today <Col N="1613" /> there were references on several occasions to the leaks about the budget. Unfortunately, we witnessed the greatest &ldquo;leak&rdquo; of all time during the past few weeks.  As a result many people, including farmers, homeowners and business centres have been placed at a tremendous disadvantage.  While we are lucky to have a direct line to Ministers what we really need is a direct line to God.</P>
      <P>The town of Carlow has been flooded on three occasions since 1990.  There had been no serious flooding on the river Barrow between 1947 and that date, a gap of almost 50 years.  It is obvious that something has gone wrong in terms of arterial drainage works; we may have put the cart before the horse in the sense that drainage works have been carried out upstream with the result that water is draining into the river more quickly and flooding Carlow, Leighlinbridge and Graiguenamanagh. This matter needs to be tackled and I suggest that dredging could be of enormous help.  If such work was carried out many people in Carlow could sleep more easily.  We should seek EU funding to enable the Office of Public Works carry out major drainage work on the Barrow to prevent a recurrence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope also that the rumours are true, that tomorrow there will be good news for those who suffered and they will receive compensation.  Because of their geographical location and the fact that there was flooding in the past many cannot obtain insurance cover with the result that they are in a difficult position. Action needs to be taken and we need to plan for the future; prevention is always better than cure.  The Minister of State, with the Office of Public Works and the Department of the Environment, should ensure that a proper drainage system is put in place to prevent flooding in Carlow where, apart from the problems caused for homeowners and businesses, flood waters have blocked the link road between Rosslare and the west.  Until the bridge we have been seeking for many years is built traffic to the west will have to use <Col N="1614" /> this route.  When there is flooding detours are necessary.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister of State will continue his good work, take preventative measures and provide compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted that this matter is being discussed as I do not think anyone fully realises the extent of the damage caused by the recent spell of bad weather.  I was surprised that the Opposition had to table a motion to have the matter discussed in this House. Last week efforts were made to have it discussed as a matter of urgency but time was not provided for a debate. It is a matter of regret that we had to wait until this week but I hope, following this debate, action will be taken to alleviate the hardship caused by the flooding and storm damage in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>During the recent Packard dispute there was reference daily on news bulletins to its effects.  In that instance the livelihoods of a large number of people were at stake and, rightly, it was at the top of the news agenda.  However, the total number of livelihoods now in jeopardy as a consequence of the recent flooding and storm damage is equal in number and I hope the Government will give it the same priority.</P>
      <P>Many people are suffering because their homes have been flooded and personal household goods have been destroyed at huge financial cost.  As pointed out by previous speakers, people living in areas prone to flooding find it almost impossible to obtain insurance cover.  For the farming community the problems are equally grave.</P>
      <P>In many cases we are talking about the household damage and, in addition, severe loss of livestock, fodder, etc.  I will return to this subject later.  It is of great importance that any measures to be introduced should be comprehensive in nature and should look to the total recompense of people who, through no fault of their own, suffered serious loss due to the recent flooding and storm damage.</P>

      <Col N="1615" /> Ba mhaith liom aird an Aire a dhíriú ar fhadhb atá thar a bheith trom chúiseach ar chósta Chonamara, is é sin an dochar a rinne na stoirmeacha do bhóithre, do bhallaí, nó do chlaíocha mar a thugaimid orthu, agus an damáiste ar fad atá déanta don talamh ar fad atá le cósta.  Tá dochar déanta ar na céannaí agus tá áiteanna le cósta go bhfuil an t-uafás dochair déanta, dochar nach bhfuil aon chaint air.</P>
    <P>Rud amháin is féidir glacadh leis; bhí a fhios ag na feirmeoirí fadó céard a bhí á dhéanamh acu agus ar an ábhar sin is féidir leat glacadh leis áit ar bith go bhfuil na claíocha tógtha i ndeisceart Chonamara nach áit é go h-iondúil go dtéann an fharraige.  Tá scéalta, agus tá sé feicthe againn fhéin, an damáiste a rinne na stoirmeacha le cúpla seachtain anuas ar an dreapa talúna le cósta.  Tá claíocha leagtha leis an gcósta ar fad ag síneadh ó Chathair na Gaillimhe siar go Carna agus siar ó thuaidh ansin go Béal an Chaoláire Rua.</P>
    <P>Tá gá le scéimeanna speisialta leis na claíocha a thógáil, leis na garraithe a ath-thógáil.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfaighaimid scéal ó na húdaráis nach fiú na garraithe seo a shábháil mar nach bhfuil ann ach garraithe beaga ach do na daoine lena mbaineann sé leo is garraithe tábhachtacha iad, is cuid dá gcuid talúna iad agus is é an t-aon talamh amháin atá acu agus is é an t-aon talamh amháin a bhéas acu.  Mar sin, tá gá le scéimeanna a réiteadh an fhadhb seo do na daoine agus a chuireas caoi uair amháin eile ar na ballaí atá leagtha, ar na céanna atá leagtha agus ar na bóithre go bhfuil damáiste déanta dhóibh.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith aird an Aire Stáit a dhíriú go speisialta ar fhadhbanna atá ag éirí go mór ar na hOileáin Árain, áit a bhfuil creim na costa go síor-leanúnach ag déanamh an t-uafás dochair agus áit go bhfuil an-contúirt ann, munandéanfaí rud éigin go luath, go scriosfar pé beag talún atá ag cuid mhaith de na feirmeoirí atá ar na h-oileáin.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to consider a remedial package for the Connemara area that would protect the needs of the <Col N="1616" /> farming community there.  It is important that special schemes be introduced to reinstate the piers, roads and all the other infrastructure that have been damaged.  In addition, serious damage has been done to the stone walls that bound the fields in those areas and many boulders have been thrown up on the land.  There is need for remedial action in this case.</P>
    <P>In that context, I was disappointed to receive a reply from An Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta, ar a bhfuil tú fhéin mar Aire Stáit inniú, saying that in regard to storm damage and coastal erosion, the Department of Arts, Culture and and the Gaeltacht has no function in the Gaeltacht in relation to remedial works.  That was a most disappointing reply and I hope the Minister of State can influence the Minister to reconsider that policy.  This matter is intimately related to the functions of the Department and I hope that an issue which is very close to the hearts of the people of the Gaeltacht will be readdressed.</P>
    <P>On the general issue of coastal erosion being caused by storm damage, we must have a comprehensive plan.  I understand a small amount of EU funding has been made available for coastal erosion and I am aware that Galway County Council has made some submissions in this regard.  That plan, however, falls far short of the problem. I accept that the money available is limited but it is important that comprehensive plans are drawn up to ensure that coastal erosion is prevented.  I accept the sea will not be held back in every area but where this is not possible it is important that a scheme be instituted whereby people who are losing land on a yearly basis through coastal erosion would be compensated for the loss of that land.  To those people the loss of the land means the loss of their livelihood and to date no compensation has been given to them.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the specific area of Gort; my colleague, Deputy McCormack, has already spoken about this area.  I wish to put on the record the <Col N="1617" /> scale of the damage we are facing in this area.  From figures given to me, I understand that more than 60 houses in that area were flooded, 40 roads were closed, and 34 are still flooded; the land of 400 farmers has been flooded and 200 farmers have lost fodder.  I will give an example of how serious is this loss of fodder.  One farmer has had 185 bales of silage destroyed which, at £15 per bale, is worth £2,775.  To many small farmers in the West, that is an unsustainable loss.</P>
    <P>We are facing the flooding of 15,000 acres in south Galway and north Clare. It must be remembered that we are not talking about long term flooding.  One of the difficulties in this area, as the Minister of State no doubt is aware, is that the flooding will last for a considerable time because the drainage is subterranean and nobody knows when the floods will subside.  In a river bank or tidal situation, the damage can be very severe over a short period but at least the effects are not continuous whereas in the areas to which I have referred, one is dependent on a series of subterranean channels to drain the water.</P>
    <P>As the land drains in the higher areas, flooding can increase in the lower areas; in fact, the draining of one area can lead to the flooding of another.  There is a need for a package of compensation for farmers whose land will be effectively non-usuable for a considerable time to come.  I will give an example of how little the waters have receded.  A helicopter made a special flight to drop food, fuel oil and hay into the area recently.  I give credit to the Government for organising this and thank the Ministers for the action taken.  My understanding is that this will have to continue in future weeks.  This gives some idea of the scale of the damage. What is required now is a comprehensive review of the damage resulting from inability to use land, damage to houses, the loss of fodder, the problems of coastal erosion and the damage caused by boulders thrown up on the land as happened in south Connemara. <Col N="1618" /> What is needed is an urgent and comprehensive plan to deal with these issues.  I hope that we will not get a small package of aid that is selective and limited.  All the people seriously affected by storm damage and flooding should be aided.</P>
    <P>We must once again look at our policy on arterial drainage.  I welcome the Government's commitment to reviewing the Arterial Drainage Act. However, we must go further.  Large grants were given in the 1970s for land drainage and much land was drained.  In addition work was done on rivers. However, it seems to be forgotten that the effect of draining land in certain areas is not permanent and work must be ongoing.  It is wrong to think that one can drain land, streams and small rivers and think it can then be left.  I hope the Minister will look at the possibility of introducing a comprehensive scheme to drain small and large rivers to prevent the kind of flooding we have had on this occasion, some of which is avoidable whereas some is just an act of God that we have to live with.  In those cases awarding compensation is appropriate but in the other cases there is a need to review drainage policy.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom na tuillte a tháinig isteach ar Chladach na Gaillimhe agus isteach go cathair na Gaillimhe féin a lua.  Rinne siad sin an-damáiste agus tá go leor daoine sa cheantar sin nach bhfuil árachas orthu; go mbeidh cailliúintí móra orthu i ngeall ar na tuillte a tháinig isteach ar Bhóthar na Trá agus isteach sa Chladach i nGaillimh.  Tá súil agam, nuair a thiocfaidh an pacáiste atáthar ag rá linn a thiocfaidh &mdash; amárach nó arú amárach &mdash; go mbeidh na daoine sin san áireamh ann freisin nuair a fhógrófar é. Fadhb an-mhór í seo: fabhb a chosnóidh airgead.</P>
    <P>Mar a dúirt mé ar dtús, ní féidir linn dearmad a dhéanamh ar an gcineál chúiteamh a thabharfaí dá mbeadh 1,000, 1,500 nó 2,000 duine ag cailleadh a bpostanna nó dá mbeadh tithe scriosta ar bhealach ar bith eile ar an oiread sin daoine.  Mar sin, creidim go bhfuil dualgas ar an Rialtas féachaint chuige go <Col N="1619" /> ndéanfar cúiteamh a thabhairt do na daoine ar fad a chaill an oiread sin sna tuillte le gairid.</P>
    <P>Tá gá ann freisin go ndéanfar cinnte pleananna a réiteach le féachaint an bhfuil bealach ar bith, go mórmhór i ndeisceart na Gaillimhe, leis an damáiste atá á dhéanamh ag stoirmeacha le blianta beaga anuas a mhaolú.  Ní féidir linn dul ar aghaidh sa cheantar sin bliain i ndiaidh bliana le tuillte móra; le feirm-eoirí ag cailleadh airgid go trom i ngeall ar fhadhbanna atá áirithe sa cheantar sin maidir le draenáil talúna.</P>
    <P>Tá gá freisin athbhreathnú a dhéanamh ar pholasaí na Roinne féachaint le dualgais agus cúramaí maidir le creimeadh talúna agus damáiste stoirme a thabhairt do Roinn na Gaeltachta. Caithfidh mé a rá, mar dhuine atá ag cónaí sa Ghaeltacht, go bhfuil díomá an tsaoil orm go bhfuil an oiread tarraingt siar ag Roinn na Gaeltachta &mdash; an Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta mar a thugtar air anois &mdash; ó chuid de na feidhmeanna a bhí acu 20 agus 30, nuair a bhí scéimeanna beaga ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus a réitigh cuid mhaith de na fadhbanna a bhí acu. Tá cuid mhaith de na scéimeanna a thugtar isteach anois i bhfad ró-mhór agus i bhfad ró-chasta agus níl siad feil-iúnach don chineál saoil atá ag an bpobal ar an gcósta agus amuigh ar na h-oileáin.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam, nuair a dhéanfar an chás seo a scrúdú, nach ndéanfar dear-mad ar na h-oileáin ar fad ar an gcósta a fhulaingíonn go leor chuile bhliain i ngeall ar stoirmeacha agus a d'fhulaing go leor i mbliana.  Tá go leor talúna i mbaol orthu agus ní amháin talamh ach tithe, bóithre agus chuile rud eile.  Tá siad ag lorg cúnaimh, agus déanfaidh siad an obair iad féin má fhaigheann siad cúnamh, le chuid den damáiste a rinneadh a réiteach.</P>
    <P>Ar an ábhar sin ba mhaith liom tac-adh leis an rún atá curtha ar aghaidh ag Páirtí Fhianna Fáil os comhair na Dála. Creidim gur maith an rud é gur phléadh an t-ábhar seo anocht.  Chuir sé ríméad orm a fheiceáil anocht an oiread de <Col N="1620" /> lucht an Rialtais a bhfuil spéis acu san ábhar seo an tseachtain seo.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh siad in ann áiteamh ar an Rialtas beart de réir a mbriathar a dhéanamh anois; seasamh lena bhfocal agus dul agus rud éigin ceart, cóir a dhéanamh do na daoine seo ar fad agus do na daoine ar fud na tíre.  Luadh Ceatharlach agus áiteanna eile atá tar éis an t-uafás airgid agus stoic a chaill-eadh i ngeall ar an tuillte a tháing le gairid.  Creidim go bhfuil sé i lámh an Rialtais anois gníomhú ar an bhfadhb seo agus tá súil agam go ndéanfar an cás seo a réiteach agus gur pacáiste ceart iomlán a fhógrófar nuair a fhógrófar an pacáiste atá geallta.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have this brief opportunity to say something about the flooding as it affects my constituency.  My constituency has suffered over the years because of differences of opinion between Departments of State, the Office of Public Works and Clare County Council. There has been a slackening off in river and stream maintenance.  It is calculated that in the Clare constituency £2 million has been directed away from the relief of flooding through non-spending of the Fergus drainage money or the rates which Clare County Council allocated for the maintenance of our rivers.</P>
      <P>Short-term relief is necessary, as outlined in the response to this motion, but long term matters must also be addressed.  I hope the interdepartmental committee now being set up by the Minister of State will address these difficult issues.  It is necessary also that responsibility for particular areas be established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ó Cuív mentioned that the responsibility for dealing with coastal erosion should be ceded by Roinn na Mara to the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltachta.  I understand that both Departments work hand in hand.  At present Roinn na Mara is doing good work on the Aran Islannds, Inis Meán and Inisheer, putting together the Structural Funds proposal <Col N="1621" /> instituted by the previous Minister.  I do not see Deputy Ó Cuív's proposals being accepted by this committee. Nevertheless some means should be found to iron out the difficulties that have arisen.  I hope long term work will be considered by this group.</P>

    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1994, 1,770 cases of suspected child abuse were referred to the Southern Health Board, a 60 per cent increase on the previous year's figures. The increase in the number of referred cases can largely be accounted for by the heightened public awareness of the issue in recent years.  We have come to the painful realisation that child abuse and child neglect occur in all sections of society and that the problem can no longer be kept under wraps.  The squinting windows have been well and truly thrown open.  Increased reporting, however, does not mean full reporting. We probably expect the number of referrals to increase in the coming years as people become more aware of the signs of abuse and children themselves gain in confidence.  It is, therefore, vital to establish the best possible procedure to deal with this issue.  In this regard I welcome the Government's commitment to child welfare: not only has full implementation of the 1991 childcare legislation been promised but we have now a Minister with specific responsibility for children &mdash; an appointment which was long overdue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Commitment at central level, however, depends on commitment at local level, and in this regard I find last year's Southern Health Board figures especially disturbing.  It is a social and political scandal that of the 1,770 cases of suspected child abuse referred to the Southern Health Board last year, 34 cases should still be awaiting assessment. Each week's delay represents an obvious danger to the child, if he or she is, indeed, a victim of child sexual abuse. <Col N="1622" /> There is not only a danger of the abuse being prolonged, but, depending on individual circumstances, the delay may also cause irreparable emotional and psychological damage to the child.  In this regard there is a clear need for regulations stipulating the maximum time that may elapse between a case being referred to a health board and final assessment.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned at the large number of cases deemed by the Southern Health Board to be inconclusive. "Inconclusive" is the same as "not proven". The presumption of innocence is central to a civilised code of justice in any country, but in the case of child abuse we have to balance that presumption of innocence with an option for the child.  What this means, in essence, is that cases deemed to be inconclusive should still be subject to ongoing monitoring until the allegations have been adequately disproven.</P>
    <P>I am well aware that continuous monitoring of a large number of cases would place a huge burden on the health board in terms of personnel and resources.  I am also aware that such monitoring could be viewed as invasion of a family's privacy.  I would be delighted to hear alternative suggestions for dealing with the large number of inconclusive cases and I hope that, as we deal with the various issues thrown up by the child abuse crisis, children will not be used as a party political football.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the increasing number of cases referred to the health boards we have to ensure that the interests of the child are paramount.  We have to ensure also that neither children nor adults are dissuaded from reporting cases of child abuse or neglect in the future.</P>
    <P>I use the term "child abuse" in the broadest possible context.  Will the Minister tell me how many cases of child sex abuse were prosecuted last year, the number of inconclusive cases and what happens afterwards in terms of monitoring?  In cases where no legal proceedings have been taken but the cases of sexual abuse have been found <Col N="1623" /> to be conclusive, what has been the outcome and why has a case not been taken?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Lynch for raising this matter and for giving the opportunity to reply to some of the points she has raised.  I thank her also for her kind remarks on my appointment.</P>
      <P>I understand that there has been an increase in the total number of suspected child abuse cases referred to the Southern Health Board during 1994. However, the available figures for 1994 are preliminary at this stage and it is not clear how many of these reports will, on investigation, be confirmed as actual abuse.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there has been a continuing rise in the number of suspected cases of child abuse reported to the health boards in recent years. This is an inevitable consequence of the greater public awareness and understanding of the horrendous problem of child abuse and neglect.  High profile cases such as the County Kilkenny incest case have forced society to confront the reality that children are abused and have brought about a determination to tackle the problem head on.</P>
      <P>Major new initiatives have been undertaken by the health boards to improve and expand the range of services and supports to help the unfortunate victims of child abuse and neglect, and to assist children who are at risk of being abused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Deputy's question relates specifically to the situation in the Southern Health Board region, I would like to outline the important new developments that my Department has approved to strengthen the board's services for the care and protection of children. These include: the development of the board's child protection services, involving the creation of over 60 additional child care posts including psychologists, team leaders, social workers and child care workers; <Col N="1624" /> strengthening of the board's child abuse assessment unit at St. Finbarr's Hospital; the establishment of new child guidance services in Cork and Kerry, including the provision of a short-stay child assessment and treatment unit in Killarney; further development of family support services, including the provision of counselling services for men who are involved in family violence.  I might mention that initiatives of the same scale are being replicated in the other health board areas.</P>
    <P>At a national level, the Government is committed to the rapid implementation of the Child Care Act.  The Health Estimate for 1995 includes provision for additional funding of £10 million for child care services.  This will facilitate the commencement by the end of the year of Parts III, IV, V and VI which deal respectively with the protection of children in emergencies, care proceedings and the powers and duties of health boards in relation to children in their care.  These provisions will greatly strengthen the powers of the courts, the health boards and the Garda to intervene effectively in relation to child abuse and neglect.  The need for the early implementation of these key provisions was underlined in the Kilkenny incest report.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State with special responsibility for co-ordinating and implementing the Child Care Act, it is my firm intention that the legislation in its entirely will be brought into operation within the shortest timescale possible in line with the commitment contained in <i>A Government of Renewal.</i></P>
    <P>I would like to conclude by assuring the Deputy that during my term of office I shall attach special importance to the development of further initiatives and strategies to combat the incidence of all forms of child abuse.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch asked a number of specific questions about the number of prosecutions last year but I did not expect to be asked them at this stage.  I will provide as much information as I can and I will convey it to the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this important matter and I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, on his appointment. During the course of the previous debate Deputies described floods and storms but they are as nothing compared to the storm raging in Cork over the shortage of beds in Cork University Hospital.</P>
      <P>One can expect emergencies to arise during the winter season with a consequent shortage of beds but the crisis at the hospital has been ongoing since October 1994.  I should like the Minister to dwell on the inconvenience caused to patients whose operations are postponed.  He can imagine their anticipation when they arrive at the hospital and their stress and disappointment when they are turned away, not knowing when the operation will be performed. Imagine the chaos in the hospital where five day wards were turned into seven day wards with nursing staff extended to the full.  Yet they give of their best and I congratulate them for the service they have given over this time.</P>
      <P>One would have thought the crisis would have abated after Christmas but there were 40 over-bookings on Satur-day, 33 on Sunday, 36 on Monday and 25 on Tuesday.  The Minister will appreciate that opening additional wards, converting five day wards into seven day wards and providing additional staff and medical supplies has a major impact on the board's finances.</P>
      <P>From the period October to December 1994 the additional cost amounted to £192,000.  The additional services provided for January amounted to £56,000.  The cost of trying to contain the emergency in the hospital is almost £250,000 and a further £50,000 will be needed for this month.  This means the board must find an extra £300,000 over and above its budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago, Dublin city hospitals and the Eastern Health Board were allocated £500,000 to meet emergency <Col N="1626" /> services.  The Minister for Health issued a statement on 18 January in which he said that because of the emergencies in Dublin hospitals he was providing a further £850,000.  The £500,000 allocated does not form part and parcel of the board's budget.  When we consider that Dublin has received £850,000 it is only natural that we in Cork would look to the Minister to alleviate the difficulties we face.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it is only right for us to expect that the Minister of State will give a further allocation to Cork to compensate for the additional funding we have expended.  If we do not receive such funding the Southern Health Board will have to cut back drastically on some of the services it hoped to extend during 1995.  If that occurs we will hold the Minister directly responsible. In line with Dublin, the Minister should make a substantial allocation of funds to the board to help overcome the crisis which exists in Cork University Hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleague Deputy O'Keeffe in raising this matter.  He has outlined the position which has existed since last October and the demands on the service.  The cost cutting exercises in the Southern Health Board and the efforts made by the board and the hospital staff are well recognised by the Minister and the Department.  The events of the last few months place a severe strain on the board's resources and are very serious. I appeal to the Minister to look at the position and recognise the improvements made due to the efforts of the board and the management.  I ask him to respond positively, as he did in Dublin and treat all areas equally.  The postponement of operations causes great <Col N="1627" /> trauma to patients and I ask the Minister to take on board the comments made by Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for his congratulations.</P>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, I thank the Deputies for raising this matter and for giving me the opportunity to outline the position regarding the costs associated with the high level of emergency admissions to Cork University Hospital.</P>
      <P>As the Deputies will appreciate, the workload of many hospitals has increased since Christmas owing to a rise in the number of people, many of them elderly, requiring admittance to hospital because of respiratory and other seasonal complaints.  Such an increase in activity is consistent with the general pattern for this time of year.  As a result of this additional workload, there has been pressure on medical wards in particular and some delays in accident and emergency departments.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that there has been considerable pressure on beds at Cork University Hospital since early January due to an influx of emergency admissions, mostly in the medical area. To cope with the increased demand, the hospital authorities have temporarily converted a five-day ward to a sevenday ward and have opened a number of extra beds over and above the hospital's normal complement.  As is normal practice in such situations, the authorities are rescheduling elective admissions to the hospital.  I take this opportunity to stress that all urgent and emergency cases at Cork University Hospital continue to be treated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies will be aware that the Department allocates funds to each health board on an annual basis for the provision of services within its region and it is a matter for each board to determine how these funds should be distributed.  The hospital authorities have informed me that the additional cost of managing the increased level of admissions is £56,000 in 1995 to date. <Col N="1628" /> The Department will be notifying health agencies of their allocations for 1995 over the coming days.</P>
    <P>It will then be a matter for the Southern Health Board to determine the level of resources to be allocated to Cork University Hospital.  In 1994, the cost of managing the problem was £192,000 and the Minister is satisfied that the Department provided sufficient funds in that year to enable the hospital to discharge its duties.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputies that the situation in relation to emergency admissions to Cork University Hospital is being carefully monitored and that the Department is in constant contact with hospital authorities in this regard.  The Minister has been informed today by the hospital authorities that the demand for beds appears to have eased somewhat. They hope that the situation at Cork University Hospital will revert to one of normal service delivery in the near future.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Rourke gave me notice of her intention to raise the matter of giving urgent attention to the Silverlea plant in Athlone, County Westmeath, to enable it to continue in operation in order to safeguard employment there.  Deputy Paul McGrath has also given me notice of his intention to raise the matter of the need to ensure that 170 jobs at the same plant and the 50 jobs at the Silverlea saved in view of the fact that the company is now in receivership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the matters raised by Deputies O'Rourke and McGrath are similar, I suggest that each Deputy should make a statement to be followed by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment who will reply to both.  If this is acceptable, the Deputies concerned have ten <Col N="1629" /> minutes in total and the Minister ten minutes to reply.  Is that satisfactory?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will be giving one answer, so that is fine by me.  I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.  As you know, I have been knocking on your door making representations about this case in recent weeks and have finally succeeded in raising the matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>I want to thank the Minister for the ready, courteous and speedy manner in which he met our deputation, a very comprehensive one, comprised of the Athlone and Athy work people, in his offices this afternoon.  Deputy Power has asked to be associated with this request to the Minister this evening. Unfortunately he is unable to be present, as is my colleague, Deputy McCreevy.</P>
      <P>While it may be somewhat odd that we shall be repeating the case made to the Minister earlier today, one has to put one's case on the record even though it will have received a very good airing in the Minister's office earlier.</P>
      <P>The matter is very serious in that there are 170 employees in the Silverlea plant in Athlone and in excess of 80 in the plant of Athy, which firm also has had a plant located in Armagh, comprising three &ldquo;As&rdquo;&mdash; Athlone, Athy and Armagh, which are in very serious difficulty, to the extent that a receiver has been appointed to the plants in Athlone and Athy and another in Armagh.  This is a recurrence of what happened in the autumn 1991 when there was a very concerted, intense effort by all of the agencies and the receiver of the day. However, there is not the same intensity of effort now, particularly by the receiver in charge of the present operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to place on record my satisfaction and agreement at the manner in which the IDA &mdash; while I know we are not allowed refer to people by name here, the person to whom I refer was mentioned in the Minister's office earlier today, so he is aware of whom I speak &mdash; has handled the matter at that <Col N="1630" /> level.  I have had, I suppose, thrice daily contact with the IDA and the Bank of Ireland in recent months and, while I constantly berate banks, on this occasion they were patient over many weeks while solutions were being sought but not found, eventually leading to the appointment of a receiver.  Indeed there is a very tight framework within which that receivership must be concluded, nominally, Friday week, whereas in fact it is this coming Friday.  If an immediate solution is not found to the problem of gaining cloth for the firm to the tune of £200,000, thus enabling them to turn over a product for which there is a market and a buyer, undoubtedly the firm will close.  However, we must remember that cloth takes some days to order, to be delivered and got into production. As I said to the Minister earlier today, any purchaser would want to see a factory that is humming; that has a psychological effect on the workers also, but apart from that &mdash; this is not a fanciful tale I am relating but rather the real story &mdash; there are no adversarial worker/management problems.  There is no need to find a market for their product, no need for research and development, it is already there represented in the latest cutting machinery.  There is no need for the training of workers, since they are very highly trained.  There is no need for anything but the two actions I propose, that is a conduit to be found for the tiny amount of money involved in real terms &mdash; while nobody begrudges what will be given to Irish Steel in Cork &mdash; sought by the plants in Athlone and Athy.  A vehicle or conduit needs to be found whereby that money can be allocated immediately, in tandem with a very intense effort to secure a purchaser for the firm.</P>
    <P>I merely repeat our earlier appeal to the Minister.  I recognise the technical and legal difficulties in giving money to a firm in receivership but, surely there is an inventive, creative manner in which this can be done?  While recognising that there is a limit on the amount that can be allocated by the county <Col N="1631" /> enterprise boards, they are not yet governed by statute, and have greater freedom of operation.  Therefore, the limit imposed on them can be lifted in individual emergency cases.  I suggest it is done through the Westmeath and Kildare county ennterprise boards, which does not necessitate legislation, or involve illegal action, thus constituting an avenue to resolution of the present problem.</P>
    <P>I am pursuing other inquiries in this respect.  I hope that, together, we will be able to save the two very fine plants, Silverlea, Athlone and Athy.  Of course, we regret what occurred in Armagh, which we hope is not a foretaste of what will happen in the midlands and in Athlone, since neither town can afford to lose any employment.</P>

      <P>The prospect of the loss of 170 jobs in the Silverlea plant in Athlone, County Westmeath has sent shock waves through the commercial centre of that town; the loss of so many weekly wage packets from the commercial life of that town would have wide-ranging effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Athlone has a long tradition in the textile trade and many families have a long tradition of service in that industry. The loss of these jobs, through no fault of the workforce, will have a terrible effect, not just on the workers but on their families and the wider community. Silverlea came to Athlone in 1991 and experienced success there up to quite recently.  It has a very skilled, co-operative workforce, who have enabled industrial relations to be conducted on a very positive basis.  They now look to the IDA, Forbairt and the Minister to take <Col N="1632" /> the necessary action to secure some form of future employment for them.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for having met the workers and Members of the Oireachtas today at short notice and for pledging his endeavours to leave no stone unturned in securing their future jobs.  The Minister listened to the many suggestions and proposals put to him, to which I know he will respond in due course.  There are 170 established jobs involved and a ready market for their produce.  When one considers how difficult it is to create even five jobs within any setting, surely it emphasises the urgency of maintaining those jobs already in existence.  Accordingly, I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy McGrath, for sharing his time and allowing me to contribute to this important debate on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, the IDA announced that overseas companies in the midlands had performed well in 1994 by increasing the numbers employed by more than 300 people in 56 IDA backed companies. That represented the biggest increase in employment in the past five years.  It is against that background that the threat to 170 established jobs in the Silverlea company in Athlone and more than 80 jobs in Athy must be measured. I am aware that many of the 170 people employed in Athlone are the only breadwinners in families which are highly dependent on that source of income to pay their mortgages and other household bills.  Every job in a factory, such as Silverlea, directly affects three to four people in a household.  The threat of the loss of such an important source of employment can have devastating consequences.  Small businesses in the vicinity of such a factory can also suffer adverse consequences.  As Deputy O'Rourke pointed out, in Athlone there has always been a great tradition of clothing and textile manufacturing ranging from Gentex, Athlone Apparel to Silverlea.  As pointed out, there is a highly skilled and dedicated workforce <Col N="1633" /> in the company.  That and an excellent modern facility are important factors to be considered in determining the future of this important source of employment in the Athlone area.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to the IDA, SIPTU and officials in the Minister's Department and I attended a meeting with a delegation from the company to the Minister today to ascertain the current position. I have been assured that the IDA is actively pursuing the possibility of securing a purchaser for the business as a going concern and it is important on both a national and international level that it be purchased as such.  I appreciate this will not be easy given international factors involved in the clothing industry, but it behoves us to make an all out effort to ensure no stones are left unturned and that all avenues and options are explored with a view to saving jobs vital to the Athlone and Athy areas.  I urge that every assistance be given to this well established employer. A number of suggestions were put forward at the meeting with the Minister today which I hope he will explore as a matter of urgency.  We have a modern plant, excellent quality produce which is acknowledged by the large number of customers and, accordingly, good market opportunities as well as an excellent industrial relations environment in which workers are both flexible and adaptable.  I hope a buyer is found immediately to ensure that those acknowledged qualities, skills and markets are preserved and maintained for the future well-being of the areas involved.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy McGrath for sharing his time.  I share the concern of my colleagues on both sides of the House about these plants, and support their objective.  It is not the first time that the workers in Athy and in Athlone have been through the mill.  So far on previous occasions things have worked out reasonably well and our efforts should be to ensure that they work out as well, if not better, on this occasion.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the <Col N="1634" /> receiver uses every possible endeavour with the assistance of agencies under the Minister's aegis and the customers of the two plants to find a way to maintain them in operation until such time as a buyer can be found.  I know that is a difficult order, but to all of us who spoke to the Minister today it seems the most hopeful way of dealing with this matter. I would like the Minister to give an undertaking that all efforts will be in that direction.  As separate industrial units, these two plants have shown an amazing resilience through previous difficulties. Knowing the workforces in both plants we are convinced that they can do so again and that these two plants would be a viable part of a new structure put together to continue the operation.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this issue this evening and I thank them for bringing in a delegation who gave me a valuable insight into the problems at the plants. I am very much aware of the bank of considerable skills residing with the workforce and the excellent working record in both Athy and Athlone.  I am as concerned as others about the future of the plants.  I found it useful to hear at firsthand from a number of Deputies, a delegation of Silverlea workers and two Ministers of State, Deputies Durkan and Stagg, of the problems and history of this plant.  I explained to them the ongoing efforts being made to keep the company in operation.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, Silverlea has been experiencing financial difficulties since the middle of last year, unfortunately, these problems have become more acute in the past month and have ultimately led to the appointment of a receiver.  That clearly puts a considerable constraint on what the agencies can do to assist the company.  However, I am pursuing a number of suggestions made by the deputation and Deputies at the meeting today.  I hope something will materialise from our efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1635" /> I am conscious this is the second time during the past four years that the future of the company has been put in doubt.  In 1991 Athlone Apparel, which manufactured jeans and casual trousers, was put into receivership.  Silverlea Limited, a Northern Ireland company based in Armagh producing knitwear products, purchased the assets of Athlone Apparel and established Silverlea Ireland Limited as a stand alone operation to run the Athlone and Athy facilities.  During the first year Silverlea Ireland Limited operated very satisfactorly. The new company also succeeded in securing new markets in the UK and Northern Ireland and continued to do reasonably well up to 1993.  Like many other clothing companies the currency crisis in late 1992 and early 1993 presented particular problems for Silverlea, but this crisis was overcome with assistance from the market development fund.  Unfortunately, the company's fortunes changed in late 1993 when it ran into financial difficulties.  In addition, it experienced a market downturn in 1994 and this has led to a cashflow problem.  As a result Silverlea has built up a very large debt liability.  The company was unable to trade out of those difficulties and had to go into receivership.</P>
    <P>When it became clear that Silverlea Ireland Limited was experiencing serious financial problems the competitiveness and employment protection unit of my Department, in consultation with IDA Ireland, sought to explore every possibility in order to secure the continuation of the Silverlea operation in the Republic.  Over the past month or so the CEPU, IDA Ireland, the company's bankers and other interest parties have examined various options in an effort to secure the company's future. Independent expert advice was engaged also to examine all possibilities whereby Silverlea could remain in business. However, despite the best efforts of all concerned it was not possible to devise a formula which would enable Silverlea <Col N="1636" /> to continue to trade commercially.  It is, of course, very disappointing that Silverlea Ireland is now in receivership, but the receiver is endeavouring to sell Silverlea as a going concern.  I have asked IDA Ireland and Forbairt to work closely with him to achieve this objective. I am hopeful that given the commitment of the workforce and the goodwill built up over the years the receiver will be successful in finding a company interested in taking over the Silverlea operation.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of the urgency stressed by the Deputies in their contributions and I assure them that we will make every effort possible to secure the future of those jobs.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a small point, which I omitted to make earlier. The area in which the Athlone plant is sited is an attractive development on the banks of the River Shannon.  I do not want the receiver to get the impression that he could sell the site and relieve the banks of their debts but I fear that option has been or is likely to be considered. I ask the Minister to give an assurance that that option will not be taken, that the plant will remain in its present location as a viable unit and will not be sold to clear the banks' debts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 127 together.</P>
      <P>A technical working group has just reported to the steering committee on the future development of the higher education sector.  This report shows unequal participation rates at third level for young people from different social and economic backgrounds.  Overall, young people from less well off backgrounds, including the Dublin inner city, have a much lower chance of access to third-level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the available evidence indicates that the struggle against disadvantage is won or lost at first and second level.  I <Col N="1373" /> have taken a range of measures to improve and promote participation in the education system by students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  These include targeting of resources at primary and post-primary level on disadvantaged areas; the provision of educational support services for students, e.g. psychological and guidance services, career guidance, remedial teachers etc., and giving priority on the allocation of these to disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The continuing development and expansion of the home-school liaison service which is focused on disadvantaged areas; a major restructuring of the senior cycle curriculum at second level to adapt it to the needs of the wider spread of ability levels and aptitudes of students; continuing financial support for special initiatives operated by a number of third level institutions which involve linkages with post-primary schools in order to provide greater opportunities for students from the disadvantaged areas concerned to enter college; support for junior education centres for travellers; increase in disadvantaged areas fund at primary level and initiation of pre-school projects and continuing development of Youthreach to cater for the needs of children at risk of early school leaving.</P>
    <P>I await with interest the report of the steering committee which will take all these matters on board with a view to further action I might take to improve access to third level for students from Dublin north inner city and other such areas where there are similar problems of very low participation in third level education.</P>
    <P>My Department is at present undertaking a review of the educational needs of Dublin north inner city, including the Seán McDermott Street area.  The case for the provision of a second level school is being re-examined.  As the Deputy knows, the issues are complex. There are eight post-primary schools in the area and the population of children and young people of school-going age is dropping.  Some of the schools have very low enrolments and the buildings are in <Col N="1374" /> poor condition.  I do not want to prejudge the outcome of the review but the issue is broader than just deciding whether or not to build a new post-primary school.  I expect that this review will be completed shortly.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy that, in view of the special circumstances of the Seán McDermott Street area.  I am extremely anxious to expedite the provision of educational facilities which are most appropriate to the needs of the area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 23, 34 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>I recently announced my intention to expand the pre-school programme by the establishment of a further 25 pre-schools in the current year.  This will bring the total number of pre-schools in place to 32.  The objective of the early start pre-school initiative is to provide young children with an educational programme which will enhance their overall development and lay a foundation for successful attainment in future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The service is being targeted on areas of particular disadvantage.  In the case of each area selected, the intention is <Col N="1375" /> that the pre-school project will serve children from the catchment area of the school in which the project is based.</P>
    <P>I am fully aware of the important role played by voluntary and community groups in providing for pre-school children. It is not intended that the pre-schools should in any way undermine this valuable work.  Indeed, I consider that the new pre-school programme will complement existing activities in this area.</P>
    <P>The early start pre-schools are being developed as an integral part of the primary schools in which they are based. The teachers involved are on the general staff of the schools concerned and must therefore be fully qualified primary teachers who can be deployed throughout the school in question.  For that reason teachers, who have a Montessori qualification only, are not eligible for employment as teachers in the early start programme as it is established at present.</P>
    <P>I have just announced the appointment of a monitoring committee to monitor the project and to advise on future developments in this area.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the new monitoring committee will be &mdash; to monitor the operation of the early start pre-school project &mdash; to advise on the future development of the project &mdash; to consider the evaluators' reports and provide advice on their implications &mdash; to advise on alternative models of pre-school provision in designated areas of disadvantage &mdash; to advise on ways in which parental involvement in the children's learning can be developed.</P>
    <P>The committee will liaise with the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, which is currently evaluating the project.</P>
    <P>I have appointed Dr. Anne McKenna of the Department of Psychology, University College Dublin to chair the committee.</P>
    <P>The membership of the committee will be nominated representatives of the pre-schools involved in the project, the <Col N="1376" /> partners in education and other relevant agencies.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion on which comprehensive data on school attendance was collected, in 1983-84, the average daily attendance was fairly constant at 90 to 91 per cent.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>My Department does not keep a record of the number of children with disabilities who are attending ordinary national schools.  However, a survey conducted in 1992 on behalf of the Special Education Review Committee indicated that 14 per cent of children with a mental disability are enrolled in mainstream classes; the equivalent figure for children with physical disabilities is 75 per cent.</P>
      <P>Comparable data is not currently available for second-level schools.</P>
      <P>It is my policy to encourage the maximum possible level of inclusion of children with disabilities into ordinary schools.  However, the pace of development and the degree to which this inclusion can be achieved will vary depending on the specific and evolving needs of the children concerned and the availability of resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach which I am taking is a <Col N="1380" /> flexible one, which seeks to accommodate where possible the preferences of parents in the placement of, and provision for, their children.  In adopting this approach, I am supported by the Report of the Special Education Review Committee, which calls for a continuum of services to match the range of special needs.  It is my intention to be as positive as possible in relation to these recommendations and to implement them as quickly as resources permit.</P>
    <P>In the past two years I have made a number of significant improvements in the area in question.  I have allocated an additional 186 remedial teachers to ordinary primary schools.  This brought the total number of such teachers now in place to 1,133.</P>
    <P>I have also appointed an additional 20 resource teachers with the specific role of assisting ordinary teaching staff in meeting the special needs of children with disabilities attending ordinary classes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Because there would be a great risk <Col N="1381" /> of mistakes in sending out results to 65,000 individual addresses my Department has no plans to issue junior certificate results direct to students' homes for a number of reasons.  While An Post can guarantee next-day delivery of the results to the 800 post-primary schools, they could not do so for delivery to students' homes.  The leaving certificate results and the junior certificate results will therefore continue to be sent to schools for all school based candidates.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress the positive role played by school principals and teachers in conveying the results directly to their students and the support which they provide to candidates who may be distressed by the results.  Candidates who are disappointed can be reassured by the principal and teachers that there are options open to them, including applying for a recheck.</P>
    <P>Up to now the results of the junior certificate have been issued on the second or third Wednesday in September. It is my intention that from September this year they will be issued on the preceding Monday.  This will mean that schools will receive the results on a Tuesday, instead of a Thursday.  Many teachers and parents have expressed concern to me that the receipt of the results at the beginning of the weekend contribute to unruly celebrations.</P>

      <P>There are schemes in existence for the redeployment of permanent teachers at both the primary and post-primary levels.</P>
      <P>The redeployment panels in the primary sector are operated on a diocesan basis by the diocesan authorities in accordance with the terms of the Rules for National Schools.  At post-primary level the redeployment scheme is confined to Catholic secondary schools and an independent administrator is appointed to administer the scheme.</P>

      <P>Teachers in the vocational sector may be transferred to another vocational school within the same vocational education committee area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 35, 44 and 156 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1384" /> I propose to introduce a pilot programme of special support services for children with autism.  This programme will involve: the allocation of extra teachers to specifically address the educational needs of children with autism; the delivery of specially tailored education programmes to meet the needs of these children; the delivery of special inservice support to the teachers concerned.</P>
    <P>It is intended that this pilot programme will be tested in a number of selected locations over the coming year. The programme will be monitored and the experience gained will provide a valuable basis for the development of a longer-term response in this area.</P>
    <P>The areas being selected for the pilot phase of the programme are those where numbers of children with autism have been identified.  In the case of each location chosen, the intention would be that the arrangements put in place would be developed in close consultation with the authorities of the schools concerned and the relevant health authorities.</P>
    <P>In some cases, for example where the children attending a school are predominantly in the autistic group, the response will be &ldquo;whole school&rdquo; based. In other cases, the number of children involved or their particular requirements may suggest that the provision of a separate class or unit might be more appropriate.  There is a need to be flexible and to allow for the development of approaches which best suit the needs of the children concerned.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the demands from representatives of the autistic children for the provision of dedicated facilities to meet their educational needs.  However, given the variety of difficulties which can attach to autism, I am anxious that any steps taken in this area will be of maximum benefit to the children concerned. Experience gained with the pilot programme will have value in this regard.  My officials are currently in discussion with the Austic Society in regard to the pilot programme and I <Col N="1385" /> hope to make an announcement in this connection in the near future.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the programme in Northern Ireland to which the Deputy refers.  I understand that this programme is also operating on a pilot basis at present and my Department will be interested in learning the outcome of that initiative in due course.</P>

      <P>In keeping with the Government's commitment to increasing access to home-school links services, I am currently reviewing needs in this area and expect to make an announcement in the very near future.  In my statement on the 1995 Estimates, I indicated that 340 teaching posts were being retained in the primary system.  I also indicated that the availability of these extra posts will allow me to address the issue of disadvantage, including home-school links.  Also in my statement, I referred to my intention to allocate an additional 700 teaching posts at second level.  In this case also, I am looking at <Col N="1386" /> the needs for increased home-school links services in deploying these posts.</P>

In accordance with that commitment I indicated in my recent statement on the Estimates for 1995 that additional posts will be allocated in 1995 under various headings, including remedial and guidance.  Decisions have <Col N="1390" /> yet to be taken on the actual number of posts to be allocated under these headings. It has been decided to establish a National Centre for Guidance in Education under the aegis of Léargas, the Exchange Bureau.  The centre will be operational shortly.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 151 together.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to extend the provision of physical education facilities in first and second level schools as resources permit.</P>
      <P>In regard to primary schools I have indicated my intention to provide for general purpose rooms in new primary school building projects in respect of schools of four classrooms or more. However, the pace at which this can be achieved will be dictated by the financial resources available and the priority must remain the provision of essential classroom accommodation and the elimination of existing substandard classrooms.  Regrettably, therefore, it is not possible to provide grant-aid for general purpose rooms in existing schools.</P>
      <P>Similarly, in the case of second level schools, sufficient funding is not available to allow the provision of physical education facilities in existing schools without such facilities.  However, as indicated previously in the Green Paper, the policy of providing indoor sports accommodation in schools will resume as soon as pressure on available resources for urgent classroom accommodation has eased.</P>

      <P>County Waterford <Col N="1392" /> Vocational Education Committee intends to proceed with the planning of the proposed extension to Dungarvan Technical College.  A schedule of accommodation has been agreed and design consultants have been appointed by the vocational education committee.</P>
      <P>In order to facilitate the extension the vocational education committee have endeavoured to purchase additional land adjacent to the school.  Two suitable sites were identified by the vocational education committee.  One of these was later sold to a third party and the other was taken off the market.  The vocational education committee hopes that part of the site which was sold will come on the market again in the near future.</P>
      <P>In the meantime, it has been agreed that the planning of the extension can proceed as there is sufficient space on the site to accommodate the proposed new building.  However, as the hard play area will then be limited it would be in the best interest of the school to secure additional land if possible.</P>
      <P>A meeting will be held in the near future between officials of the Department and the vocational education committee and their design team to discuss the planning of the extension which is currently estimated to cost £1.5 million.</P>
      <P>Pending completion of the planning process it is not possible to say when the project will be ready to proceed to construction. The timing of the invitation of tenders and the placing of a contract will be considered in due course having regard to the capital resources available and to other commitments and priorities.</P>

      <P>I am totally satisfied that the stay safe programme does not <Col N="1393" /> undermine the rights of parents in any respect.</P>
      <P>I am aware that a small number of parents continue to have reservations about the programme.  However, parents have the absolute right to decline to have their children participate, if they so wish.  The voluntary aspect guarantees the rights of parents as the primary educators of their children.</P>
      <P>The programme makes every effort to involve parents.  It encourages discussion of the lessons by children at home with their parents.  It fully recognises that parents are the most important people in a child's life and that the child is most likely to turn to them for help when they are upset or worried.</P>
      <P>Every effort is made to ensure that parents are fully informed about the programme.  Before its introduction into any school, parents are invited to an introductory meeting where the programme is explained.  The parents are invited to ask any questions they may have and to have clarified any matter of concern to them.</P>
      <P>Furthermore the child abuse prevention programme has produced a very informative guide for parents in relation to the programme.  This booklet has been widely distributed to parents and there is a strong demand for copies.</P>
      <P>Overall in terms of content and delivery I feel the programme takes a very balanced approach and fully respects the rights of parents in relation to the education of their children.</P>
      <P>I remain firmly of the view that the programme is eminently suitable for implementation in primary schools and in proving beneficial to all concerned in this very sensitive area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department has a range of strategies currently in place to help prevent early school leaving and under-achievement.</P>
      <P>At primary level these include early intervention measures which provide additional supports for young people at risk aimed at optimising their participation in and benefit from the education system.  These include initiatives such as pre-schooling, remedial and home school community liaison services, co-ordination with other agencies, guidance and psychological services, and ancillary services and resources for schools in disadvantaged areas.  A number of youth encounter projects are also provided for young people who have either become involved in minor delinquency or are at risk of doing so, and who have become alienated from the mainstream school system.</P>
      <P>In keeping with its commitment to address the problems of truancy and early drop-out, the Government has appointed Minister of State, Deputy Currie, with special responsibility for this area.  The Minister of State has established a task force to address the issues and has also established an inter-departmental committee, involving the Departments of Education, Health and Justice, to co-ordinate the actions of all three Departments in areas involving children with special needs, including the issue of truancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to reduce the incidence of early school leaving at post-primary level, a number of initiatives have been, and are being, put in place.  These include: targeting of resources on disadvantaged areas; the provision of educational support services for pupils, for example, teaching posts to cater for career guidance, remedial service, disadvantage, handicapped pupils, visiting teachers for travellers; the continuing development of the home-school community liaison scheme; a major re-struc-turing of the second level curriculum to adapt it to the needs of a wider spread of ability levels and backgrounds; continuing financial support for special <Col N="1395" /> initiatives operated by a number of third level institutions which involve linkages with post-primary schools in order to provide greater opportunities for pupils from disadvantaged areas to proceed to third level; support for junior education centres for travellers; and the Youthreach programme.</P>

      <P>The seriousness of my intention in this regard is demonstrated by the fact that I have set aside funds for the pre-construction stage of the project in 1995 and I expect that the building work will get underway in the latter part of 1996.</P>

    <P>A further sum of up to £147,000 will be spent on publication of a new edition of <i>Facts about Ireland.</i> This is a very useful publication and one which is widely used in our Diplomatic and Consular missions abroad.  The most recent edition was published ten years ago, in 1985.</P>
    <P>The remaining funds will be devoted to other, smaller, information publications; to purchase and provision of other general information material on Ireland; and to relations with, and facilities for, foreign news media and journalists, including foreign journalists visiting Ireland.</P>
    <P>I attach particular importance to the preparation and publication of the White Paper on Irish Foreign Policy.  I may say that I am glad also that it has been possible to provide some additional funding this year for the general information work of the Department and particularly for the publication of a new edition of <i>Facts about Ireland</i> which I think is long overdue.</P>

      <P>The 1995 Estimates provide for an increase of £18.6 million in Ireland's Official Development Assistance (ODA) this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>£14.7 million or 79 per cent of the additional funds will be allocated to bilateral assistance; and an additional £3.5 million or almost 19 per cent of the increase will go to meet our commitments to multilateral aid programmes. Our funding for the Bilateral Aid Programme, which is met from Subhead C <Col N="1399" /> of the Vote for International Co-operation, will increase by 59 per cent this year as compared with the provisional outturn for 1994.</P>
    <P>The decision to allocate the greater part of the additional funds being made available to bilateral aid is in accordance with the approach set out in <i>Irish Aid: Consolidation and Growth,</i> the Strategy Plan published by the Department of Foreign Affairs in July 1993. Paragraph 4.4 on page 17 of that document said:</P>
    <P>While it is hoped that both bilateral and multilateral expenditure will increase substantially over the next four years, it is intended that bilateral funding will increase at a faster rate than multilateral.</P>
    <P>This strategy plan was endorsed in the programme for <i>A Government of Renewal</i> in the following terms:</P>
    <P>We will sustain the commitment to the developing world set out in the Irish Aid Strategy document, and will pursue the priorities established by that document.</P>
    <P>I would point out, by way of clarification, that the funding for ODA is provided, for the most part, under Subheads of the Vote for International Co-operation other than Subhead A, Contributions to International Organisations. The provision in the latter Subhead is up by 36 per cent this year. However, only a small part of the funds provided under Subhead A go to ODA. The greater part goes to meet Ireland's contributions to international organisations such as the United Nations and the Council of Europe many of which are mandatory; and the increase in the subhead is occasioned by the fact that in a number of cases we have had to make provisions for increased contributions this year.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the issue raised by the Deputy.  Under the terms of the United States Federal Security Act, 1982, non-resident aliens are liable to tax on social security payments at a rate of 30 per cent on 85 per cent of the social security payments, i.e. 25.5 per cent overall. Prior to 1 January 1995, the rate was 30 per cent on one half of the payment, i.e. 15 per cent overall.</P>
      <P>Generally, in an international context, the tax treatment of such payments is catered for under the provisions of a double taxation treaty.  However, the existing double taxation convention between Ireland and the United States, which is in existence for over forty years, does not contain any specific provisions relating to the taxation of social security payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations on a new convention between Ireland and the United States which were ongoing during the 1980s <Col N="1402" /> were suspended in 1990.

      <P>Prior to 1993, excise duty was chargeable when such cars were removed from warehouse and generally this would occur immediately before delivery to the buyer.  Since the beginning of 1993, when the VRT system was introduced, VRT on new cars is chargeable at the time of registration.  VAT has always been collected on sales of new cars.  For these reaons, new car registrations, rather than imports, provide the most useful measurement of activity in the new car market.  New car registrations and estimated total Exchequer receipts therefrom for the years 1990 to 1994 are as follows:</P>

The method of taxing social welfare pensions is that the pension is paid gross by the Department of Social Welfare and an amount equivalent to the annual social welfare payment is deducted from the person's annual tax free allowances.  I have been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer is in receipt of all the allowances due to her in accordance with her return of income.  Her social welfare widows pension exceeds her tax free <Col N="1404" /> allowance and consequently, her tax free allowances are reduced to nil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the central recommendation of the report of the Kilkenny incest investigation was that the necessary resources be made available to faciliate the implementation of all sections of the Child Care Act, 1991, and in particular Parts III to VI which deal with the taking of children into care, court proceedings and the powers and duties of health boards in relation to children in their care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This recommendation was accepted by the Government as the single biggest contribution which could be made towards promoting the welfare of children and protecting those who are at risk.  Over the last two years, additional resources totalling £20 million have been made available to develop child care services in preparation for the introduction of the Act.  Among the developments approved were; the <Col N="1406" /> creation of over 370 new posts for the child care services around the country, including child psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and child care workers, the provision of additional hostel places for homeless children, the establishment of new family resource centres and community support projects to assist disadvantaged children, the expansion of the homemaker and home help services to help families in diffculty and the establishment of community mothers programmes in a number of boards, increased financial support to pre-school services in areas of social deprivation and the provision of additional places and the development of foster care and other alternative family placement services.</P>
    <P>The policy agreement between the Government parties, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, contains a commitment to the rapid implementation of the Child Care Act.  The Government's determination to honour this commitment is reflected in the fact that the Health Estimate for 1995 includes provision for additional funding of £10 million for child care services. This will facilitate the commencement by the end of the year of Parts III, IV, V and VI which deal respectively with the protection of children in emergencies, care proceedings and the powers and duties of health boards in relation to children in their care.  These provisions will greatly strengthen the powers of the courts, the health boards and the Garda to intervene effectively in relation to child abuse and neglect. As I have already indicated, the need for the early implementation of these key provisions was underlined in the Kilkenny incest report.</P>
    <P>Extensive preparatory work is currently under way in my Department regarding the next phase of implementation. Two working groups were established to assist my Department in the preparation of initial drafts of new regulations relating to foster care and residential care.  The foster care group has completed its task and the draft foster care regulations have been circulated to interested parties for their comments <Col N="1407" /> prior to being finalised.  The residential care working group has produced draft guidelines on standards in children's residential centres which have also been circulated for comment to relevant interest groups.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State with special responsibility for co-ordinating and implementing the Child Care Act, it is my firm intention that the legislation in its entirely will be brought into operation within the shortest timescale possible in line with the commitment contained in <i>A Government of Renewal.</i></P>

      <P>In relation to waiting lists in this country for children and the elderly, the Deputy will be aware that the national waiting list initiatives over the last two years specifically targeted adults waiting over 12 months and children waiting over 6 months for treatment in a range of specialities where the length of time patients had to wait had been identified as a problem.  I am pleased to say that these waiting list initiatives have helped to reduce overall waiting times for both adults and children in these specialities.</P>

      <Quest>if he will consider the extension of the provision of medical appliances without charge pursuant to section 59 of the Health Act, 1970, to long stay elderly in private nursing homes in view of the entitlement of public patients in geriatric hospitals to items such as incontinence pads; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): A person in receipt of a nursing home subvention is entitled to items which are covered by the subvention, including incontinence wear. Article 16.1 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations Act, 1993, provides that a registered proprietor of a nursing home shall not seek any additional payment from a subvented patient for any service which is considered to be essential to the maintenance of a person in a nursing home and common practice in nursing homes. Among the services which are considered to be essential to the maintenance of a person in a nursing home and common practice in most nursing homes are incontinence wear and bedding, laundry service and aids and appliances necessary to assist a dependent person with the activities of daily living.</P>
      <P>Following the publication of the report all the health boards were asked to prepare plans to implement the recommendations of the report.  I am satisfied that the recommendations contained in the report are being progressively implemented by the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years an additional £9 million was made available to the health boards to develop services for the elderly and their carers.  The extra funding has enabled the health boards to expand home nursing services, to provide day care centres and day hospitals, to provide more departments of medicine of the elderly in general hospitals, to increase the number of physiotherapists and speech therapists in the community and to develop services for the elderly <Col N="1410" /> mentally infirm.  I am making available a further £7.5 million this year to improve health services for the elderly, in recognition of the priority I attach to these services.</P>
    <P>One of the most important developments in services for the elderly in recent years has been the development of specialist departments of medicine old age in general hospitals.  The number of these departments has increased from eight in 1988 to over 20 this year. It is intended to open a number of new departments of medicine of old age in general hospitals this year.</P>
    <P>Another important recommendation of <i>The Years Ahead</i>, namely the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, came into effect on 1 September 1993.  The new Act is a major step forward in ensuring that dependent elderly persons in this country will be well cared for.  By the end of 1994, a total of almost £12 million was made available to implement the Act.  Additional funding is being allocated to health boards this year to provide further subventions.</P>
    <P>The progress achieved in developing the health services for the elderly in line with the recommendations of <i>The Years Ahead</i> will be maintained.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that the rapid rise in the number of people in the oldest age groups will pose a special challenge to health services in the next four years. Services in the community and in hospital will have to be responsive to the increased demand which this growing population of older people is likely to bring.</P>
    <P>In the recently published health strategy, one of the priorities in relation to the elderly will be to strengthen the role of the general practitioner, the public health nurse, the home help and other primary care professionals in supporting older people and their carers who live at home.  The target will be to ensure that not less than 90 per cent of those over 75 years of age continue to live at home.</P>
    <P>A further priority of the health strategy in relation to older people over the next four years will be the provision of <Col N="1411" /> additional places for convalescent care for elderly people who do not need acute medical care and the building of eight small scale nursing units in the community to replace unsuitable accommodation and to meet the needs of the expanding population of older people.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there is still some distance to go before all the recommendations of <i>The Years Ahead</i> are implemented.  I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to work towards that goal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I intend to take Questions Nos. 72 and 73 together.</P>
      <P>The salary scale for full-time home helps with effect from 1 June 1994, is in the range of £190.96 to £202.47 per week.  This is the same rate as applies in the health services to group 1 non-officer grades.  This scale applies throughout the country and is increased from time to time in accordance with increases granted to non-nursing personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to persons engaged in the home help service on a part time basis, the position is that the rate of remuneration varies considerably throughout the country.  In particular in the Eastern Health Board area, the service is provided wholly by voluntary groups, this accounts for a wide variation within the <Col N="1412" /> health board area.  In all boards the rates are determined by the particular requirements and type of task undertaken in individual cases.</P>
    <P>The average rates currently applying in the health boards are as follows: Eastern Health Board, £2 to £4 (min.-max.); Midland Health Board, £2.50; Mid-Western Health Board, £2.60; North-Eastern Health Board, £1.45; North-Western Health Board, £2.61; South-Eastern Health Board, £2; Southern Health Board, £1.40; Western Health Board, £1.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that payments made to part-time home helps do not come within the scope of the PAYE system.  Neither is such income taken into account for the purposes of a means test where a part-time home help, or the spouse of a part-time home help, is in receipt of a means tested social welfare payment.</P>
    <P>The number of home helps per health board area employed at December 1994 on a part-time or full-time basis is as follows:</P>

Proposals for the filling of new and replacement permanent consultant posts are reviewed on a regular basis by <Col N="1417" /> my Department.  This review is undertaken having regard to service and personnel criteria in the context of the priority afforded to each post by the agency concerned and with particular regard to the availability of financial resources.</P>
      <P>Under existing personnel policy, it is, therefore, the responsibility of each health agency to submit prioritised consultant manpower proposals to my Department including details of service requirement and proposed funding arrangements.</P>
      <P>Proposals in respect of the post referred to by the Deputy have not been included by the Southern Health Board in its most recent manpower submission to my Department.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Under the new dental treatment services scheme which was introduced by my Department on 1 November 1994, dental treatment for all adults with medical card eligibility will be phased in over a four year period.</P>
      <P>In the initial phasing of the scheme persons aged 65 years and over have been identified as a priority group and additional resources have been made available to health boards to enable them to provide treatment for this group.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I received the interim progress report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community on 14 January 1994, I examined it to see to what extent its recommendations could be implemented immediately, pending receipt of the final report of the Task Force.</P>
      <P>In that connection I consulted with the Minister for Education and also with the former Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, with responsibility for housing, to identify the recommendations on which progress could be made.</P>
      <P>On 18 March 1994, the former Minister of State at the Department of the Environment announced that the special grant for travellers purchasing their first house for their own occupation had been increased from £1,500 to £3,000.  The review and update of this grant was referred to in recommendation 2.7 of the interim progress report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, with effect from this year, funding for new group housing schemes for travellers will be provided by the Department of the Environment separately from the general local authority housing allocation.  This initiative is in <Col N="1421" /> response to recommendation 2.3.1 of the interim report.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Minister for Education that provision for children with special needs is being considered in the context of the report of the Special Education Review Committee, published in 1993, and in the specific case of traveller children, the interim progress report of the Task Force.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific recommendations concerning education provision for travellers, contained in the interim report, I understand that the following developments have taken place:</P>
    <P>(i)  In April 1994, the Minister for Education published guidelines entitled &ldquo;The Education of Traveller Children in National Schools &mdash; Guidelines&rdquo;.  The publication of these guidelines was sought in recommendation 3.5 of the interim report.</P>
    <P>(ii)  In the case of recommendation 3.8, which referred to the level of capitation grant paid in respect of travellers, the capitation grant for traveller children attending national schools has been increased from £76.20 in 1993 to £130 for those children under 12 years and to £316 for children over 12 years of age.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Recommendation 3.9 referred to the development of a comprehensive school record system in recognition of the nomadic life-styles of travellers.  A school record system is now being operated on a pilot basis by the visiting teacher service.</P>
    <P>The recommendations contained in the interim report concerning equal status in non-employment areas will be taken into account in the preparation of equal status legislation, being promoted by my Department.</P>
    <P>I am keeping progress in the implementation of the recommendations contained in the interim progress report under review.  I look forward to receiving the final report soon, and, at that <Col N="1422" /> stage, to considering what further action needs to be undertaken in the light of the proposals and recommendations put forward by the task force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>Decisions as to the optimum time to commence a particular film production rests with the independent producers themselves and are subject to change depending on many variable factors.  Moreover, section 35 of the Finance Act, 1987, as amended, provides a period of up to two years for the making of a qualifying film even after a certificate has been obtained from me in respect of such a film project.  It is, therefore, very difficult to give definitive figures on the number of productions which will begin in Ireland during 1995, and, with regard to 1996, any attempt to anticipate the number of projects would be purely speculative at this stage.</P>
      <P>However, I can inform the Deputy that, according to Bord Scannán na hÉireann/The Irish Film Board, nine films which have been grant-aided by them during 1994 will commence production in 1995.  Moreover, during 1994, 15 projects were certified by me as qualifing under the provisions of section 35 of the Finance Act 1987, as amended, and there are currently 29 further applications for certification on hand.  I believe that this level of activity gives an indication of the vigour and dynamism that has been nurtured in this particular cultural industry &mdash; a momentum I intend to maintain through the coming years.  I am confident that a high level of film production is assured in Ireland for 1995 and 1996.</P>

      <P>Under the Constitution the Judiciary are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and it would not be appropriate for me to express a view on the comments of a District Justice.</P>
      <P>The present position is that, under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts, 1926 to 1988, a television set constitutes apparatus for wireless telegraphy.  Under the Acts it is an offence for a person to possess apparatus for wireless telegraphy unless such possesison is authorised by a licence for the time being in force.  The Wireless Telegraphy Acts do not provide for the exemption of individuals from the requirement to hold a licence and I have no plans to introduce a waiver such as the Deputy suggests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An Post, which under the Postal and Telecommunications Act, 1983, has delegated responsibility for the television licence fee collection system, is conscious of the fact that payment of the annual licence fee might represent a particular difficulty for those on low incomes.  In recognition of this, An Post operates the television licence saving <Col N="1425" /> stamp scheme which allows for the purchase of £1 and £5 stamps during the course of a year towards the cost of the licence.  I understand from An Post that sales of savings stamps amount to approximately £9 million per annum which represents 16 per cent of annual licence sales.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I understand that during this year, through the household budget scheme, which is operated for the Department of Social Welfare by An Post, the facility of deductions at source in respect of the licence fee will be available to weekly unemployment recipients.</P>

      <P>North West Mayo contains some of the important blanket bogs remaining in Europe as well as outstanding scenery.  The importance of the area, and the need to ensure that it is conserved, is recognised and, in order to assist in deciding how best to <Col N="1427" /> conserve the area, Mayo County Council and the Office of Public Works jointly commissioned a firm of independent consultants to conduct a study.  The consultants' brief required them to consider the feasibility of establishing a national park in this area.</P>
      <P>The feasibility of creating a national park in the area, and the proposed boundaries of same, must await completion of the study which commenced last year and is due to be completed towards the middle of this year.  I cannot say at this stage, therefore, whether or not any particular location within the study area will be recommended for inclusion in a national park.  I should point out, however, that privately owned lands will only be included in a national park where the landowner is willing to dispose of his/or her landholding for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The State already owns a number of landholdings within the study area, some of which have been established as nature reserves under the Wildlife Act, 1976.</P>
      <P>During the course of the study, Office of Public Works was approached by a number of landowners who expressed interest in disposing of their landholdings, including some in the Ballycroy area and, with my approval, contracts have since been agreed for the purchase of approximately 2,207 hectares and 4/7th share in a further 1,962 hectares in the Ballycroy area.  Negotiations are continuing in relation to other holdings. No decision on the future designation of these lands will be taken until the study referred to above has been completed.</P>
      <P>It is not normal practice to release details of the solicitors or auctioneers representing private landowners.  Solicitors and auctioneers are chosen by the private landowners to represent their interests.</P>

      <P>While I accept that some level of poaching is always going on, I have no evidence that there is a particularly high level of poaching of deer at present.  Anti-poaching controls are operated by the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and, where evidence of illegal activity is established, prosecutions have been and will be brought against those involved.  Visits are made by NPWS staff to wildlife dealers to check their <Col N="1429" /> sources of supply and butchers, hoteliers and restaurateurs are also checkedout where there is reason to believe that such visits are warranted.</P>
      <P>While precise figures are not available, best indications are that poaching has declined rather than increased in recent years and such illegal activity does not pose a threat to the size of deer populations at this time.  The NPWS are actively working with other interests, such as Coillte Teoranta, to protect deer not just in County Wicklow but throughout the country.</P>
      <P>I appeal to those with any evidence of deer poaching to make such evidence available to the NPWS and/or the Garda Síochána so that prosecutions can be brought against those involved in this type of illegal activity.</P>

      <P>Overall responsibility for the planning and supervision of works, including signposting, on the national road network is a matter for the National Roads Authority whose specific functions include the preparation of schemes for the provision of traffic <Col N="1439" /> signs.  Responsibility for signposting of non-national roads is a matter for each road authority, financed from its own resources and by the annual discretionary State road grants.  It is a matter for each authority to monitor the standard of signposting on the non-national road network in its area and to determine the priorities for the expenditure of available funds.</P>
      <P>A detailed traffic signs manual for use by road authorities will be available later this year.  This will outline a code of good practice to be followed in the provision of traffic signs on all classes of roads.</P>

I measc na ndaltaí sin, áirítear iad siúd a bhfuil máchail áirithe orthu atá ar chéim chomh trom sin go dteipeann orthu léibhéil a mbeadh súil leo a bhaint amach i mbunscileanna teanga sa mháthairtheanga.  Tá sé riachtanach go mbeadh tuairisc shiceolaí ar fáil don scoil mar fhianaise maidir leis an mháchail i ngach cás ionas go mbeidh an scoil ábalta cinneadh a dhéanamh ar dhíolúine ón nGaeilge a dheonadh.  I gcásanna ina bhfuil tromlagú céadfaíoch <Col N="1446" /> i gceist, ní mór tuairisc ó speisialtóir oir-iúnach leighis a chur ar fáil freisin. Chuir Imlitir M10/94 in iúl go n-ullmhó-idh an Roinn treoirlínte do shiceolaithe maidir le hullmhú tuairiscí siceolaíochta. Níl na treoirlínte seo réidh go fóill ach táthar ag súil go mbeidh siad ar fáil gan mhoill do shiceolaithe gur mian leo iad a fháil.</P>
    <P>Is féidir le scoileanna glacadh le tuair-iscí ó dhaoine atá oilte agus cáilithe mar shiceolaithe mar fhianaise ar mháchail amhail Sainmháchail Foghlama nó Máchail Ghinearálta Foghlama de thromlagú intleachtúil, agus is í seo an aidhm bhunaidh atá ag na tuairiscí seo. Tá oiliúint do cháilíochtaí mar shiceolaithe ar fáil ar Chúrsaí i Siceolaíocht sna hOllscoileanna.  Scartha ón cheist seo faoi chinneadh go bhfuil máchail ar dhuine, tá ceisteanna eile faoi mhúineadh theanga do pháistí a fhaigheann a gcuid oideachas trí mheán na Gaeilge nó do pháisti ón nGaeltacht, nó do pháistí i gcoitinne, agus is ceisteanna ginearálta oideachais iad seo d'oideachasóirí sa chomhthéacs sin.</P>
    <P>Ó tháinig an córas nua i bhfeidhm, a fógraíodh in Imlitir M10/94, tá díolúine ó staidéar na Gaeilge faighte ag 1,316 dalta ar fad go dtí seo, 588 buachaill agus 728 cailín.</P>
    <P>Níl eolas ar fáil go réidh faoin líon daltaí a fuair díolúine atá ag staidéar teanga eile.  Nímiste a rá, áfach, go bhfuil de dhifríocht idir an Ghaeilge agus teanga nua-aimseartha, mar ábhair scoile, go bhfuil an Ghaeilge éigeantach mar ábhar don chúrsa Ardteistiméire-achta, an t-aon ábhar atá éigeantach sa chúrsa sin.  Is ábhair roghnacha iad na teangacha eile.  Dá bharr seo, ní thagann díolúine i gceist sna cásanna seo.</P>

      <P>The free book grant for schools in the vocational education sector is paid on a block grant basis to the vocational education committee and not directly to the schools.  The vocational education committee decides on the amount of grant to be paid to each school in its scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Revised arrangements were put in place by my Department for the allocation of grants for school books for needy pupils in respect of the school year 1994-95.  The purpose of these revised arrangements is to ensure that resources are targeted at the most needy pupils and that there is greater equity in the distribution of available resources within the sectors and among the <Col N="1448" /> schools within the sectors.  Accordingly, as a result of my Department's efforts to place this scheme on a more equitable footing, some vocational education committees incurred a reduction in the free book grant relative to the amount received in 1993-94.</P>
    <P>The school in question is situated in the County Dublin vocational education committee area whose allocation was among those which suffered a reduction in 1994-95.  In previous years, allocations made to vocational education committees were calculated on the basis of total enrolments within each vocational education committee area whereas, under the revised scheme, the calculation is based on the numbers of students who are classed as needy.  Therefore, com-parisons between the allocations can be misleading.</P>
    <P>Circular M34/94 stated that an advance payment of approximately 75 per cent of the expected grant was being issued.  This was based on the number of needy pupils returned by the vocational education committees for the year 1993-94. The actual grant would be determined when a similar return was received for 1994-95.  This return was due in September 1994.  If the number of needy students returned for 1994-95 showed a reduction on the 1993-94 figure, as happened in respect of the vocational education committee in question, then the actual grant payable would be less than originally envisaged. The basis of the calculation of the grant was outlined in the circular and I do not accept that the circular was misleading.</P>
    <P>In 1994 financial support for the setting up of book rental schemes by schools which have been classified as disadvantaged was introduced and the school in question received a grant for this purpose from a grant to the vocational education committee.  When account is taken of this grant, the school's total allocation for school books shows an increase on the previous year.  The total amount provided in the published Estimates for the public services for the provision of free books was <Col N="1449" /> fully expended on the scheme and no savings were achieved.</P>

      <P>The promotion of tolerant attitudes to and the awareness of the special needs of all groups, including the ageing and the elderly, is a policy objective of the broad curriculum at primary and second level.  The promotion of positive attitudes to the ageing and the elderly is explicitly covered in the civics programme of the primary school curriculum. The family, the school community, local community and the national community are developed within the civics programme from a perspective of fostering social attributes such as tolerance, co-operation with others, courtesy and care of the old and infirm.  I am satisfied that, in line with the curriculum, primary teachers make every effort to instruct children on the development of responsible attitudes towards the ageing and the elderly.</P>
      <P>Positive attitudes towards the ageing and the elderly are specifically promoted in the school curriculum at second level in a number of ways.  The new junior cycle course entitled &ldquo;Civic, Social and Political Education&rdquo;, which will form part of the core curriculum from 1996 provides opportunities for teachers and students to focus on ageing and the elderly.  A module on &ldquo;Preparation for Adult and Working Life&rdquo; has been introduced as part of the transition year programme.  Experience in the community care service concerned with the aged has been recommended as appropriate for this aspect of the programme. At leaving certificate level, the home economics social and scientific syllabus focuses on changing attitudes to the ageing and the elderly within the context of the broad family.</P>
      <P>A pilot project, funded by the European Union, is being organised by the Curriculum Development Centre in Shannon in association with the Department of Social Welfare, to identify the significant role that retired/older people have to play in the education and training of young people.</P>

      <P>Inquiries into the suspension of the person referred to by the Deputy were conducted and completed by a senior inspector of my Department.</P>
      <P>There were a number of factors which contributed to the delay in arriving at a decision in this case.  It was decided to conduct informal inquiries into the suspension. There was much correspondence between the person's solicitor and the senior inspector regarding the legality of the proposed inquiry and the procedures to be followed.  When these matters had been resolved, the investigation itself consisted of an examination of documentation and interviews with the parties concerned.  All of these matters, together with work involved in compiling the report, took a considerable time to complete.</P>
      <P>There were subsequent difficulties in considering the report.  Following the institution of legal proceedings and subsequent negotiations, settlement terms were laid down by the High Court on 1 December 1994.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 159 and 161 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education I have undertaken a particular commitment to address the educational needs of pupils in disadvantaged areas.  This commitment is reflected in the substantially increased <Col N="1460" /> level of resources which have been targeted at disadvantaged areas over the past two years.</P>
    <P>In the current year I intend to maintain this momentum and significantly increased resources are again being made available for this purpose.</P>
    <P>In the pre-school area, I propose to establish a further 25 pre-school programmes in areas of particular disadvantage.</P>
    <P>At primary level I propose to retain 340 teaching posts in the system which would otherwise have been lost due to falling enrolments.  These posts will enable me to: reduce the pupil teacher ratio in primary schools from 23.4 to 1 in September, 1994 to 22.9 to 1 in September, 1995; reduce the general guidelines on maximum class sizes and address the issue of disadvantage through the provision, for example, of further remedial posts, teachers for travellers and for home school links.</P>
    <P>I have also secured a substantial increase in the disadvantaged areas fund which has risen by almost £1.3 million to £3.4 million in 1995.  This will enable me to target significant additional funding at schools in disadvantaged areas in the current year.</P>
    <P>I have approved the appointment of an additional 10 psychologists to the school psychological service.  I am increasing the capitation fund at primary level by 9 per cent.  The book scheme provision at primary level is being increased by 26 per cent.  At second level, additional posts will be allocated for disadvantaged, special needs, guidance and remedial purposes. Caretaking and clerical services will be further expanded.  The school books scheme at second level is being increased by 31 per cent.</P>
    <P>With regard to examination fees, in the case of necessitous pupils the ordinary fee payable may be reduced at the discretion of the school principal, subject to a maximum notified to each school or vocational education committee by my Department.  My Department has made £400,000 available to schools and vocational education committees <Col N="1461" /> for this purpose in connection with the 1995 examinations.  Further concessions are made in the case of certain necessitous pupils repeating the leaving certificate examination.</P>
    <P>With regard to adult and continuing education, the provision for adult literacy and community-based education for disadvantaged adults has been substantially increased in recent years.  There is a significant literacy content in the community-based education provided.  In keeping with the Government's commitment in this area, further development is planned in adult literacy and adult education schemes.</P>
    <P>An additional £1 million is being provided for the Youthreach programme.</P>
    <P>Provision for special initiatives for adult education in disadvantaged areas has been increased by 21 per cent.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made for 5,000 places on the vocational training opportunities scheme.</P>
    <P>The Government has also committed itself to new support mechanisms to increase participation by third level students from low-income backgrounds, including the abolition of third-level fees, a comprehensive reform of the higher education grants scheme, the introduction of support for students on post leaving cert courses and an increase in the number of third level places.</P>
    <P>With regard to the particular educational needs of the travelling community, the Deputy will be aware that a special task force on the travelling community has been established by my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  The task force is looking at all aspects of traveller welfare, including the question of educational provision for travellers.  The report of the task force is curently awaited and I will consider its findings when they become available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past two years I have implemented a range of measures to improve educational equality for special needs children.</P>
      <P>I have allocated an additional 186 remedial teachers to ordinary primary schools.  This brought the number of such teachers in place to 1,133.</P>
      <P>Over the same period, I have appointed an additional 20 resource teachers with the role of supporting ordinary teaching staff in meeting the special needs of children with disabilities attending ordinary schools.</P>
      <P>I have also substantially increased the special capitation rates payable to special schools and classes dealing with pupils with special needs.</P>
      <P>My Department has recently announced a scheme whereby eligible schools may receive funding towards the provision of escorts on special school transport services.  This scheme will also provide funding towards the cost of a safety harness in appropriate cases.</P>
      <P>I have also sanctioned the appointment of an additional 10 psychologists to the school psychological service.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the commitments contained in the Government's policy agreement <i>A Programme of Renewal,</i> I propose to maintain this momentum in the current year.</P>
      <P>In my statement on the 1995 Estimates, I indicated my intention to retain 340 teaching posts in the primary system. These posts would otherwise have been lost due to falling enrolments.  The availability of these posts will enable me to target further teaching supports at special needs pupils.  In deploying these posts I will be guided by the recommendations of the special education review committee.</P>
      <P>I hope to anounce details of these allocations in the very near future.</P>

    <P>It has been decided to introduce revised syllabuses in Accounting, Irish, French, German, Spanish and Italian with effect from September, 1995 for examination in 1997.

The final choice is made by a panel of the senior inspectorate of the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>Five Primary teachers and ten post-primary teachers participated in the 1993-94 round of study visits.  Each participant receives a block grant of approximately £650.  An additional £115 is paid to those participants whose journey exceeds 2,000 km.</P>

      <P>In 1989, the Minister for Justice appointed a committee &ldquo;to investigate the adequacy of the existing statutory controls over fund-raising activities for charitable etc. purposes and to make recommendations for any changes considered necessary having regard, in particular, to the need to justify any consequential costs as well as any extra interference with individual freedoms&rdquo;. The committee, under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Declan Costello, reported to the Minister in 1990 recommending, <i>inter alia</i>, that the 1962 Act, and the regulations made thereunder, needed to be amended in a number of ways.</P>
      <P>As part of its programme, the Government is committed to reforming the law relating to the administration of charities along the lines recommended by the committee.  The recommendations are at present being examined by my Department and any legislative proposals arising out of that examination will be brought forward as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The legislation conditions governing entitlement to unemployment benefit were changed with effect from January 1993 in the light of the extension of full social insurance cover to all employed persons earning £25 per week or over.  The purpose of the amendment was to give entitlement to unemployment benefit to part-time workers who lost employment.  The conditions now in operation require a person to have sustained a loss of employment, i.e. to have lost at least a day's work in order to be entitled to unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>The new conditions apply to workers generally, including persons who had been in part-time work prior to the change.  The person concerned has been in part-time employment on a continuous basis since 1984 and, under the previous legislation, was entitled to unemployment benefit for days not worked. She is no longer entitled to claim on the grounds that she has not suffered any loss of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the changes in the legislation consequent on the inclusion of part-time workers resulted in some claimants no longer qualifying for benefit, the basic thrust of the measures was to extend social insurance cover, for short term benefits and pensions, to many part-time workers who were not previously covered.  Furthermore, the conditions <Col N="1496" /> for unemployment benefit are consistent with the fundamental purpose of the scheme, which is to provide insurance cover to people who lose employment.</P>
    <P>I want to ensure that the social welfare system does not operate to discourage people from taking up employment. The new programme for Government <i>A Government of Renewal</i> contains a commitment to take steps to eliminate or remove any administrative, tax or welfare obstacles to job sharing, voluntary part-time working, flexible working of a seasonal or temporary character or career breaks and educational leave.  I will have the circumstances outlined in the question considered in that context in the light of forthcoming opportunities for legislative change.</P>

  </MainHeading>
  <MainHeading Type="WA" LHead="Written Answers. - Statement by Minister" RHead="Bruton on Unauthorised Insurance">
    <Title>Written Answers. - Statement by Minister Bruton on Unauthorised Insurance.</Title>
    <P>Mr. Richard Bruton, T.D., Minister for Enterprise and Employment today <Col N="1498" /> (Thursday, 22nd December, 1994) issued the following statement on unauthorised insurance.</P>
    <P>In March of this year allegations were made to the Department of Enterprise and Employment that an insurance brokerage was placing insurance business with entities which were not authorised to underwrite insurance business in this country.  Following initial inquiries it was decided that the nature and the potential scale of the problem warranted a formal investigation by authorised officers of the Department.</P>
    <P>The immediate concern in the investigation was the protection of the clients of the brokerage concerned which brokerage informed the Department in mid-April that the insurance covers in question had been put into run-off and would expire in mid-June and that efforts were being made to have alternative cover arranged with authorised insurers.</P>
    <P>In September, 1994 the Department was informed that the majority of the risks had been transferred, with retrospective effect from March 1994 to an insurer based in another EU member state.  Following further investigations by the Department it became clear that this insurer had not received approval from the insurance supervisory authority in its home member state to transact insurance business in the Irish market. The investigations were then completed and a file was forwarded to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The Department of Enterprise and Employment, has a duty to act when possible breaches of the law are brought to its attention and that duty was met by the inquiries and subsequent investigation into the allegations received in March 1994.</P>
    <P>Throughout the inquiries and the ensuring investigations the Department was at all times concerned to safeguard to the extent that it reasonably could, the position of the clients of the brokerage concerned.</P>
    <P>Since August the Department has become aware that a small number of <Col N="1499" /> brokers may have placed a limited amount of business with insurers not approved to operate in the Irish market.</P>
    <P>Ongoing inquiries are being made into these matters by the IBA (Irish Brokers Association) which is the recognised regulatory body in relation to its member's compliance with insurance legislation.  The IBA is obliged to inform the Department of instances where it has concluded that a breach of the statutory regulatory rules may have occurred.</P>
    <P>Minister Bruton would like to remind insurance intermediaries that under the Code of Contract for Insurance Intermediaries they have a duty to act to the highest professional standards and in the best interests of their clients.  Consequently they should ensure that all insurance effected by them on behalf of their clients must be placed with insurers which are approved to operate in this country.  Where any doubts emerge in relation to the status of an insurer the Minister would expect insurance intermediaries to so inform their clients.  It is, of course, open to any insurance intermediary to check the status of any particular insurer with the Minister's Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister would like to advise all persons taking out insurance that they should, in their own interest, be satisfied that the insurance is being placed with an insurer which is approved to operate in this country.  The name of the insurer is normally clearly discernible on all policy and supporting documentation.</P>
    <P>In addition, where dealing through an insurance intermediary, that intermediary is obliged to provide clients with receipts specifying, among other things, the name of the insurer with which a policy is to be placed or renewed.  Anyone who is in doubt whether an insurer is approved to operate in this country should contact the Insurance Section of the Department of Enterprise and Employment Telephone (01) 661 44 44 ext. 2714.</P>

      <P>Following failure by the employer concerned to pay the award made by the Employment Appeals Tribunal under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, the employee referred the matter to my Department in accordance with section 12 (3) of the Act, which empowers the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to institute proceedings for the recovery of such sums. The employer company was no longer trading although not in receivership or liquidation.</P>
      <P>My Department referred this case to its legal advisers to consider the question of instituting legal proceedings against the employer, and, in consultation with its legal advisers, my Department made further inquiries about the company.  These inquiries confirmed that the company is no longer trading and that it was formally dissolved in 1992.  In circumstances such as these where an employer appears to have ceased trading and is dissolved, it is difficult to bring a successful prosecution. My Department is examining the case to see if any further steps can be taken and will inform the employee of the outcome as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also mention that there is provision under the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973 whereby an employee (or trade union acting on his behalf) may institute proceedings to recover the amount of any compensation awarded by the tribunal as a simple contract debt in a court of <Col N="1501" /> competent jurisdiction.  If the employee did decide to institute proceedings in the courts, the costs of any such proceedings would have to be met by the employee.</P>

      <P>I have seen the news release recently issued by IBEC in <Col N="1502" /> this regard.  The new Employment Appeals Tribunal took up office for a three-year period with effect from 30 January, 1995.  Throughout last year, indepth discussions took place with interested parties with a view to exploring ways in which the effectiveness of the tribunal could be improved.  A submission received from IBEC representatives fully considered and three consultation meetings with IBEC representatives were held.</P>
      <P>The appointment and terms of reference of the new tribunal were specifically designed to address concerns which had been made by the various bodies consulted, including IBEC.  In particular, steps have been taken to improve the consistency of the decisionmaking process and to eliminate all unnecessary legalisms in tribunal hear-ings, points which have been specifically raised by IBEC.</P>
      <P>The initiatives taken or to be introduced include:</P>
      <P>A new chairperson to head up the tribunal has been selected from among the available experienced vice-chairpersons.</P>
      <P>The number of vice-chairpersons has been reduced from 21 to 13. IBEC had suggested that a smaller number of full-time vice-chairpersons would help achieve improved consistency and predictability in decisionmaking. The reduction in the number of part-time vice-chairpersons is intended to achieve the same end but in a more cost-effective way.</P>
      <P>A liaison committee, representative of the Department and the Employment Appeals Tribunal, is in the process of being set up.  This will provide regular opportunities for representatives of ICTU, IBEC and the other nominating bodies to meet and discuss the operation and development of the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is intended that the recently appointed members of the tribunal will have access to increased support by way of information and training.  Prior to the new appointments being made, the aims <Col N="1503" /> and the ethos of the tribunal were clearly explained to all the nominating bodies and to all members.</P>

      <P>A farmer with 15 livestock units or less as calculated in accordance with the formula set out below did not need to submit an area aid application in 1993 to qualify for special beef or suckler cow premia. He/she needed to submit an area aid application then, however, to qualify for extensification premium.</P>
      <P>A farmer with over 15 livestock units similarly calculated needed to submit an area aid application in 1993 to qualify for suckler cow or special beef or extensification premia.  The EU, nevertheless, agreed as a special concession that where such a farmer had failed to lodge an area aid application he/she could be paid suckler cow or special beef (but not extensification) premium on any suckler cows or male bovines submitted for premium in 1993 up to a maximum of 15 livestock units.</P>

      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 206 and 207 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The length of time between application and payment dates under a particular scheme depends on various issues including such EU requirements as respect for retention periods and the 1 November starting date for special beef and suckler cow advance payments. The 2 months retention period under the special beef premium and disadvantaged areas cattle and equine headage schemes, the 100 days retention period under the ewe premium, sheep headage and goat headage schemes <Col N="1505" /> and the 6 months retention period under the suckler cow premium scheme all have a bearing on payment dates.  The integrated administration and control system applied by the EU to all schemes means that no one application can be treated in isolation from other applications by the same farmer. Applications submitted late in the year, therefore, impact on payment possibilities under much earlier applications. Most farmers are obliged to submit an area aid application and the processing of these applications is also critical to the delivery of payments to premium and headage applicants.  The need to respect EU rules on stocking density means that final payments under the various schemes and full payment of extensification premium have to await full processing of all applications submitted by the farmer over the year. Another critical factor is the quality of the completed application.  Farmers can obviously help in this regard but the Department can also contribute to the earlier correction of errors.  It is essential that applicants are informed at a very early stage where there are problems with or errors on their applications. This is a matter of priority for me within the charter of rights for farmers that I am introducing this year. I have no proposals at present to set up a &ldquo;special query unit because of the delays experienced by applicants with queried files&rdquo; as I would prefer to eliminate as far as possible the causes of such delays rather than let them continue and be dealt with by such a unit.  I am, however, intent on putting in place a formal appeals facility in my Department to handle appeals against decisions under headage and premium schemes.  I have initiated a fundamental review within my Department of all procedures for processing and paying applications under the schemes mentioned by the Deputy.  My aim is to deliver payments as speedily and safely as possible to all farmers.  The starting dates for the payment of 1994 balances show that we are already achieving significant progress <Col N="1506" /> in this endeavour.  I intend to build on and enhance that progress under the 1995 headage and premia schemes.</P>

      <P>Under the farm retirement scheme a farming transferee must be under 50 years of age on the date the transfer documents are signed. Examination of this case shows that one of the transferees was ineligible as he was over 50 years of age on the date of transfer of a portion of the land in question, therefore disqualifying that land from the assessment of the pension.</P>

There was also a dispute as to the ownership of one of the folios on which a share is registered.  In November last year the Land Commission was informed that the objections to the division of the commonage had been withdrawn and it is now seeking to complete the division using voluntary procedures. Any shareholders residing outside the State retain their rights in connection with the land and for the purposes of dividing the commonage they must be treated in exactly the same manner as shareholders residing within the State.</P>

      <P>The operation of the milk quota system in Ireland is biased in favour of small scale milk suppliers. Producers with quotas of less than 30,000 gallons have first priority <Col N="1512" /> access to quota becoming available under the temporary leasing and restructuring schemes and in the distribution of any unused quota at the end of the quota year.</P>
      <P>The 1994 restructuring scheme also provided for the first time for a subsidy of 50 pence per gallon to producers with quotas of less than 20,000 gallons towards the purchase price of additional quota.  I have decided that a subsidy will also be available for the 1995 restructuring scheme and £6 million has been earmarked for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The principle of ring-fencing of quota within the disadvantaged areas was also introduced into the 1994 restructuring scheme.  As the majority of small scale producers are situated in these areas, this is a further positive development in encouraging such producers to improve the viability of their holdings and thus to remain in milk production.</P>
      <P>I have also decided to extend this principle of ring-fencing to sales and leases of land to which quota attaches and legislation is presently being prepared which will have the effect of retaining milk quota in disadvantaged areas.  This measure will be of help to smaller producers, who predominate in those areas.</P>
      <P>Apart from quota related incentives, we also have in place a scheme under which small producers can avail of a 60 per cent grant towards the cost of up-grading their on-farm dairy facilities to bring them into line with EU standards.</P>

    <P>As will be seen from the above figures the number of diversions have decreased significantly over the decade. This is due to the upgrading of electronic navigational aids and equipment at the airport.</P>

      <P>The 1994 competition for cadetships in the Naval Service was open to women for the first time and, although three places were reserved specifically for women, unfortunately there were no females among the suitable candidates. It was envisaged that the induction of female cadets would be the first stage of a planned programme to open all appointments in the Naval Service to females.  In that regard it was proposed that the recruitment of female ratings would commence when female officers were qualified to take up appointments aboard ship.  In view of the fact that no female cadets were recruited in 1994, the programme is being reviewed.</P>

      <Quest>in view of the 46 per cent increase in spending planned by his Department on secondary harbours, if he will be in a position to complete work in progress at Kilmore Quay, County Wexford, in one phase rather than two; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I am anxious to have the current development work in Kilmore Quay completed as soon as possible and in the most efficient manner.  The scope for expediting the pace of the project is at present being examined.  I hope to be in a position to make a decision on the matter shortly.  I am visiting Kilmore Quay myself on Friday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, however, major financial constraints which derive from the major reduction made under the National Plan <Col N="1519" /> 1994-1999 in the allocations for fishery harbour expenditure.  The 1995 allocation is down by 30 per cent on the 1994 budget allocation and the average annual allocation set for the medium term under the Structural Funds framework shows a reduction of some 60 per cent on the 1994 budgeted level.</P>
    <P>I regard these allocations as totally inadequate and will be aiming to have the imbalance redressed in the setting of spending plans for 1996 and later years.</P>
    <P>The allocation for secondary harbours (Subhead D.1) which shows an increase of 46 per cent amounts to £870,000 and relates to essential renewals and development of smaller regional commercial ports.  It does not relate to spending on fishery harbours which is covered by subhead G.1 and has an allocation of £2.38 million for 1995.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy was advised in the reply to his parliamentary question on 15 November 1994, processing the licensing application in question has been constrained from the start because of the proposed site location.  The oyster growing operation is located within a statutory nature reserve established in 1987 which was also designated by the Wildlife Service under the EU Birds Directive as a special protection area in 1990.  Aquaculture and other developmental activity is circumscribed within such conservation areas.</P>
      <P>The Department requested the Wildlife Service on 9 November, 1994 to urgently reconsider the extent, if any, to which the application could be accommodated within the conservation area. The Wildlife Service formally advised the Department on 9 December last that any aquaculture development would have an adverse impact on the nature reserve from a wildlife conservation viewpoint and that consequently the development could not be facilitated within this particular area.</P>
      <P>The application now has to be assessed in light of the expressed position of the Wildlife Service by the Department's aquaculture licensing vetting committee which is due to meet later this month.  The committee will be asked as part of its consideration to examine the scope for assisting the applicant to identify an alternative site.</P>
      <P>I have been advised that the Department wrote to the applicant on 14 November last to explain the licensing difficulties and offering to fully brief him in person on the situation.  I understand that this offer has not been taken up as yet but officials remain available to meet the Deputy and the applicant at any time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1521" /> The Department is committed to progressing aquaculture licence applications as quickly as possible in full consultation with all relevant interests.  The duration of the consultative and decision making process can vary from case to case, however, depending on the technical and scientific considerations and particular local circumstances involved.  Procedures are being strengthened to ensure that applicants and other concerned parties are kept regularly informed of progress.</P>
