    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is is to increase the statutory limit on borrowing by the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  It is less than two years since this House passed the Agricultural Credit Act, 1972, which extended the borrowing powers of the corporation and fixed £70 million as the limit of their total borrowings.  It is a tribute to the remarkable progress of the corporation that I am now proposing to increase this limit to £120 million.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the details of the Bill, I should like to review the work of the corporation and to describe the various credit facilities which they offer to the agricultural industry.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation were one of the first public enterprises established in this country, being set up by the Agricultural Credit Act, 1927.  Over the years, they have played a significan role in promoting Irish agriculture and their total investment in the in dustry now exceeds £65 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The corporation's business expanded dramatically during the past five years coinciding with the vast improvement in the prospects for agriculture in the European Economic Community.  Total advances by the corporation increased from £6 million in 1968-69 to £29 million in 1972-73. <Col N="1677" /> The expansion continues in 1973-74 and total advances for the year could reach £50 million.  The EEC now provides about 30 per cent of the credit used by farmers.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be interested to know where the corporation get their funds. The main items in their balance sheet at 30th April, 1973, the end of their accounting year, were £6.7 million share capital owned by the Minister for Finance, £7.7 million in repayable advances from the Exchequer, and £41 million in deposits from the public.</P>
    <P>Deposits have provided most of ACC's funds during the past few years.  The deposits scheme which began in 1965 has been very successful. The inflow of deposits was so buoyant in the years 1968-69 to 1972-73 that receipts from deposits plus repayments on existing loans were sufficient to finance the corporation's entire lending programme.  The inflow of deposits has not kept pace with the expansion in lending this year, with the result that the corporation have to look elsewhere for funds.  To supplement their own resources, the Exchequer is giving them a short-term loan of £8 million and the corporation may have to borrow a further £8 million from abroad.</P>
    <P>Turning now to loans available, the corporation provide a very wide range of loan facilities.  They give loans to farmers for livestock, land purchase and improvement, erection of farm buildings and dwelling houses, and the purchase of farm machinery, seeds and fertilisers.  Livestock loans are the major element representing 42 per cent of total ACC advances in 1972-73.</P>
    <P>The period of repayment varies. For example, maximum repayment periods are five years for livestock loans, 15 years for loans for land purchase and improvement, 20 years for farm buildings and 35 years for farm dwellings.  In addition, merchants can get short-term loans to enable them to give seeds and fertiliser to farmers on credit at spring time and to finance the purchase and storage of grain at harvest time.</P>
    <P>In recent years, many firms in the <Col N="1678" /> food processing industries are turning to the ACC for capital.  Hence the ACC are contributing to the expansion and modernisation of many creameries, meat factories and grain mills.  During the past year the corporation&mdash;as well as the commercial banks&mdash;took part in a temporary scheme of loans for farmers at subsidised interest rates.  The object of this scheme which began in June, 1972, was to help smaller farmers to increase their livestock numbers in order to benefit from EEC membership. The loans were advanced by the ACC and the commercial banks and the Exchequer pays an interest subsidy of 4 per cent.  The scheme will end shortly but I mention it because it enabled farmers to obtain £4.0 million at low interest rates to buy stock and it also served as a useful introduction to the concept of interest subsidies which will form part of the EEC farm modernisation scheme.</P>
    <P>During the past year the ACC also became associated with the World Bank Loan for livestock development. This loan of £10 million is channelled through the ACC for relending to farmers by both the ACC and the commercial banks.  The loans, which are given to farmers who follow an approved development plan, are available for long-term investment in livestock programmes.  A preferential rate of interest applies 11¾ per cent at present, and the loans are repayable over a period of 12 years.</P>
    <P>I have given a brief outline of the work of the corporation.  Deputies will see that the volume and nature of ACC business have expanded considerably. To cope with this expansion the corporation recently adapted their management structure and installed a modern accounting and data processing system.  They also extended their area organisation in order to bring their facilities within easy reach of farmers and to ensure that their officials are in close contact with local problems.</P>
    <P>Looking to the future, it is likely that the demand for credit for agriculture will remain high over the next few years.  Farmers will need credit as they continue to adapt their enterprises, improve <Col N="1679" /> their land, buildings and equipment and increase their livestock numbers to exploit the market opportunities available in the European Economic Community.  It is true that because of their higher incomes farmers will themselves have more funds for re-investment in their holdings, but, nevertheless, a substantial gap will remain which must be filled by borrowing from sources such as the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
    <P>This is the context in which I am presenting the present Bill to the House.  While the corporation can count on annual receipts of £15 million from loan repayments, they would have to borrow about £30 million to finance an annual lending programme of £45-£50 million.  Their total borrowings at present are close to the permitted maximum of £70 million.  I propose, therefore, to increase the statutory maximum to £120 million.  Section 2 of the Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>Borrowings by the corporation may be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  The maximum of such borrowings which the Minister can guarantee under existing legislation is £70 million.  To bring this into line with the new borrowing limit, section 3 of the Bill empowers the Minister for Finance to guarantee ACC borrowings up to a maximum of £120 million.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 of the Bill relate to charging provisions which apply to lands offered as security for small loans.  These provisions were put into the 1947 Act to speed up the issue of loans.  Existing provisions apply to loans up to a maximum of £2,000 which was fixed in 1965.  To take account of the decline in money values, I now propose to increase this maximum to £10,000.  Sections 4 and 5 make this change.</P>
    <P>Finally, section 6 of the Bill enables the corporation to make whatever changes are necessary in their memorandum and articles of association as a result of other clauses in the Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill will help the ACC to cope with the expanding demand for credit for agriculture and in this way enhance the prospects and progress of our agricultural industry.  I recommend <Col N="1680" /> the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In our present circumstances as a member of the EEC, with the development in agriculture which has already taken place as a result of that membership, and with the vast potential which still exists for further development of the agricultural industry, it would be true to say that there is no more important source of investment from the point of view of the economy than the agricultural industry. This importance is enhanced even further by reason of the possible dire consequences of the oil crisis.  I say that because, although we all hope it will not happen, it would be unrealistic not to take account of the possibility that developments in the oil crisis may well have a very serious effect on manufacturing industry, in which event both the community and the economy as a whole would become even more dependent on the development of agriculture.</P>
      <P>For all these reasons the Minister can rest assured that this side of the House is fully in favour of the proposals in this Bill, proposals which will enable the Agricultural Credit Corporation to supply an even greater flow of funds to the agricultural industry to enable it to develop further. One of the major problems in regard to investment in agriculture is that the actual amount of money required, which would give a very good return, is enormous.  I am speaking now in terms of the money that could reasonably be envisaged as being required in the next two or three years.  This money is by no means all coming from, or intended to come from, the funds of the ACC.  As the Minister has indicated, the improved income of farmers is assisting as a source of investment in agriculture, but it is not, of course, sufficient.  Other sources are required.  The commercial banks have been investing fairly heavily in agriculture. But the most important source and the one geared specifically to the requirements of the agricultural industry is the ACC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I concur in what the Minister said about the activities of the ACC in recent years and about the success <Col N="1681" /> which has attended its efforts.  The figures he gave indicate a very substantial expansion in the business of the ACC in a relatively short time and, subject to certain complaints which, I think, one will always get in relation to any lending institution, it is clear that the ACC has handled this very rapid expansion in its business, in the demands on the ACC and the enhancement of the importance of the position of the ACC in our economy very efficiently indeed.  In this connection, it would be no harm for us to pay tribute to the board and the chief executive of the ACC because of the efficient and expeditious way in which they have dealt with what could well have been a crisis situation.</P>
    <P>The proposed increase in the amount which the ACC may borrow might seem on the face of it a very excessive increase, from £70 million to £120 million, but I do not think it is excessive.  Indeed, if any criticism were to be made of it, it would be that it is too small.  This is because the rate of expansion in the last year or two has been and very likely in the next few years will be far greater than it ever was over a long period in the past.  I would expect that it will be necessary to bring before this House in the not very distant future another Bill to raise the limit above the £120 million proposed here.</P>
    <P>It also seems to me that the increase in the limit in respect of what were regarded as small loans, and the provisions laid down in an earlier Act to speed up the procedures, from £2,000 to £10,000 is certainly not unreasonable having regard to the value of land today and to the fall in the value of money.  Consequently, as far as these provisions are concerned, we on this side of the House fully support them.</P>
    <P>There are, however, a few matters on which I hope the Minister will expand a little further when replying to this stage of the debate.  First, I had hoped when he was introducing this stage that he might be a little more specific as to what is happening in regard to deposits.  He has given some indications but they are not quite clear, and perhaps he would spell them <Col N="1682" /> out for us.  If I may quote from the Minister's speech, he says:</P>
    <P>The inflow of deposits was so buoyant in the years 1968-69 to 1972-73 that receipts from deposits plus repayments on existing loans were sufficient to finance the corporation's entire lending programme.</P>
    <P>That statement is perfectly true, and this was my own experience as Minister for Finance up to March of this year.  The inflow of deposits was very buoyant, and certainly there was no drain on the resources of the Exchequer as far as the ACC were concerned because of this, and it was a very welcome development.  However, the Minister goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The inflow of deposits has not kept pace with the expansion in lending this year, with the result that the corporation have to look elsewhere for funds.</P>
    <P>That could, of course, mean one of two things: it could mean that the flow of deposits is increasing at the same rate as in the past but, nevertheless, that the demands for lending are increasing at a much faster rate and, therefore, there is this gap to which the Minister referred; alternatively, it could mean that the flow of deposits is not increasing at the rate at which it was in the past or, indeed, that it might be decreasing.  The Minister's statement does not make this clear, and I hope he will let us know what has been the pattern in regard to deposits in the ACC since the beginning of this financial year, in other words, since 1st April.  It is a matter of some importance that we should have this information and know what is the attitude of investors, particularly in this vitally important industry of agriculture, vitally important as it has always been but even more so for the reasons I mentioned at the outset.  The Minister goes on to say:</P>
    <P>To supplement their own resources the Exchequer is giving them&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that is, the ACC.</P>
    <P>&mdash;A short term loan of £8 million, and the corporation may have to borrow a further £8 million from abroad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1683" /> I wonder if the Minister could indicate in regard to the short-term loan, first, how short is it&mdash;in other words, are we talking about a period of months or a period of years&mdash;and whether it is a sum which he had not provided for in the public capital programme. There have been indications under other headings which I shall not go into here&mdash;I probably would not be in order in doing so&mdash;of substantial changes in the amounts required for the public capital programme from the programme as published by the Minister early this year.  We would like to know, therefore, whether or not this sum of £8 million was a part of the published public capital programme or whether it is an addition to it.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in regard to the Minister's reference to the possibility of the corporation having to borrow a further £8 million from abroad, there are two matters I should like the Minister to clarify. First, I should like to have the Minister confirm that the ACC are enabled to borrow abroad without any legal difficulties.  I am pretty certain that is the position.  The Minister will be aware that there are certain State-sponsored bodies who have legal difficulties in borrowing abroad and that we have to make special statutory provisions in regard to some of them to enable them to do so.  As far as I can recall, the ACC are not in that position, but perhaps the Minister would confirm for me that there is no problem from the point of view of the ACC borrowing abroad.</P>
    <P>In relation to the second point I wish to raise on borrowing abroad, the Minister referred later to the World Bank loan for livestock development of £10 million being channelled through the ACC for relending to farmers both by the ACC and the commercial banks.  Could the Minister indicate whether the World Bank loan to which he has referred is separate from and over and above the possible £8 million abroad to which he has referred in his speech?</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, there are complaints from time to time about <Col N="1684" /> the ACC either refusing to lend money when the borrower thinks they should do so or, in other cases, and very often coming from the same kind of person, complains that they have lent money or an excessive amount of money to people who, in the view of the complaint, should not have been lent money.  I believe that these kinds of complaints are inevitable in dealing with any lending institution.  I cannot say, of course, with certainty, that none of those complaints is justified, but I can say from my own experience of the ACC and from some investigations which I carried out into certain complaints of that kind, I do not believe that the vast bulk of such complaints is justified.</P>
    <P>I believe that the ACC have handled an extremely difficult and potentially chaotic situation extremely well in recent years.  As far as we are concerned, anything that can be done to provide more money through the ACC for the agricultural industry and to assist the ACC to become even more effective in dealing with the credit problems of agriculture will have our full support.  We regard this Bill as being in that category, and consequently it has our full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This is possibly one of the most important financial provisions that has been brought before this House.  It is somewhat overdue. It is dealing with one of the main sources of finance to the largest industry in the country.  We are living in a very rapidly changing world, particularly in relation to the agricultural sector.  The main problem in agriculture in Ireland is generally agreed to be one of starvation of capital and, following on recent thinking, a certain starvation of thought on how to use capital in agriculture properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been somewhat of a critic of the Agricultural Credit Corporation. I am not so much a critic now, but I still reserve my right to criticise where I feel it is proper to do so.  However, in relation to this proposed authority to extend borrowing, it is notable that deposits have provided much of the ACC's funds during the past few <Col N="1685" /> years; in other words, it has been left to the public to finance agriculture. In relation to the £41 million deposits, I would like to know the proportion of people in the agricultural sector who have provided those deposits.  My feeling is that a large part of those deposits comes from the agricultural sector, and it is likely now that with the increased demands on finance for agriculture there will be a lesser amount of deposits coming from the agricultural sector because the farmers will be utilising the money that they would otherwise deposit with the ACC.</P>
    <P>As the types of loans have been referred to by the Minister I think I would be relevant in dealing with loans and types of loans.  The Minister said that money has been made available from World Bank sources for livestock development.  Certain Press comments and articles have indicated that this money will be made available to the agricultural community and one interesting suggestion&mdash;I do not know if it is true or not&mdash;is that there should be a moratorium in relation to the repayment of loans.  That is a very vital aspect of lending in agriculture. Any of us who have association with agriculture know that when money is put into agriculture it requires some time to produce the return to repay or finance the loan particularly where agriculture is very short of capital. Possibly it will take longer to repay and the borrowing will possibly be correspondingly costly in relation to the operation of that farm.  It is really a matter of taking the farm up off its knees, making it stand upright and it has to walk after that.  This may be a poor analogy but I am trying to explain the problem.  I would, therefore, welcome any policy in the ACC which would provide a moratorium both in regard to repayment of capital and payment of interest.  If there was such a provision the utilisation of the borrowed money would be far more beneficial.</P>
    <P>At present we are probably dealing with larger units in borrowing from the ACC.  I have not been long in the House but I have had the <Col N="1686" /> slightly unfortunate experience of dealing with larger sums of money and I must confess that I have found a slight lack of co-operation between the banking sector and the ACC. This may be due to a misunderstanding in the past: I know there have been difficulties concerning bridging finance where the ultimate finance is being produced by the ACC.  This has created difficulties and for want of a better phrase there is a slight air of tension between the banking community and the ACC.  I should like to see that disappear and I should particularly like to see the utilisation of a document known as a <i>pari passu</i> agreement.  This is a very useful document in finance and is used quite frequently in big property developments where various banking sources are providing money.  It means that neither lender has priority.  There could be a situation where one source of finance has lent money and taken the security of the farmer, say, his title deeds.  The farmer wants more money but the source of finance is not prepared to give further accommodation. A second source is.  If the <i>pari passu</i> document is used second-line finance would be available and could deal with difficult situations, areas of pressure, whether on the side of lenders or borrowers.</P>
    <P>Another matter that has created a little surprise is this.  There is a document of security known as a bill of sale where you are dealing with a chattel.  A chattel mortgage is a very simple document which does not give rise to many legal technicalities.  We now have a situation where you have herd numbers and stock numbers under various schemes but our law at present appears to be that the granting of a bill of sale is illegal.  That is an extraordinary situation when there is a large cattle population, when the cattle can be identified for the purposes of a bill of sale but our premier lending institution cannot use a bill of sale nor can any banking institution do so.  It is prohibited, as I understand it, by one of the Agricultural Credit Acts.  Amendment of that part of the law is long overdue.  Such a document is available on the continent <Col N="1687" /> and in America.  Ireland is an agricultural country.  Why have we this block or embargo on an easy system of lending money and providing security to the lender?  I was a bit puzzled about Deputy Colley's remark in regard to the ACC dealing with a potentially chaotic situation.  He did not expand on that.  Possibly some member of his party may explain what was behind it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from a constituency where agriculture is of paramount importance I should like to join with other speakers in welcoming this measure.  I would also like to join Deputy Colley in paying tribute to the Board of ACC, its executive and staff, on the magnificent, indeed amazing, job they have made of the ACC in recent years.  I join with the Minister when he says that the ACC have played a significant role in promoting agriculture.  Their total investment in the industry now exceeds £65 million. When the ACC were first established their lending was in mere thousands of pounds.  Last year they spent £29 million and this year's estimated figure is £50 million.  That is a really remarkable achievement but when that figure reaches about £100 million per year we shall then be playing the part we must play in regard to investment in agriculture.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Colley I should be very disappointed if there was any falling off in deposits from the general public in the ACC.  As the Minister said, they have received £41 million in deposits from the public.  This was one of the remarkable successes of the ACC, that they were able to get, particularly from farmers&mdash;that is where that money should really come from&mdash;and from the general public that sum in deposits. It would be a great pity if there was any falling off.</P>
      <P>The Minister said the Exchequer is giving a short-term loan of £8 million and that the corporation may have to borrow a further £8 million abroad.  I would be slightly worried about this type of borrowing which could very well mean that interest rates would be very high, possibly too high for the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1688" /> The Minister says that in recent years many food processing firms are turning to the ACC for capital.  I have noticed this.  I have been told that very large sums have been invested in this type of firm.  I would consider that this industry might possibly be financed from some other source.  I agree that the food processing industry and other industries allied to agriculture are of vital importance but the financing of this type of industry might be undertaken by the IDA &mdash;I am sure they do assist to some extent&mdash;or some other body.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Looking to the future, it is likely that the demand for credit for agriculture will remain high over the next few years.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt about that.  The demand for investment in agriculture will certainly be very high.  I have mentioned a figure of £1 million per annum.  I believe that in the next five, six or ten years this could well be a minimum figure.</P>
    <P>I join with the other speakers in welcoming this Bill and I should like to pay tribute to the board for a job well done.  They have done a wonderful job over the past four or five years. Their work will certainly be very essential to the nation during the next few years, especially now that we are in the EEC and that agriculture is playing such an important part and will play a much bigger part in the economy over the next few years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHussey" hpid="Mr. Hussey Mr. Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with other speakers in welcoming this Bill, the purpose of which is to increase the statutory limit on borrowing by the ACC.  The figures outlined by the Minister indicate the faith the ACC have in the agricultural industry. It is important that credit should be available to our farmers so that they can avail of the many schemes in existence and make the maximum profit from their land.  Some years ago farmers would not dream of asking for credit, particularly small farmers in the west.  They were always afraid of credit.  In recent years we have seen a big change in this regard and now big and small farmers are prepared to <Col N="1689" /> go to the bank or to the ACC and avail of the facilities offered to improve the output from their land, to improve their farm buildings or dwelling houses.  This is very important but it is also important that when getting credit the farmers should have advice available to them on how to use this credit.  In the last 12 months farmers were advised to avail of credit.  They purchased livestock last spring at very high prices.  They also took land at very high prices.  It was no problem to get £40 and £50 per acre for grazing land, even in the west.  Now we see what has happened to the cattle industry.  Farmers are left with a large number of cattle on their hands.  They cannot sell them because of the fall in prices.</P>
      <P>It is important that farmers availing of credit facilities should be advised on how to spend the money and have a proper farm plan drawn up for them by their agricultural advisers or somebody from the ACC or wherever they are getting their credit.  It is a cause of great worry to farmers that after borrowing money and paying a very high interest rate, buying cattle at a very high price, taking land on the 11-months' system at a very high price, at the end of the year the bottom has fallen out of the market and they are left with stock on their hands or have to sell their stock at a loss.  This is a serious situation and it is one I am afraid that we have at present.</P>

    <P>I should like to refer to the temporary scheme that was brought into operation last year.  It was a scheme of loans at subsidised interest rates, mainly to help farmers who were affected by the brucellosis scheme and had to dispose of affected animals and replace them later.  The Minister said that it is proposed to finish the scheme very shortly.  I would ask him to reconsider this because at present some counties in the west are only beginning the brucellosis scheme.  In County Galway it only began this year and present indications are that a very large number of cattle in Galway are affected by brucellosis.  A few weeks ago a farmer not too far from my own home had 25 cows <Col N="1690" /> turned down.  This is a great loss to farmers.  Not alone can they not sell or freely move livestock during a 90-day period but they are also at the loss of the milk they would normally be sending to the creamery.  I would ask the Minister to continue this loan scheme for a further period.  It is very important that people should have money to replace such cattle.  It was an excellent scheme which helped many farmers in other counties who were fortunate enough to have been in the scheme earlier.  It would be disastrous, particularly for western farmers, if this scheme were to be finished now and if they had to borrow money to replace cattle at a very high interest rate.  I would ask the Minister to continue this scheme until such time as western counties are cleared because farmers there would not be able to avail of credit facilities from other institutions and pay interest rates of 11, 12 and 13 per cent.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the House for the manner in which they have received this Bill.  Throughout this debate and all debates these days on money availibility the crucial question is that of interest.  We had Deputies on both sides of the House naturally complaining about the high rates of interest which borrowers are required to pay.  At the same time we have continuing anxiety about the shortfall in the flow of money into organisations such as the ACC where, unfortunately, the buoyancy which in recent years was displayed in deposits has not been maintained this year.  I think we will be lucky if we achieve a rate of deposits this year comparable with last year.  Because of the massive growth in lending by the ACC this year the normal rate of deposits, even with the buoyancy displayed in recent years, would not be adequate to feed this colossal and very legitimate demand which exists for credit.  Last year the total amount of loans from the ACC was £28.9 million.  The corresponding figure for this year will be £45 million.  Even if there was not the considerable slowing down in the rate of expansion of deposits it would not be easy to feed <Col N="1691" /> this new demand.  We consider this to be a top priority.</P>
      <P>That is why, in addition to the original public capital programme we have paid an additional £8 million to the Agricultural Credit Corporation. We cannot think of any more important investment in this country at present than agriculture and we will make every effort to feed that legitimate demand in the belief that we will get the best return from it.  That would be true in normal circumstances but, as Deputy Colley pointed out, we now face a potentially very dangerous situation in industry which is more dependent on oil than is agriculture so that we will need everything we can get from agriculture in order that we might maintain some kind of decent economic and social prospects at home.  However, we cannot overlook the fact that agriculture, too, is dependent on oil to a large extent. Certainly, it is much more dependent on oil now than it was 20 years ago and, as the Minister for Transport and Power has indicated already, the Government will consider agriculture to be a priority area.  In relation to the use of oil in agriculture there is a greater return for every gallon used than there might be from some other activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the need to increase the flow of money to the ACC through deposits we have taken steps recently to increase the interest rates and shall continue to look at the position as circumstances require.  It is easy to get money if one offers very attractive terms.  One of the great pities today is that there are many schemes offering people very high rates of interest but perhaps people are not aware that the security offered for their investment might be illusory, whereas a body such as the ACC have the guarantee of the Minister for Finance so that money is always repayable. There have been such a multitude of new temptations being offered to people in recent times both here and abroad that people are not as prudent as they used to be in looking for security for their money.  I can only express the hope that nobody will <Col N="1692" /> have his fingers burned but anyone who might have that experience will have learned his lesson, that is, that when very high rates of interest are offered there is probably some risk involved. Therefore, the wisest thing in the long run is to invest in organisations such as the ACC which are secure and which spend any money they borrow in worthwhile investments to the benefit of our economy.  Some of the investments that have taken place through private organisations are highly speculative and probably socially disadvantageous.</P>
    <P>About 50 per cent of deposits in the ACC come from farmers.  In recent years the great buoyancy in deposits has arisen from the fact that the ACC have offices distributed throughout the country and also because farmers in some cases now have money over and above their normal spending requirements which they can invest in the ACC.</P>
    <P>I was asked what was the term of the Government short-term loan of £8 million.  It is for four years and, of the £8 million, £4 million is at 11¼ per cent and the other £4 million is at 12¼ per cent.  Deputy Esmonde spoke of the desirability of having a moratorium after the issuing of a loan.  This is legitimate particularly in agriculture where the prospects of getting an immediate return are slight.  There is a four-year moratorium on World Bank loans in respect of the principal, that is to say that no part of the principal will be paid for four years after the issuing of a loan although the interest would be payable.  For normal ACC loans there is a moratorium of a year and a half.</P>
    <P>I can understand the dissatisfaction on the part of some people regarding the requirements of the ACC in respect of the security required before a loan is given.  As any prudent person knows, when giving a loan one must ensure that it will be repaid.  In most cases the ACC are justified in reservations they may have about would-be borrowers.  I have brought to the attention of the ACC any cases that have come to my notice and these have been dealt with sympathetically.  The Minister for Finance often receives <Col N="1693" /> information in confidence which justifies the ACC refusing a loan.  Such information would not be given by the applicant to his TD or whoever he approached in connection with the loan and neither would it be fair for us to give any such information to the person making the representations.  By and large the ACC bend over backwards to assist farmers.  They are not unreasonable and when they refuse credit it is often in the best interest of the would-be borrower because nothing would be worse than to give a person money which he could not repay.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hussey raised the question of the termination of the existing scheme for small farmers.  This scheme receives a subsidy of 4 per cent in order to reduce the rate which must be paid on borrowings.  At the time of its introduction it was indicated that the scheme would be of short duration and that it would be tailored to the immediate requirements and opportunities of the EEC.  It will not be terminated until the new farm improvement scheme&mdash;EEC related&mdash;is introduced. That will be as and from the 1st January, 1974.  Then there will be a subsidy of 5 per cent so as to cushion the load of interest which the farmer will have to pay.  Therefore, it is a question of replacing an old scheme with a better one and one of longer duration.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne mentioned that £50 million was a generous amount but that perhaps £100 million would be required.  I do not disagree with that sentiment and I have acknowledged already the massive demand that agriculture is making on our available money.  We will make every effort possible to meet that demand.  The Deputy mentioned also that it might be more appropriate that some of the industrial concerns that are obtaining money from the ACC would seek their money elsewhere.  That is a matter we have discussed with the ACC and with other agencies.  It is legitimate and, perhaps, desirable to dovetail basic agricultural activity into industrial activity.  The borderline between what is essentially an agricultural and what is essentially an industrial process is often very hard <Col N="1694" /> to distinguish.  It might be compared to the difference between a bald man and a man with a head of hair&mdash;one does not know how many hairs he must lose before he is bald.  However, we would like to think that the ACC would concentrate on the traditional farming activities rather than become too involved in what are essentially industrial processes.  We must accept that there will be a mix.  I accept what Deputy Browne has said and I think the ACC are alive to it.  I believe I have covered the items which have been of some concern and interest to the Deputies.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with the other speakers in commending the chairman, the board of the ACC, and their staff, for their great skill and dedication which have certainly borne fruit to the great advantage of the farming community in recent times.  As we know this organisation commenced operations in 1927 and the people who gave birth to it could never have visualised it becoming the massive organisation which it now is.  As recently as ten years ago this organisation was advancing only 10 per cent of the credit required by the agricultural community but today it is advancing 30 per cent and is still growing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde mentioned that there is a certain tension between private banks and the ACC.  It is likely that as long as we have free competition in the money market we will have rivalry&mdash;I prefer to call it rivalry rather than tension&mdash;but we must commend the ACC, and the whole banking system, for their readiness to co-operate with one another.  This has become very obvious in recent times and it is a clear indication that ACC is now accepted as an established and legitimate creditworthy organisation which is serving a very useful social and economic function.  We believe that there is a place for them, and for the private banks, and that through working together the farming community will be able to obtain all the credit which they can reasonably use in the foreseeable future.</P>

      <P>That scheme will be phased out because it was intended to be of short duration.  However, as and from the 1st January we will have the new EEC farm moderinsation scheme under which loans will be available at a rate which will be subsidised to the extent of 5 per cent. While there is a different mix between the requirements in relation to the two loans, the small farmers Deputy Hussey has in mind will be able to get considerable benefit out of the new scheme.  It is not a question of cutting off all sources of money.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, as the Deputy is aware, world interest rates today, if one is a borrower, are not as attractive as they used be.  On the other hand they are very attractive for a lender.  We live in a world in which interest rates are rising everywhere and it is not possible, if we are to survive, to cut ourselves off from the rest of the world.  We are one of the most open economies in the world.  This EEC scheme will provide an interest-subsidy of 5 per cent and that is no small amount these days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which increases the amount the ACC can borrow.  I hope I am in order on this section in expressing my grave concern at the situation which the Minister touched on a few moments ago in response to my question on the Second Stage.  It is a matter of serious concern if the deposits from the general public in the ACC are going down rather than going up.  To the <Col N="1697" /> best of my knowledge up to March of this year there was a very substantial buoyancy and rate of increase in the deposits in the ACC.</P>
      <P>It appears now from what the Minister has said, although he did not have precise figures, that that position is reversed and that the rate of deposits in the ACC since March is going down.  This is an extremely serious position particularly in agriculture. On the Second Stage we dwelt on the vital importance of agriculture in our economy especially in these times and if there is any suggestion of a lack of confidence in the future of agriculture it could have very serious consequences.</P>
      <P>The Minister did say on the Second Stage in a somewhat different context, that there were many &mdash; I do not think he used the word gimmicky &mdash; different forms of investment available offering apparently very attractive rates which are not, in the long run, as reliable as an investment in the ACC.  The Minister did suggest that this range of attractive, or apparently attractive, alternatives was operating to take from the ACC and similar institutions deposits which they might otherwise receive.</P>
      <P>But while I would not like that position I think, if that is the position, things are not as bad as they might be. I doubt if that is the explanation.  The Minister will recall that any such alternative attractions as are available now were available in the past, certainly in the last few years when the pattern of deposits with the ACC from the general public was increasing all the time.  The Minister would be very unwise to accept that the reasons for the falling off in the deposits in the ACC were solely these alternative attractions which have been available in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of the problems to be faced with rising interest rates but I would point out to the Minister that the problem of rising interest rates is not a new one and that it did not start last March.  While people may think that the present interest rates are appallingly high it is conceivable, in certain circumstances, that they could go higher.  In that event present interest <Col N="1698" /> rates would be relatively the same as last year's interest rates are to the present interest rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look very closely at the reasons for the falling off of deposits in the ACC.  As the Minister knows, not only in regard to the ACC but in regard to other bodies also for which he is responsible, the matter seems to be a serious one, and one which is becoming more serious. In this context in relation to agriculture it is ominous.  The Minister should examine the position much more deeply than is indicated by the rather superficial explanation which he gave of attractive alternatives being available.  It is incumbent on the Minister to make a more detailed examination of the problem.  The Minister knows, as I do, that unless the deposits from the public are maintained at least at a reasonable level in a position where demand for credit is expanding at a greater rate than ever, it simply will not be possible for the Exchequer to bridge the gap if the gap becomes very large.</P>
    <P>It is right that an effort should be made to bridge the gap.  As the Minister has indicated, this is being done. The Minister knows, as I do, that there is a limit to the amount of money which the Exchequer can make available for this or any other purpose. Consequently, I urge the Minister to give extremely serious consideration to the underlying causes of the fall-off in deposits in the ACC.  Perhaps he could do so in conjunction with the board of the ACC or with the other advisers available to him.  The Minister should see whether there is any course open to him which would reverse this very ominous trend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I stick to my basic premise.  It is not one with which Deputy Colley or anyone else can disagree. The world is full of &ldquo;hot money&rdquo; at the moment.  Much of this money is very unsound and people are very foolish to be chasing it, but they are doing so.  As a result of this, long-established, solid institutions and some of the principal banks in the world are now in a position where they have to offer, for a variety of reasons including <Col N="1699" /> the availability of this &ldquo;hot money&rdquo;, interest rates to attract depositors which are 5 per cent higher than those obtaining in September, 1972.  That is a massive jump &mdash; 5 per cent higher than in September, 1972. In some cases this is an increase of nearly 130 per cent in interest rates.</P>
      <P>This is what is knocking the bottom out of organisations which traditionally have attracted money from small depositors who were seeking security and a steady interest flow.  The consequence of this is reflected here in the ACC intake and in the intake of many other institutions which collect money from a large number of small savers.  The ACC and other organisations in days of cooler and more sensible money behaviour attracted very large deposits from a variety of institutions who today prefer to put their money into some of the international markets where the overnight rate of interest can vary by anything between 5 per cent and 20 per cent. This money is being sloshed around the world by the multi-millionaires and is something, as Deputy Colley knows, even the World Bank notices.  The situation is not being made any easier by the experiences of the biggest moneymakers in the world &mdash; those of the Arab countries &mdash; who now find they can make more money by selling only a small fraction of what they used to sell, and they can build up bigger deposits.  It is a crazy world.  I am not saying that on that account we must give in to it.  It would be idle, if we are to have a debate on credit, to overlook these factors and the very substantial forces which are at work throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be wrong, as Deputy Colley has suggested, that anybody should interpret the position of the ACC as indicating lack of confidence in Irish agriculture.  Nobody but a lunatic today would be miserable about the prospects for Irish agriculture.  This year alone the income from agriculture in Ireland has increased by 40 per cent.  It is not a question of agriculture having either a poor present or a gloomy future.  It is quite the reverse. <Col N="1700" /> It is obviously a very sensible form of investment.</P>
    <P>We face the problems which face any Minister for Finance today. Money rates are such that it is extremely difficult to attract sufficient money to meet the requirements of legitimate investment.  We hope that this situation will last only for a short time, but we are not even certain of that.  The Finance Ministers of the EEC will be meeting next Monday and Tuesday to try to find a solution to this problem.  A solution would be a nice Christmas present to bring home if it could be found.  If we do not do so, that will not have happened because of lack of effort.</P>
    <P>As we sit here today there are likely to be some very cold draughts blowing on the London market.  No matter what steps we take it is improbable that we will avoid having to face some of the unpleasant consequences. These unpleasant realities must be faced.  If deposits cannot be maintained and money attracted through normal sources there is an obvious limit to the capacity of the Exchequer to make good the shortfall. That would be particularly so at a time when revenue is not likely to be as buoyant as it has been in the past, and if international economic forces develop in the way some people fear at the present time.</P>
    <P>This section of the Bill is doing no more than authorising the ACC to increase their borrowing capacity from £70 million to £120 million.  As was said, this is the least we can do but probably more will be required. It is a sound investment and we could not borrow for a better purpose.  The ACC and the Government will borrow the money at the very best possible rates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I referred in some detail to the situation that has been disclosed in relation to the last national loan and the considerable disimprovement in the savings situation as far as prize bonds, national instalment savings and savings certificates are concerned.  I pointed out the startling drop in public subscriptions to the recent national loan from £27.7 million to £8.8 million, or approximately 30 per cent of what was got last year.  I expressed the view that if we had the figures in relation to other traditional forms of <Col N="1702" /> investments or savings they would very likely display the same trend.  I did not have those figures last night but I have the advantage this morning that as a result of the debate which has just concluded on the Agricultural Credit Bill, we now have an indication of the trend of the figures in relation to investment in the Agricultural Credit Corporation.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said this morning in relation to the Agricultural Credit Corporation:</P>
      <P>The inflow of deposits was so buoyant in the years 1968-69 to 1972-73 that receipts from deposits plus repayments on existing loans were sufficient to finance the corporation's entire lending programme.</P>
      <P>That was a very satisfactory situation. It was well known that the ACC in each of the past five or six years were going from strength to strength every year, that their lending was increasing at a commendable rate, that they were making a magnificent contribution to the development of financing of agriculture particularly at the important stage leading up to our EEC entry.  One would have hoped that that trend would have continued.</P>
      <P>We now find, and it is rather shocking to find it even though in the light of what we were examining last night it is not surprising, that the trend has reversed, that this steady increase in the inflow of funds to the ACC since 1968 has come to an end and that the situation is going in the opposite direction.  The Minister for Finance this morning gave us the information that the ACC this year will get £16 million elsewhere to make up for what they are not getting from the investing public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Colley asked if the Minister could give figures in relation to the current financial year of the amount of deposits or the fall-off in deposits. The Minister said he had not that information and that he could not give the figures.  At the same time, the Minister was able to tell the House that the amount of money the ACC will have to get from the Exchequer and from foreign borrowing in this financial year is £16 million.  No doubt <Col N="1703" /> the Department of Finance and the Board of ACC did not decide on this extraordinary borrowing of £16 million without knowing precisely where they stood.  They must have realised and had figures to show that their shortfall this year would be £16 million.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister for Finance made any serious effort to discover the figures in relation to deposits from 1st April this year, or is it the case, as we had here on 4th December of this year, that the Minister was very unwilling, for obvious reasons, to disclose the figures, and that he endeavoured to pluck them up in a written answer to prevent supplementary questions being asked on them in relation to the national loan, prize bonds, savings certificates and so on?  I doubt very much if the Minister could come in here and tell us that the ACC will have to get £8 million from the Exchequer and the same amount from abroad this year unless he knew exactly what the falling off in investment in the ACC is this year.</P>
    <P>We now have five examples in the past couple of weeks of figures given of the falling off in investment particularly from small investors.  The five things concerned are all of vital importance to this country &mdash; the national loan, the ACC, prize bonds, national instalment savings and saving certificates.  The trend in all five of them is very serious.  This trend is being compensated for by what is described as a short-term loan of £8 million from the Exchequer this year and foreign borrowing of the same amount.</P>
    <P>This consistent recourse to foreign borrowing by the Government in this financial year will bleed this country dry.  We had the figures in the Taoiseach's speech yesterday of the enormous increase in borrowing, particularly in foreign borrowing, in this financial year.  This morning we had another example of it.  This foreign borrowing is not money given to us freely from abroad: we pay very dearly for it.  It is much more unsatisfactory from the national point of <Col N="1704" /> view that we should be running abroad now to banks and other institutions looking for money to try to keep this country going than that the money should be borrowed from the savings and the production of our own people at home.  The tragic truth is, and it is only slowly being revealed, that the savings of our people at home are no longer going into the places where they traditionally went into, the places where they can most benefit this nation.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of money around and it is not all the sort of hot money that the Minister for Finance spoke about this morning.  The man with £500 or £1,000 to invest is not a man who is investing that money at overnight rates on the London market or in Zurich.  He is not that sophisticated, and even if he were the amount of capital available to him is not adequate for that purpose because the London and Zurich overnight markets are not interested in £1,000. They will talk to you if you have a quarter or a half million pounds, perhaps, but not with a small quantity like that in your hand.</P>
    <P>The explanation for this is not simply these international trends which, proportionately speaking, as Deputy Colley pointed out this morning, are now worse this year than they were last year, or last year as against the year before; the explanation is simply a lack of confidence engendered in the last nine months by the economic policy of the Government, a lack of confidence that is caused by the bitter memories of so many people of what happened before under a Government such as this, the great fear that this will happen again.  I am afraid that fear is one which is in the process of being realised and it is a tragic situation for this country that it should be so.</P>
    <P>Before the House rose last night I was discussing the security situation and the fact that there has been no change whatever in the policy of this Government on security matters from the policy which I followed during the time I was in office.  In particular there was no change in the use of the <Col N="1705" /> legislation which I promoted and got through in this House with considerable difficulty against the opposition of many members of the present Government. I said that I felt that that was a vindication of what I had done and of the legislation I had promoted during the term of office of the last Government.  As well as being a vindication of what we did at that time it is also the clearest possible exposure of the fraudulent nature of the vehement opposition made to the security policy of the last Government and the legislation promoted by them on those lines.</P>
    <P>When one recalls the lengthy and acrimonious debates in relation to what we did by way of legislation in 1971 and 1972 and finds the results of that legislation enacted during those years being used now by the present Government in precisely the same way we had used it while in office, one realises just how false and fraudulent that opposition was at the time.</P>
    <P>While there may be no change whatever from the policy of the previous Government in relation to security measures, there is a very major change in policy by this present Government compared with the last in relation to another aspect of the workings of the Department of Justice and that is the approach of this Government to judicial appointments within this State as compared to the approach of the last Government.  A number of people were disturbed during the last month or two at some things that were happening but yesterday's happening crowned them all. Four men have been appointed to the High and Circuit Courts in recent months.  These four men have something in common: two of them are former Fine Gael TDs and the other two are former Fine Gael general election candidates who were not successful.  I know three of the four men and regard them as competent. I do not know the fourth man but I have no reason to doubt that he is a reasonably competent lawyer.  I have no specific or precise objection to the appointment to the Judiciary of any one of them, But, in common with <Col N="1706" /> many people, I believe it is not a case of justice being seen to be done that four prominent Fine Gael supporters were appointed to the highest courts in the land within a matter of weeks of one another.</P>
    <P>I should like to contrast that situation with what happened in the years 1970 to 1973.  A number of vacancies occurred, as they do from time to time, in the various courts.  A number of appointments were made by the then Government to fill those vacancies.  The then Government went out of their way to ensure that only the best qualified people would be appointed to these vacancies.  I can fairly claim that that was so.  It happened that in our search for the best and most suitable lawyers one of those whom we appointed had formerly been a Fine Gael TD.  Another man whom we appointed to a very high office in the Judiciary had formerly been closely associated with the Fine Gael Party.  We can fairly claim that we took no account whatever of the political feelings, or former political feelings, of the lawyers whom we considered for appointment to the Judiciary.  The only criterion we used was their ability as lawyers and their suitability as judges.</P>
    <P>There was widespread recognition of the fact that, possibly for the first time in the history of this country, judges were appointed, and clearly seen to be appointed, on merit over the last four or five years.  A number of people were very pleased that that should be so.  It was felt in many places that the days of this petty repayment of political supporters by appointment to the Judiciary were over.  If Fianna Fáil had remained in power that silly and childish system of patronage would have remained out of operation.</P>
    <P>The Government changed in March of this year and an awful lot changed with it.  One of the most disgusting changes is the performance we have seen in relation to these judicial appointments in the past two or three months.  I venture to suggest that, if a year ago the Government of which I was a member had appointed four Fianna Fáil TDs; or ex-TDs, or four <Col N="1707" /> Fianna Fáil defeated candidates, to the highest courts in this land, there would have been a public outcry from the Fine Gael and Labour Parties and the Press.  Fine Gael, aided and abetted by Labour, have now appointed four men who could not be more closely associated with them, one of them having spent 25 years in this House on the Fine Gael benches, another having spent ten or 12 years here and two more having unsuccessfully fought a number of elections for them.  Yet there was not a murmur from anyone until I opened my mouth here today. Is one entitled to ask: are there two standards in this country?  Is a certain thing wrong when Fianna Fáil do it but the very same thing right when the Coalition do it?  I do not know who will reply to this debate because I understand that the Taoiseach is about to leave the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Tánaiste replies I hope he will deal with this matter because it needs an explanation.  It will shatter public confidence in not just the courts but in other institutions if this sort of thing is allowed to continue. If the courts are to be used in this way, and publicly seen to be used in this way, to compensate people who unsuccessfully sought high office, is there any guarantee that the Garda Síochána and the Army will not be used in a similar fashion?  Is there any guarantee that the Civil Service, notwithstanding the legislation that governs it, will not be used for a similar purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not easy to get all the precise facts one would wish to get regarding these matters.  Deputy Dowling recently addressed a series of questions to each Minister in relation to the appointments made by him in his Department outside the normal Civil Service procedure since the present Government took office.  Some of the answers to the questions were very revealing.  I do not intend to go into them in detail but it is a matter that might profitably be investigated by someone who has the time and the inclination.  We have seen the appointment in most Departments <Col N="1708" /> of people to advise or to assist Ministers in one way or another.  The people so appointed invariably seem to have been part of the staff of the political party of that particular Minister.</P>
    <P>I understand there is a situation where one of the persons so appointed happens to be a member of a local authority.  My understanding of the position of civil servants, whether appointed through the normal Civil Service Commission procedure or appointed in the way some of these people have been appointed, is that they are not entitled to retain membership of a local authority when they become civil servants or, if they are civil servants, they are not entitled to be elected members of a local authority. However, one member of a local authority who was appointed to a Department in April last is still a member of that local authority.</P>
    <P>To my personal knowledge, one person was appointed a civil servant in the Department of Justice shortly after the present Government took office.  I understand the gentleman in question has yet to start work in that Department and that he confines his activities to acting in a clerical or advisory capacity to a political party here in this House.  I understand he spends his working day in this House, not in the Department, that he spends his day with backbench Deputies of that party, not with the Minister for Justice.  I believe he was seconded &mdash; if I might use that word &mdash; from the Department of Justice to Carrickmacross, County Monaghan, for two weeks before a recent event in Monaghan and that he performed his duties on behalf of the Department of Justice, which are costing the taxpayer £35.91 weekly according to a reply given in this House, and that he performed his duties on behalf of the Department in the headquarters of a political party in Carrickmacross.</P>
    <P>All these matters might be looked into by those who have the time to do so.  There is a very fruitful field to be studied in regard to the blatant patronage that has taken place in the past nine months under this Government. When I think of the crocodile tears and the bleeding hearts that criticised Fianna Fáil during the years for allegedly looking after their own, these <Col N="1709" /> nine months have painfully shown us where the truth lies in that regard.</P>
    <P>Patronage, as it has existed in the last nine months, is not even confined to the Judiciary and the Civil Service. We had the unseemly spectacle not long after the Government took office where the most distinguished soldier in this country, for ten years Chief of Staff of our forces and for several years Chief of Staff of the United Nations forces in the Congo, and a man who has given tremendous service to this country, was telephoned by the Minister for Defence and informed that he was dismissed from his position as chairman of the Army Pensions Board.  His period of office had not expired and, I understand, it was not even remotely near expiration. Nonetheless, he was telephoned and summarily told that his term of office had ended.  Some weeks later he was replaced as chairman of this board.  The position is part-time and the salary is reasonable considering the job is not full-time.  The replacement for one of the most distinguished soldiers this country has ever known turned out to be a rather eccentric gentleman from Dún Laoghaire who, among his other occupations, happens to be chairman of the Fine Gael executive in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.</P>

I have given examples of these kind of happenings in the last nine months but I have by no means exhausted the list.  I did not go to any great trouble to find out those facts and I have no doubt that had I made iniquiries that list would be much longer.  For example, I have not made any reference to the extraordinary appointment of a flower arranger in the Department of Foreign Affairs. This is at a cost of £25 per week from the public purse.  As to the identity of the flower arranger, with a salary of £25 per week plus a free flat, I shall leave that to somebody else.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately in the course of the current year no discussions took place in this House on health matters.  I hope I shall be excused for making some reference to them in this debate because I was recently appointed spokesman for the Opposition on health and because I feel it would be wrong to let this debate pass without some reference to what is or is not happening, as the case may be, with regard to health.</P>
      <P>The first thing I want to say is that there are many very serious problems relating to health which, I am afraid, are not being dealt with.  Perhaps in the short term, at least, the most urgent is the drug situation.  The former distinguished Minister for Health, now the President of Ireland, did an enormous amount of work with his advisers on a new Bill to bring our legislation on the abuse of drugs up to date.  I had many consultations with him when I was Minister for Justice because there was a fair amount of overlapping in relation to that Bill between the Departments of Health and Justice.  It was a difficult Bill to draft and there were many crucial decisions to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The former Minister for Health was under almost continuous pressure during the years 1971 and 1972 from a number of Deputies now on the opposite side of the House to produce this Bill and to have in it very heavy penalties particularly in relation to drug pushers.  The then Minister introduced the Bill and circulated it early in January, 1973, I think.  This Bill would have been taken in February, 1973, if the general election had not taken place with the resulting change of Government.  It would have been debated here in February because it was recognised by everybody on all sides of the House, and not least by the then Minister, that the problem was very serious and was very urgently in need of rectification, that the powers of the Garda in relation to drugs needed to be strengthened considerably and that our law <Col N="1711" /> needed to take cognisance of all the new practices and substances which unfortunately and tragically are now abused here.</P>
    <P>The Government changed.  One would have thought that one of the first things the new Government would have done would have been to re-introduce the Bill which existed, which had been published and circulated to Deputies, which was comprehensive and thorough and which did the sort of thing Deputies on all sides of the House had been looking for, for two years previously.  Amazingly that was not so.  They went right through the summer without either re-introducing the existing Bill or bringing in a new Bill.  When I made inquiries from the Minister for Health about it some weeks ago I was told in a rather off-hand way that they were drafting a new Bill, that he did not really know when it would be ready, but he hoped it might be soon. That would seem to indicate that there is not much possibility of seeing the bill within six months.</P>
    <P>I regard this drug problem as one of the most serious problems facing the country at present.  It is deplorable that when there is a Bill fully drafted and published to deal with this problem &mdash; and I am sure it would go through the House quickly &mdash; it should be left there, thrown there, apparently not because the Bill is not adequate or suitable, but simply because Fianna Fáil produced it.  The Government should forget about those sort of things and think of the number of people who have died from the abuse of drugs since that Bill was introduced, think of the amount of suffering that is being caused to so many young men and women who abuse drugs, the amount of suffering caused to their families and friends who see them in the condition they are now in, and think of how much of that suffering could be avoided by the speedy passage of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Government to think of the impotence of the Garda in relation to so much of this problem because the legislation they require, and which is contained in that Bill, has still not been passed <Col N="1712" /> through the House.  I do not know why the Government should fail to bring in the Bill when, with one solitary exception, the Constituencies Bill, every other Bill they have introduced since they took up office nine months ago was a Fianna Fáil Bill. Many of those Bills were important enough in their own way but they were not vitally urgent.  If there was ever a Bill which was vitally urgent to try to cut down on the terrible and horrible suffering of people who are abusing drugs, the Misuse of Drugs Bill, 1972, is it.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the Minister for Health is replying to this debate I put the proposition to him that, on behalf of this party, I will introduce this Bill as a Private Members Bill if he will give me an undertaking that the Government will not oppose it.  It may be that he does not wish to bring it in himself because it was prepared and published by the President.  We can get over that difficulty if he will agree with me and if the Government will give reasonable time to the passage of what must surely, in the opinion of anyone with any humanity in him, be the most urgently needed Bill in the country at present.</P>
    <P>Would it not have been so much more useful if all those long and arid and useless days which were spent debating <i>ad nauseam</i> Estimates which were already fully discussed had not been wasted in that manner by the Government in the way they are ordering business but had been devoted to discussion on this very serious topic?  Instead of six hours of Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan on local government, would it not have been much better to have six hours of the Minister for Health and the Opposition on the Misuse of Drugs Bill?  One would think from the attitude of the Government that there was not a drug problem and that there was not this terrible, horrible suffering going on.  One would think they had to start from scratch to prepare legislation to counteract it.  Instead, a thoroughly researched Bill was published in January, I think, of this year.  It makes one wonder what sense of priorities the Government have that <Col N="1713" /> they can inflict Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan for six hours on local government on this House and not order these important matters which are awaiting debate.</P>
    <P>The only positive thing we have heard in regard to health matters since March is that on 1st April next the Government propose to extend to the remaining 10 per cent of the population the hospital services at present enjoyed by the other 90 per cent, enjoyed either totally freely by those who have medical cards &mdash; which is 40 per cent or so of the population &mdash; or enjoyed at a cost of 15p per week or £7 per year by those who come within the category of eligible patients.  That 15p per week or £7 per year is now so small in modern terms that one could virtually say that at the moment 90 per cent of the population have free hospital services as a result of the considerable extensions brought about by the Health Act, 1970, and the regulations made under it in 1971 by the then Minister, Deputy Childers.</P>
    <P>We have, however, the rather curious situation that the only proposed action by the leader of the Labour Party, the man who assured us that the seventies would be socialised, is to extend this health service to the best of 10 per cent in our community. Unfortunately there has been no discussion of that proposal in this House. It needs fairly detailed analysis, but I do not think this debate is a suitable vehicle for making that analysis; it should be a debate on the Department of Health or a debate on whatever regulations are necessary to carry this proposal into effect.  It certainly has all the hallmarks of ideology gone mad because, in order to be able to say there is a comprehensive health service, at least so far as hospitals are concerned, the Minister for Health introduces an extension of the existing scheme to cover the best of 10 per cent or 300,000 people in the community, many of whom neither need nor desire to be covered in this way.</P>
    <P>In many ways it is commendable that another 300,000 people should have free hospitalisation.  Many of these would, even though they are comparatively well off, often find difficulty in paying for hospital <Col N="1714" /> services which are so very, very dear nowadays and it gives a certain peace of mind to many of these people who would not otherwise have that peace of mind.  But the immediate result of the proposal is to overload a hospital service which at the moment is stretched to the limit and the greatest losers in this overloading will, I am afraid, be the weakest people in the community.  They will be the medical card holders.</P>
    <P>Another 300,000 people are thrown on to the public service in hospitals, a service which is only barely able to cope at the moment.  Indeed, I understand that in relation to some of the health board areas there is now an extensive and ever-growing waiting list in regard to different forms of treatment and non-acute operations and that whole situation will be compounded and made much more difficult and those who will unquestionably suffer are those at the opposite end of the scale.</P>
    <P>A Government with a proper sense of priorities would not bother for ideological reasons to facilitate the top, in economic terms, 300,000, but would try to ensure that a better, fuller and quicker service was available for those who clearly cannot pay but whose entitlement is as great, or perhaps greater, than is that of those at the top of the economic scale.  The Minister in his proposal may well be repeating the errors made during the years of other Coalition Ministers for Health whose anxiety was to extend the institutions of health rather than the system and the services.  We should now realise that this institution mentality, inherited from the British system, a system imposed on us in the 19th century, of putting those in need of care into institutions, irrespective of whether or not they should properly be in these institutions, is something which we will carry as a legacy.  It is an attitude of mind of which we must rapidly rid ourselves.</P>
    <P>We have had examples in the last few years, in particular under the inspired encouragement of the President of Ireland when he was Minister for Health, of a tremendous development in community care in relation to <Col N="1715" /> the sick, the aged and the mentally and physically handicapped.  In three particular areas we have seen the tremendous success attendant upon the building up of a community spirit to help those who are disadvantaged in one way or another but who are not in need of permanent institutional care.  The three places in which we have seen that operate most successfully are the cities of Limerick, Cork and Kilkenny.  The benefits to those looked after in this way are from a medical point of view truly enormous.</P>
    <P>There is always a reluctance on the part of people to go into what used to be known as the county or city home. That reluctance is understandable. Many people just fade away after going into these institutions.  They are uprooted from their own locality and from their friends and they lose interest in life.  That situation has changed considerably over the past three or four years in the three cities I have mentioned.  This is the sort of system and these are the methods that the present Minister should be seeking to extend to the whole country because, not alone are these community supports valuable to those in need of care, but they are good economically.</P>
    <P>The cost to the Exchequer of providing a thorough and even a sophisticated community care or support service is considerably less than the cost of maintaining someone in an institution. The most important thing is not, however, the economic benefits but the fact that someone who may through increasing age or infirmity find it difficult to look after himself or herself will actually thrive if looked after at home through the medium of regular visits from trained social workers and from neighbours.  Too many of our institutions for the old are filled with persons in need of shelter rather than in need of hospitalisation. With health costs at their present enormously high rate it is foolish and futile to think in terms of more institutions for either geriatric patients or the mentally or physically handicapped when these people can be maintained at far less cost in their own community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1716" /> We have the situation also that bed occupancy in nearly all our hospitals is at an abnormally, almost dangerously, high level.  It is regularly over 90 per cent.  In some cases I believe it is the almost impossible figure of 100 per cent.  There are supposed to be beds available for acute cases but the fact is that there are long waiting lists because these beds are occupied by old people who do not have anyone to look after them, who are not ill and whose only need is shelter, food and warmth.</P>
    <P>Surely that shelter, food and warmth can be given to those people in their own homes by their own community.  Surely the Minister for Health must realise that the success of these community care schemes in the cities of Limerick, Cork and Kilkenny has been so demonstrably proved that he should think in terms of extending that system to the country as a whole, of increasing the financial support for that, and not to think, as he seems to do, in terms of institutions and institutionalisation only, not to think in terms of getting more and more people into the hospitals but to think in terms of getting more and more people out of hospitals, to have in our hospitals only those who are acutely ill, who are in need of constant, serious medical attention.</P>
    <P>I have spoken at some length on these and other matters and, indeed, from a few headings I have here in front of me, there are a number of other things I would like to talk about.  I never got at all as far as the Sunningdale Agreement, nor have I dealt with the European Economic Community.  However, having spoken at some length, I think it might be unfair if I continued to speak any longer.  I want simply to sum up my remarks by saying I am seriously disturbed by the limited indication we have got in recent weeks of economic trends in this country.  I am afraid that this period beginning in 1973 and ending whenever it will, but hopefully soon, will be very reminiscent of two other periods when we had precisely the same economic trends for precisely the same reasons that we have <Col N="1717" /> them now.  The fact that the people have lost confidence is not due to oil shortages in the Middle East.  It is not due to all these external economic factors in which the Minister for Finance seeks to take refuge.  It is due to the fact that we have a Coalition Government in this country, and confidence will return to the people when we no longer have a Coalition Government.</P>

      <P>Out of charity to Deputy O'Malley I rise with a prayer that his wit will soon return to him.  I should also like to point out to him before he runs away that the gospel which he preached in his last sentence is entirely in conflict with the concept of a Council of Ireland and the great relief which the people of Ireland as a whole expressed when, at the conclusion of the Sunningdale Conference, they heard we were about to create in Ireland the greatest coalition which offered the greatest promise, because people of very different, conflicting political, cultural and religious views had decided to put aside their points of disagreement and to work instead within the areas of agreement.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley acknowledged at the end of his contribution that he ignored Sunningdale, because he had not got sufficient greatness of mind to rise to that occasion.  Instead he embarked upon one of the most contemptible attacks I have ever heard in this House on people who can be clearly identified and are not in a position to defend themselves.  There is no need for me or anybody else to say any words in reply to a person who abuses his position in this House to attack such a wide range of people who have given very distinguished service to this community in a multitude of ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meeting of the Tripartite Conference at Sunningdale was an occasion unprecedented in the history of Ireland.  Analogies have been drawn and no doubt will be drawn with other negotiations, but unlike all previous parleys between British and Irish chiefs, on this occasion the discussions have been between two sovereign States and the democratically elected representatives of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland who wish to live out <Col N="1718" /> their lives in peace and harmony and do not desire a conquest, be it military or verbal, over others.</P>
    <P>The outcome of the conference is, in an Irish/British, Nationalist/Unionist context, astounding and almost incredible, if you reflect for any length upon our history.  We have produced a ananimous agreement freely entered into to co-operate in establishing in Ireland a partnership for peace and prosperity, a joint venture for a better life for everybody in all parts of this island.  A unique pledge from Britain has also been given for the first time to support this grand enterprise.</P>
    <P>This agreement has been achieved without serious sacrifice of anybody's aspirations; indeed, I can say without any sacrifice of principle by any of the participants.  Nobody has been bludgeoned or cajoled or conned into signing it.  Nobody has been sold out or compromised or jeopardised by this agreement and by what we have achieved by this agreement.  There has been no secret deal, no conspiracy, but there has been understanding, goodwill, generosity, and mutual determination, publicly declared, to get positive, beneficial and real results from the negotiations which began in Sunningdale and which we hope and dream, having started, will never stop.</P>
    <P>The talks have succeeded because the intransigence and irreconcilability which have been such a feature of our history in the past were absent on this occasion.  The protagonists of such notions as &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo;, the &ldquo;irresistible force&rdquo; and the &ldquo;immovable object&rdquo;, absented themselves, because bigot and fanatic have no time for moderation, reason, understanding or the basic principle which most people respect of &ldquo;live and let live&rdquo;. For the first time since the Act of Union of 1800 we shall now have in this island an assembly and an executive representing the people of every part of Ireland and reflecting every shade of political opinion, allegiance and creed.  It will be an assembly superior to the pre-1800 institutions because at that time people of certain religious beliefs were excluded.  From now on nobody will be excluded except those who by their own volition refuse to come.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1719" /> The 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty was described as a stepping stone.  Very sincere men who loved their country and who were anxious to work for its betterment disagreed about that description. There is no point now in any argument on the part of those of us who were not then alive as to who was right or wrong, but what we do know is that nobody who disagreed wanted a civil war, and the people who suffered the bitterness and tragedy of the terrible disagreement that followed would not want the same to happen again.</P>
    <P>The Council of Ireland now proposed is to me a bridge or causeway which can rise over the sea of suspicion, hatred and misunderstanding which has separated the different communities and traditions of the people in this island.  It can span the abyss of prejudice, ignorance and intolerance which is the legacy of our history.  Unfortunately, some of our contemporaries do not see the Council of Ireland as that.  Perhaps those who see the Council of Ireland as a bridge find it difficult to accept as sincere those who would attack it but I suppose there are those who genuinely believe they belong to the age of the troglodytes or dinosaurs and who view bridges with great suspicion and are concerned only to undermine them and topple them and certainly fear that they should ever cross them.</P>
    <P>There is now a simple choice for every man and woman in this island, either to try to destroy or refuse to cross and use that bridge, which is the Council of Ireland, or to join with the bridge-builders, to use the bridge, to meet people in the middle of it and, having met them, to cross and recross that bridge so that we can better get to know and love our neighbours. There is little difference between those who belittle the Sunningdale communiqué and those fanatical maniacs who last week physically assaulted fellow-members of the Northern Ireland Assembly.  The one thing these two groups of attackers do not want is that the builders of new institutions should succeed.  There will <Col N="1720" /> come a time when the events of 6th, 7th, 8th and 9th of December, 1973, can be analysed dispassionately and objectively by historians but I feel sure the light of history when it comes quietly and accurately to record those events will see that Liam Cosgrave's calmness, compassion and integrity was the labour which bound conflicting elements together and if we as a people display the same virtues in months and years ahead, I believe Sunningdale can be a great beginning. The overwhelming hope of the people of this island, the ambition of the ordinary man, woman and child is to be happy within the family circle and about their daily labours.  Those people want peace.  This Sunningdale aspiration can give them that and to offer the Irish people anything less than that would be to do them a serious and unforgiveable violence.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies here and commentators elsewhere have naturally sought for some elucidation of some paragraphs of the communiqué but, as the Taoiseach said, it would probably not be helpful to seek to parse and analyse any items of this communiqué which could be misunderstood elsewhere and we shall leave it to the growing spirit of co-operation in this country to develop this agreement in the positive way in which it can be most beneficial.</P>
    <P>But I should like to deal with the executive and harmonising functions and the consultative role which are specifically referred to in the communiqué. In view of the number of major complex matters that had to be dealt with at the conference and of the administrative complexities obviously involved in the field of functions and of transferring functions there was not sufficient time to get down to details of the executive and harmonising functions of the new Council of Ireland.  It was decided therefore, as a matter of common sense, that these would be the subject of further and more intense study to be carried out urgently and to be completed, as far as possible, sufficiently in advance of the next formal stage of the conference, which is to be held towards the end of January, to enable specific provision <Col N="1721" /> to be made for them in the agreement which will be signed at the conference. It may well be that it will not be found possible in the time available to reach agreement on all the matters in relation to which the Council will have executive or harmonising functions or a consultative role, but to the extent that agreement is reached &mdash; and we believe that a very substantial and wide-ranging agreement will be reached &mdash; they will be specifically provided for in the formal agreement.</P>
    <P>The intention of the parties is to provide also for the addition and elaboration of further items according as they are examined, agreed on and defined in the period following the agreement and later by the Council of Ministers in the light of experience after the establishment and operation of the Council of Ireland.  Arrangements are already in hand for the studies contemplated in the agreement and meetings of experts will take place next week and in following weeks to sort out the details of organisation, administration, personnel and financing and so on which will be involved in transferring executive functions to the Council of Ireland and even more so in giving to the Council the machinery and powers to carry executive decisions into effect.</P>
    <P>Our aim is to ensure that the agreement will contain positive provision for the Council of Ireland to have a substantial content of executive and harmonising functions from the outset in order to establish it firmly as a body with real powers and greater possibilities for growth arising out of the mutual trust generated by Irishmen and women working together.  I want to dispel any ideas that the Council would be merely a showpiece or a token body with little or no impact. At the same time I want to give an assurance that neither stress nor chicanery will be used by the representatives of the Irish Government or the Dáil to force reluctant members from Northern Ireland to go any faster than they want to go.</P>
    <P>There is among sensible people on either side of the Irish political divide a much greater readiness to co-operate <Col N="1722" /> to mutual advantage than has been possible under existing institutions or than could often be admitted in public because of the spleen which so many ill-disposed people were ready to spread.  The Council of Ireland can and will become a vehicle of genuine co-operation without anybody trying to force anybody else at a pace he would find unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Certain criteria which should command general support are set out in the communiqué.  We think that no reasonable person could quarrel with the objectives which the communiqué adumbrates for the executive functions of the council.  Those objectives are (1) to achieve the best utilisation of scarce skills, expertise and resources; (2) to avoid, in the interests of economy and efficiency, unnecessary duplication of effort; (3) to ensure complementary rather than competitive effort where this is to the advantage of agriculture, commerce and industry.  In view of the innovatory character of the council it is clear that much thought and study must go into the task of selecting matters which can more effectively and harmoniously achieve these objectives.</P>
    <P>The communiqué also contains a list of contemplated specific functions. I should like to emphasise that this list is by no means exhaustive.  The list includes the following: exploitation, conservation and development of natural resources and the environment; agricultural matters including agricultural research, animal health and operational aspects of the common agricultural policy; forestry and fisheries; co-operative ventures in the fields of trade, industry, electricity generation, tourism, roads and transport; advisory services in the fields of public health, sport, culture and the arts.</P>
    <P>We had very wide-ranging and very friendly and fruitful discussions at Sunningdale on these and other activities. There was hardly ever discussion on any of these activities in which all parties were not involved, even when informal chats were taking place. People went out of their way to make sure that people representing different <Col N="1723" /> attitudes and different political opinions were brought in on them.</P>
    <P>When we came to the drafting stage it became a matter of drawing up a fairly simple but representative list.  As I said earlier, this inventory does not in any way prejudice the inclusion of other functions from time to time.  We expect that future inspiration would come not alone from the Council of Ministers but from the Consultative Assembly which will be fully representative of this Dáil, both Government and Opposition, and likewise would represent all interests in the Northern Assembly.  The council can have new functions developed to it from time to time and the devolution of these functions will be a matter for Oireachtas Éireann and for the Northern Ireland Assembly.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary, therefore, to secure the agreement of the two administrations, North and South, on the extent of the functions to be undertaken by the council.  We must see of course this involves agreement, but agreement between Irishmen is desirable in itself and we should not see agreement as an undesirable constraint. The British Government may have a particular financial or other interest so long as they are involved in Northern Ireland.  Interests other than the financial one would include matters possibly arising in the EEC context but people North and South in Ireland today recognise that, as far as the inhabitants of this island are concerned the views of the Dublin Government would probably be of better benefit to the people of the North than views which might be spoken in their name by the representatives of the United Kingdom, because our economy and our requirements on this island are peculiarly our own and they are quite often at variance with those of the British Government so far as Britain itself is concerned.  The British Government have agreed to co-operate positively in the devolution of functions to the Council of Ireland and if Irishmen can agree we need not anticipate any difficulty from the British side.</P>
    <P>We see that the Council of Ireland <Col N="1724" /> could have executive functions of two kinds.  It could take policy decisions on matters devolved to it, leaving the implementation of that policy to be carried out by the two existing administrations and, in respect of some services, I think that would clearly be for some time to come the better thing to do.  It could also, in appropriate cases, and in some respects this would be better from the beginning, be entrusted with the responsibility of carrying its own decisions into effect.</P>
    <P>At this point I should like to make it clear that all the parties to the tripartite conference were unanimous in opposing the creation of a third large layer of bureaucracy in this island.  It was emphasised that the secretariat to the Council of Ireland should be quite small.  In fact, this matter is regarded of such importance that it is specifically referred to in the agreement.  Paragraph 7 says that there would be a secretariat to the council which would be kept as small as might be commensurate with efficiency in the operation of the council.  I think that was a very reasonable rider to put into the communiqué, having regard to the experience which we have had in the Council of Europe, the EEC, the UN and other organisations which cross national boundaries.  They have a capacity sometimes to grow beyond reasonable dimensions.  Our anxiety is to have the most effective and independent secretariat to the Council of Ireland but not to have it of such dimensions as to make it a costly operation which would get out of touch with the two other administrations on the island.</P>
    <P>The main functions of the secretariat will be to advise the council on the matters entrusted to it by the two administrations and to convey the council's views and decisions to the separate administrations.  It will also ensure, through such supervision as may be approved, action throughout the whole island either separately or jointly to implement decisions of the Council of Ireland.  While it is difficult to spell out very fully at this stage the matters in relation to which the council would exercise harmonising <Col N="1725" /> functions, there is clearly very great scope for harmonising in this country in matters such as regulations in the fields of animal health, hotel standards, vehicle licensing and testing, driver tests and so on.  Given the wide range of subjects which could arise, it is clearly necessary to examine all of them closely with a view to reaching agreement on those which could be allocated to the council from the outset of its existence. These could, of course, be added to from time to time and as there would be agreement to do so.</P>
    <P>Again there are many matters on which either administration could profitably seek advice from the council in relation to the island as a whole and matters on which joint consultation on mutual problems would be very advantageous. We would visualise that we would have consultations within the Council of Ministers in Ireland on the best line for Ireland to take in EEC decisions and this could give our Northern colleagues a new opportunity, a new outlet, to express their views.  Indeed in the past there has often been quite an amount of unofficial consultation between experts in the North and South.  This has not been because of our law but nevertheless it has been of very great benefit to both parts of Ireland and we would see this develop.  It is hoped to be able to specify some of the consultative roles by agreement for inclusion in the proposed agreement.  These too can be extended in the light of experience after the formation and commencement of operation of the council.</P>
    <P>Early discussions are being arranged between North and South on these complex questions and we think that in a matter of some weeks we will have available a suitable list for consideration by those who will be involved in the formal conference early in the New Year.  The Sunningdale communiqué dug for and put in the foundations for a new edifice of co-operation in Ireland.  Sunningdale was an informal but vital get-together of Irishmen who, through mutual respect for the rights of one another, were able to see, respect and, to a large extent, meet each other's viewpoints. <Col N="1726" /> The real building must begin now.  On everyone in this island lies the onerous personal obligation of deciding whether, on the one hand, his words or actions will over-run those foundations with weeds of hate, will bury them beneath more dead bodies or flood them in yet more Irish and other innocent blood or whether, on the other hand, these words and actions will build a secure structure on those foundations so as to help Irish men and women to a better understanding of one another.</P>
    <P>As can be learned from the communiqué it was agreed at the conference that in the initial period the revenue of the Council of Ireland would be provided by means of grants from the two Administrations in Ireland towards agreed projects and budgets according to the nature of the services involved. Until such time as we know the extent of the functions assigned to the council we cannot estimate what budget may be required but by the time we complete the formal stage of the conference it should be possible to give to the Dáil a fairly reliable figure of the cost of the new institution and of the functions that may be transferred to it.  The method of financing the various services will depend on the functions that the Council of Ireland would have, whether they would be executive, harmonising or merely consultative. This matter is being examined in the course of the other studies between North and South and we would hope to have some useful and concrete information in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>While the method of financing must be related to the functions it has been agreed that where expenditure is incurred in the area of the Republic or Northern Ireland, the revenue to meet that expenditure would be decided by the location of the expenditure.  However, in some cases such as in the field of promotional activities, particularly abroad in respect of trade or tourism, the principle of dividing the cost by reference to where the benefit accrues has been adopted.  While few will quarrel with the fairness and logic of that principle it may prove difficult in practice to establish objectively and <Col N="1727" /> conclusively how the benefit is distributed. It is for this reason that studies are now in hand of methods of financing the council which would be consonant with the responsibilities and functions assigned to the council. It is hoped to have these studies completed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>If Deputies reflect on my words in this regard they will understand why it was not possible to be more particular in specifying functions or financing methods in the communiqué but again I reassure the House that the mere absence of such specific detail should not be taken as an indication of any lack of readiness to undertake these new responsibilities. We want to examine them carefully and to ensure that as we start the Council of Ireland we make no mistakes. Once we put the locomotive on the rail we wish to keep it running and ensure that there should be no technical reason why it should jump the tracks.</P>
    <P>At Sunningdale the question was mooted but left aside for further consideration of giving the council a greater degree of financial independence than would be represented by providing its revenue by way of grants from the two participating administrations. This question is being examined but the possibilities are limited by the fundamental fact that the council's functions will be devolved to it from two parliaments.  As Deputies will appreciate, there is also a constraint within our own Constitution in relation to taxation.  At this stage the best thing to do is not to anticipate what the outcome might be but to keep an open mind until such time as we have had some experience of the working of the council.  By then I am sure a suitable formula could be adopted.  We favour leaving the financial arrangements sufficiently flexible to accommodate future development in the council's roles and functions.</P>
    <P>It would be undesirable, indeed foolish, to circumscribe it unduly by a rigid financing formula.  Apart from the secretarial costs which are to be shared on a 50-50 basis it is unlikely that much, if any, additional liabilities <Col N="1728" /> will arise for us, certainly not in the early stages because it seems likely that for some time to come the council will prefer to operate agreed policies through the separate administrations. But this need not necessarily be so and in time there may be a change.  When any such change comes about we can have another look at the financing arrangements.  The more we work together and consult together the more it would be sensible to coordinate our activities so as to avoid overlapping and duplication of overheads.</P>
    <P>At a later stage we will be liable for our due share, in accordance with the arrangements made, of the cost of new policies enunciated by the council in the areas of responsibility devolved to the council by the Oireachtas and by the Northern Ireland Executive.  I am confident that the people, both North and South will be happy to remunerate a council that is operating to their benefit. There is not much greater taxable capacity in the North nor in the South. That is something on which every taxpayer will agree but it should be possible to devise new patterns of taxation and of expenditure which will bring about savings and reliefs. That will be one of the aims of the council.</P>
    <P>It was agreed at the conference that if Britain should continue to pay subsidies to Northern Ireland, such subsidies would not involve British participation in the council.  It is important that we emphasise that in this Assembly because there are people who, naturally, would resent British participation in a Council of Ireland. It is a participation that Britain does not seek and on that account the assurance can be given specifically that she will not be involved in the operation of the council.  At the same time nobody could quarrel with Britain's legitimate request that her own financial position be safeguarded, but any arrangements made in that connection will be on an informal basis and will not be a constraint on the development of the Council of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Sunningdale was not the only event of the last week or of the past nine <Col N="1729" /> months.  We have had dramatic changes, too, in the south of Ireland which will confer great benefit on our people.  Here I would make some reference to criticism that was voiced during this debate about the present state of the economy.  Deputy Lynch claimed that if the present Government had not gone into office there would have been considerable expansion in growth this year.  The truth is that if our Government had not taken over this year, and if Fianna Fáil had continued, as they were apparently willing to do, with the economic policies of the last four years, our growth rate this year would have been about 3½ per cent, or at most, 4 per cent.  That would have been the maximum growth rate this year.</P>
    <P>We decided, very deliberately, in preparing the budget to go for expansion, believing that any other policy would not only add to the growing number of unemployed we had under Fianna Fáil but also would add to our losses in international trade. We saw growth as an opportunity for us to increase employment, increase exports and substantially improve the standard of living here.  It was as a direct consequence of our decision that the growth rate of this country, which has remained at 3 per cent for the last three years, has jumped in a matter of seven or eight months to beyond 6 per cent.  In fact, if we did not face the constraints of the oil shortage our growth rate this year would be 7 per cent plus.  That is as a direct consequence of our policies, policies which were attacked in the course of the budget debate and against which Fianna Fáil voted in this House on several occasions since we went into Government in March.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of our policies we have reduced the number of unemployed by 7,000.  We have increased agricultural incomes by 40 per cent; we have increased incomes in the nonagricultural sector by 17 per cent and there has been a growth of nearly 19 per cent in the gross domestic product as the result of our policies.  The volume of consumer spending &mdash; I am taking the volume deliberately because <Col N="1730" /> if I took the value Fianna Fáil would claim that it contained an element of inflation &mdash; has risen by 6½ per cent. The expenditure of Government, in a deliberate effort to promote activity on current expenditure, rose by 7 per cent.  The gross domestic fixed capital formation has risen by 11½ per cent in volume; the physical value of stocks has increased by £71 million; our exports have increased by 15 per cent visibly and 9 per cent invisibly and our imports, in so far as they have risen, have risen in the main due to the colossal increase in purchases from abroad to provide raw materials and capital goods for our industries.  All of these clearly prove that the country now has a thriving economy as a result of the change of Government this year.</P>
    <P>There are a number of constraints but the only ones that are at present upon us are those from outside the country.  The extraordinarily high interest rates which are operating across the world are now about 5 per cent higher than they were in September, 1972.  Never has mankind experienced the degree of interest rate inflation which the world has to endure this year.  If Fianna Fáil have a cure for this would they please give it to us.  Would they give some indication in the course of this debate what the cure is?  Deputies Lynch and O'Malley have already spoken on this Estimate and Deputy Colley, this morning, spoke on the Agricultural Credit Bill, 1973.  All acted indignantly about the high interest rates but offered no cure.</P>
    <P>We are maintaining interest rates here at 1½ per cent less than interest rates in London which is the market with which we have the greatest mobility.  While it is unpleasant for us to have to pay the high interest rates which are at present operating throughout the world we are keeping them to a figure which is lower than many other countries.  These high interest rates are not peculiar to Britain: they are running right across Europe and beyond it to the United States of America.  Many states in the United States of America have a law which prohibits interest rates rising <Col N="1731" /> above certain levels, but in most of these states they have had to amend those laws in order to take account of the massive increases operating in interest rates across the world.</P>
    <P>In Germany, a country which has a very healthy economy and which if it has any illnesses at all is not subject to the same kind of illness as the British economy, the current overdraft rate is 14½ per cent.  The overdraft rate in Britain is 14 per cent.  I am taking the prime lending rate.  In Germany the rate is 2 per cent more than ours while in Britain it is 1½ per cent above ours.  Perhaps, even before I conclude here, we may hear that the London rate has risen yet again. There are five other countries in Europe which have rates comparable to ours and in no European country is the interest rate at the same level as it stood a year ago.</P>
    <P>This has had the effect of slowing down the rate of investment in some securities.  However, it is important to emphasise that the overall savings of our people are about £57 million greater than they were this time last year notwithstanding the colossal growth in expenditure in the statistics, a growth which, to a significant extent, was attributable to the justifiable social welfare increases we gave to the most necessitous people in our community.  The fact that consumption spending has gone up shows that these people were well below the line of subsistence, and, having received a little extra in the budget, are spending it.</P>
    <P>Even taking all the extra spending into account &mdash; and it should be clearly understood that it is not all of a necessitous type; some of it is of a luxurious type &mdash; we still have £57 million more being saved than we had this time last year and investment is on the increase.  The shortfall arises in relation to funds which traditionally have been from the small depositor and have had interest rates related to the services which those funds finance.  I refer, of course, to the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the Industrial Credit Corporation and the building societies &mdash; all organisations <Col N="1732" /> which have an immense social purpose. The conflict which arises is that in many respects, because of the massive and very rapid changes in bank interest rates across the world, people are being tempted to switch their money to funds which seem to give them, in the short term, great profit. However, people should beware. When people are offering extraordinarily high interest rates they are not doing it for the good of the depositor; they are doing it because there are serious risks involved or because they are engaged in some highly speculative and possibly antisocial purposes.  Therefore, people would be well advised to concentrate on the legitimate and long respected forms of investment.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party have been endeavouring to make some mischief out of the result of the recent national loan.  In my view the result of the national loan, having regard to the circumstances, was quite good.  I wonder what a Fianna Fáil Minister would have done if the day after he issued a national loan the prime interest rate in London had risen by 1¾ per cent?  I am sure Deputy O'Kennedy knows well that in those circumstances the national loan which was issued here was bound to produce a result less beneficial than would have occurred if it had taken place the week before this very surprise move on the London market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, if Deputy O'Kennedy, or anybody else, reads the papers they will know that warnings were sounded over the last few days about this.  On the last occasion, as I have already pointed out, there was a meeting of the nine Finance Ministers of the EEC on the previous Friday in Brussels discussing interest rates.  It was considered there that interest rates had reached their peak and the British Chancellor of the Exchequer did not demur.  There was no indication of the change.  As I said in challenging Deputy J. Lynch recently&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1733" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>You need not always take what the British Chancellor of the Exchequer says as applying here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he knows the steps that have to be taken about one month or six weeks in advance of the issue of a national loan.  Having regard to the fact that interest rates in London jumped by 1.75 per cent overnight and we increased our rate here by only 0.3 per cent, it was quite a remarkable achievement and a clear indication of the confidence in the Government that we were able to get from the public and the financial institutions £16 million, having regard to the very uncertain state of the market.</P>
      <P>In view of the recent upswing in sterling interest rates and the obvious unsettling effect on giltedged markets everywhere &mdash; not merely in Ireland but everywhere giltedged markets are being knocked &mdash; the result of this year's national loan was a very good one. There is confidence in Irish Government securities.  Anyone here or elsewhere who suggests otherwise is doing a national disservice.  There used to be a tradition in this House that one did not knock national loans or make it difficult for the Government to get the money necessary for the public capital programme.  Apparently Fianna Fáil standards have stooped so low that they do not regard this any longer as an obligation.  The knocking will not do any harm.  I am glad to say that the sale of Irish Government securities this year is well above what they were last year, taking all sales into account.  The national loan is but one very small bite of the Government's way of collecting capital.  In modern, monetary market conditions it becomes less significant than it might have been ten or 20 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an annual turnover of £300 million in Irish Government securities. As the House knows, there is a very wide range of these securities.  We are quite satisfied that notwithstanding the constraints &mdash; and there are constraints, and we acknowledge them and if they had not been pointed out by the Opposition we would be pointing them out ourselves &mdash; we are quite certain that the unsettling events of recent <Col N="1734" /> times will soon come to an end and when the total picture is seen it will be obvious that there is substantial confidence in the way in which the financial affairs of this country are being managed.</P>
    <P>It is fair to point out that our economy is having one of the fastest and steadiest growth rates in Europe this year.  At a time when the mighty economic and financial giants are shaken to their foundations, we are maintaining a steady pace.  Were it not for the threat of the oil shortage, the growth which we have achieved this year could flow into next year and beyond.  There is a large number of uncertainties at present.  We would be lacking in our duty if we did not point to these uncertainties.  They are obvious.  The oil situation is the most critical one.  We are in a position of having had a very sluggish economy for three or four years past since 1968.  There has been a massive expansion this year and if we were to be limited this year and next year to the oil consumption of last year we would not be able to feed the growth which we have had in our industry and in our agriculture this year.</P>
    <P>One of the worst constraints under which we are suffering, even if our Arab suppliers treat us as a friendly nation and maintain the same supplies as they gave last year, is that which Fianna Fáil sluggishness and mismanagement of the economy has imposed.  They prevented us from developing our full industrial capacity for the last three years.  If it had been used to the full, our oil imports would have been about 30 per cent higher than they will be as a result of the restrictions which are now being imposed. Fianna Fáil's dead hand on the economy is even worse than anything which might arise from the Middle East.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is much point in talking at much greater length on the economy.  The picture speaks for itself.  There was one matter I wanted to correct.  Deputy J. Lynch claimed that Fianna Fáil built 21,000 houses last year.  That is not true.  Before they left office Fianna Fáil issued approval for 2,500 houses.  They included those approvals in the numbers <Col N="1735" /> given for their so-called building programme of last year.  Issuing approval for houses is about the simplest thing to do.  If one is irresponsible, he will do it without thinking of where the money is to come from.  Having issued the approval for 2,500 houses the number of houses actually built was 18,000, and not 21,000.  Fianna Fáil provided no money for the houses of which they had already approved.  Northwithstanding that, we have pumped money into housing in order to fulfil the obligation which we undertook to build&mdash; 25,000 houses a year, although that figure will be 6,000-7,000 houses over what Fianna Fáil built last year. There has never been such growth in the number of houses.</P>
    <P>At the same time as we are doing this, there is naturally some difficulty arising in relation to the financing of such a massive housing programme. Even if there was not a shortage of money and if one did not have high interest rates and people being tempted away from investment in houses into speculative purchases in the property markets, there would still be a very considerable problem in financing this massive housing programme.  There has been no cutback as a consequence. We have devised a number of ways and means of financing the housing programme, including subsidising the building societies.  We have been attacked because of the high rates that house mortgagors are being called upon to pay.  As I pointed out, this is a reflection &mdash; a sad but unfortunate one &mdash; of the massively high interest rates charged across the world.  If we were not to keep the bank rate in Ireland 1½ per cent below the British rate and if the Government were not subsidising the building societies to the tune of £2 million, the actual rates which the mortgagor would have to pay would be in the region of 14-14½ per cent.  The rate is 11¼ per cent. This Government are ruling well and fairly.  They are giving the maximum support possible within the constraints the monetary situation is dictating.  It should be seen that this Government are doing magnificently.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1736" /> We were all surprised last February when the then Taoiseach, Deputy J. Lynch, announced a general election. There was great speculation about it. At the time it was thought the general election was called because of the question of security, the question of Northern Ireland, that there were rows within the Fianna Fáil Party and so on.  The interesting thing is and I believe historians, particularly economic historians, will identify it, that the advice Deputy Lynch received from his economic advisers last February was that this country would run into economic storms as a consequence of domestic policies which had gone astray and also of the cold economic winds which were blowing against this country from elsewhere.</P>
    <P>We now know the consequences of these unstable economic conditions across the world.  They are having a disastrous effect on economies much stronger than ours.  That was the situation Deputy Lynch was not able to face up to.  He did not want to be in Government to deal with those problems. He wanted to run away from them.  That is the reason why Fianna Fáil went to the country last February. They thought the worst that could happen to them would be that they would be returned to power to deal with them and that the better thing for them would be to stay out and leave it to their opponents.  Their greatest disappointment today is to find that notwithstanding all the difficulties which are affecting economies throughout the world we are staying on a steady course, that not only have we maintained employment but we have increased it, that we have increased the output of housing, that we have increased capital investment everywhere, that we have increased exports, that we have put this country at long last on a steady course of economic and social progress.</P>
    <P>This is a course we will try to maintain notwithstanding the winds which are blowing against us from across the world.  I can give Fianna Fáil the reassurance that if these international gales do not so disturb us the little breeze of Fianna Fáil will not give us even a draught in the neck.  Neither do I believe it will influence the Irish <Col N="1737" /> people.  The country is sound, it was never better ruled, economically, socially, politically, and we believe the people of Ireland realise that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be accepted that the public generally, and the Press for that matter in so far as one can interpret their reactions, expected the Taoiseach would give us a detailed analysis of the Sunningdale communiqué. I state that as a fact, because the record of the Press expectations is there.  Also there is the record of the public's expectations for all of us who recognise the significance of the events of last week and the responsible attitude which the Irish people have taken towards those events.  I do not intend to deal with that aspect at the moment.</P>
      <P>One of the matters that has been projected since this Government came in is that the Taoiseach's silence derives from his strength&mdash;that he is a strong silent man who comes to clear firm decisions which he does not feel he needs to explain either to the House or to the public.  One will know from the silent conduct of his Government since they came into office that the projections of many of his Ministers have been very much more constant than that of the Taoiseach who seems to sit behind, and sometimes whose nods and physical mannerisms are interpreted as being indications of his strength, capability and confidence.</P>
      <P>Time alone will prove how accurate these assessments are.  The question can be asked whether in areas of considerable public concern, whether in the economic or political spheres, one could expect from the Taoiseach something on the pattern clearly established by his predecessor &mdash; that the Leader of the Government would be sufficiently open and confident to be able to analyse and phrase and explain in the full glare of public questioning the reasons for decisions reached and leave it to the responsibility of Members of this House to endorse such decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mention that by way of preface because we have sometimes been told &ldquo;Binn béal ina thost&rdquo;&mdash; silence is golden&mdash;but we have never in this <Col N="1738" /> country believed in silence to the extent of reading from prepared statements like we had from the Taoiseach yesterday.  We have not been led to believe that that is strength.  The Taoiseach's silence yesterday was on matters of deep concern to most of us and it is on these that I wish to dwell in the first instance.  I shall quote three lines of the Taoiseach's statement to the House yesterday:</P>
    <P>I may add that I will be discussing the oil situation among other topics with my European colleagues at the summit meeting later this week.</P>
    <P>That is as much as the Taoiseach told the House of what he intends to discuss or what he understands will be discussed at what is being called the &ldquo;fireside summit&rdquo; in Copenhagen later this week.  Those of us who have any awareness of the concern in Europe at this time and of the attitude of the EEC member states towards the energy situation and others, will acknowledge that the Taoiseach will be discussing this topic, among many, in great detail.  The Taoiseach has an obligation to us to tell us what precisely his attitude will be at the summit and to tell this House in particular what he has reason to believe will emerge from the Copenhagen talks and how what will emerge will affect our interests in the EEC and our national economic situation arising out of the energy crisis.</P>
    <P>It is significant that last week Herr Willi Brandt said:</P>
    <P>If the Community does not manage to work out a joint line on oil at the Copenhagen Summit then the Rome Treaty is not worth the paper it is written on.</P>
    <P>I wonder is the Taoiseach aware of that statement and its implications.  Is he aware of a survey undertaken by <i>The Sunday Times</i>, published last Sunday, of the attitude of EEC member states towards the energy crisis? Apparently we alone are &mdash; and I will quote:</P>
    <P>having no sense of crisis but that in fact the resolution of the problem is a matter of quite diplomacy.</P>
    <P>Having had an opportunity to visit <Col N="1739" /> Brussels this week with other members of Fianna Fáil I can say that the Taoiseach will find that the attitude towards the energy crisis will greatly influence the EEC states in the matter of their programmes and policies.  It should hardly be left to an Opposition Member to sound this note of warning.  The least one could expect would be that the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs would say precisely what is involved.  Among other things, what is involved is that if we are not prepared to show solidarity with other EEC members in this problem we will find that our attitude or lack of one will influence the other EEC members in matters that we regard as being of significant concern of ours.</P>
    <P>Are the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs satisfied that the Regional Fund will not be limited any more than the proposals from the Commission would lead us to believe? Are they satisfied or have they any reason for concern that the fund may be limited to one year of operation because of the state of the economies of the member nations arising out of the energy crisis?</P>
    <P>If they are satisfied, this would explain their silence.  If they are not satisfied and there is cause for concern, why did the Taoiseach not tell us more than he did in his three-line reference in his address to this Parliament.  Is this the kind of silence which he would regard as being the strength of our Prime Minister?  To me this silence gives rise to grave concern and apprehension. One must take the realistic political view on these matters.  It was the failure of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the earlier part of this year when we were discussing the report on the progress of the European Community to take these realities into account which has led to a certain sense of disappointment with the development of the regional fund proposals up to this time.</P>
    <P>In our policy statement on the regional fund we charged the Government with reacting too late and in the wrong directions.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs in May, soon after the publication of the guidelines of the <Col N="1740" /> proposals for the European Regional Fund, said in this House spontaneously that he was satisfied that there was no suggestion of the British Government insisting on a principle of <i>juste retour</i> out of the European Regional Fund. I did not challenge him to make that statement, he made it quite freely.  This indicated a naive approach to this political reality which would give cause for concern.  It was because of this naive approach at that time that we were concerned.  We are equally concerned now.  That is why I raise these matters at this time, before the Taoiseach and the Minister leave for this Summit Conference in Copenhagen.</P>
    <P>The Minister's reaction at that time was widely publicised and promoted. We have had no indication from the Minister at any time as to the consequences of his hasty trips to his colleagues in the member states of the European Community.  We have not yet had the opportunity of hearing him replying to my queries on this debate and it now seems unlikely that we will hear from him. We were all interested to hear the arguments he made &mdash; arguments which had been made by our party two or three months in advance &mdash; reported in great detail in the report of the European Communities.  We would have been more interested to hear even three, four or five lines of the response to the arguments.  As I have indicated, we are concerned here not with intention, not with projection, but with performance.  It is in performance that there will be a level of great disappointment.</P>
    <P>We are taking a responsible attitude towards the energy crisis. The German, Dutch, and many other Governments have expressed their views.  They have reason to expect that this is a test of solidarity.  If we and the British Government in particular &mdash; I want to emphasise the British Government in particular&mdash; want to exclude ourselves from our obligations under the Treaty of Rome and as members of the European Community and set ourselves aside because we are friendly nations and prove our solidarity by adopting a <Col N="1741" /> common approach, then we are deluding ourselves as to our responsibilities. We are fooling ourselves if we think we can expect the same member nations of the Community to implement policies and programmes in the agricultural, regional, social or any other area, which would be to our advantage when we and the British Government are not prepared to act in unison with them to the responsible advantage of all.</P>
    <P>This may not be something an Opposition member is expected to say. The fashion is that I should wait until the difficulties arise and then point out the problems.  We have a responsibility to recognise what our membership of the Community involves. We should recognise the real feeling of crisis in that Community and the need to take responsible and coherent action.  I hope the Taoiseach has given this matter much more thought and preparation than his very brief reference in his statement to this House yesterday seemed to indicate.</P>
    <P>We have had many examples of well publicised trips, for instance, the trip of the Minister for Industry and Commerce to Washington in June. We were told in a few brief lines by the Taoiseach yesterday that it is unlikely that there will be any significant changes in the US Government's investment tax laws, or foreign investment tax laws within the next year or two.  We can be forgiven for a certain disappointment at this outcome, having regard to the fanfare which preceded the Minister's trip. While we all recognise the need for activity and energy in travelling in various directions, we would be much happier if we saw this energy being matched by negotiating capacity.  I am very doubtful that there is evidence that that energy and capacity to travel is matched by the capacity to negotiate effectively and shrewdly in the interests of this country as members of any international organisation.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to another area of silence in relation to the energy situation.  What will be the attitude adopted by our Government in the spring of 1974 at the Convention <Col N="1742" /> on International Maritime Law?</P>
    <P>Maritime law is in a very fluid and unsatisfactory state at the moment. The Minister for Foreign Affairs acknowledged that some weeks ago. This convention will endeavour to establish consistent criteria in the various areas of international maritime law, depending on the proposals to be put to it by the member Governments represented there.  The last convention in Geneva proceeded along four different lines.  Sometimes these lines were contradictory.  There was a treaty dealing with territorial waters; a treaty dealing with the fishery laws; a treaty dealing with the shelf, and I am not sure what the fourth treaty dealt with.  Each was signed separately and has been used to the advantage of member nations, when they so wished; sometimes the elements involved in other aspects of treaties signed separately, though negotiated simultaneously, have been ignored.</P>
    <P>It is important at this time that we have a clear statement from the Government regarding our attitudes to such a convention or conference.  It is becoming clearer each day that the whole question of the exploration of our resources, and particularly the resources within our territorial waters and the resources of the shelf, will be of immense significance from the beginning of the next decade.  I realise it takes time to exploit these resources but that does not mean that we should not have clear views on the matter.</P>
    <P>I would point in particular to an incident that was regarded by some as a matter of light relief.  I asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs a question regarding the island of Rockall. That question did not arise because of concern for our fishery rights around that island.  The Minister in this House, for some reason best known to himself, insisted that that was the major issue of concern. I should like to clarify the point now.</P>
    <P>The island of Rockall, in itself of significance, was purported to be occupied by the British Government in 1955 when they planted a flag on it.  Every year since they have sent out marines to reinstate their claim.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1743" /> In the last few years they enacted a law in Parliament formally claiming it to be within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom.  The significant fact is that the island is 300 miles west of Scotland and 250 miles north-west of the coast of Donegal.  Incidentally, there need be no question that it is nearer to the Northern Ireland jurisdiction than to us&mdash;the island is much nearer to County Donegal than to any other part of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The British have made a claim but that claim has not been established by the criteria of international maritime law.  It is not enough for the Minister to say in reply to my question that he rejects their claim.  The point is where do we go from here?  I asked the Minister if he would consider submitting a claim on behalf of the Irish Government on the basis of the many facts which his Department should be able to provide for him from their research in this matter.  At least we should establish a claim on which an arbitration could be held at the International Court or at the international conference.  Surprisingly, for reasons best known to himself which he did not disclose to the House, the Minister has indicated this will not be done and has stated it is a matter connected with fisheries.  I would tell the Minister it is anything but that.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Minister's counterparts in the British Foreign Office are in quite a tizzy about the whole question of Rockall and the rights to explore the shelf around it. If they are in a state of concern it is about time our Government, having regard to what the resources around that area may be, took positive steps that would at least establish our right to arbitration in connection with the island.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that where land is within the jurisdiction of a country the waters around that land then belong to the territorial seas of that country to a limit at least of three miles.  The right to exclusive exploration without reference to any international convention is entirely different from the right to exploration under the Geneva convention in connection <Col N="1744" /> with the continental shelf. This basic difference must be under stood.</P>
    <P>It may be that the indications of significant deposits of natural gas and oil in the shelf around Rockall will not be realised although I do not think this will be the case because the signs are there are significant deposits.  If this is the case we will stand to be accused in five years' time of grave dereliction of responsibility if we fail to present a claim that would enable us to have a status at any international negotiations on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the greatly reduced burden on the Exchequer arising out of membership of the EEC.  We all accept there has been a great reduction in the burden on the Exchequer particularly with regard to farm supports, although to listen to spokesmen of the Government one would think that the £30 million saved to the Exchequer was provided by them.  One had the impression that they alone were committed to the increase in social welfare benefits but I do not intend to go into that matter now because the public know the answer to that.  If any of us made a mistake in connection with the £30 million it was that we spent it too freely &mdash; I am not referring to the Labour Party who were opposed to our entry into the EEC &mdash; without acknowledging that membership of the Community would involve expenditure of a type we previously did not contemplate, expenditure of a kind that would ensure we would &ldquo;reap maximum benefit from membership of the EEC&rdquo; to use the words of the 14-point programme.</P>
    <P>I hope that the schemes now being presented by the Government in connection with farm structure and so on will ensure that they will provide the maximum investment to match whatever may be available from the EEC schemes.  I say that subject to the qualification mentioned in the early part of my speech.  Our great concern is to ensure that the Government will be prepared to back to the maximum extent the funds available under the farm structure scheme and from the FEOGA and social funds.  Our country must pay its share to ensure <Col N="1745" /> that we utilise to the maximum whatever resources are available to us.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might quote some specific examples.  Under the proposals recently sanctioned by the Council of Ministers in connection with high altitude farmers, there is provision for special grants for certain purposes for farmers provided there is proper access and a proper water and electricity supply.  In these circumstances, a very high rate of grant or assistance will be given to the applicant out of the resources of the European Community particularly in this area of the farm structure improvements scheme.  If we have not already provided these facilities &mdash; proper access, electricity, water supply &mdash; so much of that money as we could call upon from the resources of the European Community will be lost to us due to our failure to balance it with our contribution, which is a characteristic of the funds to be applied to any area of the European Community.</P>
    <P>This is a very important aspect.  It is not enough for the Taoiseach to say in his opening speech &mdash; and we heard this in Monaghan at great length &mdash; that this Government were about to introduce a new scheme of assistance for hill farmers and that they would have a pension of £600 a year if they were married and £400 a year if they were single.  They did not say that this is the minimum that could be applied under the terms of the farm structure improvements scheme of the European Community.  We listened to this being paraded as the achievement of this Government and as the great Tír na nÓg for the small hill farmers of Monaghan and the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>They cannot now present the provisions of the European Community, which so many members of the Government resisted strongly, as the achievements of the Government.  That is an even more blatant example of misrepresentation than that of the application of the moneys saved on the farm subsidies of previous years to the social welfare area in the last budget.  The people must be properly informed on who qualifies for assistance out of the various European <Col N="1746" /> funds.  They must be informed of the existence of these schemes and, if anything, more important, they must be informed on how to present their applications. The Taoiseach referred to the information services and said that, with a view to the effective dissemination of Government policy within the Government and to the general public, they were making significant improvements in the area of the Government Information Service.</P>
    <P>Some of us know all too well that, if there is one area more than another in which the Government &mdash; and here I acknowledge the contribution of the Minister who is now in the House &mdash; have been very effective indeed, it is in the area of the dissemination of Government policy.  I can say &mdash; and I am sure this will give some satisfaction to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs &mdash; that we are inundated with statements from various Ministers made on various occasions for various purposes at home and elsewhere.  To that extent at least there is an indication of the success of the Government Information Service.  Nobody with any experience in the Press or otherwise will call that success into question.  It is very well presented indeed.</P>
    <P>The question can be asked: could they spare some of the time and some of the money they use so freely to send us copies of the various Ministers' speeches, and to present the attitudes of various Ministers to the public, and use it more effectively to inform the public of the schemes that are available to them nationally and, more important, the schemes of assistance available to them by virtue of our membership of the EEC?</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House are concerned &mdash; and nothing that our recent delegation to Brussels saw alleviated that concern; in fact it was exaggerated &mdash; that we have not utilised these schemes to the best advantage. To take one area alone, we have listened to the Minister for Labour making significant criticisms of the proposals of the Commissioner for Social Policy with regard to the effect they would have on this country, and their failure to cover important areas of concern to us.  I wonder will the House be surprised <Col N="1747" /> to know that, in fact, from the allocations out of the Social Fund up to the end of this year which, of course, were sanctioned earlier this year, Ireland got exactly what Ireland looked for.  I say Ireland collectively but I mean that the applications which were submitted to that fund were met 100 per cent to the order of something over £4 million.</P>
    <P>It is very widely known that we could have submitted more applications and would have qualified for more if the Government had taken the proper steps to inform the industries concerned, and to inform those in the educational area and other areas, on the assistance to be availed of under the fund.  We have the record of actually getting 100 per cent of what we asked for, but we have the unenviable record of submitting many applications or making many inquiries much later than the deadline.  The Government, who are so concerned with telling us what Ministers say at Boston University Law School and elsewhere, must at least consider telling the industries about the assistance available.  There are precedents for special applications.  There are industries which could qualify for the same reasons as other industries in Europe qualified for assistance out of the Social Fund, but they did not apply because they were not aware of their entitlement in this area, and then our Taoiseach talks about the dissemination of information on Government policy.</P>
    <P>In another area it is important to note that, so far as can be ascertained, the vast majority of the applications which were submitted for assistance from the funds available, under the FEOGA fund &mdash; if the Minister or any other Minister can prove that I am wrong about this I will be pleased to learn it &mdash; will have to be reprocessed and reactivated.  They were not properly documented.  Something of the order of 55 out of 71 applications submitted have to be represented and reprocessed.  Can the Government Information Service have any special pride in that?</P>
    <P>It could be that in the reprocessing, repreparing and representing they may <Col N="1748" /> fail to qualify this year and may have to be taken into consideration next year.  Is this a matter which the Taoiseach referred to in the three pages dealing with the need to improve the Government Information Service and streamline it.  Are we satisfied that the representatives of the Commission in Brussels are not limited by the instructions they may have to the point that they cannot assist individuals from this country who apply to them for information?  The attitude we have ascertained as a result of a discussion with the representatives of that Commission &mdash; I make no criticism of them &mdash; is that they feel it is not their function to provide information to individuals from this country.  My colleagues will bear me out in this; those of them who attended those consultations will not deny that this is the case.  The representatives of the Commission say that the experts are to be found in the various Departments at home and their function is to supply the information to the Deputies and then the Deputies are the experts in the different aspects of law.  This will be news to many, particularly as those same experts, limited as they may be in terms of personnel, spend most of their time attending with their Ministers on the latters' frequent trips to the Commission or to the Council of Ministers.  Because of the tradition of the Irish Civil Service, even if one were to try to get the precise information from these experts, it might not be so freely available but, even if it were, those most directly concerned will themselves be attending conferences in Brussels.</P>
    <P>This is an area in which the Government have a major responsibility to improve the services available through the Departments of State to the point at which there will be a constant flow of effective information to assist industry, the trade unions, agriculture and all the other bodies involved in the presentation and preparation of applications and in informing them of the consequences to their various sectors of certain developments in the European Community.  Such is not the case at the moment and anyone who has any experience at all knows that what I am saying is true.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1749" /> Furthermore, there are some Departments which have no European &ldquo;expert&rdquo; attached to them.  This is a matter for some concern.  I would be happy to forego the pleasure of receiving statements made by Ministers in different places if some of the money thereby saved could be channelled into the proper presentation to the Irish public of their rights nationally and as members of the European Community. In case the Minister and his Government may have any doubts, may I say that there are other funds about which the Irish people have never heard? There is the fund of the European Coal and Steel Community which has apparently a provision for the granting of assistance to local authorities. That fund would back to a considerable extent the crash programme of this Government in the area of housing. We have not heard much about it and we would like to hear more.  We would like the Government Information Services to be used in that particular respect.</P>
    <P>In all that area there is tremendous improvement to be made and I think all of us have been a little guilty in emphasising the saving we would make in the agricultural sector.  We should equally have said that it, of course, would also involve us in significant investment in our total administrative structure to enable us to maximise our benefit as members of the European Community.  There has been no sign yet of any step in that direction.  I shall come back to this later.  It is vitally important that this step should be taken now as a matter of extreme urgency.</P>
    <P>In connection with that, we have had one example of the attitude of the Government towards this whole area in the establishment of the EEC Committee.  This was presented as a committee of experts.  If any Government think they can discharge their responsibility by suggesting that Members of this House comprise, in fact, a committee of experts, they are only fooling themselves.  The public will not fall for that.  I do not think an assembly of this type is an assembly in which one finds experts.  Our function <Col N="1750" /> is not to specialise in particular fields but to react to the broad consensus in many fields.  However, even if we were experts, we could not operate without having adequate services available to us and I am rather disappointed that the Minister for Finance, the Minister charged with financial control, is not in the House at the moment because he was asked some months ago and again in the report to give us the assistance we needed.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs promised us we would have all the aid we required.  Would the Minister for Finance now and his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, tell us they will properly support the committee and give it the facilities it needs or else tell us they regard the committee more as a nuisance rather than an advantage?  We would like the Minister for Finance to ensure that out of the resources available to him we will be given the facilities we require. Whatever personal differences may exist between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in other areas, we would like to see this particular matter resolved so that the national interest can be protected and promoted.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach tells us the Government are going to <Col N="1751" /> set up more committees of this House. He has an odd belief in the capacity of Members of this House to serve effectively on so many different committees. None of us wants to go through the charade of being involved in a great many committees, like the candidate for the Seanad, so many heads of different committees without anything effective being done on any of them.  This is a matter in regard to which the Government will have to take a very definite and positive change of direction.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach says it is intended to refer Committee Stages of Bills to Special Committees.  Is the Taoiseach really serious in this?  It would be fine provided the Taoiseach and his Minister for Finance are prepared to make the facilities available.  The Minister tells us he is spending £45,000 more this year.

He has, however, decided in principle to assign a sergeant to Newport when circumstances permit, but this is not expected to be possible for some time.

At the moment the actual strength is two gardaí, but it is hoped, as I said in the reply, to post a sergeant there as soon as possible.  The difficulty in Newport, as in any other area, is that if the people of Newport feel they should have extra gardaí, they have to be taken from somewhere, and that will leave a grievance somewhere else.  I have to be advised by the Garda as to what they think is adequate to the area.</P>

      <P>I should explain at the outset that the Minister concerned with schools certified under the Children Acts is the Minister for Education. However, those responsible for producing the programme indicated that the scope of the programme extended to certain matters that are wholly or partly in my field of responsibility and I consented to be interviewed.  My consent was subject to the condition that my interview would be broadcast substantially in one piece.  A long interview took place but only a fraction of it was broadcast and even that was divided and the excerpts placed in juxtaposition with other material in the programme.  An officer of my Department also gave a long interview detailing the expansion that has taken place in the welfare service of the courts and prisons but none at all of this interview was broadcast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>A person who wishes to carry out an experiment on a live animal for scientific purposes must obtain a licence from the Minister for Health under the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876.</P>
      <P>No experiment may be carried out under the Act except with a view either to the advancement by new discovery of physiological knowledge or of knowledge which will be useful for saving or prolonging life or alleviating suffering, or with a view to the acquisition of such knowledge by persons attending lectures in, for example, medical schools, hospitals or colleges.</P>
      <P>All applications for licences and other relevant documents are examined by the medical officers of my Department and I am satisfied that unnecessary experimentation is not being carried out.  It would, in my view, seriously frustrate the education of medical and other students if I were to prohibit the use of live animals in experiments carried out for educational purposes.  I might mention that only 206 such experiments were carried out in 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great majority of the experiments carried out in Ireland involve rodents only and are done for ensuring the safety of drugs and medicines <Col N="1759" /> for use by man; there is no other way of doing this work at present.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of experiments carried out on animals in 1972 under the provisions of the Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876, based on returns furnished to the Department by the licensed experimenters, was 79,939.  The corresponding figure for 1971 was 69,611.</P>
      <P>The number of animals used in these experiments was 34,483 in 1972 compared with 26,285 in 1971.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increases in the number of experiments <Col N="1760" /> carried out and of animals used in 1972 were attributable to work done in the Medical Research Council Laboratories and in the Veterinary Research Laboratory in Dublin.  The Medical Research Council work was concerned mainly with establishing the safety of drugs used in connection with bacterial diseases and cancer.  There is no other way of doing this type of testing at present. The additional Veterinary Research Laboratory work primarily arose out of a special project on &ldquo;louping ill&rdquo;, a virus disease of sheep and cattle which is transmissible to humans.

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction occurred in this case because of the different methods of calculating means derived from capital in these two types of pensions.  In this instance the pensioner possessed stock, the market value of which is over £4,000, and she derives an income therefrom of £475 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the year 1963 the same method of assessment was used for both pensions but in November, 1963, provision was made for a more liberal assessment of means derived from capital in the case of a widow.  The reason for the change lay broadly in the fact that a high proportion of <Col N="1761" /> widows are left with young families and have to face not only a major economic adjustment on the death of the husband but also problems of rearing and educating their children, which do not arise in the case of old age pension claimants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I am well aware that there is a difference in the system of assessing means as between widows and old age pensioners, with the recent easement in the old age pensions' means test one could hardly expect there would be a difference of £4 in the amounts of the two pensions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it has.  The pension was calculated and first awarded to this lady on 31st May, 1973.  This calculation was done under the system <Col N="1762" /> in operation when the Deputy was Minister for Social Welfare.  Her widow's pension, under that assessment, was £1.15 per week.  As a result of the provisions in the budget that was increased to £5.15 per week.  As the Deputy is aware, since 1963 there has been a different means of assessing widows' and old age pensions in favour of widows.</P>

Such a practice would not be permitted by the EEC.  It would be contrary to the neutrality of taxation.

In any event the consequences to taxpayers in general could be enormous if the principle was established that the Exchequer could be obliged to make good any trading losses.</P>

      <P>The only written complaints on record during the past five years about the standard of litter collection in the Phoenix Park have stemmed from the one source.  I shall not give the name of the gentleman concerned.  In May, 1968, he complained directly to the park superintendent as well as to the Dublin Regional Tourism Company that litter in the form of bottles and tin cans was being allowed accumulate in the park for weeks at a time and <Col N="1774" /> he complained that he seldom saw more than one man collecting litter. In October, 1969 he made similiar complaints to the then Parliamentary Secretary.  On both occasions the matter was investigated and his complaints were found to be unjustified. He intimated to us that the former Parliamentary Secretary was responsible for having the litter collection extended to five days a week.  That was not correct because it was the superintendent of the park who made that decision.</P>

      <P>The extension of compulsory measures for the eradication of brucellosis to Counties Clare and Galway in July, 1973, added considerably to the work of the local district veterinary offices and resulted in some arrears of work at the offices concerned over the past few months. Additional staff has been recruited to deal with the situation and every effort is being made to ensure that payments for reactors are made as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally people are paid about four weeks after the reactors are found.  It takes a couple of weeks to get valuation and an agreement on the valuation and to get the animals moved.  After that it takes a couple of weeks more to process the application for payment through the usual channels.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Cavan):</i> I regret the information at my disposal does not bear out what the Deputy has said.  It appears the land in question was sold by the original owner in June, 1971.  An inspection notice was served on 3rd September, 1971, proceedings commenced for acquisition of the land on 3rd December, 1971, and the provisional list was published on 26th January, 1972.  On 18th February, 1972, an application was made on behalf of the person in whom, I think, the Deputy is interested; that application was fully considered but was refused on 24th May, 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The information before me, which deals with a transaction long before I became Minister for Lands, shows that the inspectors investigated fully the Deputy's constituent.  It was revealed that the person in question was a landless man, living with his wife and two young children on a 42-acre holding owned by his brother-in-law. It was revealed he had three cows, four two-year-old cattle and 50 sheep on the lands situated in the townland of Tawneygorm, Inver, some five miles from the land which is mentioned in this question.  The information on the file shows that the person worked full-time as a lorry driver in the town of Dunkineely.  The inspector's report of May, 1972, <Col N="1791" /> showed he was not a suitable purchaser. The report also showed there were five worthy congests in the immediate vicinity.  That is all the information I have on the file.</P>

It is not now considered there is such a thing as bad land.  The whole pressure is on the Department of Lands to release land for grazing which they have acquired for afforestation.  The increased value of land and the increased profit from agricultural activities have created this problem.</P>

The Department of Lands are paying as much as £60 or £70 per acre.  I agree that even that is not sufficient to encourage people to sell <Col N="1793" /> land to the forestry section.  The question arises regarding the economics of paying more for land and planting. This problem has arisen in the last 12 months or two years because of the increased price for land and it is a matter on which a policy decision will have to be taken in the near future.</P>

      <P>1970-71&mdash;£124; 1971-72&mdash;£168; 1972-73&mdash;£156.</P>

        <i>(Cavan):</i> The objective of land settlement policy is the improvement of farm structure; and that includes not alone the enlargement of small holdings but also the rearrangement of holdings which are held in rundale or intermixed plots.  In County Galway, as elsewhere, the Land Commission carry out such rearrangement wherever they find it possible and practicable to do so.  These operations, of course, always involve the surrender of plots or fields by individual farmers in exchange for other lands: the procedure is entirely voluntary; and success, therefore, depends on the willingness of all concerned to give up the plots required for the rearrangement scheme and to accept in exchange the land which the Land Commission are able to offer them.</P>

The solution to the problem requires the goodwill and co-operation of the various people affected because, if one is going to close gaps, one inevitably has to move people.  The officers of my Department are available for consultation with the local people interested.  I would suggest that the local advisory services might be availed of to encourage a local plan which would lead to people being agreeable to co-operate in the rearrangement of holdings. From what I have seen and from what I have been told I am convinced that, without goodwill on the part of those concerned, the problem is almost impossible of solution.</P>

      <P>Ireland's position is that we have always maintained friendly relations with the states of the Arab world.  There have been no indications that the Arab states regard our position as being in any way other than friendly.  The Government have consistently supported the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the decisions of the Security Council designed to achieve a just and lasting settlement to the conflict in that area.  Ireland's individual contribution to the search for this settlement has taken the concrete form of making available, at the request of the Secretary-General, a <Col N="1800" /> contingent of Irish troops to serve with the United Nations Emergency Force in the Middle East to assist in the implementation of Security Council resolutions.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the Arab states have felt obliged to take certain decisions in regard to the production and supply of oil.  My understanding is that the Arab states intend to make known comprehensively their attitude to the rest of the world in the matter of oil supplies.  This has not yet been done.

In fact, no application has been received to date from anybody in Chile for entry to Ireland.  As will be appreciated, the refugees who have applied to get out of Chile have named a number of countries; amongst these Ireland has not so far been named, as far as we are aware. We are in touch with the UN High Commission for Refugees, and if and when we receive any application from any of the people concerned in Chile the matter will be sympathetically dealt with.</P>

      <P>Yes.  As soon as we have hard information that some particular person wants to come&mdash;and there are these agencies for feeding this information&mdash;the matter will be looked at.  The Deputy will appreciate that there are many matters which concern a refugee, and they include employment prospects and so forth. There are a number of central European <Col N="1806" /> countries which have employment opportunities and which have been named by the refugees as places to which they wish to go.  Of course, we have seen in the last few weeks that with the oil situation even central Europe is trying to discourage people from coming in.  However, the Deputy may be assured that if requests accompanied by hard information are received they will be dealt with sympathetically.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the ESB voltage drops at times in parts of Donegal, and in other parts of the country, and that this can result in loss of picture or rolling pictures on television sets although the transmissions are not affected.  Remedying this situation is a matter for the ESB.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that specifically in the Carrigans district this condition obtains for a considerable time, and despite repeated requests and complaints nothing to rectify the voltage problem has been done by the EB, nor anything promised for a considerable time.  That means that television sets are obsolete, though licences are due.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should add for completeness that although I think the ESB supplies are the main difficulty, it is not entirely due to that. There is also a difficulty about transposers. The transposers in Letterkenny, <Col N="1807" /> Moville and Fanad are not entirely reliable.  The provision of new transposers is included in the RTE three-to-four-year programme for improving reception in the country generally.</P>
      <P>On the question of licence fees, there is no statutory provision for remission or waiving of licence fees on grounds of poor reception.  It would be very difficult, as the Deputy will understand, to administer a scheme whereby the amount of a licence fee would depend on the type of reception available.  Everyone would tend to have complaints if he knew he might get his fee reduced.  The present position is that a licence fee is payable in respect of possession of wireless telegraphy apparatus, including an aerial, irrespective of whether the apparatus is being used.  This means that anybody who holds a television set has to pay the same licence whether the reception is good or bad or whether he can receive one or several programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is not a question of the quality of reception?  In this area it is a question of not getting reception.  In view of that and in spite of the laws that are there, could we take it that, without a guarantee being asked for, at the same time that that would be a fairly good defence, pending the work I hope the ESB are going to do as a result of the answer by the Minister's colleague in Transport and Power, and that their apparatus would not be confiscated, as the law normally would do?</P>

      <P>I am sorry that some holders of television sets are not getting good reception or, as the Deputy says, any reception.  As far as the ESB end of it is concerned, my colleague can answer for that.  As far as RTE is concerned, I am hoping the new transposers to be included in the development programme will in due course improve reception and bring reception to those who do not have it at the moment.  As regards what would be a good defence, I think I <Col N="1808" /> must leave that for the courts to decide.</P>

So far as the Parliamentary Secretary's reply is concerned, within my knowledge there is a very low supply, if not a scarcity, of a variety of bulbs held by wholesalers at present.

      <P>It is well accepted by the Minister for Education that there <Col N="1816" /> is a considerable degree of urgency in taking decisions on the whole question of non-university higher education in Dublin.  For that reason the Minister has set up special machinery in the Department for dealing with submissions received in the context of Higher Education Authority reports and he is, I am aware, treating this particular case with great urgency. As the Deputy is also aware, it is a complex matter and it is not desirable that decisions should be taken without very full consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make some concluding remarks on our position within the EEC, particularly <Col N="1818" /> having regard to the point I was making earlier, that I believe this Government have failed properly to publish and project the benefits available to individuals and organisations who could derive benefit from them. In a recently commissioned survey undertaken at the request of the Commission it transpired, and it was apparently a representative survey, that 56 per cent of the Irish people when asked now whether they were in favour of our membership of the European Community answered &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and, not surprisingly, only 41 per cent of them thought it was a good thing for them individually.  This is obviously a very steep drop from the 83 per cent who voted in favour of entry.  I make the point now to confirm what I have been saying, that the Government have failed miserably properly to promote the various schemes of the EEC to the individuals and organisations concerned.  I hope they will take note of this as an indication of the public's reaction and concern.  It may also be an indication of many other things but at least I would regard it as being an indication of that.</P>
      <P>I want to make one other reference in connection with our membership of the EEC.  I referred to this before but since then I have reason to understand that perhaps I did not sufficiently highlight the significance of a statement in a report on the European Communities.  It is the one dealing with political co-operation.  It refers, at paragraph 1.2, to the Paris Summit of October, 1972, and the mandate given to the Foreign Minister to produce a second report on methods of improving political co-operation. It goes on to refer to the second report and it says that the discussions in this connection are regarded as being outside the scope of &ldquo;normal Community activity.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be stated for the record of the House that the discussions in connection with the foreign policy of the Community undertaken prior to the mid-East policy statement are outside the scope of Community activity. They have nothing whatever to do with our membership of the EEC.  In <Col N="1819" /> fact, it is under the Avignon procedure, whereby the Ministers of the member states retire to another room, and if necessary to another capital, take off one hat and don another, and then make statements as individual Ministers of the nine member countries. It is important that the Minister should have spelled out clearly, first in the report and secondly to this House, that the position in this instance is totally outside our obligations as members of the EEC.  I do not intend to repeat what I said during the debate on the report but I am concerned that the Minister can involve himself so freely in decisions which may be a precedent for further decisions in the foreign policy area and <i>ipso facto</i> in subsequent defence area decisions which we are not either obliged or expected to take as a result of our membership of the EEC.</P>
    <P>Anybody reading the first page of this report would not understand these consultations unless they had a knowledge of the procedure.  There is no indication of how significant or detailed were the consultations.  It is my opinion that the decision was an <i>ad hoc</i> reaction to circumstances presented to the Minister at the time. I am concerned that our Minister could so freely append his name to any statement of this nature without having the opportunity of giving it active and detailed consideration and in particular without indicating here in advance whether the decision would be taken as a precedent for further involvement beyond our commitment.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion in the Taoiseach's speech that as a matter of principle all Bills coming before the House from now on should be sent to a special committee.  Let us take a factual view of this suggestion and consider it in the light of the facilities and capital available to us to discharge either individually or collectively, such responsibility.</P>
    <P>I need hardly remind the House of the number of committees in existence at present, both special committees of the House and informal committees such as the EEC committee <Col N="1820" /> and the committee concerning Northern Ireland which was established during the lifetime of the last Dáil and which has been reactivated since.  When one takes into consideration the number of Deputies who are members of the Cabinet as well as those Deputies who are members of the European Parliament and the number that we hope will contribute meaningfully and positively to the Council of Ireland and, I presume, to the committees of that council, and when one considers the various other committees that exist, one realises the limitations of the capacity of the House.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is ludicrous for the Taoiseach to suggest that we should now refer all Bills to special committees. Is the Taoiseach being serious, considering that his Minister for Finance indicated this morning the provision of a further £45,000 this year for the committees of this House and seemed to regard this as a major breakthrough.  The public will realise that these committees can only discharge these responsibilities if they are properly serviced to do so, but this would require a lot more than the £45,000 mentioned by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Even with the best back-up service in the world, I have grave doubts whether this House having regard to the responsibilities of some Members and the professional preoccupation of many others, as well as the fact that many Members are not concerned particularly with the detailed work associated with Bills, could ever reach a stage where we could bear the burden of the present much less of the future in these areas.  Maybe there is a case to be made for increasing the representation in the House, but I am not suggesting that this be done.  It is a suggestion to which the public might not take too kindly.  If the Taoiseach's suggestion were to be implemented, the newspaper people, too, would have difficulty in servicing such committees in addition to servicing the proceedings of the House and any other work that might be in progress simultaneously. It would appear that the suggestion <Col N="1821" /> was made without having any regard to what would be the consequences of implementing it.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with what the Taoiseach referred to as being the most important concern in this debate, the Sunningdale conference, I would like to comment on a reference made this morning by the Minister for Finance to the necessity of backing up the European committee.  The Minister said that we were concerned with empire building.  I do not know whether he was referring to me or to other Members but I think I am justified in saying that he had better sort this one out with the Minister for Foreign Affairs because there seems to be a very considerable difference of views between them on the subject of empire building.</P>
    <P>For a considerable time we have been endeavouring to have discussed in this House the question of whether it is appropriate for us to have diplomatic relations with Russia but we have not succeeded in these endeavours.  It is the opinion of the Minister that the matter is one for the Executive to decide.  That is fair enough, but not having heard the views of the House I fail to understand how he can be so confident in his decision.  Fortunately, however, some of us took the precaution of recording a statement made so freely by the Minister on a radio programme. On that occasion he stated clearly that it was not for trade purposes that this matter would now be considered but in order that he, as a member of the Council of Ministers, would be able to take an informed view on matters coming before that Council so that when he cast his vote it would be an informed and responsible vote having regard to the fact that he has very serious responsibility in this area and that our country is the only one of the nine that has no diplomatic relations with Russia.  If it is the Minister's opinion that we should establish an embassy with any country so that he might take an informed and responsible view at meetings of the Council of Ministers, and judging from what he said this would seem to be the most important reason <Col N="1822" /> so far as he is concerned, might he not be the one who is engaging in empire building and not those of us on this side of the House, as was suggested by the Minister for Finance?</P>
    <P>Taking the Minister's point and other factors into account I am not suggesting that if the matter were discussed here the House might decide to support the Minister, but having regard to the present lack of back-up of our involvement in so many international organisations I think the Minister's priorities are wrong especially when one has regard to our limited resources.  Perhaps even at this late stage this is a matter on which the Minister would take a responsible viewpoint and that whoever is engaged in empire building will have a second look at the situation.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Sunningdale conference I would like to say at the outset that, as the Leader of this party has said, the public, should they have any doubts, can rest assured that all of us welcome any move towards reconciliation, tolerance, harmony and peace in this country.  In so far as the agreement reached is a significant step towards the realisation of reconciliation and co-operation we support the outcome of the conference.  I want to put that clearly on record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said we support the Sunningdale agreement but I intend, if the Minister has an opportunity to listen, to make certain comments which I believe will give him an indication of our concern in some areas.  We recognise a formal agreement is to follow and we hope the Government will take what we have to say into account when this formal agreement is being signed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Sunningdale conference, and any talks in this connection, must be put in proper perspective.  The Deputies on this side of the division were not responsible for Partition.  Neither was it our fellow Irishmen in the North of the country who were <Col N="1823" /> responsible for Partition.  Responsibility for Partition, and the consequences of Partition in many ways, not in every way, lies fairly and squarely with the British Government. This is the first thing that must be stated.  But looking at the communiqué issued from Sunningdale one could be forgiven for getting the impression that the matters were discussed in the light of troubles that have spontaneously emerged in any part of our country because of certain differences of tradition, attitudes that exist on both sides of the Border and the need, particularly, to deal with terrorism.  There is much more to it than that.</P>
    <P>One thing more than any other that all Irishmen have in common &mdash;this is something that has not been stated as yet&mdash;is the fact that we all recognise Britain's financial obligation deriving from history, deriving from our economic involvement, to contribute meaningfully to the solution of the present position in Northern Ireland and, in particular, to enable all Irishmen to work towards effecting harmony and peace.  I acknowledge the firmly held view of many Unionists in the North of Ireland who wish to remain part of the United Kingdom. I acknowledge and respect that view. When one acknowledges these things one must also accept that we can never hope to achieve normality with them until such time as we can, by persuasion and proof of our concern, change their view.  We can only do that and no more.  We cannot do that by any other means.</P>
    <P>There is no reference in the communiqué to this financial obligation of Britain.  I should now like to refer to paragraph 7 of the communiqué. This paragraph states that the conference agreed that a Council of Ireland would be set up.  But what follows is the important point.</P>
    <P>It would be confined to representatives of the two parts of Ireland, with appropriate safeguards for the British Government's financial and other interests.</P>
    <P>I know it is easy for me to suggest an appropriate amendment to that <Col N="1824" /> text.  Nonetheless, I should like to do so and I should like to inquire from the Minister who will be replying on behalf of the Taoiseach what difficulties they found in inserting an amendment such as I am about to suggest. The amendment I suggest is something that occurs to any Irishman. I suggest that instead of saying, &ldquo;with appropriate safeguards for the British Government's financial and other interests&rdquo; we should say, &ldquo;with appropriate provision for the discharge of the British Government's financial and other obligations&rdquo;. This is a matter which, in the interest of all Irishmen must be stated because all of us recognise that Britain has obligations that derive from history and otherwise.</P>
    <P>In the interest of the pride of Irishmen of whatever tradition this should be stated.  In this we could find another common bond, a common bond that all of us are looking for.  This is not based on a prejudiced opposition of any type but on an acknowledgment of what the reality is having regard to the history of this island.</P>
    <P>When one reads paragraph 9 of the communiqué, which deals with the revenue of the Council of Ireland, one sees that there is no clear indication of Britain's financial commitment or contribution to this council.  This paragraph states:</P>
    <P>During the initial period following the establishment of the Council of Ireland the revenue of the council would be provided by means of grants from the two administrations in Ireland towards agreed projects and budgets, according to the nature of the service involved.</P>
    <P>I know it can be fairly said that if it comes from the two administrations there is already an element there of a financial contribution from Britain but it must also be said that this is qualified in other ways by what follows. Equally, if this council is to achieve the purpose all of us want to see it achieving&mdash;reconciliation and co-operation and whatever happy consequences may follow from that&mdash; Britain may have, like always, to be a little more than generous in the <Col N="1825" /> circumstances and even make direct contributions to certain projects.  I am not prejudging the issue but the ways of the past are very much in favour of this argument.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 9 of the communiqué further states:</P>
    <P>It is also agreed that further studies would be put in hand forthwith and completed as soon as possible of methods of financing the council after the initial period which would be consonant with the responsibilities and functions assigned to it.</P>
    <P>I hope those further studies will give rise to some such commitment.  That paragraph continues:</P>
    <P>It was agreed that the cost of the secretariat of the Council of Ireland would be shared equally&mdash;</P>
    <P>From what has been said earlier one presumes that this means equally between the two administrations, between the Executive in the North and the Government here.  We are also told in the communiqué that other services would be financed broadly in proportion to where expenditure or benefit accrues.  The Minister for Finance referred to this earlier today.  Again, in its own way, this is a reasonable proposition, and obviously one all of us welcomes, but I see no indication of Britain's obligation or role in this apart from the fact that the Northern Ireland Executive is involved.</P>
    <P>Another part of paragraph 9 states:</P>
    <P>While Britain continues to pay subsidies to Northern Ireland such payments would not involve Britain participating in the council, it being accepted, nevertheless, that it would be legitimate to safeguard, in an appropriate way, her financial involvement in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I know it is not possible to say everything in such a communiqué because of the delicate feelings of the people on this island.  However, one wonders, when there has been so much reference to Britain's interest and safeguarding in an appropriate way her financial involvement if the people <Col N="1826" /> who spent so much time and trouble &mdash;and I acknowledge both&mdash;in drafting this communiqué were aware of the reaction of the people here to the fact that we seem to be concerned with safeguarding Britain's financial interest in one sense and that we have made no reference to Britain's obligation to discharge her financial obligation.</P>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach, and the members of the Government, in the course of their later discussions prior to the signing of any treaty arising out of these talks, will give serious thought to that.  We would like to have a commitment, if we are entering or registering agreements in the United Nations, which is a little more specific that what at present appears in the communiqué.  I do not think any such commitment would upset the attitude of Irishman to Irishman whatever their tradition.  If I thought that would happen I would not have made that suggestion.  In fact, I think it would acknowledge the one thing we have in common: a recognition of Britain's financial obligation and the fact that we, given a chance, can discharge our responsibilities and do not need constantly to rely on the handouts of assistance of any other nation.</P>
    <P>I do not regard this as a handout.  I regard it as a consideration in discharge of a contract.  There is a long and historical binding contract between this country and Britain.  There have been changes in Britain's attitude over the last 50 years.  I welcome those changes, belated though they be.  It is important at this stage in recognition of the reality that we should look at those changes.  We should first look at the 45 or 50 years of inactivity.  There was apparent lack of concern. Under the Speaker's convention in Westminster the internal affairs of Northern Ireland could not be brought up there.  For all those years, for reasons best known to themselves, the many injustices which existed, and which I do not intend to discuss in detail, were not apparently a matter of immediate concern to the British Government.</P>
    <P>There may have been other <Col N="1827" /> reasons, but the reality was that it was not until very recent years that, because of the Civil Rights movement, what followed it and the international notice attaching thereto, the British Government reacted.  I am glad to say that in recent times they have reacted in a reasonably positive sense. Up to 1969&mdash;and I am not quite precise about this&mdash;the Speaker's convention still applied.  Then, because of the factors mentioned, Northern Ireland could not only be discussed but it became the main topic of discussion there.  If there was one single topic which dominated the discussions at Westminster it was, in fact, Northern Ireland.  The Legislature in Westminster then changed the law with regard to the status of Northern Ireland in the United Kingdom.  Any change in the status of Northern Ireland would be subject to the consent of the Northern Ireland Parliament.  But now it is guaranteed as long as the people of Northern Ireland wish it.  By a stroke of the pen, or by the change in the collective opinion of the Legislature in Westminster, it is no longer &ldquo;the Parliament&rdquo;&mdash;Stormont, as it was then &mdash;but &ldquo;the people of Northern Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an indication of Britain's position in this matter.  It is an indication that Britain, taking decisions of this nature, can influence the situation to a considerable extent when it seems necessary and urgent to Britain to do so.  We had the suspension of Stormont under British legislation. We had the establishment of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Executive under British legislation. We now have the Council of Ireland legislation to be introduced this week to give effect to decisions taken at Sunningdale.  This is all an indication of the fact that the <i>sine qua non</i> of any development in this area lies with the British Parliament because of their historic involvement and obligation.  The position is that nothing can change in any real sense until the British Government&mdash;and in the manner in which they are now reacting one can hope at least that the opportunity for further positive and <Col N="1828" /> tolerant change will emerge&mdash;act on their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>Suggestions have been made from time to time that somehow the conditions in this part of the country were the cause of Partition.  I do not intend to defend many of the attitudes of our society.  This is not a matter for debate on this occasion.  The Taoiseach is on record as having said that the time has come for a new Constitution and we should bury the old one quietly.  Recently Deputy Harte appeared with me on a programme called &ldquo;Here and Now&rdquo;. The chairman mentioned the All-Party Committee on the implications of Irish unity and Deputy Harte said that so far as he was concerned he would throw the Constitution into the Liffey and, further, that he was not concerned whatever with meaningless constitutional jargon.</P>
    <P>I accept the sincerity of people who say they are more concerned with people's lives, as all of us are, than with Constitutions.  But it is being quite naïve to suggest that one can do anything in any area to safeguard people's lives without having institutions through which one can operate. I am concerned that, if there is an implication that the responsibility for the troubles that have presented themselves lie here and that we have a responsibility to change, we are causing others to whom we present that argument to look in the wrong direction.  I acknowledge that this case as presented by me now is not entirely original.  I have seen it referred to very effectively in a recent article in <i>The Irish Times</i> by Geoffrey Bing who had experience of this matter in Westminster.  It was indicated that from the 14th to the 19th centuries the British could lay claim in their coinage and otherwise to being <i>rex</i> or <i>regina Francia.</i> This claim was not a matter of particular concern to the French during those generations.</P>
    <P>I mention that to indicate that matters of this nature represent the genuine aspirations, as the communiqué acknowledges.  Our Constitution and what it contains represent our genuine aspirations.  We should all <Col N="1829" /> like to see the time emerge when, under new institutions in a new Ireland, we would not need any such statements in a Constitution because they would have become superfluous. Until such time as it does emerge we must acknowledge the fact that we should place the responsibility where it should lie.  When our time comes, we must prove that we, too, will be generous and tolerant.  In the meantime there is a danger from the tone of this communiqué that there is an implication that it was our responsibility rather than Britain's that all of these troubles have come about.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 10 of the communiqué states in connection with the proposals which were put forward:</P>
    <P>Different ways of solving this problem were discussed: Among them were the amendment of legislation operating in the two jurisdictions on extradition, the creation of a common law enforcement area in which an all-Ireland court would have jurisdiction, and the extension of the jurisdiction of domestic courts so as to enable them to try offences committed outside this jurisdiction.  It was agreed that problems of considerable legal complexity were involved, and that the British and Irish Governments would jointly set up a commission to consider all the proposals put forward at the Conference and to recommend as a matter of urgency the most effective means of dealing with those who commit these crimes.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of paragraph 10 it was stated:</P>
    <P>It was agreed by all parties that persons committing crimes of violence, however motivated, in any part of Ireland should be brought to trial irrespective of the part of Ireland in which they are located.</P>
    <P>I simply want to say that the criminal law is only one element in the total statute law of a country.  It does not exist in a vacuum.  It is part of the legal framework of any country.  Therefore we should not just be dealing with punitive jurisdiction of the courts because when we are dealing with crimes <Col N="1830" /> of violence we may lose sight of what the law means and of the fact that the criminal law is but one element of statutory law in any country.  I hope we are concerned with encouraging respect for law generally.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about law and order and this can be interpretated in a very emotional way.  This has often been the reaction in the matter of law and order according to all preconceived attitudes.  We must learn to understand that the law represents not just punishment but also the concern our institutions must have to establish a framework for society which will uphold all the legal requirements of those in that society, including protection of civil rights.</P>
    <P>Last weekend I suggested that there is great opportunity and scope for the commission which has been suggested to harmonise the law as between both parties.  Up to 50 years ago we had such harmonisation and common courts in the several areas.  Having regard in particular to our membership of the EEC and the need in any event for harmonised laws within that community, surely the Council of Ireland and the institutions set up under that council will have a better opportunity to establish what they want to establish.  Normally the courts of such an institution would be concerned with normal protection of civil rights, whether these involve criminal law or civil law.  I am not aware of any jurisdiction where the criminal law is treated entirely separately. Criminal law in property is inevitably associated with civil law in property. That can be illustrated in several jurisdictions, including the States in America.</P>
    <P>Our main concern is to see that there is respect for the institutions of the council and for the courts which we hope to see established.  These courts, I hope, can evolve into representative institutions in regard to the various aspects of law.  I know it is not reasonable to expect that all this can be done overnight.  It involves complex studies but they are not as complex as they might appear to be.  I am mainly concerned that the council or any of their institutions would not be <Col N="1831" /> seen simply as an agency of punishment or enforcement.  You cannot have respect for an agency which is one of punishment or enforcement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree and if the Minister thinks I am illogical in what I am saying, well and good.  Mr. Faulkner seemed to suggest he did not think it was necessary to look at the general harmonisation of laws, but perhaps if it were brought home to him that such could be done he would agree.  I am not aware of what happened at the conference.  We welcome the conference and the communiqué. All that is needed is co-operation between Irishmen through democratic institutions.</P>
      <P>I was glad to see in the communiqué that representation should be weighted in favour of the northern representatives.  From our point of view we can assure all concerned that we will not in any way support deceit or coercion of our fellow Irishmen, that through the council we will not deceive or coerce them into a united Ireland.</P>

      <P>I hope that from <Col N="1832" /> their experience of working with us in the council they will find in us a healthy desire for friendly normal relations with our nearest neighbour as two countries whose destinies and futures are inevitably associated, particularly having regard to our common membership of the European Community.  They will particularly find in us a desire to live in peace and reconciliation with Irishmen of every tradition for our common good.</P>
      <P>Towards this end we must be patient, generous, tolerant and understanding. We are concerned for the feelings and frustrations of all in the North of Ireland.  These feelings are deep and the frustrations are real.  We are concerned in a special way for the feelings and frustrations of our Unionist fellow Irishmen because they might not readily appreciate our concern.  I believe we can prove that concern through the institutions which have been proposed as a result of these talks and negotiations which have been carried on during the past few days. I believe we can prove that concern and, in time, they will respond to it. That is the ultimate hope we all share.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unfortunate that this debate has been relegated to a place where, when everything else has been attended to, we will talk about the Taoiseach's Estimate.  A minute part of it is, perhaps, the most important, some say historic, momentous occasion, certainly in my lifetime and the lifetime of most of the people in this House, that is, the Sunningdale conference which was held a few days ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am amazed at the manner in which it has been played down.  I am staggered by the scant treatment it has received from the Taoiseach who brought it in with his Estimate, as we felt, to give it a better floor for discussion and make it more convenient for the House.  It was brought into that discussion a number of days after the various media had their &ldquo;go&rdquo; at it and quoted the various versions of the participants in those talks.  I am horrified at the prospect that this is to be the only discussion on a matter as important and as far-reaching and, <Col N="1833" /> perhaps, as dangerous as is, I think, this document which has emanated as an agreed communiqué.  I complained very bitterly, and properly so, that a copy of the communiqué was quoted in various cross-Channel and home newspapers a number of days before a copy was made available to any Member of this House.  In fact, copies were made available to Members late last night.  Most Members would not have received their copy until this morning.</P>
    <P>Members were approached by various newspapers and asked to give their views on the communiqué.  They did so and their views were widely publicised.  Yet, the communiqué&mdash; which was the only document issued on the discussions&mdash;became available to Members of this House only yesterday. This was very wrong.  It reflects no credit on the Government, or the Information Bureau&mdash;if they were at fault&mdash;or on anybody connected with the Sunningdale discussions.</P>
    <P>I have been sought by newspaper reporters&mdash;I will deal with other media later&mdash;for some time.  I did not have anything to discuss because I had not a copy of the only document to emanate from that conference.  I read what was reported in the papers both cross-Channel and at home.  I issued a statement because it appeared as if I had nothing to say about this.  That would be untrue, of course, as well as unfair to the people I represent.  My statement was carried in full by <i>The Irish Times,</i> to quite a degree by <i>The Irish Independent,</i> to some degree by <i>The Irish Press</i> and not at all by the State-sponsored and State paid for RTE.  Perhaps they were following in the footsteps we know they trod in recent years of being suppressed in disseminating the views of any of us anywhere who do not happen to agree with the official view of the Establishment of the day; and that goes for today, yesterday, last week and last year.</P>
    <P>The document I issued got some mention, not only because of what it contained.  It even got a description: a Paisleyite-like document.  That, of course, could come from one pen only, <Col N="1834" /> wielded by one man who would see this document in that way.  I give him this credit at least: by so doing he is drawing some attention to it, which is more than the RTE institution, which I and the rest of us help to pay for, had the courtesy to do.  In their operations over recent time&mdash;when I say &ldquo;recent&rdquo; I mean the past two or three years&mdash;on this very touchy matter of the Irish question and the national issue, they seem to be directed by the gnomes wholly and completely to conform to the Establishment point of view.  Any time they infringe on that there is a long silence before another view contrary to that of the Establishment is heard from any of the persons who might hold a contrary view.  There are more people holding contrary views to those of this and the last Establishment than would be depicted by that particular media.</P>
    <P>I have had no reason to change the statement in question now that I have seen the official communiqué.  I should like to quote from my statement.  This may be unusual but it is not unorthodox. I said:</P>
    <P>Mr. Heath says of Sunningdale that &ldquo;it is absolutely true that all delegations were prepared to compromise in order to get agreement&rdquo;. Mr. Cosgrave says of Sunningdale that none of us has compromised and no one has asked any of the others to compromise on basic aspirations.</P>
    <P>Yet the Dublin Government have agreed to make a solemn declaration recognising internationally (as I understand it) the present partitioned status of the Six Counties as part of the United Kingdom.  The greatest sell-out in our history (and I underline that).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that at a later and more appropriate time.  I will continue to quote from my own statement which I made on the 11th December:</P>
      <P>The agreement would ensure the return to Stormont, with the RUC elevated to a new and more powerful status and their continuance guaranteed by all the five signatories of Sunningdale.</P>
      <P>Internment is to remain.  The internees and political prisoners are to be used as pawns.  A mean advantage is being taken of the relatives of internees with baited promises of release by instalment in order to assist the compromisers of Sunningdale in selling this shabby deal to the Irish people.</P>
      <P>The proposal for trying in one jurisdiction persons accused of offences in another jurisdiction is ludicrous.</P>
      <P>It is totally unacceptable, unworkable, and almost certainly unconstitutional. If the Dublin Government were being honest with the people in this regard, it would scrap the Constitution and propose our return to the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>Appointments to the Garda Police Authority are to be made in consultation with the Council of Ireland.  But Britain is to make the appointments to the RUC Authority after consultation with Mr. Faulkner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement continues:</P>
      <P>Why the sinister difference? Further, Mr. Faulkner says that the Garda Commissioner and the Chief Constable of the RUC are &ldquo;to sit down and work out together the best ways to co-operate&rdquo; in hounding Republicans.  Collaboration, in other words, is to be legalised&mdash;and this outside the control of any parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1836" /> Apart from the fact that the stated matters with which the proposed Council of Ireland may deal are not relevant to a peaceful solution of the Irish question, the further fact that each of the 14 members of its Council of Ministers has a veto makes it nothing more than a further piece of Sunningdale window-dressing for which the public are to be asked to provide the finance.</P>
    <P>The only solution that holds out any real hope of an end to violence in Ireland is for a Council of Ireland with complete control of security for the whole island&mdash;and that can only happen after Britain declares her intention to go.  This must be accompanied by the ending of internment, with a general amnesty North and South, and in Britain, for all political prisoners.</P>
    <P>The Sunningdale agreement has all the appearance of being another &ldquo;damn good bargain&rdquo;, as Mr. Cosgrave's predecessor some fifty years ago described what has since proved to be a tragic mistake.</P>
    <P>That statement was made without the aid of the communiqué but as a result of reading various cross-Channel and home newspapers.  As I have said, having read the communiqué and having tried to digest it since last night, I have no reason to change it but much reason to add to what I have said.</P>
    <P>It appears from what we have been told by the Taoiseach that we are not to discuss the matter.  In fact, it has been suggested it would be better that we should not elaborate on the subject. We have been told that the hopes of success and chances of real progress would be better if we did not talk about it.  Surely this is the very negation of the whole purpose of a forum for debate in this country.  If there is no forum for debate before which a matter as important as this might be brought, then there is no democracy left in what we claim to be our territory on this side of the Border.</P>
    <P>What does the Taoiseach want us to do?  Are we to willy-nilly trust what has been done by way of a bargain, <Col N="1837" /> which emerged as a package at Sunningdale?  All I can say as an Irishman&mdash;I do not think anyone can feel aggrieved about it&mdash;is that anything brought about by way of deliberations, discussions and bargaining with British diplomats and members of the British Government is not to be trusted.  That is the first thing all of us must surely know.</P>
    <P>This particular operation is even more fraught with danger because in addition to the traditional British diplomacy that has held them together and won for them many possessions during the centuries, on this occasion aiding and abetting them was the very quick brain and the politically agile Mr. Faulkner who has no peer in the political arena in either of the two islands at this time.  For those reasons I was absolutely staggered by the Taoiseach's suggestion that it would be better not to go into this matter in any great detail.  He set the tone himself by relegating to five or seven pages out of 27 pages his contribution in connection with this important matter as head of the Irish Government delegation.</P>
    <P>In the first paragraph of my statement I highlighted the contradiction where one Prime Minister, Mr. Heath, said it was absolutely true that all delegations were prepared to compromise in order to get agreement, while the Taoiseach stated that none of the parties compromised or asked anyone else to compromise on basic aspirations.  In the light of that contradiction, and from the scant supply of information furnished to us, either through the communiqué or the Taoiseach's contribution or those of other speakers in the debate, can we see what has happened and is happening?</P>
    <P>One reason for all the apparent secrecy, the soft-footed approach, the playing down of the most momentous and important occasion in my lifetime, and the contradiction evident in a specific way in the remarks of the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach, may be that the British public have to be sold a version, the Unionists in the Six Counties must be sold a somewhat different version and <Col N="1838" /> for the poor slobs south of the Border any version will do.  The long-suffering nationalist people in the Six Counties also have to be given some variation of the version&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>They were represented at the talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>All of this must go towards selling the idea.  We are great at selling these days.  It seems to be our greatest attribute now.  Is this why we are not being given the information? Is there a better, more reasonable or more logical explanation? If there is, is it not a sad thing that we have to look for it in the House rather than being given it?</P>
      <P>Should not the fullest explanation be given whether it be a version that pleases or displeases me, or pleases or displeases the Unionists in the Six Counties, or the British people or the Nationalists?  It is the truth that should be given.  There should only be one version.  Let us get it all out. Let our people know what it is all about.  Let us not have doubts raised because of lack of information, particularly if there is no cause for those doubts.  Why raise the doubts by short circuiting the information that might be given if it is available?  I believe the Government must give that information. I believe it must be clarified and that it will be on their heads if it is not.</P>
      <P>In opening this debate the Taoiseach avoided like the plague giving any details which might elaborate or clarify what is contained in the communiqué. We find some strange and rather difficult passages in the communiqué but, before going on to quote them, let me put it this way.  In the five pages, or so, the Taoiseach gave us by way of his total contribution, representing the people who were at the talks and the Government over which he presides, these were his words:</P>
      <P>The wording of the communiqué is I believe clear and I do not think it necessary or useful to enter here into a detailed commentary on it, or interpretation of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having disposed of it satisfactorily <Col N="1839" /> and explained it so clearly that even I could see every last item in the communiqué, he goes on to say in the next paragraph:</P>
    <P>The important thing now is to make what was agreed at Sunningdale work for the benefit of all the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>What is he talking about?  What is it that is so clear in the communiqué? What is it that is for the good of all the people of Ireland that should be so clear in this communiqué that, having dealt with it in those sparse few words, we are now to lump it and like it and work through it for the betterment of all the people of Ireland?  This is a grand aspiration, but surely it is not the manner in which a document of the nature of this communiqué, and particularly its content, should be dealt with in this House on this important occasion.</P>
    <P>Surely we should look at it and seek clarification and, if necessary, rediscussion and re-negotiation in order to get clarification on practically everything contained in the communiqué. The Taoiseach said that the setting up of the Six County Executive and the Council of Ireland early next month, as he forecast, would not be helped &ldquo;if each Party to the agreement were to enter into detailed exposition of its own particular interpretation of the communiqué, or of any part of it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This brings me back round the circle again to the other way in which it has been approached.  Apparently there must be a deal and a pact between all the participants in Sunningdale that, whatever it is they have agreed on, even though we do not understand it, we are not to be told their versions of it.  What does that mean?  Are we all to be kept in the dark or are we, as we have already seen, to find some of these parties not sticking to the deal at Sunningdale, like Mr. Faulkner coming out in various media and telling us various parts of what he understands and believes he agreed to and what will follow from it.  Mr. Heath, I am sure, is not really in any great dilemma.  If he is pushed on any of these matters he will talk.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1840" /> Here in this House the Taoiseach, perhaps in accordance with some preconceived and agreed formula is not forthcoming at all.  I think he has got to be.  There is an absolute obligation on him.  No part of this dealing can or should properly be done&mdash;even if it can be done it should not be done&mdash; until it is fully and completely and absolutely explained and clearly understood by all the people of this country and not only their representatives in this House who are not clear on it at this stage.  Unless we get a great deal more information we will not be clear on what this is all about. We should get the clarity that this important occasion demands and then, regardless of whether it is law that is involved, constitutional or otherwise, and regardless of whether the Government have a right as the Government to manipulate their way around what might preclude them from signing our heritage away, they should do one of two things.</P>
    <P>I would ask them to consider this seriously.  They would go down in history as people who, having done what they believed to be best, took the honest and straight course with their people.  They should go through the country for an election on the whole issue, the whole issue having been explained, or hold a referendum. There could not then be the recriminations which undoubtedly must arise and will arise, and from those recriminations perhaps more tragic happenings and, perhaps, parallels with that of which we have all had too much experience in the past.  I believe the Government should do this.  Even though they may feel they could show, by legal manipulation or otherwise, that they do not have to do it, it is important enough for them to do it. They would then know exactly where they were.  The people would know where they were going and, by and large, the Government and people would move towards that end.</P>
    <P>Are the people to be left in the dark?  That is the question I ask.  Are they to be left with what we have been given here?  Are they to be left with the various interpretations that we will have to try to make on these <Col N="1841" /> matters, representing as we do people who will be most interested to find out what do we think?  What is the explanation?  What was said in the Dáil?  What does that mean?  I say: do not leave us in the dark and do not leave them in the dark.  We had enough of that during the power cuts without having it in reality here again.</P>
    <P>If Stormont is coming back, as I believe it is, the people should be told. If we are recognising the Six Counties for the first time in our history and reneging&mdash;as I see it; others may see it differently&mdash;on our national aspirations, let us say that is what we are doing.  Do not let us go along, as we appear to be doing in paragraph 5, trying to have it both ways on the two sides of the one page.  The first thing which struck me about the declarations was that normally we get paragraphs one after the other, but here we get them side by side.  The Irish Government's declaration is on the left and the British Government's declaration is on the right.  I now quote the Irish declaration:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The Irish Government fully accepted and solemnly declared that there could be no change in the status of Northern Ireland&mdash;</P>
    <P>The rest of it is hogwash but I will quote it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;until a majority of the people of Northern Ireland desired a change in that status.</P>
    <P>I put the full stop after &ldquo;Northern Ireland&rdquo; if you want to know what is really intended there.  Again, my interpretation, and I am open and gladly available to be convinced that that interpretation is wrong above anything else in this document.  Anyone who can convince me that that is not the real interpretation I certainly will welcome.</P>
    <P>That is the end of the Irish declaration. We move over from that, as I see it, declaring our acceptance of that which we have never accepted, the Six Counties as part of the United Kingdom and we then get the British declaration and, as I read it and see it, and as it has its impact on me, it follows in this way, and I quote <Col N="1842" /> the British declaration:</P>
    <P>The British Government solemnly declared that it was, and would remain, its policy to support the wishes of the majority of the people of Northern Ireland.  The present status of Northern Ireland is that it is part of the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>There is a full stop there.  It goes on &mdash;again waffle, hogwash in my own estimation, and of no consequence whatever in so far as our national aspirations are concerned:</P>
    <P>If, in the future the majority of the people of Northern Ireland should indicate a wish to become part of a United Ireland, the British Government would support that wish.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the British declaration coming, as it were, after the Irish declaration which, reading on the left, is read first, merely copperfastens the fears I have and that have, indeed, been headlined in some papers, that we are, in fact, recognising the Six Counties as part of the United Kingdom and that we are jettisoning and throwing out the window the oft repeated claim that only the majority of all of the people of this island have the right to determine what may be its future; or, putting it conversely, as it often is, that no part of the 32 Counties of Ireland are conceded the right to opt out of this nation.  To me, nothing that has gone before or may come after in so far as the Sunningdale agreement is concerned matters a damn when it is compared to that if, as I say, it cannot be shown that my interpretation as I have given it here is not correct.  I would hope that it could be so shown, but I cannot see where or how that welter of words in both those declarations, and cutting out the bottom portion of each, they could mean anything other than the sell-out that I have mentioned earlier and, indeed, that I have mentioned at other times in the recent past.</P>
    <P>What are we then to do if we have, as I believe, though I dearly desire and hope that I am wrong&mdash;as I see it here, there is no getting away from or gainsaying it&mdash;in fact, given in and sold out our heritage and our birthright <Col N="1843" /> to Britain?  What then is to be the future in so far as any aspirations towards uniting our country as it is entitled to be united is concerned? What of all those and everything that has gone in the past in trying to reach this particular goal?  What of the sorry tragedy that the partition of our country is and has been for the last 50 odd years?  What does it mean that there are a thousand dead since 1969 and that there will be more dead&mdash;maybe before we are out of this House?  I just do not know.  Can we just go back even before 1969 and have a thought going back only those six or seven years to the emergence of what is credited as the beginning of the whole movement that has brought us up to this situation that we are discussing such a document here today, namely, the emergence of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association in the Six Counties?  Might I just even say that that may have been the formalising of the movement that began the whole situation and the whole episode that has culminated in this, if culmination this is in this agreement.  But might I suggest there was an earlier movement?</P>
    <P>I think that the first real evidence of an assertion by the people in the Six Counties of no longer being prepared to be pushed around and discriminated against on a sectarian basis arose out of the protests, which were non-political, non-religious, organised to try to do the sensible thing in regard to Ulster's new university; the people wanted it built in Derry.  They failed and the stupidity is still there with us, a bulge where it should not be on the north west, while Derry, on the north west, lacks the very facility that would be so useful to both sides of the Border, with or without the unnatural divide that is there at the moment.  From that I believe came the knowledge and the belief and the confidence that people could be got together to fight for their ordinary rights, to protest in every possible way and no longer lie down and take the sort of treatment that partition and the setting up of Stormont and the enshrining of a perpetual majority of a Unionist outlook was <Col N="1844" /> handing out to them.  Whether it was then known or not as the Civil Rights Association the movement began to gather strength, began to be taken note of, and whether it might have continued as it ultimately continued, if we did not have the stupidity on Craigavon Bridge away back in 1968 or the greater stupidity of Burntollet through the forces of the RUC and particularly of the dreaded B Specials at that time, whether the movement would have gone on regardless of these further provocative, inflammatory and discriminatory actions of these alleged law-keeping forces at that time, I do not know, but these things together with the ban on the march made by the then Minister for Home Affairs, Mr. Craig, whether they only contributed or whether, in fact, without them the cause might have fizzled out, I do not know, and nobody ever will now know.</P>
    <P>But the cause and the movement went on and gathered strength to such a degree that as 1969 wore on it became pretty evident that a clash was inevitable and that clash emerged and erupted, as we now know, tragically in Derry in August of that particular year.  We have the evidence upon evidence through inquiry after inquiry, through the cameras of the all-seeing eyes of our television crews who risked their lives and limbs to bring to us then the true state of things above in those Six Counties of ours, and the manner in which our people, all of them, irrespective of what side they belonged to, were being treated and all that they were going through.  They depicted above all else to the world to see that the B Specials and the RUC were no more peace-keeping forces&mdash;it is difficult to describe how far removed they were from what they were supposed to be doing as against what they were doing&mdash;because they were the people who were batoning down the people.  They were the people supposed to keep order but who were, in fact, the creators of the disorder.  They were the sort of people who kicked to death one Sam Devenney, of whom the House has heard many times before. These things were seen and appreciated for the first time in a wide sense and by a wider audience than ever before. <Col N="1845" /> This helped to create public opinion not only here in Ireland but in England and much, much further afield.</P>
    <P>True to its tradition&mdash;indeed, I suppose, almost obeying the causes and the reasons and the promoters who brought them into being&mdash;this peace-keeping force did not suddenly emerge in new splendour to keep the peace, but batoned to the ground, as they had so often done before, the Croppies who had raised their heads to claim their rights in their own city not only in Derry but also in Belfast.</P>
    <P>These things should not be forgotten when we are talking here in this communiqué from Sunningdale not only about recreating the RUC, but, adding insult to injury, creating and restructuring our own Garda Síochána on the RUC pattern.  What does this mean except that we have absolved completely a force that, by exposure to the world, by sworn statements at public inquiries and other inquiries, has depicted itself as a force that can never regain, if it ever had, the confidence of the minority in the Six Counties occupied, as they have been for so long by Great Britain?</P>
    <P>Have we lost all sense of reason, all sense of decency?  Have we forgotten entirely the role this force has played over so many years?  This is not to say that every member of it is to be condemned any more than the members of any other organisation are to be condemned, but as an organisation it is not the type that should be retained if there is to be any hope of respect for the law or the keeping of order in the future.  Above all, we should not import that pattern into the Garda Síochána, as is now being proposed.  This is madness, madness that should be nipped in the bud.  If there are to be police let there be two sets of police or guards, if the Border is to remain as it has been enshrined, in this document, as I read it, forever and always.  That is what it means to me.  I may be too obtuse.  I certainly am blunt.  I am northern, and I think I know what I am talking about in this regard.</P>
    <P>It is a tragedy that at the hour of our greatest opportunity in all of our <Col N="1846" /> history to put our foot on the road to final unity in this country, that we should opt out of our claim to that unity by saying that by consent we shall have it, with Britain saying very graciously: &ldquo;If they consent we shall not stand in the way; in fact we shall help you.&rdquo;  I am sure Britain at this stage in her history would be delighted to get rid of the North.  She must be sick, sore and tired of the Irish question. There may have been a time when holding the Six Counties was not merely the pride of the British Empire and the British Government, as I believe it now only is; there may have been a time when it was regarded by its war lords as absolutely necessary to the preservation of the island, but no longer is that the case. Surely we must have been aware of how sick and tired Britain is of the kettle of fish she has on her hands these last five or six years, shown up before the world for the occupying usurper that she is in this land of ours. She wants to get out, but we have not been helping her to get out.  We are now pinning her down to stay in. What has gone wrong?  Surely there must be limits to the distance any delegation is prepared to go to get agreement.  I am from the North of Ireland, north of the north.  I want peace in the North of Ireland or in the Six Counties, as it will always be to me.  I want an end to the conflict there.  I want to have the greatest co-operation between the people of Derry and Tyrone and Donegal because the Border counties of Monaghan, notably, Cavan, Louth and Donegal are all partitioned counties. We are suffering from the evils of Partition.  Who has represented our views at these talks?  Where are we given any consideration in this matter? We have not even been thought of.  We are sick listening to the tune: &ldquo;You cannot bomb a million Protestants into a united Ireland&rdquo;.  Nobody says that he could or that he wanted to.  What nobody who sings that tune ever seems to advert to is that there are half a million Catholic Nationalists in the Six Counties who have been kept there by coercion, discriminated against scandalously <Col N="1847" /> down through the years; and that there are close on another half million living in close proximity to the Border but south of it who are almost as much affected by that Partition as those inside the Six Counties. If you put them together there is no case you can make that the million have a right that the other million have not got; or that the million have a right that the other three-and-a-half million in the country have not got.</P>
    <P>We have gone away from any semblance of sanity in regard to this matter. I do not ignore the fact that those who went from this Government and Parliament here represented the Twenty-six Counties in all good faith, but overburdened with the idea that an agreement had to be got and that peace at any price was the answer. The greatest deception that any people could perpetrate on themselves is to believe that you can have peace at any price.  If the price is too high, that is the sure way not to have peace.  It is my fear and my regret that we will not have peace out of this package that has been presented to us, because the price is a reneging on our claims to our own territory.  That price may have bought something today, but it will not endure on the morrow.  I only hope that my interpretation is as wrong as I am positive that it is nearly right.</P>
    <P>Internment is a dirty word.  Internment in the recent years and in the recent decade was a very dirty word. Together with internment has gone torture, evidence of which has been elicited through the various media and as a result of public inquiries, not instituted by any of us here but instituted by what would only be regarded as the objective third party, Great Britain, who I feel, if anything, would not be partial to our point of view or to the finding that tortures were taking place.  Internment and torture were introduced hand in hand.  By whom were they ordered and introduced on that dark day of 9th August 1971?  By none other than Mr. Faulkner who is now the king pin of the 11-man Assembly designate that has been <Col N="1848" /> brought about as a result of the support of the SDLP who claimed that they got Stormont prorogued, got rid of Stormont and Brian Faulkner and who said they would never again sit down and discuss any matter relating to the Six Counties and its troubles until internment was first ended.</P>
    <P>What do we find?  Internment continuing and Mr. Brian Faulkner the new king pin of the Assembly designate with a majority of six to five, even if you counted the fifth&mdash;but a majority, nevertheless, and no man knows what a majority means better than Mr. Faulkner.  He has said that a majority of one is still a majority and he is dead right.  He is being put back and put into a position of power that he never occupied before and never even dreamt he could attain by the very people who would claim credit for knocking Stormont and who said they would never have anything to do with anybody in this regard until internment was ended.  Internment remains; Stormont is on its way back and&mdash;fair play to him&mdash;Brian Faulkner is the chief pilot, captain and bossman and nobody can gainsay it.  I salute him for his political agility, his capacity to survive, his quickness of political brain and strategy by which he can cod the lot, and I do not exclude those who went from Dublin to Sunningdale.</P>
    <P>If we could have changed captains in this game, as I said in relation to another game not so long ago, I reckon we would win.  However, that has not happened and the tragedy to my mind is that we now have Stormont coming back, entrenched more firmly than ever, acknowledged and accepted and brought into being by the people who say they represent the Nationalist minority in the Six Counties, aided and abetted by the representatives of the Dublin Government whom I excuse to this extent: they have been advised as were their immediate predecessors by SDLP members and if the information they have been fed&mdash;and I am sure they were fed very strenuously by these people&mdash;has misled this Government, as I believe it misled the previous Government, then I blame both for <Col N="1849" /> being misled but I have a better understanding as to why it happened. It does not excuse such a cardinal and fundamental error as paragraph 5 of the Sunningdale communiqué would indicate that they had made.  Nothing can excuse that.  No deal that is in any way to our betterment emerges as a result of that.</P>

That alone bothers me and the phrase &ldquo;no winners and no losers&rdquo;. If everybody else has a different opinion&mdash;&ldquo;they are all out of step except our Johnny&rdquo;&mdash;very well, I am accustomed to that appellation in this House.  Naturally, I do not like it but I must accept it if that is so.  Can anybody convince me&mdash;believe me, I want to be convinced&mdash;that there have been no losers in this case because I believe that we are losers?

      <P>I know.  I am not claiming anything for any particular one or two.  I am saying that we are all losers on this side of the Border.  I only wish the Taoiseach's claim that there are no winners and no losers were true.  I cannot but see that we have lost to a degree never before equalled in our history and this not only voluntarily at Sunningdale but we are still of the opinion, as is indicated <Col N="1850" /> to us in this House that, far from losing, we have done something really worthwhile.  I wish to God that were true.</P>
      <P>If I am the only odd man who believes that is not true, if, in fact, we are neither losers nor winners, if we have not thrown away by our declaration what I believe we have have thrown away, nobody will be happier than I.  But that is what I believe.  That, if it can be changed, should never have been allowed to arise in my reading of that communiqué, if it was capable by a proper explanation and exposition by the spokesmen for the Government to allay any doubts or fears.  I believe it to be a certainty that we have really given away anything that really matters but if that is not true it should never have been allowed to appear in such a way that anybody could take that meaning out of it.  It is far too dangerous that that should be so.</P>
      <P>I do not believe it can be changed but I would be delighted if it can and that I can be proved totally wrong in my interpretation of it.  When I say that, I am not concerned with legal quibbles if that is what we may get, not the legalistic terms and legalities and so on that can&mdash;no reflection on the legal profession or the law or its institutions&mdash;make black legally white. This can be done with the clever use of words by clever manipulators of them.  Our legal people are trained in this: that is their job.  Any Government worth its salt has within its ranks the best that can be got in legal advisers.  I shall not be impressed if that is the sort of explanation we get. The hard, blunt fact is in the two paragraphs.  If it can be shown to any reasonable person that they are not what they appear to be and that we have not lost that which has been so dearly held for so long by so many people, I shall be very glad.  If, without any of the legalistic verbiage that will smother us and leave us not knowing whether we are going or coming, that can be cleared, let us have it cleared and I shall be the first to acknowledge that it is clear and that there is no ambiguity about it and I shall be delighted as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The internee question, that I have <Col N="1851" /> mentioned, is still with us.  May I make an appeal even at this stage?  Having come to close quarters on a tripartite basis, is it not possible for our spokesmen or our representatives in Government, even as a result of their recent contacts, to seek, outside and beyond this whole matter that we have in the communiqué, to have internment ended and not to participate in what may have been a well-meant gesture but is causing nothing but dire distress to hundreds of people, this holding out of release by instalment just a little bit before Christmas? There are no relatives of internees, and many of those relatives are living down here because they may not continue to live up there, who are not hoping that their man, their son or their daughter may be included in the instalment that will be let out for Christmas.  This is a cruel thing.  I am not accusing those who brought it about of intending any sort of cruelty; I know the reverse is the case, but it is a cruel situation.  From the very moment that it emerged that a batch were to be let out, every relative and every close friend of every internee has been hoping that their's will be among the batch who get out.  This is not fair.  It is wrong. I know it was not intended to be wrong in that way.  I would ask that if there are to be releases, get them out. They should be on their way home before this sort of promise comes out if they are not all getting home and obviously they will not all get home because Mr. Heath has said internment may continue until such time as the security situation indicates that it can be done away with.  Does Mr. Heath realise or appreciate&mdash;I doubt if he does and I do not think he got a great deal of help from those who talked to him&mdash;that if he waits until that happens he could wait until Tib's eve?  While we are occupied as we are in this country and while we are partitioned as we are, it is not just a cliché but the truth to say that there will not be real peace in this country.  There never can be.  Unless and until we can get ourselves on the road that will bring us to that, even if it takes us a long time, we cannot <Col N="1852" /> even begin to have peace.  We cannot even begin to have hope that there will be peace.</P>
    <P>Internment is there and irrespective of the promise of instalment release it continues and is likely to continue for quite a long time.  Mr. Faulkner is back in the saddle, the man who ordered it into being, who presided over it and no doubt advised the British in whatever part they played in it, together with the tortures. He was the man then, he is still the man today but more powerful than ever before.  Consider Faulkner in his present role, seeking to get moving an executive of an assembly that has been brought together as a result of the astuteness and the tenacity of the Secretary of State, Mr. Whitelaw, recently gone back to work his miracles in order that Mr. Heath may win the next general election.  Consider how powerful Faulkner now is, how much more powerful he will be in a number of weeks when if, with the help of this Government's delegation and his own delegations and the British Government, he really gets into business again.  I say that when that happens there is nothing that Brian Faulkner can be refused on request from Great Britain if he make the threat, as undoubtedly he will, being the good politician he is: &ldquo;Give me that, this or the other or I am finished with the assembly, the executive and the lot.  You can have the whole damn thing back in your lap again.&rdquo;  There is nothing he will not be able to command.  This man who brought in internment, who ordered internment, who advised on it, who must be held responsible for the tortures that emanated from it, is now on his way back to being the most powerful man in these two islands and I deliberately say the two islands. We have helped to bring that about. We are helping to bring it even further and we should have a thought and a care as to what we are doing. Though I decry his outlook, his politics, his behaviour over the years, I cannot but at a distance&mdash;and it must be at a distance&mdash;admire the man's capacity to survive and keep bouncing up on top all the time, even <Col N="1853" /> though one might have little regard for the means he has adopted to achieve those ends.  He has turned turtle several times but he is still right side up and is now cock-of-the-walk and no question about it.  Consider the attitudes of our people who have suffered under internment, under the tortures and the brutalities that have been so clearly demonstrated to have taken place up there.  So far as I know we are still engaged in an international court in proving what is known here to be true so that we can display it to the world as such though the progress is so slow that perhaps its impact and effect will fall far short of what it was hoped for at the time it was first referred to this international court.</P>
    <P>There is the proposal for trying in one jurisdiction people accused of offences in another.  I listened very closely and attentively to the Leader of the Opposition yesterday.  I do not want anybody cracking back that I did not always do so.  I was impressed to the degree that he certainly seemed to have grasped fully, and perhaps as a trained legal man he would have been expected to have grasped this fully, the apparently insuperable difficulties of trying somebody in one jurisdiction for an offence committed or allegedly committed in another.  As the Leader of the Opposition went through this in a legalistic way, as was proper and as he saw it, I could see the whole progression of this matter.  I have listened to other legal people, notably Deputy O'Kennedy today, speaking on this same subject. He enlightened still further myself and others who might not be as well versed in the law as he is.</P>
    <P>But what is clear to me is that if we are to attempt to put into operation this sort of procedure we must have a common court, that is if we are to have a common application of law. If we are to have a common court operating under a controlled Council of Ireland, we must have a common enforcement organisation that would back up that court on both sides of the Border and be common to all 32 counties.  Are we not then at the point where this parallels our peace-keeping <Col N="1854" /> force, our Garda Síochána <i>et cetera</i>? When that stage is reached is not the logical progression from there that the Army move in to back up, as is the practice today on both sides? Having reached that stage, are we not back to where we came in?  As I have been saying for years, a Council of Ireland that has not got security as its prime responsibility and to whom the peace-keeping forces are entirely responsible is meaningless.  But that is the stage the progression must reach if the council is to work.  Therefore, would it not be better by far that those who have gone to the top storey instead of to the basement or, <i>vice versa,</i> whichever way one wishes to put it, should re-think this matter?</P>
    <P>If there is to be a Council of Ireland there is a lot to be said for what I have been advocating for years in this regard.  During that time I was laughed and jeered at by the then bossman on that side, who was applauded for laughing at me by the bossman on this side.  Now there is produced a wishy-washy council that is proposing to do the sort of thing in this overall way that would appeal to the British and to Brian Faulkner and company in the North.  The whole purpose of this is to get rid of violent men.  Fair enough.  If that is the purpose it would still be far better to get back to the concept of a Council of Ireland that means something and from which could come in the not terribly distant future without coercion or force, a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>Such reunification cannot come from the council proposed, because this type of council is so ill-bred and so badly mixed up that it cannot make sense.  It is to be composed of seven members from the North and seven from the South.  I had been advocating seven or ten Unionists and an equal number of people representing this Government; but now there are seven from the Assembly, not just seven representing the Unionists, not an equal number representing their views.  My purpose in having equal representation from Unionists and from the South of Ireland was to try to allay the fears and suspicions of the Unionists.  Long ago in this context I <Col N="1855" /> proposed the rotating of a chairman. Surely such a council would have been a real council, one in which was inherent the security of the 32 counties, a council on which the chairman would have a casting vote, and one in which decisions would be reached by majority vote.  The real safeguard in it would be that if in one year the Unionist chairman put his finger in the southern fellow's eye in regard to the casting vote he would know instinctively that his counterpart from the South would adopt the same attitude in the following year, and that if they continued in that way both would be without eyes within a very short time.  Instead of that we have this emasculated effort at a Council of Ireland that is being given no chance of ever being capable of doing anything that would justify it meeting, wherever that meeting might be.  I hope Armagh will be the venue.  It seems to be the obvious place, but wherever it is held the journeys of its members will not have been worthwhile because each of the 14 members would have to reach his decision unanimously.  In other words, every member is to have a veto.</P>
    <P>Can anybody conceive of anything so far removed from the reality of the situation that obtains and in respect of which an attempt is being made to deal in this overall matter of a Council of Ireland than having 14 vetoes reposed in its 14 members?  Is there anything the members of the council will be capable of doing that all 14 will agree with and which could not be done more capably, more effectively, more economically and more expeditiously by either a Minister from here and his counterpart from the North or indeed by a couple of civil servants getting together and doing whatever is to be done?</P>
    <P>The impossibilities and impediments that are being created by this overindulgence in wishful thinking to have peace at any price are very obvious.  It is illusory to think that this council can work.  If it is understood to be illusory then it is dishonest to be putting it forward as something worthwhile.  If it is believed by those who have brought it into being&mdash;and <Col N="1856" /> I can see there is this belief&mdash;that it will bring peace, I ask them to have another look at it.  If we are to have a Council of Ireland let it be something the members of which might at least be proud of their membership of it in the knowledge that they were attempting and had the capacity within it to do something worthwhile, something that could not be done better by people at a much lower level and at considerably less cost.</P>
    <P>All this reminds me of a trip I made some years ago to the US and Canaada.  The project was under the auspices of some body of the UN and was undertaken by me in the context of new planning legislation that was being introduced in this country.  The greater part of the itinerary involved visits to the various big cities in the US and Canada and in meeting the people in those places who had grappled with the sort of problem that was only emerging in Dublin and to some degree in the bigger provincial towns.  On my second day there I attended a very long session and listened avidly to the people from different departments in the city hierarchy that seems to be part and parcel of the whole working of any city of note in the US.  On that occasion, having listened to the manner in which the Americans were redeveloping in terms of lighted areas, twilight areas and their plans for buildings of a 20-year life span instead of the previous 40, I remember getting down to the details as to how one would take a centre city area that was in a bad state but which could be used more economically if it were knocked and re-built.  I found that, between committees, commissions, agencies, mayors and councilmen among many others, there were 13 people or groups who had to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; before a decision was taken on how to go about knocking a building.</P>
    <P>Thirteen commissions, and elements, had to say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and I asked: &ldquo;In the name of God how do you ever do anything here and yet you do it quicker than anywhere else&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, that will not work in the case of 14 vetoes.  It does <Col N="1857" /> work in the United States of America. That was the explanation given to me as to how 13 elements could be got to synchronise their thoughts and their thinking to the degree that they would all say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to a big development in the heart of their city.  It was the dollar, not, perhaps, as mighty today as it was then but still effective judging by the performance in this and other fields that we read of.</P>
    <P>While that worked in the United States of America it cannot work here.  Nothing can make those 14 members with vetoes do anything effective.  I can see that the frustration from there can do greater damage by far than one would imagine and greater damage than the good those who put it together thought it would do.  It is a disastrous effort and it is one which cannot bring any worth in its train.  Indeed, it brings the danger that if it ever gets off the ground it can do more harm than good.</P>
    <P>On the question of policing, the courts and the common law enforcement area, I would like to suggest that if that is what we are going to have we also must have, and this is inherent in the idea of a Council of Ireland, the security of the entire 32 Counties as the responsibility and the prerogative of this Council.  That further progresses to the point that the declaration of intent of Britain to get out must accompany that particular operation.  What is now being attempted is incapable of working, well intentioned though it may be.  It raises immediately in my mind with great clarity that what I have been advocating as what is needed, a declaration by Britain that she is prepared to get out of this country is the correct approach.  Britain should state that she will delegate to the Council of Ireland, constituted and on equal footing with a majority decision rather than veto, her share in regard to security for the Six Counties and we, as a Government, should devolve into that Council of Ireland our authority as a Parliament over the peace keeping forces of the Twenty-six.  In other words, Britain decides that she is <Col N="1858" /> going and she gives to the Council of Ireland the authority that she would be divesting herself of.  We in turn, would match that for the Twenty-six Counties.  This would mean that we could bring in a council that would mean something.  In its working and its responsibility for the entire peace keeping force of the country such a council would give satisfaction to those who participated in it and worked in it as members.  It would display to the entire population, north and south, Protestant and Catholic, that this was a body that could be trusted.  It could then be seen that the peace keeping force for the entire country belonged to the people, not ours, but belonging to all of us and caring for all of us.</P>
    <P>This is a real fault that should be cleared up in any talk of a Council of Ireland rather than approaching it on the basis that it sounds good and it can go over well.  In my view it is not capable of performing even in the slightest way what those who offer it to us hope it will.  There is a lot to be said for being honest with people from the North, particularly those who are not of my religious persuasion.  I know those people and I am aware that they appreciate being told what the facts are.  One thing which they deplore above every other attribute or vice is when anybody tries to sell them short of truth or honesty.  That is a trait of theirs.</P>
    <P>If that is the only sort of Council of Ireland that has any true meaning and if this one is a projection that it is hoped in some way may emerge as the real one, by some roundabout way that may creep up on these people without their knowing what it means. I say do not try that.  Be honest with those people and tell them that this sort of council cannot function: it cannot bring us closer or do anything. These people should be asked if they are prepared to throw their lot in if Britain is going and if they are we should ask Britain to get out.</P>
    <P>There can be no real discussion with these people and we cannot expect any reasoning from them in any discussions except they get their way while Britain stands behind their backs.  When will <Col N="1859" /> this get through?  It has not got through in this House and it did not get through in Sunningdale.  The knowledge and the belief in this House is that at the high level of Government, present and immediately past, they never seem to grasp the absolutely fundamental elementary bit of knowledge that the British Government must get out of this country before we can get talking to our own people, the Protestants and the Unionists of the Six Counties, with any hope of their talking to us in a reasonable way.</P>
    <P>How can we ask a man who is supported by that which he wants to cling to, whose fears have been fed and built up over the years as to what would happen if he was taken in here, who feared that he would be beheaded and that we would visit on him all the wrath of our people because of what some of his people did to some of our co-religionists in that part of the country to accept us?  Regardless of how proud such a person is of being Irish&mdash; 90 per cent or more of these people are proud of being Irish particularly when they are outside this country&mdash; how can we ask such a person to join us or volunteer to come in while Britain stands by his side and tells him that as long as she is wanted she will stay and that is a guarantee?</P>
    <P>Such a person would be a nut, a headcase, a double headcase, to agree to talk to us about uniting while Britain tells him that she will mind him so long as they stay with her.  What can we expect a northerner of any description and particularly a hard-headed northern Protestant Unionist to do; cut his own head off and hand it to us on a plate?  Britain must go before we can make any headway in getting down to the problem of living together.  We can do this if Britain can be made to realise that she must make such a declaration. We must face the reality that in the future we must live without her and that we have got to either live or perish to get that.  When that happens we will meet the reasonableness of the northern unionist and the northern Protestant who may seem over the years by his &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; and the trailing of his sash to be something that cannot be brought together in the short term.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1860" /> In the short term if Britain would declare her intention to go they will talk to us and they will make their agreements with us.  If that day came, I would be glad to be an Ulsterman because they will get the best of it. Do not have any doubt about it. Faulkner and his men are having the best of it at the moment.  I will be on their side if they ever get to that stage and I will be glad to see some of the people that I know getting their &ldquo;come uppance&rdquo; for a change. Britain must declare her intention to go.  That is the only way in which we can ever really get to terms with these people.  No amount of whitewashing and giving away and of conceding our claims and our rights will impress those people there.  I am northern.  I think I have the same temperament as those people, Catholic and Protestant. I am not impressed by anybody who is prepared to give all the time, give all in the belief that they can &ldquo;cod&rdquo; anybody by giving today, and you know damn well that their hands are behind their backs hoping that they will take something off you tomorrow. This is the way we see things in the North.</P>
    <P>Be honest with the people of the North.  Be honest with Britain and tell them to get to hell out of it and that we can really get to terms ourselves without the bloodbath that is being bandied and used, and the backlash that we hear so much about. There is all sort of backlash and bloodbaths.  They are ten a penny at the moment while Britain maintains that she is going to stay.  Why would there not be these threats?  This is all part of the game.  It has been going on for generations and will continue as long as Britain stays.  We cannot get to terms or to talk.  There is no way until Britain says she is going. Can we help her?  I believe we can and I believe we have not been doing so because we have not been projecting this as the ultimate in so far as her thinking is concerned.  I at times, feel that we are far from fair to Britain in this particular period.</P>
    <P>Whatever our feelings may have been in the past of being hurt and injured, today and for a considerable number of years back I have felt <Col N="1861" /> that Britain got no help from us as an Irish Government established democratically and living in freedom on this side of the Border.  We have not helped her one iota to understand the situation of the Six Counties and we are not doing it now.  Could we help Britain to see that?  Could we help her to prepare the way for her declaration of intention to go?  I believe that only then and not until then will we have taken the first positive, real step towards peace and unity and justice in the whole of our land.</P>
    <P>On this Council of Ireland we have this business which is hardly worth bothering about, although so much is made of it in the communiqué and some reference should be made to it. It may be as well to refer to it because much was made of it in the communiqué. I am speaking about the quite impressive list judging by its length that appears here as to the sort of matters that may come in time to be considered by the council.  General terms are given and then there is a list of particular terms.  There are eight items on the particular list and three very general headings which include everything from industry to sport, culture, and so on.  They are all there; everything of that general nature by which we live and communicate is included.  Tourism and electricity are mentioned.  These only bring us back into the realm I have been talking about.  Quite a number of things are being done.  Even in the midst of the present turmoil, which is part and parcel of the Six Counties today and for the past five years, they are being done.  It is nice to get them down and put them on paper but, as I said earlier, some of them are being done and the whole of them could be more effectively done and we do not need a Council of Ireland with or without a veto to look after these at all.</P>
    <P>These things can be taken care of as they have been cared for up to now, but more could be done.  This brings us to the question that if these things are to be done under or through the Council of Ireland who will pay for them.  From the communiqué <Col N="1862" /> I take it that we in turn  pay, north and south, and  Britain is there or not there  internal arrangements with  Counties on the financial side  business of theirs between  London.  So far as we are  we will be dealing with  Assembly or Stormont&mdash;I do  what you call it&mdash;but the  about it is that if these  be moved ultimately into  the Council of Ireland we  them into very substantial  cial expenditure and  most of which is taking  moment, but to whom  this control, this power  pensation of these  giving them to a  the manner proposed  qué that has vetoes  in addition, has 60  become the </P>
    <P>We are great  and we seem to be  or half a book, out  book&mdash;the United Nations,  the Council of Europe.  These have  gone to our heads.  We will have a consultative council and 60 of us going up for that and selected from this House and from the other House by proportional representation.  They are all being remunerated.  For what?  They will meet to advise the 14 members of the council, each of whom has a veto and as a result of which are likely to do nothing.  Who are we codding? What is happening?  If this is merely a jamboree so that 30 people from here can meet 30 from up there, let us arrange the jamboree and the meetings frequently.  On a night such as this, on the eve of the breakup for the recess at Christmas, would it not be a good idea to have something like a match here this year and another one up there next year?  Let us do it that way, but do not let us get the idea that 30 people from here and 30 from there will consult and advise the council who in themselves by their very composition are capable of doing nothing, while we are going to pay for it.  The public outside will pay for it and we are part of that public when we are not in here.</P>
    <P>This will cost more money, and, as I understand it, none of these things <Col N="1863" /> costing one halfpenny of the public money or the public purse can be done without the authority of this House. How then does it come that in talking here yesterday and asking&mdash;through no fault of the Taoiseach at the time who seemed to be prepared to answer and this morning, in fairness to all concerned, he answered as far as he went &mdash;we have not been told when are we going to have another proper debate on this.  When are we going to be fully informed so that we can be &ldquo;with it&rdquo; and agree?  When are we going to be fully informed so that we know precisely what we are debating?</P>
    <P>I was disturbed today because I do not think the Taoiseach was forthcoming in his reply.  He went quite a bit of the way and his reply might seem satisfactory to an individual querying the Taoiseach on the Order of Business, but it is not good enough to me in that he did give me and this House to understand&mdash;which is the important aspect of it&mdash;that what was required by the law or the Constitution would be discussed here.  Does this mean that this is the only discussion we will have, and by the time this House resumes in January or February there will have been another treaty document signed in our name without an opportunity having been taken of having it before the House, discussed and ratified before the final document is put on paper?</P>
    <P>Is that it?  If it is, then I can only appeal and plead at this stage not to do it that way.  All I can say is: It is not the way to do it, above all in this particular Parliament.  This is the last place that should be done.  Let us not have any suggestion of a repetition of something being done irrevocably, irretrievably, while there is an Assembly such as this which can be consulted and, if necessary, steam-rolled by a Whip's majority to be accepted.  Let us at least go through the motions of a debate and a decision before any delegation, no matter how well meaning, take it on themselves to go across the sea again to sign our rights, our heritage away, whatever may be the cause.  Let us have it in this House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1864" /> That is not asking too much.  It is our right in this House.  It is our sad experience that we should exercise that right, above all in relation to our dealings with Great Britain and our occupied portion of this country.  I say again, do not, no matter how you feel you have the power or the weight of the constitution or the law on your side, go and sign anything away until you have fully and completely and clearly and without question put it before this House and got its prior approval.  To do anything else would be a tragedy above all other tragedies. It is one that I personally do not want to see added to the tragedy that I believe is enshrined in the communiqué that we have been issued with from the Sunningdale talks.</P>
    <P>Do not double the tragedy by doing it in the manner that I seem to think the Taoiseach had in mind.  He did not say it in so many words, in fairness to him.  I am not saying that he said we will do it in that way, but he was less than forthcoming in what he said in reply to my specific questions and pleas about having a full and complete discussion in this House before the final documents are signed away.  I hope that others on all sides of the House will join me in saying that this is not a matter of politics. It is not a matter of having a cut at somebody.  It is not a matter of getting one up on anybody.  It is a matter of fundamental principle that an Irish Parliamentary delegation should not sign anything while we have a Parliament still standing here capable of assembling, capable of debating and approving or disapproving that which it is proposed finally to sign.  Let us exercise that which we so proudly boast of, our democracy, here in this House in regard to a matter which is part and parcel of our country, of our future, as well as being a great part of our past.</P>
    <P>In regard to the matter of common law enforcement, apart from what I have already said on it, I should like to say that as things now stand I ask any Member of this House or any member of the public outside do they think or do they feel satisfied about this trying of a person in the other jurisdiction for something allegedly <Col N="1865" /> committed here.  How many of you would be satisfied that you would get a fair trial there, particularly if you were known to have republican tendencies? We have had the experience of what has happened in the past six years not only in the Six Counties and its courts but in British courts in the recent past.  Does anybody here or outside believe that a person picked up or having had a finger pointed at him up there as being republican or as being tainted, would have a hope of a fair trial?  I refer to either the Six Counties or Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Here I refer to Great Britain.  She with her most recent savage sentences on those arraigned before her courts has shed no lustre on her alleged British justice.  It is British justice all right when it applies to Britons but apparently it is not British justice when it applies to Irish people.  In regard to these particular people, one of the things that disturbs me most at the moment is that those who have been savagely sentenced&mdash;I say &ldquo;savagely&rdquo; designedly&mdash;are in English jails.  Efforts have been made to have them returned to jails in the Six Counties not because they are any beds of roses but because their families and friends at least can visit them, on the few occasions on which they are permitted to do so, without too great a hardship.</P>
    <P>A short two weeks ago, Mrs. Bernadette McAliskey asked Mr. Carr in a written House of Commons question that the Price sisters, who were then being forcibly fed, might be returned to a prison in the Six Counties.  He absolutely refused to do any such thing.  That is disturbing in itself but it shows to a degree the way in which people become pawns as well as other things, because we found that Mr. Health, I think it is, has indicated that as a result of representations by Mr. Gerry Fitt and Mr. Paddy Devlin of the SDLP while they were at Sunningdale, is now having the matter reconsidered.  Is it the Price girls' tragedy and misery that is more important or is it the political window dressing and whitewashing that is being done?  The whole thing raises a very serious doubt.  I am not asking, <Col N="1866" /> but I would hope that the Irish delegation did their job at Sunningdale in regard to seeking the return of those people.  I do not want an answer.  I am just expressing the hope that they did.  I am not referring only to those who come from the Six Counties.</P>
    <P>What I am underlining is that what could not be done by Mr. Carr and would not be done by him in any circumstances two weeks ago apparently could be done by Mr. Heath in more recent days in response to representations by two of the participants in the new set-up in the Six Counties.  He said he was having the matter reconsidered.  Very nice of Mr. Health.  Might I say in this regard that there is ample precedent for all of the prisoners over there to be returned to the Six Counties.  It is only the reverse precedent in regard to soldiers being convicted in Six County courts. In all cases of which I am aware, when they express the wish to be returned to jails in their own country their requests have been acceded to. If it can be done for British soldiers who have been convicted of crimes in the Six Counties, why can it not be done in reverse for those Irish people who are now in English jails?  They might not fare any better from the point of view of their being locked away in Armagh or Crumlin Road.  I am speaking purely from the humanitarian point of view&mdash;that their families at home would be able to visit them without incurring so much hardship.</P>
    <P>Reverting to my earlier plea that the House be given the opportunity to debate the final document, I say also that the voting public are entitled to have their say.  I am not saying this, as might be expected, as a gimmick. I am asking that the people be consulted. Whether the Government should choose a general election fought on this issue after it has been clearly debated here or a referendum to get a consensus I do not mind.  I believe that, in addition to this House being entitled to full clarification, debate, ratification, amendment or throwing it out, the people to whom we are all responsible, and who sent <Col N="1867" /> us here, should be consulted directly on this very important issue.  We can do it for other things.  For example, Article 44 comes to mind immediately. If we could do it in that case, surely this is more important than Article 44 or any other Article.</P>
    <P>Even if it is no more than equal to any of these, if we can do it for them then let us do it.  Let us make sure that what we are doing we are doing with our eyes open, the Government, Opposition, all in this House and all the voting public, that they know and approve what they are doing or, if they do not approve that we are let know in the only way possible, through the ballot boxes.</P>
    <P>I should like the Government to consider this.  Perhaps they have already had some thoughts of this in their mind.  I am not throwing this out as tempting them or daring them to have an election or a referendum.  It is not that sort of test.  I want the people to be consulted on this because of its importance.  I want it clarified so that they may be consulted.  I want it clarified so that we can debate it more readily and more clearly than we are capable of doing at the moment.  We are entitled to this.</P>
    <P>Again I would appeal to the Government not to by-pass this on the basis that they are entitled by precedent to sign this or that; not to by-pass this because the law enables them to do it; not to by-pass it because the Constitution does not prohibit them from doing it; not to enter us into commitments for the financing of which they will have to come back to the House, coming back retrospectively having committed us to the expenditure. The boys up above have paid their bills; we owe our part of it and have not paid it.  This is not the way to deal with this and I do not think it would be the way for any Government to deal with this matter.</P>
    <P>There is no point in quoting precedents and saying how many times we have legislated retrospectively for this or that.  I agree we have done this a hundred times.  It is a useful device and we will do it a hundred times more.  This is not a matter of grants, <Col N="1868" /> rates or assistance.  This is a matter of funding the institutions which are proposed to be set up, to which we are a party, to which we are agreeing and proposing to agree and depend on the signature of our delegates on behalf of our Government, our country and our people.  It should be clearly established what is being done in the names of all of us, Government, people and country, before it is done.  Do it in the House.  Do it on the floor of the House.  Do it before not after.</P>
    <P>Go and consult the people as to whether they agree with whatever we have decided here.  Find out whether there is acceptance or rejection.  Let us get their verdict on it as well as ours.  If we do it that way, at least what is done will be done fully and completely and democratically.  Those who do not agree with what has happened must accept that a majority in the House and the country decided with their eyes open that this was the way it was to go.  In that way you can get a proper decision.  In that way the decision that is made is one which is likely to stick.  In that way the decision taken is unlikely to cause unrest. Do it otherwise and it is fraught with dangers of unrest and unease, to say the least of it.  It will not bring us anywhere.  It will not improve our situation.  It will not advance us one whit and may set us back in so far as our hopes and wishes for the future of our country are concerned.</P>
    <P>I understand from listening to Deputy Lynch, Leader of the Opposition, that he is not knocking the Sunningdale agreement, but neither is he unreservedly accepting it.  I may be misinterpreting what I heard but, if I have not misinterpretated him, then I may be misinterpretating Deputy O'Kennedy who spoke this evening.  I think the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs queried him across the House to clarify or come across in some way. I understood Deputy O'Kennedy to say: &ldquo;As the Leader of the Opposition said yesterday.&rdquo;  He was asked by the Minister did he support it.  It conveys to me a conflict.  I am not seeking to tease out the conflict.  I am merely seeking to point out what appears to be a difference in my interpretation of <Col N="1869" /> what I understood Deputy O'Kennedy to say and what I heard Deputy Lynch say, despite the fact that Deputy O'Kennedy underlined it by saying that he was saying again what had been said yesterday.  That is not what I understood it to be yesterday and what I understand it to be today.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy seemed to support the Sunningdale agreement whereas I understood that Deputy Lynch was not knocking it but had reservations about it.  I also understand, but only from the wind&mdash;maybe it has been said in the House; I do not know because I was not in the House for every speaker nor, indeed, for all of Deputy J. Lynch's speech either&mdash;that, while the Opposition intend to vote against the adjournment and therefore vote against the Taoiseach's Estimate, as it were, they are not voting against the Sunningdale ageeement.  Quite candidly this is what confuses me; not &ldquo;sort of&rdquo; confuses me, but positively confuses me.  You might say this is none of your business but I think it is. I should like to know whether or not the Opposition agree with the Sunningdale agreement.  Except for a few of them they are just as important as the Government, because that is all the difference there is between the two sides of the House at any time.</P>
    <P>If they agree with it, then perhaps it is an unhappy situation that they should be seen to be voting against the Taoiseach's Estimate incorporated in which, as its first part, is the Sunningdale agreement.  On the other hand, if they are not in agreement with the Sunningdale agreement then is it not positively strange that they should indicate their intention to vote against the Taoiseach's Estimate on the adjournment of the Dáil while, at the same time, indicating that they are not voting against the Sunningdale agreement?</P>

      <P>Perhaps I am straining things a bit but I am anxious in this matter.  Perhaps because of its vital <Col N="1870" /> importance normal procedure might not be strictly adhered to.  When I am seeking information from a Minister, that is one thing, and when I am seeking information from the Opposition benches, that is another.  In this case what is really happening is that the Opposition's recorded vote will not be against the Sunningdale agreement, nor is it to be taken that their not voting against it means that they are voting in favour of it&mdash;that what they are doing is reserving their position in that they are of the belief, as I am, that there will be another day or days in regard to this matter when there will be a precise and straightforward debate and the issue resolved directly concerning the Sunningdale operations rather than anything else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where I came in and where I am going to go out as well.  Is legislation necessary before the final deed is done?  This is what I am concerned about.  If I could be assured that all the detail in the communiqué as circulated would be discussed in the House at a future date, even by special recall of the Dáil in January which I think should take place, I should be happy to leave it at that and hope for some assurances. I would be happy if there were some changes of mind and would be glad to be reassured that the agreement is not what it seems to be.  If I knew we would have another day so that we might unravel the matter and get more explicit, concise, explanations that were not merely part of an Adjournment Debate on the Taoiseach's Estimate I would be happier than I am at the moment, or at least I would be satisfied that we were not being bamboozled into accepting the agreement when we are unclear about it.  This matter should stand on its own, it should have a full debate and not be tied in with the Taoiseach's Estimate.  I hope we will get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The financial matters mentioned by a spokesman for the Opposition could be very tricky because I think they are capable of being sought for afterwards <Col N="1871" /> rather than being a prerequisite to the event.  If this is so we are deluding ourselves that we will have another day because when we have irretrievably and irrevocably signed, when we have made our commitments and have obligations to meet for which we must provide money, we may not have an opportunity to discuss the matter in this House.  If we cannot discuss the merits of the payment of the money, I am wondering&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should sleep all the better if the Minister could do that and I should be delighted to hear if he can do it.  With regard to the international registration, perhaps the Minister when he speaks might be in a position to elucidate on this matter. Perhaps he can tell us what it means, how it will be done, what are the obligations and whether the registration requires us, through our Constitution or the laws of the United Nations, to come and get authority from this House.  I should be very glad to hear this kind of information from a speaker on behalf of the Government and there is nobody better versed in these particular operations than the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any assurance of a further debate would relieve my mind considerably. It would reassure me that whatever we decide will not be done in haste and, consequently, it will be all the better. Whatever may be decided ultimately will be more likely to be right than if it is done now, irretrievably and irrevocably; no matter how well-meaning we may be, we could be doing the wrong thing.  It is my belief we have sold out the most important thing by our declaration.  My overall attitude is that I do not like it.  I realise it is hardly necessary for me to say it, but say it I will.  I do not like the deal, I do not like the package.  I find a great deal of the detail wrong, much more than I have mentioned here.  I do not think it is a good deal, <Col N="1872" /> I do not believe it has a snowball's hope in hell of attaining the ends the Government representatives so dearly wish.  For all those reasons, and for that reason in particular, I dislike the deal; if it is as it appears in the communiqué, any way I can influence or talk others into opposing it in order to change it I shall do so.  I do not believe the deal is good; I believe it is positively bad, but if I can be persuaded that it is good I should be very happy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to ensure that Deputy Blaney will sleep tonight.  I should not like to keep him awake.  Certainly the Dáil will have another opportunity of debating this matter.  We think such an opportunity is needed because it is necessary that every Deputy has not merely an opportunity but a need to declare or to show by a vote where he stands on this matter.  It is absolutely necessary that the people know where their representatives stand exactly on this, and they do not know now.</P>
      <P>The next stage of this matter is the renewed second or formal stage of the tripartite talks which will take place early in the new year.  At those talks there will be a formal agreement; the international parts of that agreement between the two sovereign States will have to be registered in a formal agreement.  When that formal agreement is reached it will be brought before this House and we will have an opportunity of debating it. Those who cannot make up their minds at this stage where they stand on the matter will have not merely the opportunity but a duty to say exactly where they stand.  I hope they will. There will be a vote on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to consulting the people, it is clear that if the vote in the Dáil went against the agreement the Government would have to go to the country.  If not, then I think not, but the Government have taken no decision on the matter.  The Government would have no hesitation if necessary in going to the people about the Sunningdale agreement or the subsequent agreement.  We believe the people will welcome these steps but no <Col N="1873" /> decision has been taken on it.  Those who advocate that course can do so in the course of the debate on the formal agreement.  Frankly, Deputy Blaney speaks for himself.  He is his own man but he does not speak for anyone else here.</P>
    <P>If the Opposition party were to demand that the Government should go to the country on Sunningdale or the subsequent agreement, and defend Sunningdale before the country, the Government would take that suggestion very seriously indeed.  I could not commit the Government because it has not been discussed but, if that were what the Opposition party thought should be done, that would be very seriously considered.  They will have an opportunity of saying what they think about that in this debate.  I will say one thing for Deputy Blaney.  He has made absolutely clear where he stands on Sunningdale. He is against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly.  Deputy Blaney made a comparison between this and the Treaty situation. They are, of course, in many respects very different situations.  The whole historic period is different.  There is also one major difference.  The Government sent a united delegation to that conference and that delegation came back united.  That delegation was empowered by the Government, before it went, to agree to propositions. It did agree to propositions.  It <Col N="1874" /> reported back to the Government.  A united Government approved a united delegation and a united set of formulae. That is an important difference. I believe also that the Dáil will approve.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blaney deserves credit for having said honestly where he stands on Sunningdale.  He is against it.  We all know that.</P>

We do not know where the gentlemen opposite stand.  I will come back to that.  It is a pity that we do not know at this stage.</P>
      <P>I should like to make a few more comments on what Deputy Blaney said.  His speech contained some positive elements, just a few, not very many.  I am looking for them and they seem to be even fewer than I thought. He said that the delegation which, on behalf of this Government and this State, agreed to the Sunningdale communiqué acted in good faith.  That is something.  We must be grateful for small mercies.  We acted in good faith. We were rather simple-minded people and we were led up the garden path by Mr. Faulkner and the British, but at least we acted in good faith.  That is something judging by the general standards of this controversy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we were in Monaghan recently, for reasons which Deputies will recall, a meeting of ours&mdash;and I believe the same thing happened to a meeting of the party opposite&mdash;was interrupted by a group of demonstrators identified to us as supporters of Deputy Blaney and including, I believe, Deputy Blaney's brother. They carried placards with words like &ldquo;Arch-collaborationists&rdquo;, &ldquo;Traitors&rdquo;, <Col N="1875" />&ldquo;Quislings&rdquo;&mdash;all words which in our vocabulary have somewhat lethal overtones.  The same word &ldquo;Arch-collaborationists&rdquo; was used in the communiqué of the Provisional IRA in which they claimed what they regarded as credit for the attack on Austin Curry's house which had taken place not long before.</P>
    <P>I would say this to Deputy Blaney if he were here.  No doubt he will read the Official Report of our debates.  If he thinks, indeed, that we whom he opposes here acted in good faith&mdash;and no doubt he would extend the same presumption to his erstwhile colleagues&mdash;let him exert some influence on his Republican sympathisers to moderate their language if they will not moderate their actions.</P>
    <P>In one of the more interesting parts of his remarks Deputy Blaney repeated several times that he hoped his interpretation was wrong.  He went back to that again and again, in the midst of a speech which was, for him, not especially vehement, though it would have been vehement for many other Deputies.  I think there is something even in Deputy Blancy that sees the force of what was done at Sunningdale, feels the need for it and the attraction of it, something which I would call, if I may without offence, the rational side of Deputy Blaney, overshadowed and obscured as it is at the moment by his emotions and the momentum of the things he has said in the past, the fairly recent past, because his over Republicanism is a matter of the fairly recent past.</P>
    <P>There are a few things I should like to take up but this in particular. Deputy Blaney referred again and again to the long-suffering Nationalist population of the Six Counties of Northern Ireland.  He came back to that again and again.  Particularly from the earlier part of his discourse one would have thought that the Sunningdale agreement was an agreement reached between London and Dublin or, perhaps, London, Dublin and the Unionists, over the heads and without the consent of the said population, the minority in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>That minority was represented at <Col N="1876" /> Sunningdale.  That minority, through its representatives, agreed to Sunningdale. The SDLP with their 19 Assembly Members have one of the solidest democratic claims in this whole country to represent a particular section of the community, the minority in Northern Ireland.  They agreed unanimously to Sunningdale.  By what right are we to be told by Deputy Blaney, or any other Deputy who does not represent any section in Northern Ireland and has not been chosen by them, that we are betraying the minority whom the SDLP represent if we agree to something they agree to? What sort of sense does that make?</P>
    <P>It makes sense only in that kind of dark Republican logic by which representatives have only the right to represent and only the right to act, if they represent and act in accordance with other people's slogans, the slogans of the Republican Movement, or that section of it which Deputy Blaney represents. We make no apology for what we agreed to at Sunningdale.  We were glad to work there with all the people who share power in the Executive. We recognise, in particular, that the Sunningdale communiqué rests in a great measure on the work accomplished by the representatives of the minority in Northern Ireland, those representatives who have carried the historic step of getting themselves included in a power-sharing executive for the first time in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Make no mistake about it&mdash;and I shall come back to this&mdash;without what was agreed at Sunningdale, there will be no power-sharing executive for Northern Ireland just as there will be no Council of Ireland.  If anyone wrecks Sunningdale&mdash;and I believe nobody will wreck it, or can wreck it&mdash; the minority in Northern Ireland are once more shut out from all share in the control over their own lives, in the representation of their own people, and in the power to help their own people.  Let that be remembered before Deputies think of committing themselves against Sunningdale.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney spoke of sinister steps, about the return of Stormont, and so no.  If Stormont were returning in the sense that Deputy Blaney <Col N="1877" /> means&mdash;that is to say, in the sense of shutting out the minority from all power and discriminating against them and so on&mdash;it would be nonsense to think that the representatives of that minority could agree to such a step or even that they would be consulted about it.  The thing is completely meaningless, as far as I can see.</P>
    <P>Another point that Deputy Blaney made was to ask why are we not getting the information, why are we not being told about this?  This, again, is without meaning, I am afraid, because the communiqué, this communiqué here, has all the information there is because it is all that was agreed. No gloss that might be put on this by any of the partners can have any authority in relation to the agreed wording of this communiqué, precisely because this communiqué was agreed and negotiated for long, hard, slogging hours, and every word in it is the product of that negotiating process.  There is no secret agreement.  There is no behind-the-screen understanding.  There is nothing else at all at this stage only this and, when there is anything else, this Dáil will be told about it and told it right away.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney spoke against the two declaratory sections of paragraph 5, as it his right to do.  He used curious language in talking about them; he said &ldquo;cutting out the bottom portion of each&rdquo; they meant something or other.  Nobody has any right to cut out the bottom portion of each or any portion.  They are all-in.  They are all there.  In relation to one particular sentence he spoke with peculiar severity. In general, his language was somewhat less vehement than is, perhaps, his custom, but he was very hard on this one sentence for some reason.  The sentence is the sentence in the British declaration in the right hand column of paragraph 5.  It is the sentence which says:</P>
    <P>If, in future, the majority of the people in Northern Ireland should indicate a wish to become part of a United Ireland, the British Government would support that wish.</P>
    <P>Now Deputy Blaney describes that statement, which seems to many of <Col N="1878" /> some significance, as &ldquo;waffle&rdquo;,&ldquo;hogwash&rdquo; and &ldquo;of no consequence whatever&rdquo;. That is his description.</P>
    <P>I worked in what was then the Department of External Affairs and what is now the Department of Foreign Affairs for close on 20 years. I was there in the forties when Mr. Eamon de Valera, lately our President, was Minister and later under Mr. Frank Aiken who was a colleague of Deputy Blaney's in the Fianna Fáil administration.  I know that under Mr. de Valera and under Mr. Aiken the Department of Foreign Affairs for years tried to extort from the British Government by one means or another, but always in vain, this declaration which is now described by a former member of that Government as &ldquo;waffle&rdquo;, &ldquo;hogwash&rdquo; and &ldquo;of no consequence whatever&rdquo;.  So for 20 years Fianna Fáil were striving to obtain waffle and hogwash and things of no consequence whatever; that was the object of their diplomacy and, indeed, it was all that passed with them for a policy on Northern Ireland.  That was all that they had: (a) blame the British and (b) get the British to say this.</P>
    <P>Now I think this is a positive step but I do not attach quite as high hopes to it as Fianna Fáil did in those years. By itself it will not change the face of the whole problem.  It has a bearing on it, and it has a useful bearing on it, and that is how we would present it and that is the only way in which we would present it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney also referred several times to atrocities.  The atrocities he referred to, like the Devenney atrocity, were real and terrible deeds but, again, and this is the worst part of his speech and the worst part of his whole approach and of those who sympathise with him, it was one set of atrocities only all the time.  Never a word about all the others that were committed by the Provisional IRA, the Official IRA and others, just the atrocities of the British, of the RUC and of Protestant extremists.  That is all they ever mention.  These atrocities are all horrible and we all have a duty to condemn them all.</P>
    <P>Deputy Blaney referred to savage <Col N="1879" /> sentences on people whom he did not otherwise identify but who were, in fact, people convicted of placing bombs in public places.  Savage sentences! The sentences were severe. They may have been unduly severe. They may be reviewed.  I hope, in mercy, that in due process of time they will indeed be reviewed.  Deputy Blaney says the sentences were savage. What adjective did he apply to the bombings?  None.  He did not mention them.  He did not mention the word &ldquo;bomb&rdquo;.  You would think these people had gone to jail for their republican principles and not for bombing.  If the sentences were savage the bombings were even more savage. But that was not said.</P>
    <P>He referred to internment.  He attacked internment in very strong terms.  He knows more about internment than I do.  I have never been a member of a Government that had to employ internment without trial, as he did without demur.  He expressed the hope that internment would be brought to an end.  I share that hope. I share that hope even more strongly having attended the recent SDLP conference in the Europa Hotel in Belfast, where I heard speaker after speaker demand the end of internment. But they were using an argument which I respect and an argument which would possibly surprise Deputy Blaney.  I am referring now to SDLP speakers from the floor, not leaders, not office holders, not people widely known, but people coming from places like Andersonstown where there have been many interness.  Their point about ending internment was: &ldquo;Please bring internment to an end because it is the only moral weapon the IRA still hold, because it is through this they exercise what moral leverage they still possess within that community&rdquo;.  They were speaking, therefore, not as IRA sympathisers but as the very reverse.</P>
    <P>I thought the thrust of their argument impressive.  At the same time, there is an argument on the other side. It is suggested that all the interness, all of them without exception, are harmless, innocent people who were never associated with any violent <Col N="1880" /> organisation.  Of course they may be in the sense that none has been convicted by the court; the presumption of innocence is there, but I did notice that whenever any of them escape from internment, they are always described as members of the Irish Republican Army and their escape is chalked up as a feat of that organisation. I think this is a statistical fact. I do not think there is any exception to it.  From that we must infer the distinct possibility that among them there are some dangerous people, people who might, if released, booby-trap a motor car.  Cars have been booby-trapped very recently killing RUC men.  No condemnation of that was heard here either.</P>
    <P>I believe that it would, on the whole, be more politic and better to release the lot, in part because of the general objections to internment without trial, and in part because of the argument I heard at the SDLP conference.  However, there is no doubt that the most effective argument and possibly the only fully effective argument for the ending of internment could be provided by the Provisional IRA if they followed the example of the official IRA&mdash;the belated example but, in that respect, a good one&mdash;by stopping the campaign of violence, by the simple step of stopping killing people.  If they would stop that, I believe internment could be faded out in a very short time and that there would be very little resistance to such a proposal.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to Deputy Blaney's final scenario, that the British should be induced to pull out now without their being in advance any agreement with any Unionist or Loyalist section, and that we then try to get their agreement to a kind of Council of Ireland with no veto and overall powers.  That is cloud cuckoo land.  This has no relation to any possible reality, and I do not believe there is anybody in Belfast who would say anything different about it.  I certainly know that none of the SDLP leaders would say anything about it.  If the British simply pulled out without any advance agreement, there would be a massacre on a very great scale, and the end of that would not be an agreement, Council <Col N="1881" /> of Ireland, or anything like that, it would be a new Border in a new place, and in the northern part of that, an Ulster Loyalist dominance and a terrible fate for minorities in every part of Northern Ireland.  I do not want to dwell on that but that is the perspective that we have turned our back on or have begun to turn our back on at Sunningdale on the 9th of the month.  To say that we began then is wrong.  The beginning was earlier, and, perhaps, the most decisive step was the setting up of the power-sharing Executive, but, again, the coming into being of that Executive depended on the outcome of tripartite talks, so in any case it was a turning point.</P>
    <P>I think I have said enough about Deputy Blaney's comments.  I should like to refer now to what Deputy Lynch had to say.  I should like to speak with as much measure as I can on that subject.  I confess that my immediate reaction, as I listened to Deputy Lynch yesterday, was one of disappointment and even irritation at what appeared to me to be a pettifogging response to an important occasion.  The occasion itself Deputy Blaney, I believe, described correctly. He said it was the most momentous event affecting Ireland that had occurred in his lifetime.  That was the scale of it as it was assessed not by any of us here who might happen to be accused of wanting to magnify the importance of something we support but by its enemy, its only declared enemy in this House, though it may have other enemies.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lynch's response was guarded and did not seem to us to rise to the height of this occasion.  But I would like to say this: Deputy Lynch himself while Taoiseach in the period from about mid-1970 until the fall of his Government, contributed in a very large degree&mdash;and I honour him for it&mdash;to the climate of opinion which made possible the very general acceptance by the country of the Sunningdale communiqué.  I am certain, and I think all Deputies will be aware from their own contacts, that there is such general acceptance.  Deputy Lynch did help to build that, and we have the <Col N="1882" /> right to acknowledge this here.</P>
    <P>That being so, it is sad that he should not have felt able to come forward and openly and clearly welcome a communiqué which is in full agreement with the thrust of his own argument, I shall not say with every qualification that he introduced into his argument, but the central thrust of his own argument in those critical years.  I thought, reading over his speech, that I had, perhaps, not done him justice.  A bad speech&mdash;and I think it was a bad speech&mdash;may be a good action if it is intended to serve a good purpose and does serve that purpose effectively.  I believe that Deputy Lynch's aim was to hold the line, to keep his party as much in accord, or as much out of discord, with the Sunningdale communiqué as he possibly could.  If that interpretation is correct, it does honour to Deputy Lynch personally, but at the same time, it is an index of the dangerous forces building up inside his party.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lynch's qualifications were surprising to the degree that he never actually said that he either welcomed or supported the Sunningdale agreement as a whole. He did not say at any time&mdash;and I read the statement carefully for this&mdash; what he thought of Sunningdale as a package, because Sunningdale is a package, every part of it is interdependent on every other part.  It is only moderately interesting or useful to know what the Leader of the Opposition thinks of this or that part of it, to know, as we learned from him, that he liked the idea that there was a Council of Ireland but that he had reservations about the Irish Government's declaration and so on.  That is not what we need to know, because we cannot pick bits out of this package or put bits in.  It is a negotiated text, as Deputy Lynch well knows, and the whole point is to know this: do Fianna Fáil, yes or no, support the Sunningdale package?  That is what <Col N="1884" /> has not yet been authoritatively answered.</P>
      <P>Perhaps whoever winds up for Fianna Fáil in this debate may have the authority from his party to tell us do they, yes or no, support the Sunningdale package?  I put the question to Deputy O'Kennedy and under a good deal of pressure he said, yes, he did accept it.  He may be speaking for his party but if so, the party must have reached some sudden decision between Deputy Lynch's speech and Deputy O'Kennedy's reply to the question because Deputy Lynch did not say&mdash;we know that he weighs his words; we know that if he did not say something he meant not to say it &mdash;that he welcomed or supported the Sunningdale package.  He said he supported and would support what he called the practical proposals involved in Sunningdale.  That is something, but the practical proposals are part of a package of which there are other parts and the other parts cannot be separated from the practical proposals. In particular, if these declarations which stand in paragraph 5 had not been decided on, if the Irish Government, for example, had not made the declaration that stands there, the rest of the Sunningdale package was simply unobtainable.  If you say: &ldquo;I accept the practical proposals but I do not accept the declaration&rdquo; you are saying: &ldquo;I would like to stand on this ladder but I shall cut away the floor on which it stands.&rdquo;  You cannot do that.  What we want to know, in honest and clear language is, whether or not the whole of the communiqué including the Irish Government's declaration is accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say something about the significance of the declaration in relation to the Constitution and otherwise. This matter was raised and, indeed, the Unionist Party, Mr. Faulkner's Unionists, subsequently divulged that it was raised and so I am not breaking any confidence here. The Unionist participants in the Executive designate who were among our partners at Sunningdale raised the matter.  One of the first things they raised with us was the question of the <Col N="1885" /> Constitution, specifically Articles 2 and 3, to which they strongly objected. They urged us to undertake to amend the Constitution in this respect.  We told them in very clear language that we could not give such an undertaking. We explained that it was only the people as a whole who had the power to amend the Constitution and that we did not think a major amendment of the Constitution could be carried out without concensus, preferably of all the parties.</P>
    <P>We told them that an all-party committee of this House was at present studying the Constitution and all related matters.  We also told them that to attempt to link the question of what was to be negotiated with the question of possible Constitutional revision would be a very foolish and damaging thing from the point of view of all the interests concerned in that a subsequent referendum could destroy the whole structure if these things were linked.  We told them we could not link them, that the whole of the Constitution, including Articles 2 and 3, stood as the fundamental law of the land.  They reluctantly accepted that as being our position.  I do not say they approved it&mdash;they did not&mdash; but they accepted it and continued the negotiations with us on that basis.</P>
    <P>When I say that I should like also to say that it has been the view of many of us&mdash;and the Taoiseach was quoted in this debate, I think, by Deputy Blaney as having said it&mdash;that we need a new Constitution.  I think we do.  I think the Constitution framed in 1937 in many ways is obsolete and no longer corresponds to the views of most of the people and needs to be changed.  But I think that required change is, and has to be treated as an entirely separate matter from these negotiations.  So, we were not, and we made it absolutely clear to our interlocutors that we were not negotiating on the basis of a possible or proposed change in the Constitutional arrangements.</P>
    <P>The declarations are there.  The Irish Governments declaration reads:</P>
    <P>The Irish Government fully accepted and solemnly declared that there could be no change in the <Col N="1886" /> status of Northern Ireland until a majority of the people of Northern Ireland desired a change in that state.</P>
    <P>I think that is perfectly clear.  I have no authority to put any gloss on it. Deputy Blaney asked people on our side to provide some kind of exposition, explanation or commentary which would enable him to take that. I cannot do that.  If he cannot accept that as it stands or if Deputies opposite cannot, very well, let them reject it but I cannot, and nobody on this side can, and no single partner to the negotiations can give an authoritative interpretation of an agreed text.  I think Deputy Blaney referred to masses of verbiage: it is quite a short declaration and quite simple and it embodies a principle which I should have thought has been common to all the main parties here for a very long time, the fact that the unity to which we aspire is to be won by free consent including the consent of the majority in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>If it requires their free consent it is rather clear that they have to agree. These propositions are almost tautologous. It may be asked how this declaration stands in relation to the Articles of the Constitution.  I think Edmund Burke had the right answer.  At the time when trouble was developing in America&mdash;it was then the American colony of Great Britain&mdash;it was generally held that the Constitution of Britain, an unwritten but, of course, powerful document, entitled the British Government to tax the colonies. Edmund Burke did not dispute that Constitutional position; he agreed that the British Government had such a right, the Crown had such a right, in the terminology of the time, but it would be wise and prudent not to exercise that right.</P>
    <P>This declaration concerns policy.  It is not a declaration on basic right; it concerns policy&mdash;what should be done about a given situation, what the Irish Government takes on itself to do, what it accepts and I think there matters are entirely consonant.  If you say &ldquo;unity only by consent&rdquo; you are also saying: &ldquo;There cannot be unity unless there is consent.&rdquo;  You cannot <Col N="1887" /> accept the principle of consent unless it also includes a right to dissent: you cannot denounce a veto while you are looking for consent.</P>
    <P>I think in our debates here we must be conscious all the time, and conscious with a certain sense of urgency, of the actual pattern of forces inside Northern Ireland at present. The Northern Ireland parties to this agreement, the power sharing partners, are at present under extreme and terrible pressure.  It would not be too much to say that they are in very serious danger indeed, political danger and even physical danger.  All of them have done a very courageous thing. They are menaced from two sides. They are menaced by the men of violence, the extremists inside the Protestant community, and they are manaced by the Provisional IRA. They are in such danger from both sides that if any of them were to be attacked at the moment it would be very difficult to know from what side the danger came.</P>
    <P>What ought we to do in relation to their situation?  Ought we to say: &ldquo;Let us wait and see.  Let us be pretty cautious about this.  Let us be satisfied that all the formulae are in accordance with formulae our parties have used in the past?&rdquo; Are we to sit it out or are we going back to them? Are we going to buttress their position? Are we going to help them to defend their position?  If we choose the latter option then we will support the Sunningdale communiqué.  We will support it clearly.  I will not say without reservations.  It is possible to have reservations and say: &ldquo;We do not like our having to say that but on balance we agree that it was worth saying if that was part of the package.&rdquo; That is a possible line.  But it is not possible to say: &ldquo;We like some bits of it, we have reservations about others and we will not say what we think about the communiqué as a whole.&rdquo;  That is not enough.  It does not match the urgency of the situation and it does not match the danger in which the Northern Ireland signatories of Sunningdale now find themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1888" /> There are very few conjunctures at which you can say that the forces of reason and decent feelings are both on the same side, are all or virtually all on the same side, and that the forces of irrationality, fanaticism, cruelty, injustice, are arrayed on the other side under different banners. But if ever there was such a case this is it here.  Every decent Irishman should rally to the support of the power sharers in Northern Ireland now and should heed their call to support the Sunningdale communiqué.</P>

      <P>To get our situation in relation to the communiqué into perspective, I have on a number of occasions visited the British Parliament and had discussions with both Labour and Conservative Members of Parliament over the past four or five years.  Usually such discussions end up with the Labour Member of Parliament agreeing entirely and the Conservative disagreeing.  Where I have come up against Conservative Members of Parliament disagreeing I have put the proposition that if I were an Englishman and the situation were reversed and I had to deal with a situation in which a part of England was under the control, with a local majority, of another country, it would be a situation in which I would have to work in the interests of people and their lives, but it would not be a situation which I would approve.  There is a distinction here which has applied over the past 50 years to the situation that exists in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The communiqué which was issued to us yesterday is a detailed, fairly legalistic document which has resulted from many days and hours of strenuous discussion and argument, of which of course I have no knowledge.  It has also resulted from many years of patient effort and trial, particularly the past four years, but it goes further back to when efforts to reach some sort of an accommodation over 50 years ago failed.  It is too serious and too far-reaching a document for anyone to permit himself the luxury of coming to hasty conclusions about it, although some people have done so, as I have noted in the Press and in the Dáil this evening. <Col N="1889" /> This is a sovereign democratic Parliament and we are the democratic Opposition, a single party with two exceptions.  As such it is our duty to be a responsible party which represents, at the time of the last election, almost half of the electors.  As such we will approach our job of examining this communiqué and what follows, calmly and intelligently before we come to firm conclusions.  We have no intention of being rushed into anything in so fundamental a matter as is contained in this communiqué.  The Leader of our party has put our reservations on record, so I shall not repeat them. The Government's duty in the course of the next couple of months will be to convince us, if they are willing to do so.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I should like to say that in my opinion any sane person will hope that good results can come from the recent strenuous discussions and the published communiqué. It is reasonable to hope that the benefits which may follow may be seen later as a significant step in bringing about a better relationship between the Irish people as well as between the two sections of the Northern community. I express the genuine hope that the agreement will prove to be acceptable and that it will work.</P>

      <P>The manner in which some speakers from the Government side referred to what was said by the Leader of the Opposition causes me some concern.  The impression was created that some people on the Government side of the House might try to use this very important and serious question to divide the country. That was the impression I got and I will say no more than to express the hope that it is only an impression and that in the coming weeks the interest of the people and of the nation will be kept above the interest of party politics of any kind.  For many years we have had a bi-partisan policy, and fortunately so during the past four years, which have been a period of very great concern for those in Government. Both the Taoiseach and Deputy Lynch referred yesterday to the importance of the question of the lives of people <Col N="1890" /> in our considerations.  Deputy Lynch expressed genuine concern in a very reasoned approach to the agreement not only on behalf of this party but on behalf of many others who are not involved in any way in politics but who are genuinely concerned about their country and its future.  It may be that the concern expressed by Deputy Lynch was taken mistakenly as an attempt to play party politics.  I assure the House that there was no such intention.</P>
      <P>In approaching this question it might be no harm to reflect on the gradual development of this part of Ireland to the stage where we have arrived at what I might describe as a clearly defined political sovereignty, a sovereignty recognised beyond doubt internationally. A number of years ago we became a member of the UNO and this year we took a major step forward in becoming a member of the EEC.  It is worth bearing in mind that the Government which has a Foreign Minister as a full member of the EEC, are acting as a sovereign Government because political sovereignty for this part of Ireland has been achieved.  If this sovereignty had not been achieved I believe we would not have been able to become a full member of the EEC.  Steps that were initiated many years ago have led to a situation in which not only are we a full member of the EEC but in which we are, this year, in political terms in Europe, on an equal footing with Great Britain.  Perhaps this in itself is having its own subtle form of influence on the Unionists in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From some speeches I have heard in recent times I have detected a type of attitude on the part of some of treating sovereignty lightly.  I agree that there is a tendency at times to become obsessive in regard to a matter such as sovereignty.  This depends on what one regards as sovereignty.  To me sovereignty is not an obsession; it is simply the right of a people to decide their own affairs.  In the past it was described as self-determination.  It is important to bear in mind that the efforts made down through the years have led to a situation in which we <Col N="1891" /> may be making a significant move forward because we have independence.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Northern Ireland problem I have stated on numerous occassions that the main obstacle, apart from Britain's involvement, to the creation of a normal relationship in Ireland has been the determined refusal since 1921 by the Unionists to be involved in any way with the rest of Ireland.  Up to recently at any rate this refusal has been supported and, indeed, encouraged earlier on, by Britain.  In the course of our history Britain has invariably taken the easy road that suited her interests and British support of the Unionists from 1921 onwards in a situation in which the Unionists had their own political closed shop is a good example of the self-interest of Britain in a matter in which she has had and still has a major responsibility.</P>
    <P>Events in recent years, including the inability of the former Unionist Government to function normally in a way acceptable to the minority have brought about a major change in the British attitude.  From a position of a couple of years ago following on the troubles which developed in 1969 onwards, Britain has moved from the position where she declared that she was not standing in the way of settlement and has now said that she will now support it if the majority wants it.</P>
    <P>This may be a significant indication that Britain would like, eventually, to be done with her involvement in this country.  I am one of those who believes that all that is needed to bring about a normal and sane relationship in Ireland depends on two factors.  The first is that Britain would want to disentangle herself from involvement in our affairs.  That does not mean that I am suggesting that she should do so suddenly but that she should have the will and the inclination.  Secondly, that the Unionists, or enough of them, would be able to escape from their own historical prison and get down to talking with the remainder of the country.  They would then be able to settle down to normality and put this country, which is the country of their <Col N="1892" /> birth, first so as to bring about the kind of peace, reconciliation and progress that all but the unstable wish for.</P>
    <P>I express the hope that the agreement will prove to be workable because I believe that any joint assembly such as the proposed Council of Ireland once it begins to function should make rapid progress in the area where progress is most needed in Ireland: in our attitudes towards one another and, particularly, the attitude of Unionists towards us which has been the main stumbling block to progress.</P>
    <P>We are at a stage in our history which is very important to us all.  It is equally important that we should approach our problems calmly and as maturely as possible.  We should remind ourselves that lessons can be and have been learned from past mistakes. Most people would agree that if those who were in positions of leadership in Britain and Ireland during the period 1919-22 had a second opportunity they would have acted differently.  Unfortunately, none of them, and none of us, have the benefit of hindsight.</P>
    <P>After the suspension of Stormont I expressed the view that some sort of interim arrangement was needed in Northern Ireland.  I hope this is the sort of interim working arrangement that will work.  If some form of normal working relationship can be developed between us and our fellow countrymen in the North after a time they, like us, will come to understand that the same approach to affairs in Ireland is one in which decisions for Ireland should be taken by elected representatives of the people here and not as up to the present for a part of Ireland by people elected in another country.</P>
    <P>On the Adjournment Debate there are a number of points I should like to deal with.  We discussed last week the European Investment Bank loan and the considerable advantage it would give us in relation to our telephone system.  This loan will enable the present administration to proceed with reequipping and the provision of additional equipment.  It will be possible to do this virtually without having to raise additional capital on the home <Col N="1893" /> market.  The agreement, to my mind, is a very satisfactory one.  Hopefully, it will continue over the five-year period because if it does it will mean that 40 per cent of the total capital necessary over the coming five years for telephones will be made available from the European Investment Bank. This is another indication of the wisdom of those who urged the electorate last year to join the European Community.</P>
    <P>Recently the question of open broadcasting was made a subject for public debate.  I believe this whole question should be kept as open as possible and that a broad discussion should be engaged in by all of us in order to establish what is the best thing to do. For example, there is a serious need to provide a service for the North of Ireland.  This may become possible, and acceptable, if the Council of Ireland comes into being and functions. This is very important because many people are not conscious of the fact that our television signal is not available to the majority of those who live in the Northern Ireland area.  If it could be made available on some acceptable basis it could lead to an opening of minds in the North which should bring about even a greater degree of reconciliation and a better relationship between us.</P>
    <P>In this connection also the people who live in the single channel areas should be considered.  That area does not benefit from free television reception from the outside channels. Because they do not have the advantages of reception from outside channels these people feel deprived.  This is important.  It must be decided on over the next few years.  What we can afford must be decided.  What amounts to open broadcasting and television is available to a large section of our people at no cost.  One of the principles involved here is that no country or state that I know of has ever provided broadcasting and television transmission from another country at the expense of the taxpayers of the receiving country.</P>
    <P>There are special reasons why we should try to provide a second channel possibly through RTE, which could relay one or other channel or a <Col N="1894" /> selection from all the existing outside channels.  Whatever decision is arrived at we must have regard to the future of RTE as the country's national communication service.  A service such as RTE is necessary for our community in order to support our community identity.</P>
    <P>I would like to remind the Parliamentary Secretary of the RTE programme called &ldquo;The Politicians&rdquo; from which the Government side withdrew some time ago.  Programmes of this kind can be useful.  Some agreement should be reached to arrange something similar or, perhaps, a little different to take the place of the programme originally planned at the beginning of this year.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach referred to the setting-up of special committees to deal with Bills and also to committees to examine and report on semi-State bodies.  I would favour such committees. Other speakers have mentioned the problem of how much a House of this kind can do.  This committee system works very well in Britain but there are problems here.  The British Parliament has a membership of over 650; our Parliament has about one-fifth of that.  The point has been reached where many Deputies are finding it difficult to keep up with the committees to which they are attached.  There are committees in the House here and party committees. Some Members have been delegated to the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>There is another matter I must mention by way of criticism: the rate of inflation.  We are now at the top of the European league, together with Italy, with an inflationary rate of 11 per cent.  According to my calculations the rate of inflation has almost absorbed the social welfare increases.  To some degree world prices have influenced the situation. But part of the problem has been created by the increased VAT and the tax increases decided on in the last budget.  I criticise the Government and the Minister for Finance on the fiscal policy which to a considerable extent has acted as an encouragement to inflation.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect to which I attach considerable importance and <Col N="1895" /> it is the reduction in the grants provided by the previous administration for recreational facilities and amenities. Proper playgrounds in urban areas and football pitches are essential to the normal development of young people.  Many problems which we find among teenagers arise from lack of amenities such as playgrounds and swimming pools.  The capital grant in last year's budget was quite small.  I find it impossible to justify the reduction in these grants in this year's budget.  Indeed that was the time when serious consideration should have been given to having them increased. Not only the Minister for Finance but also the Taoiseach should look into this matter urgently in an effort to relieve the serious overcrowding problem not only in Dublin but in all cities and towns throughout Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly) John Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by drawing attention to some of the remarks offered by Deputy O'Malley this morning.  I have not secured that my speech would be delivered at a time when he is not here; neither have I gone out of my way to warn him to be here.  I certainly would have liked to see him in the House to hear what I have to say in regard to a few of the charges he made.  Their relevance to the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach is doubtful but in so far as the entire working of the Government is conventionally brought under review in this debate, I suppose he was in order in speaking his mind, and I hope, therefore, I will be considered equally in order in speaking my mind on the matters to which he saw fit to draw attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He spoke in an oblique way about the security performance of this Government and seemed to me to be tying up what he had to say with a remark which he previously had made in a debate earlier this session to the effect that the picketing of courthouses by people with placards, evidently aimed at intimidating jurymen or justices, never could have been dealt with lawfully until the passage of <Col N="1896" /> the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Bill which he sponsored here a year ago.  That assertion of Deputy O'Malley went unchallenged at the time, I am sorry to say, for the reason that I did not happen to be in the House.  Had I been in the House when the Deputy made that assertion I doubt if I would have had enough self-control to avoid contradicting him on the spot in defiance of the rules of order.</P>
    <P>If Deputy O'Malley is under the impression, or if his advisers are under the impression that the laws of this country contained no provision for dealing with this situation or were so feeble that this situation had to be tolerated whereby men with placards paraded in front of courthouses with an evidently intimidatory purpose, then Deputy O'Malley and his then advisers, or possibly the advisers whom he now has in his think-tank, would want to do some more homework.  It is a legal point and even the humblest, the most inexperienced lawyer, is slow to be dogmatic.  There is no such thing as being absolutely right from the word go, or absolutely wrong, and I do not want to make what may seem like a papal pronouncement on the status of picketers outside courthouses, but for my part I do not accept that the law did not contain such power before Deputy O'Malley's Bill, and I would have liked to have seen the last Government exploring the possibilities which were inherent in the law in regard to contempt on indictment.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley spoke about contempt, and what he said about it was that he was sorry that judges had not seen fit to employ their powers in regard to people who are immediately outside the doors of courts.  It is true that contempt in the face of the court traditionally bears only on an insult offered to the court by somebody inside the door and I think that a judge or a justice would have been on weak ground if he tried to commit for contempt somebody who was parading outside the door of his court. However, there is such a thing as contempt on indictment whereby somebody can be formally arraigned and charged with the criminal offence <Col N="1897" /> of contempt of court which amounts to trying to interfere with the courts of justice by dictating its outcome.  By that I mean by intimating in an intimidatory way or even in a less than intimidatory way to somebody who is charged with administering justice what he should do.</P>
    <P>I believe that the last Government, at any rate until their very last months, were grossly neglectful in this regard and I will not take from Deputy O'Malley the explanation that the law does not contain sufficient power to control this absolutely disgraceful picketing of court houses.  I will not take that explanation from him.  I am as willing to be ruled wrong on a point of law as any other lawyer and I hope Deputy O'Malley has the same amount of humility.  However, I do not want him to be let go uncontradicted in this House on his suggestion that the law of this country was powerless to deal with this kind of blackguardism.  I call it that advisedly because I note that the people who complain most bitterly about unusual legal power, about the suspension of usual legal processes, about internment, about special courts, are the very people who are to be seen conducting themselves in such a way as to make the ordinary administration of justice impossible&mdash;the very people who organise and instigate protests and agitations about unusual forms of law are the very ones who are identified and who commit and perpetrate the interference of the ordinary courts of justice in the way I have been describing.  That is why I call it blackguardism.  It is blackguardly on the one hand to prevent or to do your best to prevent a justice or a humble juror from doing his duty and in the next breath to complain if the ordinary processes of the law are suspended and accused persons of a certain kind find themselves charged before a court of a different kind.</P>
    <P>Let me remind the House that justice in the forms to which we have been accustomed is largely in accordance with British forms.  Let us not forget that.  It is not a thing I am particularly proud of.  I believe that this country ought to have struck out on its own much further and much faster, but <Col N="1898" /> when I hear the like of the various outer wings of what is called republicanism protesting about the ordinary processes of law being suspended, I often ask myself do these people realise that the only processes of law they know of in this country were inherited from the hated oppressor; that the jury system, that <i>habeas corpus</i>, are legacies here of the hated British and that if we had secured our freedom not from the British but from the Turks, or the Russians, or the Germans, or the Italians, or the Swedes, these remedies might very well not be there.  These are the ordinary processes of law, we took them over from the British, some of them uncritically, I believe.  Some of them might perhaps have been examined to see if they squared with the Irish national genius, about which the Constitution so ponderously speaks, but for better or for worse we have taken them over and they are British institutions.</P>
    <P>I have nothing but contempt for somebody who has not got the guts or the honesty to recognise his own parentage or the parentage of the institutions under which he lives. These institutions were taken over by us and they require a certain level of civilisation, a certain level of peace, a certain level of give and take and a certain political climate in order for them to be workable.  They become unworkable when people set out to intimidate a witness from giving evidence, to intimidate a juryman&mdash;and it does not take much, perhaps to intimidate someone who has got a wife and family to think of and who has no particular political axe to grind&mdash;or perhaps even to intimidate a district justice, although I should like to make it clear that I have not heard of a case and do not believe there ever was a case of a member of the Irish Judiciary, by whichever political party he was appointed, having been deflected from his duty.  It is blackguardly and disgraceful that this should happen. When it does, the State is entitled to take further powers into its hands in order to deal with the disruption of the ordinary processes of law.</P>
    <P>Even before the introduction of the <Col N="1899" /> Offences against the State (Amendment) Bill last year the State had powers.  My charge against the Government then was, and remains, that they were neglectful in exploring those powers; they did not do their job in searching diligently enough to see how it could be controlled and they allowed the situation to develop so that the people scarcely knew from one month to the next what kind of state they would be living in.  I remember this country, as we all do, before the EEC referendum.  I was very much committed to the referendum in justice.  The Fianna Fáil Party were as well.  The reason I was committed to it was that I thought our membership would be some kind of a bulwark for us against savagery.  I thought that if we, a small country, were a member of a large group of civilised countries that it would be some kind of defence for us against barbarism. That was the one reason more than any other reason why I favoured the passage of that referendum.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party and other groups exercised their clear democratic right in taking a different view and making a different evaluation of the importance of the issue.  The Labour Party, like democrats, accepted the people's verdict and are doing their best, as we all are on both sides of the House, to make the best of our membership of this Community, to get what we can from it and to contribute what we can to it.  My fear at that time was that if by any chance that referendum were defeated, we would be left high and dry on the shores of Europe at the mercy of the bullies.</P>
    <P>I certainly misjudged the outcome very much.  I am willing to concede that I misjudged the temper of the people in thinking that that might be the outcome.  I felt that the possibility was there and I found it terrifying that if we did not get into the EEC we would be left with a Government who were not fit, able or willing to control the bullies and savages in our midst.  My misgivings would have been far less with a different kind of Government. In justice to the better side of Fianna Fáil I must say that if the <Col N="1900" /> better end of Fianna Fáil had been in Government and had had a majority independent of their penumbra of part-time gun hookers I would have been perfectly happy too.  That was not the case.  We were governed by an administration, the leader of which, I must say in his favour, never wished for bloodshed, or did anything which could be thought to lead directly to it and in his heart he wished it to stop. He led a party which I honestly did not think were sufficiently committed to what may be conventionally called law and order, to protect us against the savages, bullies and blackguards.</P>
    <P>That all changed, according to Deputy O'Malley.  I do not wish to put words in his mouth but he gave the impression that when he got a grip on things it all changed.  Although Deputy O'Malley and I do not seem to have a perfect <i>rapport</i>, in the parliamentary sense, of course, I am willing to say that I have a certain regard for the personal guts which he showed at a time when the savages and blackguards were lampooning him, putting up posters about him, threatening him and, for all I know, making his personal and home life a misery.  I felt then and I still feel that Deputy O'Malley, the then Taoiseach, the then Minister for Finance and the then Minister for Health were a lonely quartet holding a fort.  If one would like to drop back into the language of the imperialistic era, these four Ministers were like European officers in a fort in the desert.  The rest of the garrison consisted of very unreliable, local levies who would turn and desert to the nomad insurgents at the first whistle of danger.  I am sorry to say that the events of those days do not really validate that perhaps exaggerated comparison.  One could search the pages of the Official Report and the daily papers and month in, month out, one would not find a word from the vast majority of Fianna Fáil office-holders which could be construed as trying to give a lead to the people against cruelty, savagery and barbarism.</P>
    <P>There were 15 Ministers and seven Parliamentary Secretaries in the last Government.  There were 22 Mercedes-cushioned office-holders.  Of those 22, I cannot count more than four, or five <Col N="1901" /> at the very outside, who ever tried to give the people a lead in this matter.  I regard this subject as being far more important than the matters upon which we are being bombarded with letters every day of the week.  It is far more important than any issue which this Parliament ever faced or will have to face.  There were 16 or 17 office-holders in the last Administration who thought it was good enough to be Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries.  They were paid &ldquo;danger money&rdquo; and should never have left a Fianna Fáil dinner, a bun fight or a dog's dinner without making it clear where they stood in regard to the rights of this democracy, to there only being one Army and one Dáil and the one form in which violence could be used by this country against our neighbour, whatever one thought of the legitimacy of the neighbour's frontiers, was on the direct order of this House.  There were 16 or 17 of these men who did not do that, who felt they could get away without doing it and who would have cheerfully ridden to Belfast on the backs of the Provisionals if that was how things had turned out.  They were trying to have things both ways.  Like many a man who tried to have things both ways they ended up having nothing.  I do not want to sound condescending but I freely admit that there were a few men who tried to keep their heads and shoulders above water.  I have no doubt that there were some backbenchers who admired them for it and were willing to stand by them.  By and large, we got a rotten example from the last Government.  It was an example about which the people trembled because we were coming up to the EEC referendum.</P>
    <P>The arguments against joining the EEC, so far as I can judge&mdash;I am not an economist and never set out to be one&mdash;were strong enough.  The Labour Party, made an excellent case for their opposition to membership.  Their campaign would have secured more votes and come nearer tipping the balance were it not for the very dubious people who put themselves, uninvited, not onto the Labour Party band wagon but on to the anti-EEC bandwagon.  That was a direct consequence.</P>
    <P>The fact that people were immune to <Col N="1902" /> the concrete and objective arguments of the Labour Party in this matter was a direct consequence of the terror that gripped the country 18 months ago.  There was a fear that the whole of this society and civilisation might crumble before our eyes, that the people we saw striding up and down firing shots in the air, the men with the sour faces, with the black berets and dark glasses, would take over this country.  We saw no will on the part of the Government to prevent that happening.</P>
    <P>I believe that many men and women, if they thought about the issues, might have felt the Labour Party were right, that we should not join the EEC, that there was more to be gained by staying out of it.  Many people might have voted the way the Labour Party suggested but instead they voted with Fine Gael and, inferentially, with Fianna Fáil, because they were afraid of what would happen if they did not&mdash;not from the Labour Party but from the people Fianna Fáil were unwilling to put down and control.</P>
    <P>All this started out from the question of the picketing of the courthouses. In my absence the other day Deputy O'Malley said there were no powers in the law to control such matters before his Bill was introduced. I believe that is untrue; however, I am willing to have it adjudicated and I do not mind if I am shown to be wrong. I suppose if Deputy Andrews were here he would put on a sour face and say I was acting the professor again.  I am perfectly willing to be shown wrong about this but I believe there were adequate powers in the law and contempt on indictment was one possible remedy.  I believe that would not have exhausted the remedies.</P>
    <P>For example, the Offences Against the State Act, 1939&mdash;the parent Act&mdash; contained powers that were adequate for dealing with this matter.  Section 8 of that Act provided it was an offence to interfere with the administration of Government, whether legislative, executive or judicial.  That is an offence and has been for the last 34 years.  When I was in the other House it was a matter of complaint with me <Col N="1903" /> that that section had not been activated.</P>
    <P>I charge the previous Government with never having given a second's thought to whether the fellows who were intimidating, or intending to intimidate, justices, jury men and witnesses, might not have been successfully prosecuted for interfering, or attempting to interfere, with the administration of Government in the sense of the 1939 Act.  Speaking as a layman and as a citizen, it is obvious that the intention was to prevent the judicial arm of the State from operating, to terrify witnesses and jury men and, if possible, to terrify justices. That was the intention and I charge the previous Government with never having bothered their heads to inquire whether this matter might not have been brought under control in that way.</P>
    <P>I mentioned two legal remedies but that does not exhaust the list.  I realise the House does not want a lecture and that if I go on about legal remedies it will be thought I am delivering a lecture.  However, I do not mind providing other remedies if the occasion arises in the future and I am challenged on the matter.  I absolutely reject any suggestion by Deputy O'Malley that there were no powers to prevent the kind of activity I described until his Bill was passed last December. Although the Deputy is a difficult man to deal with, rather like Deputy Andrews, and is a rather prickly plant, I acknowledge he is a law-and-order man and I accept that he himself would not have wished to trifle with the kind of people he was out against.  However, I do not accept his allegation, made very categorically, that nothing could have been done about these matters until he had the Bill last December.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley saw fit today, when talking about general Government policy and conduct, to mention judicial appointments.  Although the report has not yet been printed, I have seen the transcript of his speech. He saw fit to criticise four judicial appointments made by this Government since they took office.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1904" /> Let me start by giving the Deputy some credit.  In the last years of the previous Government they made two judicial appointments to the superior courts; the gentlemen concerned, as Deputy O'Malley rightly pointed out, had been associated with Fine Gael.  If Deputy O'Malley had anything to do with the making of the appointments and with the breaking of the system of patronage which existed, I acknowledge it gladly and I compliment him on it.  The Deputy boasted there was general pleasure and relief when these appointments were made and I concede that also.</P>
    <P>At the same time, while I do not want to appear to be niggling in giving him credit, I must point out that two judges do not make justice and that for the many years a system had been endured in which appointments were made, all from the other side. Some of the appointments could not have deserved the credit or the praise Deputy O'Malley recently gave to the gentlemen appointed by the Government. Judicial appointments were made by the last Government&mdash;I cannot in decency name them, nor would I be allowed to&mdash;that were not respectable. By that I do not mean the judges or the people concerned are venal, I do not mean they have misconducted themselves since their appointments, but the appointments were made of men who, in the opinion of the legal profession, of those best qualified to size up a judicial appointment, were bad appointments and this must have been known before they were made.  They were appointments of men with far closer links with the then ruling party than any described here by Deputy O'Malley in connection with the more recent appointments.</P>
    <P>I do not want to appear holier in any way than the rest of the Government I support but I hope, as time goes on, the whole system of patronage will wither and die.  If that is what Deputy O'Malley genuinely wants, I shall be with him shoulder to shoulder.  I do not believe in the system, whether in judicial appointments or in anything else.  However, in talking about the judicial appointments <Col N="1905" /> as he did today, the Deputy invites the comments I feel I must make.  Until the breakthrough, for which I freely give him credit, the bench had been literally stuffed with Fianna Fáil judges.</P>
    <P>Many of the judges&mdash;I would say most of them&mdash;were at the top of their profession.  I also admit that most of them&mdash;nearly all of them&mdash; have given satisfaction.  All of them, and I want to make this quite clear, are absolutely free&mdash;and this is very important because I do not want to be misconstrued in regard to anything amounting to a charge&mdash;even the most blatently political appointments made by the Fianna Fáil side are completely free of any suspicion of having misbehaved themselves after appointment by reason of partial behaviour towards one side or another in any kind of a case.</P>
    <P>I want to make it quite clear that I am making no charge whatever against the conduct of these gentlemen once appointed, but I do say that, with the exception of the breakthrough for which Deputy O'Malley claims credit, and for which I am prepared to give him credit, the appointments made have been solidly Fianna Fáil and some of them were not only Fianna Fáil but discreditable as well, and known to be before the appointments were made, and known to the profession&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>At the risk of being repetitious, because I realise that feelings can be hurt about this, I want to say again very briefly that every judge or justice, so far as I know, ever appointed by either side in this State has conducted himself impartially.  I want to put on record that I have never heard a tittle of suspicion that any judge or justice has misconducted himself in the sense of showing favour <Col N="1907" /> to one side.  I have never heard even a whisper of that.  I want to put that on record.</P>
      <P>I have never heard that even about gentlemen appointed by Fianna Fáil. That is on record but, merely to be fair or do one's best is not enough. One must also have qualifications which, admittedly, are difficult to assess in advance but which every practising lawyer understands and knows about.  You must have something up there.  You must have experience.  You must have tolerance and patience.  These are indefinable qualities which I freely admit are not easy to see in a man when he is an advocate but the absence of which can be very quickly seen.</P>
      <P>I want to assert distinctly that appointments, not many, but some, were made by the previous Government during their 16 years in office which did not measure up even to the rough criteria I have outlined and which were made on a completely and flagrantly party basis.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley drew attention to the fact that one, or maybe two&mdash;I have forgotten which &mdash;of the Fine Gael appointees had been Fine Gael general election candidates. If I saw fit I could call attention to a very, very well-known judicial name, and a very well-respected and rightly respected one, appointed by the Fianna Fáil Government who had the honour of running as a Fianna Fáil candidate.  I will not do that because I do not want to go any further than I have to in putting Deputy O'Malley's words into perspective. If Deputy Tunney will allow me I promise to have regard to his sensitive skin and to make my remarks as little painful as possible.  I will not allow Deputy O'Malley to get away with the inference, which will have <Col N="1909" /> been well picked up by the papers because he spoke at an advantageous moment of the day, that this Government have done something out of the way in making judicial appointments over the past eight months.</P>
      <P>The situation is simply this.  If you were to make nothing but Fine Gael and Labour appointments to the Judiciary for the next six years, you still would not have caught up, in fairness, with the people appointed by Fianna Fáil to the bench at the higher or lower level.  I accept&mdash;and I pay tribute to Deputy O'Malley if he had anything to do with it; I think this is the third time I have said this; I am anxious to give him credit for it because I was very glad to see it myself&mdash;that a breakthrough was made by the Fianna Fáil Government.  I accept that freely, but it would take not only a breakthrough but going into reverse to even the score.  When I say &ldquo;score&rdquo; I am not simply thinking in terms of jobs.  I am thinking in terms of filling judicial offices like any other offices with the best people available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not claim to have up-to-date recollections of it.  I have not been active there for 12 years or thereabouts.  I remember the few years I was there and I remember the appointments made.  I remember a place on the bench that became vacant, and the names that were bandied about by my friends, many of them Fianna Fáil supporters&mdash;they were not all Fine Gael people trying to make a cheap point at the expense of the other side&mdash;as being likely successors, the names bandied about in the coffee rooms and the bar, the <Col N="1910" /> names which were in the mouths of the gossips, were never any but Fianna Fáil names.  The idea that anybody but a known Fianna Fáil supporter might ever occupy such an office never entered our heads.  The idea that anybody but a known Fianna Fáil supporter would ever get on to the Bench never entered our heads and the first break that was made, as I gladly acknowledge, was an appointment that Deputy O'Malley mentioned earlier today.  But over the last 16 years a very large number of appointments were made.</P>
      <P>It is not now a question simply of evening up the score.  If it were simply a question of paying Fianna Fáil back by putting our own people into the jobs I would think that contemptible, if that were all that was in it, but do not forget that there is a backlog of men who, because perhaps of some hereditary blemish could not find it in their hearts to support Fianna Fáil, never could and never will, and these men, with the exception of the two gentlemen mentioned by Deputy O'Malley, never got any consideration for a seat on the Bench.  These men are at the top of their profession, have been for years at the top of their profession, and, under any impartial system, would have reached the Bench just as quickly as and more quickly than many appointments that were made on a partisan basis by the last Government.</P>
      <P>I do not want now to seem to be trying to have my cake and eat it.  I do not want to expose myself to the accusation of being pious or holier-than-thou by any of my own colleagues. I know this is a danger that exists in politics.  I remember Deputy Colley being rapped over the knuckles by Deputy Haughey in an oblique way for that a few years ago and I certainly do not want to leave myself in that position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not like a system of pure patronage.  I have always been against it.  I am on record in various places as being against it.  The situation in regard to judicial appointments is that there is such a log jam at the top that, if the Government were to do nothing else but appoint Fine Gael and Labour supporters for the next <Col N="1911" /> three, four or five years, it scarcely would have appointed all the men who deserved appointment as soon as the men that were appointed under Fianna Fáil because of their being Fianna Fáil supporters.</P>

      <P>I will not join in that kind of talk and I will tell the Deputy why.  I think it brings on a mí-ádh.  It is unlucky to be boasting about what is going to happen.  I remember Fianna Fáil after the Cork by-election. I remember having to face in the Seanad debates in the winter of last year the sneers and the jeers from the Fianna Fáil side.  We were talking about &ldquo;under another Government&rdquo; and the Fianna Fáil Members would all chorus back, like so many hens when they see the oats, &ldquo;When? When?  When?&rdquo; When was that going to be?  It came very soon.  That taught me a lesson.  Admittedly it was a lesson learned at the expense of Fianna Fáil and not at my own expense.  I will not boast about how long this Government are going to last.  I make no prophecy about it at all.  We could be gone in a month.  We could be gone in a year.  But my advice to Deputies opposite is do not make any prophecies either.  Let us just see what the Irish people will do when the time comes.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley said that if only the Irish people had been kind enough to leave himself and his party in power the silly and childish system of patronage would have ended.  He called it a silly and childish system.  I too can call it that: it is a silly and childish system if it is a system of pure patronage.  The incidence of, if you like, the more publicised ones being the appointment of judges is only the tip of the iceberg and every man in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and Labour knows that too.  To go no further than the legal profession&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaving aside the appointment of judges, but not going too far away from it, I will tell the House something about patronage and about how it can operate at another level on the legal scene.  The State every year pays out a very large sum, running into over six figures, in fees to barristers for doing the people's work. Now that money under the last Government, with a couple of exceptions, and I acknowledge the exceptions freely and frankly&mdash;they were trivial in number and in the amount of money involved&mdash;was allocated on a purely party political basis.  I remember in my own days in the Bar Library when a by-election came around&mdash;I want to make this point if it is of any interest to anyone on the other side of the House: I was not a member of any political party and I had no fixed political convictions; certainly there were things I reacted very strongly against, and they were much the same then as they are now, but I was not committed to any political party in those days&mdash;it was observed that when a by-election came around certain members of the Bar Library used go around and whisper in certain ears: &ldquo;We will expect to see you at certain church gates&rdquo; and the clearly understood message was that for a token appearance at the church gate and the making of a speech in a by-election, a general election, a presidential election or a referendum campaign, the people's work would flow in in varying quantities to the man concerned. Not the briefs of the Fianna Fáil Party, not the personal litigation of Mr. de Valera, Mr. Lemass, Mr. MacEntee or anybody else, but the people's litigation would be steered into those hands.  That was the understanding and that is what happened. When I was there there was less money around and I suppose the Fianna Fáil Government are entitled to both the praise and the blame for the rise in wages and the rise in prices and, in general, for everything having got dearer and dearer, but there was less money around then and a junior counsel making £3,000 to £3,500 a <Col N="1913" /> year was considered to be doing very, very well indeed.</P>
      <P>I knew junior counsel in those days with wives and families pulling the devil by the tail with £1,000 a year or less, with no pension, with no insurance, with absolutely no way of protecting themselves if they should get sick; their practice just disappeared overnight like snow off a ditch.  To these men were held out the glittering prospect of adding 50 per cent, 100 per cent, or, perhaps, 200 per cent, to their income would they but go down to the church gate in Quiltybough and speak for Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>I know the legal profession is thought to be a crowd of grabbers, crooks, cheats and everything else. You may take it from me that the legal profession, by and large, works very hard for what it makes.  There are some men in it who make quite a lot of money.  I am out of touch with some but there may be a few people who make £15,000 a year.  That compares very poorly, even at that, with certain members of other professions, with certain doctors, engineers, architects, accountants, people of that kind.  There may be a couple of barristers at that level of £15,000.  There are about 200 in the profession altogether or not far off that, and you can take it that most of these are very far from being rich men.  Most of those are by no means in the category that one of the Fianna Fáil think-tanks spoke about recently when he said £10,000 a year was a respectable and legitimate aspiration for an ordinary man.  They have to work very hard for their money.  A young man with a wife and family might be excused, if he has got no particular political interest, for saying to himself: &ldquo;All I have to do is go down now to Clonbur next Sunday and make a speech for Fianna Fáil, even though I have no interest in the party. It might be worth another £500 a year for me.&rdquo;  That is reducing it, if you like, to absurdity, but that is the absurdity which existed.</P>

      <P>There is one side of this to which I have no objection.  I think it is right and proper that political parties should get out and try to recruit support.  That is as it should be, but look at the other side of it. A man who because of some flaw in his character, because of some hereditary blindness of soul, does not accept that Fianna Fáil is the Army of Destiny, does not believe that there is no alternative to Fianna Fáil, it is very perverse and disgusting of such a man not to accept such a concept. However, if there is such a man who is able to call his soul his own, he is faced with this situation, that for the mere price of a speech at the church gate he can double his income or, perhaps, treble it or, if <Col N="1915" /> he is lucky, strike the jackpot like two or three junior counsel have done over the last few years, and earn more from the State alone than the Chief Justice was being paid.  A man going home to his wife and family confronted with that situation might be inclined to waver and say: &ldquo;Does it really matter?  Are they not all the same?  I might as well go down and make a speech for Fianna Fáil.&rdquo;  But there is some little thing inside of him which says: &ldquo;I am damned if I am going to go along with that crowd.&rdquo; I do not want to use an offensive word about a party which contains many gentlemen, honourable people, but he may not feel that way about it and may say: &ldquo;I am damned if I am going to sell myself even for another £500, even if it is going to pay the school fees, the rates, the rent, whatever it is.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is the way a citizen of a free republic, a free Irish republic, ought to think and ought to be encouraged to think.  That to me is a man worth having in this country, and that is the man who is left behind here over the years by Fianna Fáil.  I have spoken about the Bar which I know something about.  I have absolutely no doubt that what I am describing is true in every other profession to which public funds could be applied. If it is true of the Bar, what is there about the professions of architect, engineer, consultant, accountant, or anything else which might make it unlikely?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not listen to Deputy O'Malley or anybody else talking about patronage. This country is rotten with it, has been made rotten with it, and if this Government can kill it, it will be its proudest achievement in my eyes. There are people who could have been comfortable, who could have paid off their mortgages, who could have had holidays, who could have lived in nicer houses, given their wives and their children things, which they would not do because they would not sell out.  If in the next list circulated to this House by way of a Parliamentary reply, you see, as you will see, a list of people getting State money for State work who, amazingly enough, <Col N="1916" /> are not cumann members of Fianna Fáil, are not Fianna Fáil ward healers or hatchetmen, the putters-up or pullers-down of posters, I do not apologise for that.  These are men who stuck to their principles.  These are men who resisted the temptation openly held out to them by Fianna Fáil and pressed upon them, to come into the service of that party.  It is time that these men got a share of that money, because it is not Deputy Crowley's money or Deputy Dowling's money we are talking about it, it is the people's money.</P>
    <P>Although I dislike and detest patronage and would like more than any other thing to be able to say of this Government, when it faces the people, that we have begun to put an end to it, I will not apologise if men who were left behind, who endured, in some cases, hardship rather than take the very easy way out of pretending to be Fianna Fáil supporters, now get some recognition.  I hope that, when the score is evened, when one side catches up with the other, a system will be arrived at whereby all patronage will disappear.  When the time comes when it is reasonable to say the score has been levelled I promise the people opposite will not find me making a sophistical defence for the continuance of patronage.</P>

      <P>It is like the Constituencies Bill.  We listened to righteous fulminations over the past few days regarding this Bill and how outrageous it is of the Minister for Local Government to make this or that change.  If the Minister had left the dog's breakfast which he found in the Department of Local Government when he arrived, in the shape of Deputy Molloy's plans and allowed it to become law&mdash;he had to make some change because the Constitution required it, in my view&mdash;but suppose he had been able to leave the Boland constituencies as they were, would he not have been thought the greatest baby?  Would not everybody have been laughing?  The trouble is that <Col N="1917" /> the record of this House does not record the smiles.  Deputy Dowling opposite has a smile on his face and I know in my heart that he knows that I am talking sense and truth about this and Deputy Crowley is repressing a smile&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was here for some of that discussion.  Deputy Molloy denied that he had prepared a Bill.

      <P>Deputy Molloy found himself put into office in consequence of a convulsion in the Fianna Fáil Party.  He planned a grandiose masterpiece which would plaster the walls of this House, the crucifixion of Fine Gael and Labour.  He was preparing sketches toward the execution of this masterpiece.  He never produced the masterpiece although he had time to do so and in my view constitutionally ought to have done it, but the sketches remained.  We know what it would have looked like if he had gone on to paint the final job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the Minister for Local Government was more than justified in mentioning this matter yesterday.  Perhaps there were faults on both sides but he got a very surly time from Deputy Molloy who knows perfectly well that he had riding instructions. If he had not, his party would be guilty of a degree of foolishness which the public would not credit; whatever their other faults they are well able to look after themselves.  Deputy Molloy was drawing up some kind of plan and thought he had all the time in the world to do it.  As it turned out, <Col N="1918" /> he had not, but his sketches, studies towards this masterpiece, showing the obliteration so far as it could be done of Fine Gael and Labour, survive in the Custom House.  The Minister for Local Government dug them out and presented them here yesterday and we saw what happened.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Crowley talks about Thomas Aquinas, it is a very apposite thing to say because it calls a parallel instantly to mind.  The defence I would make and have made in the House for what Deputy Tully is doing &mdash;I do not know if the Deputies opposite were present; Deputy Lalor was&mdash;is that we must protect ourselves against the consequences of the Boland constituencies which were clearly designed to buy cheap seats for Fianna Fáil.  Deputy Desmond is on record I think, and certainly more than one Government Deputy is already on record as saying they would like an impartial fixing of constituencies.  I should like that also but until such a thing can be built into the Constitution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am afraid it is not, but it is near enough, a couple of hundred years out, but the comparison drawn by Deputy Crowley called it irresistibly to mind.  The Minister for Local Government is involved&mdash;and I support him&mdash;in an operation which is intended to remove from the backs of the two parties in Government the handicap deliberately placed on them, as Deputies opposite know, by Deputy Boland.  The people put us into Government this time notwithstanding that handicap.  We overcame it.  As Deputy Power said, in a good interruption <Col N="1919" /> the other evening, we played a blinder but the day of the match was badly chosen, or the coin was badly tossed or whatever way you like to put it.  I am not a sportsman but no doubt there are many suitable metaphors.  A blinder was played and we overcame the handicap even though we had to play into the wind, a very strong wind set up by Deputy Boland with his Constituencies Bill and we won the election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody has ever heard me boasting or gloating about winning the election. We could as easily lose one.  We might at any time be out and sitting opposite again.  I do not believe in boasting.  But while that law is there we are still under that handicap, whatever side of the House we are on, and it cannot be left like that.  We must redress the balance.  Later, we shall see what can be done about a commission. I, for one, do not mind being on record as being in favour of it.  Deputy Desmond has said the same thing and so has more than one other Government Deputy.  The question of patronage is not so far away from it.  I have said I am against it. I am against it; I do not like to see jobs being given simply because people are of a particular colour.  I do not like it any more when they are Fine Gael than when they are Fianna Fáil, but the ruthless application of jobbery by Fianna Fáil at every level, down to the humblest roadmen in some counties, over the last half-generation is such that it would take a long time to see that the people whose principles prevented them from going along with that and from signing into the cumann, will at least get a fair crack of the whip.  I am willing to defend that and the man who says: &ldquo;I am not going to join those lousers&rdquo;&mdash;that may be a rude word; I am using it in inverted commas.  That might be the point of view of somebody.  I am sure that word is used about us.  If there is a Fianna Fáil road-mender somewhere to whom it is ever put up that he will get extra employment or an extra couple of weeks doing this or that if he will join the Fine Gael or Labour, I would say to that man: &ldquo;I will <Col N="1920" /> stand by you and in so far as I can make sure that you are not left hungry I shall do it.&rdquo;  I do not believe in patronage.</P>

      <P>They swallowed this thing but hated it.  I know there are Fianna Fáil people who are decent and honourable and who hate these things.  One of the sad things about the civil war, if I may go back that far, is that it tended to separate two people who in many ways were very similar and had a lot in common with each other, and put them in competition with one another and made the tools and weapons of that competition the giving out of jobs and reducing of ordinary people to servitude, because that is what it is, in other words doing with the Irish people exactly what the English did with them.

Although I do not want to sink to the level of people who, the other day, threw the word &ldquo;fascist&rdquo; across the House, when I hear complaints about patronage coming from the Fianna Fáil side I am reminded, just as Deputy Crowley was reminded of Thomas Aquinas, of Hitler calling himself the greatest democrat in Europe.  Fianna Fáil were, and still would be if they were in, the greatest jobbers in Europe.  When I say Europe I had better qualify it.

      <P>I have done my best to make the point that I am against patronage.  I was against it when Fianna Fáil exercised it and I certainly will be against it if it ever becomes apparent that this Government are exercising it for its own sake but I want to make another important point.  I have already made it but let me end this part of my speech by summarising it.  Over the years large numbers of people in every profession, in every walk of life, have been left behind, have not got their fair share of public money&mdash;I do not mean in the shape of hand-outs, I mean employment or mandates of one kind or another which are paid for by public money&mdash;simply because they were not supporters of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You will notice, Sir, that I have been making that point for the last 20 minutes or so without once mentioning the magic word &ldquo;Taca&rdquo;.  The fact that I have been able to make this point, I hope forcefully and cogently, without even mentioning Taca is sufficient commentary on the truth of what I am saying.  I will not speak about that organisation.  It merely institutionalised, it erected into a formal pyramid, complete with Sphinxes, Deputy Blaney at one side and Deputy Haughey at the other, with the cryptic message: &ldquo;Stay with us boys and we will see you right.&rdquo;  That is all I want to say on the question of patronage.  I hope I will not have left open to any misconception or misapprehension my absolute repudiation of the remarks Deputy O'Malley saw fit to make today about the judicial appointments. I have made every allowance I can to him for being well-meaning himself. If he was concerned with the breakthrough, with which I am willing to credit him, I compliment him on it but I simply will not take from that side allegations about patronage when we have seen the record of the last 16 years and when we have seen the obverse of it, the people who because of principle, preferred to paddle their own canoes and not go to Fianna Fáil looking for favours and jobs and money and who might, as Fianna Fáil were then predicting, never see the day <Col N="1923" /> when their ship would come in.  I remember the respected Senator Yeats, now a vocal member of the Fianna Fáil delegation in the European Parliament, saying after the 1969 election he thought that in consequence of the people having shot down the 1968 referendum of Mr. Boland, Fianna Fáil would be in power for 50 years. It puts me in mind again of Hitler: &ldquo;tausendjaehriges Reich&rdquo;.</P>

That is a stern warning against pride in political or any other kind of life.  Senator Yeats thought they would be in for 50 years.  I make no such assertion about us.  I do not think anyone has a lease of any kind of life, human or political.  What would this country have looked like after another 50 years of that kind of Government?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the question of the reform of Dáil procedure.  Before I say anything about that, I want to say something about a matter which is very closely connected with it.  Criticisms were thrown across this House in the last month or so about the state of business and people asked why we were not getting on with the business.  The record will show that the number of Bills passed by this House since the 1st May, which was the date on which the Dáil first met after the election of the Taoiseach, is about the same as the yearly average for the few years previously.  This does not support the contention we have heard from the other side that legislation is not forthcoming.  There is a great amount of legislation forthcoming <Col N="1924" /> and I am wondering whether our present sitting habits will be adequate to cope with it.  I do not wish my remarks to be taken as a news item because I say this in a rhetoric rather than in a serious sense.  Some of this legislation is proximate while some of it is more imminent.  I am not claiming that we have been all that much faster in regard to legislation as was the position in the previous year and I admit freely that some of the Bills passed, such as the one passed this morning, were non-contentious and many of them, but not as many as Fianna Fáil pretend, were at an advanced stage of preparation when we took office.  But it is not true that the legislative programme this year, despite the disruption caused by the change of Government, has been any slower than in previous years.</P>
      <P>I noticed two curious aspects of the criticism from the other side in regard to Dáil business.  One was that we were filling in time or freewheeling in bringing forward Estimates, <i>et cetera.</i> It is a question of which side one is on or of how well one is pleased to have it both ways.  Seventeen Estimates were discussed since this Government took office.  Some of these were discussed completely, that is, to the stage where they were passed, while others did not reach that stage and were hanging until yesterday. Last year the number was ten while in the previous year it was 12 and in the year before that the figure was 18.  Estimates involve this House approving the allocation of staggering sums of money for the public service. More of those items have been discussed in the Dáil since the change of Government than had been discussed in an average year for some time past.  Therefore, I reject, first, the idea that less legislation has gone through this year and, secondly, any idea that there was any sort of freewheeling or of unnecessary stringing out of Estimates. If it is not right that we should discuss Estimates who will be the first person to say so?  Is it to be somebody from the Opposition who will will say that we have no business discussing the allocation of, say, £300 million for a Department of State?</P>

      <P>Criticism was levelled at us both within the House and outside it in that we were spending too much time on Estimates.  That criticism began building up about two months ago but we have not had much of it during the past couple of weeks.  Debates on Estimates might be curtailed profitably but who will say that they should be ruled out altogether or that there should be any limit on the amount of time devoted to debating them?</P>
      <P>The campaign for the Monaghan by-election was relatively short but it would have been within the power of the Minister for Local Government, had he so chosen, to have fixed the election for a week later than the day on which it was held.  I will make the Opposition a present of this and say that the incidence of a by-election during a Dáil session has a decelerating effect on business.  The reason for this is clear.  Our system of by-elections, whereby they can be held at any time of the year and regardless of whether the Dáil is in session, means that there is pressure on Deputies and workers on all sides to get away to the constituency concerned and to stay there.  I need hardly spell this out for the two warriors sitting opposite me because they have been here for longer than I but one learns fast. In the event of a by-election the Government are obliged, in as far as possible, to avoid issues of a contentious nature which might result in a vote. The fact that Deputy Dowling is scribbling away suggests to me that he is man enough to take that point and recognise the veracity of it and that he will not make hay of it as soon as I sit down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The record of by-elections during the past few years will show that the last Government introduced Estimate after Estimate or Second Stages of Bills which they then held over.  Knowing that this criticism of us to which I refer was circulating, the newspapers picked it up and had some untrue articles in the papers with such headings as &ldquo;Taoiseach very worried about state of business&rdquo;; &ldquo;Cosgrave raps...&rdquo; this or that Minister.  What is true is that the business here decelerated during the by-election but I am sorry to say that that is part of the system. I am not endeavouring to make a partisan speech.  I would hope that we would look clearly at this situation.  It is a separate question and one on which I have a very open mind.  If there was any co-operation from the other side in relation to it I would be willing to approach it in an open way. On reading this newspaper criticism of us I checked on what had occurred during the 19th Dáil when Fianna Fáil were in control and I found that six by-elections were held during that period&mdash;one in Dublin South-West and one each in Kildare and Longford-Westmeath, which were held simultaneously, one in Donegal and one in South County Dublin, which were held simultaneously also, and another in Mid-Cork.  Of these six one of the pairs&mdash;the Longford-Westmeath and the Kildare by-elections &mdash;were held while the Dáil was in recess.  The same applied to the Mid-Cork one and in both cases I understand that the writ was moved on the last day of the Dáil session.  The others were fought at times when the Dáil was in session.  I recall the County Donegal one as being very trying in that the weather conditions were extremely bad and, also, of course, we lost it.  The periods of those by-elections were ones in which there was only one vote taken in the Dáil and this was at the conclusion of the then Government's Prices and Incomes Bill which was challenged by the Labour Party.  That <Col N="1927" /> happened at about the beginning of December, 1970.  The Government had to bring back every single one of their available Deputies to fight off that vote.  The result of the vote was 70 to 41.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government had 75 Deputies.  There were probably a few who were laid up or who had to hold the fort.  They had to bring back every one of the Deputies from Donegal, as well as those from South County Dublin.  That must have been a major nuisance.  It must have been reckoned to give the Opposition a better chance.  That was the only bit of contentious business in the entire period of these two by-elections.  That is the way it is always done.  If suggestions were forthcoming from the other side as to how that could be avoided I should be glad to have them.</P>
      <P>The system here whereby by-elections can take place as soon as they are called ought, perhaps to be amended.  I know there is the argument that a constituency cannot be left without representation.  It is said that a three or four-seat constituency cannot be left short of one of its Deputies, particularly a three-seat constituency.  Weighed against the deceleration in Dáil business I wonder whether this system is a good one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two things could be done.  We could have legislation which would qualify the constitutional references to by-elections in such a way that they would not be held while the Dáil was in session or within three weeks of the Dáil going into recess, or we could have an understanding between the parties that by-elections would be conducted by the people on the ground and other party members would keep away from them.  The latter suggestion is a rather unrealistic one.  The people who would be inclined to cheat would be the Opposition.  I am not speaking of the present Opposition but of any Opposition. They would be the ones who <Col N="1928" /> would be inclined to slip away to help a man by addressing a meeting. If there was a vote they would be the ones to be beaten anyway and it would only be a question of being down by three, four, five or six votes. It might not be easy to arrange for a truce.</P>

      <P>I accept the criticism that it seems unrealistic and that it might be hard to work.  If Deputy Crowley has a suggestion I will give way to him.  I am trying to be constructive. I see a real difficulty here in that the important business of the Estimates, which have to be discussed, has been discussed but other business which might be more important has been left behind in the queue.

      <P>Once the by-election was called there was non-stop bleating. There were non-stop complaints about the way the House was going. I received complaints over the telephone and in letters and in the House and from my opposite number&mdash;with a smile because he knew how much they were worth&mdash;to get some real business on.  Deputy Crowley knows that is the case.  He knows that is what we have to put up with.  He cannot have it both ways.  Either we have a realistic system of by-elections or we reconcile ourselves to the Dáil slowing down and not doing any serious business when a by-election is on.</P>

      <P>This session has been on for eight or nine weeks.  You can juggle this as you like.  According to the Opposition&mdash;and I will not quibble about it&mdash;we spent three of the eight or nine weeks doing work which was certainly important&mdash;I am not in any way trying to suggest that it was not important&mdash;but which would not have mattered an awful lot if it had not been done.</P>

      <P>No, it does not.  But let us not then have complaints from the other side about the work of the House not being proceeded with.  Once the by-election started the complaints came in thick and fast that we were putting in Estimate after Estimate. I accept that the business was ordered somewhat in that way.  In doing that, we were merely following the pattern laid down by previous Governments for the reason, as Deputy Crowley knows well, that if the Government are going to have their Deputies at the by-election the work of this House decelerates.  For some reason which is traditional, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach seems to have some responsibility for the way the House operates in the short term as well as in the long term.  I do not like to see time being spent on unnecessary debate.  It is all very well for Deputy Crowley to say that a debate is important and that a certain subject must get a full debate. It is also true that I have not been here very long but I have been here long enough to know the difference between genuine debate and wasting time.  While there may be times when the Government are put in the position where they have to protract a debate beyond a certain hour&mdash;and I hope the Press or the public listening to this are not going to make a meal out of it because I am only saying what everybody knows or will discover if he takes the trouble to inquire&mdash;this seems to have been the practice over the years.  A Government may find it convenient to protract business beyond a certain hour.</P>
      <P>I remember last July there was great pressure to get the work of the House finished.  There was much contentious business particularly the Budget and the Finance Bill.  The Second Stage of the Finance Bill was basically merely an introduction to the detailed taxation provisions and other provisions which the Bill contained.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 14th December, 1973.</P>
