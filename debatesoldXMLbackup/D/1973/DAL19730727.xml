    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 52 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a section which gives substantial relief from estate duty and, as I have mentioned, the reliefs given in this year's budget are greater than have ever been given before in the history of the State.  The position is that all estates under £10,000 will in future be exempt from duty.  Raising the general limit to £10,000 will of itself, without the considerable other benefits in the budget, relieve 530 cases from liability to estate duty in a year.  Considering that the number of cases liable to estate duty is around 3,000 it will be seen that this one relief alone is quite significant.  The cost in a full year is £330,000 and £160,000 in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The combined effects of the new exemption limit, the increased abatements and the higher limit for artificial valuation will be that approximately 1,300 cases per annum of deaths occurring after the 16th May will be dutiable but the balance which were previously dutiable will not now be dutiable.  This is a very clear indication of the Government's anxiety to move towards the situation to which they are committed and that is one of replacing estate duty with another form of duty.  I should like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that every responsible organisation accepts that estate duty cannot be <Col N="2373" /> wiped out instantly unless, at the time you do it, you provide an alternative form of taxation of wealth.</P>
    <P>I might instance Mr. T.J. Maher who, in a letter which he had published in the papers last Monday and which he had previously sent to the Taoiseach, said that it was agreed by his organisation that estate duty could not be abolished without an alternative method being introduced which would have the affect of preventing speculation in agricultural land.  He said that they accepted the situation now as they accepted it before.</P>
    <P>It is important that that should be underlined because there have been a number of statements, inside and outside of this House, suggesting that there was a commitment to the outright abolition of estate duty without any provision being made for an alternative form of tax.  The commitment we made was one to give relief in cases of hardship as quickly as possible and to replace the system of estate duty with an alternative form of tax which would enable a taxpayer to pay the tax by instalments over a working lifetime in place of the present system which requires his next-of-kin at the time of greatest family tragedy to pay it in a lump sum when the principal breadwinner is no longer available.</P>
    <P>Accepting our responsibility to replace estate duty we are at present engaged upon the most intensive research that has ever been conducted in this country into the whole question of capital accumulation and distribution. We are sorry to say that the statistical information which we would have expected a Government to have available is not available because the previous Government made no studies in this field.  Notwithstanding that, we are going to keep to our undertaking to have a White Paper on this subject available before the end of the year.  We will then be in a position to fulfil the requests which were made to us to have consultations with all people who may be concerned, and they cover a wide spectrum of society, not only farmers but people in urban areas and in industry <Col N="2374" /> and commerce, and people who are expert in financial and taxation matters.</P>
    <P>It is our anxiety to have these discussions expedited.  It is our hope that when our proposals in the White Paper are published there will be a substantial amount of agreement that we have achieved a fair system to replace estate duty and, if and when that happy event occurs, we will be in a position to remove the iniquitous forms of estate duty which have been accepted all round as causing hardship at a time of greatest personal tragedy.</P>
    <P>In the meantime we have given the greatest relief ever given in estate duty.  This is going to provide relief for the majority of people who at present may be liable for estate duty.  We consider that that is a very significant and important advancement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we proceed too far into this matter there is one point on which I should like clarification. The Minister has said, and he said something similar on previous occasions, that the statistics which the Government required were not available. By implication, if not expressly, he said that it was because of the failure of the previous Government to ensure that such would be available. The Minister also said that notwithstanding this it was intended to go ahead and produce a White Paper on this matter before the end of the year. I should like the Minister to explain if it is proposed to produce a White Paper without what he considers to be the necessary statistics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We will issue the White Paper based on the best available information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we take it, therefore, that either the statistics which the Minister has said were required were not essential or, alternatively, the White Paper which it is proposed to issue will be issued without the essential statistics on which it should be based?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The kind of problem we have to face is this, as the <Col N="2375" /> Deputy probably knows, that estate duty is a system which makes it possible for wealthy people to avoid payment of duty, or a substantial portion of duty, by distributing their estate more than five years prior to death. Because of the systems of transfer and the calculation of wealth in the country there is no record available as to the extent of these distributions.  However, it is quite obvious that extremely wealthy people can afford to distribute a large portion of their estate and, at the same time, retain sufficient to give themselves, in the autumn of their years, quite a good standard of living and ample security.</P>
      <P>Somebody with assets worth £1 million could afford to distribute £950,000 and keep £50,000 for himself. We have no concrete evidence as to the extent of transfers of property in that way.  As the Deputy is aware, a number of studies which have been made indicate that the amount of wealth in the country far exceeds what was captured by way of estate duty because the really wealthy were able to distribute their property well in advance of being caught in the estate duty net.</P>
      <P>This is one of the reasons why we are publishing a White Paper because the inevitable reaction, I think, to a White Paper will be that the people affected by the proposals will then come forward to indicate the extent to which they are affected.  It is a pity that we have not got more information of this kind because, if we had, it would be possible to move more expeditiously along the road which we consider most people expect us to move along, the road to a system of taxation which would not make it possible for people to avoid making their proper contribution to the taxes which society requires them to pay, and along the road which would ensure a fairer distribution of property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the revenue aspect of estate duty I think it is agreed, in principle, that one of the purposes of estate duty is to stop the accumulation of too much wealth in too few hands. In fact, estate duty, in recent times has been operating to such an extent <Col N="2376" /> that it has encouraged property to transfer in advance of death, not into many hands but into a few hands.  As long as people can reasonably anticipate the likely date of demise &mdash; and we all know that there is no certainty about that and that many a person has not been wise enough to make transfers of property sufficiently ahead of death &mdash; accepting all these possibilities of error, there is within the present system ample opportunity to avoid paying a capital taxation which, of course, is what estate duty really is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to this section.  However, there are many things in what the Minister has said in moving this section that we, on this side of the House, query and are in disagreement with.  The Minister spoke at some length on this section, even though it is not a controversial section.  Presumably the reason he did so was because of the controversies in which he got himself involved in relation to the promises that were made before the last election by the group who now form the Government.</P>
      <P>These are promises which in the opinion of a great many people who were influenced by them, the present Government have failed to fulfil.  It was my experience, as a candidate in the last election, and it was the experience of many other Fianna Fáil candidates, successful and unsuccessful, that the statements made by speakers on behalf of the Coalition before the last election in relation to death duties had a bearing on that election and on the result of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to quantify the precise number of votes influenced by these statements but unquestionably some votes were influenced and, remembering the very narrow outcome of the election eventually, it may not be going too far to say that this very point in fact caused a change of Government.  Having caused a change of Government, those who were influenced to support Coalition candidates in the election as a result of the statements made and commitments entered into in advance, naturally felt let down, to say the least of it, when the proposals of the Minister for <Col N="2377" /> Finance and the Government in relation to death duties were disclosed in the budget.</P>
    <P>Contradictory statements were made by the Minister for Finance and the head of one of the farming organisations.  The Minister here this morning quoted a small selected passage from a letter which Mr. Maher sent to the Minister asking him to withdraw certain statements he had made and pointing out that, if that withdrawal were not forthcoming, the letter would have to be published. The letter was published some weeks afterwards when no retraction had been made by the Minister for Finance and the letter, of course, contained a great deal more than the small selected passage the Minister quoted.  I have not got the letter with me and I cannot, therefore, read it all, but I think it would be a worthwhile exercise to contrast what was said in the letter and the whole point of the letter &mdash; it was one of considerable annoyance at the attitude and statements of the Minister for Finance &mdash; with the little selected passage the Minister read to the House this morning.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest and as much attention as I could command to the Minister's comparatively lengthy statement on this non-controversial section.  One of the things I noticed was that the Minister kept talking about estate duty and the great reliefs being given in that duty. It is very significant that he never once referred to death duties and there seems to me to be an implication in that, the implication being that he and the Government will seek to reduce estate duty but will not seek to reduce death duties overall. That would seem to be borne out by section 54, which not just increases but doubles the rates of succession and legacy duties.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out before, the Minister keeps away from these.  There are three elements in death duties &mdash; estate duty, succession duty and legacy duty &mdash; and it matters little to someone called on to pay death duties which of the three he is paying if a substantial amount of money is being taken from him and <Col N="2378" /> paid into the Exchequer.  It does not sugar the pill to say to that man that he is not paying estate duty, that he is paying succession duty or legacy duty. They are all death duties.  We have the extraordinary situation then in this Bill that, after the promises, statements and commitments made by the Minister for Finance, in relation to death duties generally, there is actually a doubling of the rate of duty in two of the three elements in estate duty.  The Minister gave figures in relation to estate duty and, quite frankly, I am doubtful if they can be correct.  He quoted a figure of 3,000 cases in which estate duty is payable this year; he said estate duty, but he may have meant death duties. The estimated yield this year is the same as the actual yield last year, which was approximately £12 million, or very slightly under that.  I find it difficult to do sums in my head when I am on my feet but, dividing 3,000 into £12 million, would seem to show that the average amount of estate duty payable must be truly enormous in each of these cases.  My own personal experience is that these vast sums of duty, which the Minister would seem to imply are payable on average, do not represent the real picture at all. Regularly one pays quite small sums of estate duty, perhaps £50 or £100. Regularly there are old cases in which one has to take out grants to old estates and there is a fixed duty of £3 or £5, as the case may be.  The Minister's figures can scarcely be correct.  If they are correct they would seem to indicate an average payment of duty of something in the region of £4,000 in each case.  I doubt that the average payment is anything remotely approaching that figure.</P>
    <P>Having spoken a great deal about estate duty &mdash; the fact that it was not a satisfactory tax; that the really wealthy were able to avoid it by making distributions of their wealth in sufficient time before death &mdash; he went on to say that, in order to get at the really wealthy and prevent them getting rid of their capital by distributing it among their children or their relatives in sufficient time before death, some new form of taxation would be introduced after the promised White Paper and this new <Col N="2379" /> form of taxation would get at that wealth; and, in view of the fact, he stated, that estate duty was not bringing in sufficient revenue from accumulations of capital, this new tax would presumably bring in considerably more.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to discuss any alternative system of taxation until one sees it spelt out but, at this very early stage and long before we see the White Paper, I want to sound a note of caution in relation to these sorts of proposals because the economic damage which could be done to the whole financial structure by such proposals could be enormous. One cannot, admittedly, criticise these in advance when one has not got the details, but we had spelled out to us this morning by the Minister the outlines at least of some sort of plan which has not yet been developed. All I can say is that it sounds potentially a very dangerous sort of operation. I and my party have no objection to the wealthy being taxed and to accumulations of capital being cut down.  The way in which this has been done in most countries up to now has been by a tax on the capital that exists at the time of the person's death.  In the context of this country, with a free flow of capital between here and Britain, this proposal could cause a considerable outflow of capital funds in order to avoid taxation of that kind.</P>
    <P>The Minister was critical this morning of the fact that people distribute their estates or their capital, in whatever form it might be, in good time before they die.  He said that because they do that they do not pay as much estate duty as they should pay.  The Minister has completely lost sight of the very desirable social factor involved here.  We had a tradition up to comparatively recently that people held on to their assets, to their capital in whatever form it was, right up to the day they died.</P>
    <P>The most important single asset we have is land.  It is a form of wealth, if you want to use that phrase &mdash; it is not a very appropriate phrase in the <Col N="2380" /> case of land &mdash; because land is very much a capital asset.  Up to comparatively recently, perhaps in the past five or ten years, land has always been held onto with an extraordinary tenacity by the people who owned it, notwithstanding the fact that they had families who were not just grown up, but often advanced far into middle age and more than capable of taking over the running of a farm and running it more efficiently and more productively than the rather aged father would run it.</P>
    <P>It is only in recent years that we have seen the beginning of a willingness to make those transfers to the children in due time which are a feature of the social structure of other countries but unhappily have never been a feature of our social structure.  The Minister is treading on potentially dangerous ground in the form of the alternative taxation he is talking about here.  The statements which he made exclusively about estate duty today need to be clarified. We should know whether the Minister's proposals relate only to the replacement of estate duty as such, or whether they relate to the replacement of death duties generally.</P>
    <P>The constant references this morning by the Minister to estate duty could be very significant.  This may have been a slip of the tongue but, in view of the provisions of section 54, I rather think it was not a slip of the tongue but a deliberate reference.</P>
    <P>We have no objection as such to the section under discussion but the Minister has opened up a very large field of discussion in relation to this alternative taxation he is proposing.  I do not think this is the time to debate it in detail.  In any event, we cannot debate it in detail, not having details of it.  I should like to hear from the Minister in relation to the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a farmer I have to come in on this debate.  I do not like farming organisations to be made political footballs.  I was a founder member of the NFA which is now the IFA.  I was vice-president for some years.  It is a strictly non-political <Col N="2381" /> organisation.  Before the election people tried to use that organisation. I agree with much of what Deputy O'Malley has said.</P>
      <P>Death duty is a terrible burden on farmers owing to the increase in the value of land during the past few years.  The Minister's people down the country said from every platform that, immediately they got into office, they would abolish it.  They did not say they would consider abolishing it or reducing it, but that they would abolish it completely.  This meant a lot to the farmers.  I believe, with Deputy O'Malley, that our party lost a certain number of votes on this whole question.</P>
      <P>This goes to show the irresponsible statements you can make when you have no responsibility.  When I was a member of rural organisations I noticed that people who were conscientious objectors at meetings became responsible immediately they were given office.  It is only fair that it should go on the records of this House that that statement was made by all the then Opposition speakers.  I do not know what authority they had to make it, but it was made at every parish pump and outside every chapel gate. Anybody who studies the result of the election can see that, whatever votes were lost by this party, were lost in the country.  Estate duty played a major part in the loss of a certain number of votes.</P>
      <P>This is where the farmers showed intelligence.  Anybody with common sense knows that you cannot abolish estate duty overnight.  I agree with the Minister, and Mr. Maher agrees with the Minister, but people said it could be done.  We knew it could not be done and we convinced the vast majority of the farmers that it could not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a farmer and as a man who was in this organisation, I could not let this occasion go without saying that it is a terrible thing to make a political football out of a farming organisation and to try to use it to get votes.  I have been associated with voluntary organisations and I always left my politics outside the door.  I object to anybody using a voluntary organisation for political purposes.  I welcome all that has been <Col N="2382" /> done in this Bill but any intelligent person knows that you cannot abolish estate duty overnight.  I would love to see it abolished because it is a burden on the farmers.  It needs study and, therefore, it is a long-term policy.  If those people had said that they would set up a study group to investigate the possibility of replacing estate duty by some other form of taxation they would have been justified, but they said they would abolish it after the election.  That is the promise they made.  It is only right to set the record straight.</P>

Taking the last six years this shows that the figures vary between 2,600, 2,900, 3,200, 2,500, and so on.  The average number of estate duty cases is in or about 3,000 per annum.  I am not at all diminishing the importance of giving relief and of replacing the estate duty system, but it would be wrong to exaggerate it because that, in fact, is the extent of liability for estate duty under the existing code.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are amending it radically so that the numbers for next year and future years, even if we retained the system with the amendment &mdash; which we do not propose to do &mdash; would still be substantially reduced.  That is why we are justified in saying we have made a most remarkable change in the whole incidence of estate duty. It is also wrong to take an average such as Deputy O'Malley did because, simply by dividing 3,000 into £12 million you may get an average figure, but it is no indication of the typical family case.  Even with figures like £12 million there are on many occasions estates varying in estate duty liability &mdash; in other words, the amount they contribute in estate duty &mdash; from £1 million to £3 million.  Obviously to suggest that the average amount paid is £4,000 is illusory and misleading. The vast majority are in the lower scales such as the scales to which we have given relief this year.  The amounts of relief which we have given are quite substantial.  We would <Col N="2383" /> like them to be more.  I suppose it could also be said that they are small but even if they are small this has relieved many people who previously would have had to pay.</P>

      <P>It is disappointing that the Minister confines his reply simply to reading out a few statistics from a volume published by the Revenue Commissioners.  There are much more important matters at issue than the precise number of cases in which estate duty is paid or payable in a particular year.  The Minister very gingerly kept away&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I questioned a lot more than the Minister's figures.  I questioned the whole principle of what he has been talking about.  The Minister, perhaps wisely from his own point of view, gingerly sidestepped the whole issue of this capital tax which he proposes to impose instead of estate duty.  I cannot criticise this tax precisely because I have not got the details of it and presumably the Minister has not got the details of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister answered some of what I said earlier <Col N="2384" /> there might be less mischief because I could then be told not to speculate but we have to think of what is a capital tax.  There is one form of capital tax, death duties, which you pay on the capital that is there at death or that was transferred within five years beforehand.  What the Minister is proposing is a tax on capital at any given time, on the capital of a young man who is in business or who is a farmer.  The capital of a farmer is, for the most part, his land. It also includes his cattle or other stock and any money he might have in the bank.  He has, at any given time, a particular figure of assets. What the Minister is proposing is that such a man will pay some form of taxation on those assets, that is on his land or on his cattle, each year and that no taxation will be payable on those assets after the man dies. Until we have the details of that taxation, the proposed new taxation which the Coalition Government are going to impose, we cannot discuss it in any detail but we should be clear in our minds as to what this new form of capital tax is going to mean.  It will mean that a farmer or a businessman will pay something into the Exchequer annually on his land, his business, his shop or factory, and that he will have to pay that not just once but presumably annually.  I am sure there are many people in the country who would like to think about it and about the implications of it even in advance of the White Paper.</P>
      <P>When I was speaking earlier I did not have the letter which Mr. Maher was forced to publish.  I think it was his own wish that it would not have to be published but he was forced, by the refusal of the Minister for Finance to apologise and to withdraw his statements, to publish it.  The Minister this morning quoted a very small selected passage.  There were other passages, including the much more important bit just before the little piece that was quoted, which might well have been quoted also.  I quote from the letter published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of July 23rd, 1973. Mr. Maher wrote:</P>
      <P>This statement,&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2385" /> that is the statement of the Minister for Finance</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;if quoted correctly, contains very serious allegations against, and cast reflections on my integrity and that of my Association.</P>
    <P>In my letter to An Taoiseach I drew his attention to the pre-Election promise of the Coalition Government to abolish Estate Duty.  I went on to say: &ldquo;There is dismay among the farming community that this promise has so far not been honoured and while we have been promised a &lsquo;White Paper&rsquo; in taxation, there is no indication as to when it will be published or when Estate Duty will be removed.  These commitments solemnly given by the Coalition Parties before the (General) Election clearly influenced the outcome of same.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later in the letter he said:</P>
    <P>I want to state quite emphatically that I was not misled or pressurised by any individual or group of individuals into writing this letter to the Taoiseach and subsequently releasing it to the newspapers.  Furthermore, I fail to understand how you could state in Dáil Éireann that I seriously regretted making this statement.</P>
    <P>Those are some passages from Mr. Maher's letter to the Minister which are more indicative of the tone of Mr. Maher's letter and the disappointment and resentment caused to Mr. Maher and the organisation of which he is president and the farmers which that organisation represents; much more indicative of the tone of their feelings, than the selective little piece which we had from the Minister this morning.</P>

      <P>I accept your ruling, Sir, but you will recall that the gentleman in question was first named and quoted by the Minister and I felt I <Col N="2386" /> would be entitled to put the record right with regard to the statements that were made by the gentleman concerned.  I wish to attribute neither praise nor blame to him but simply to place on the record of the House what, in fact, he said.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke this morning, as he spoke on the budget and on the Second Stage of this Bill, of what he called substantial reliefs in death duty.  Again this morning he referred to them as the greatest reliefs ever and he told us that the saving in this financial year to the taxpayer on estate duty was £160,000 and £300,000 in a full year.  That is if I heard him correctly.  If I did not he will, no doubt, correct me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only in respect of this relief but the Deputy is aware that there are several reliefs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am so aware but I am aware also that there is a heavy additional imposition of death duty taxation in section 54 and as I stated during the budget debate and, I think, also when I spoke on the Second Reading of this Bill, the net saving to the taxpayer in death duties this year, on the basis of a percentage of the estimated yield is 5¼ per cent to describe that figure as a substantial relief is illusory and misleading, to say the least.  It is very far from being a substantial relief because the minor relief which is given in this section, that of raising the bottom figure from £7,500 to £10,000, is more than covered by the rate of inflation which is current at present in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional abatements which are given are more than covered by the increase in the value of land in the 12 months since the last rebate. When I spoke on the budget I made the prophecy that, notwithstanding the very minor reliefs proposed here in relation to death duties, because of inflation and because of the increase in the value of property, the amount of death duties which would be collected by the Exchequer in this financial year will not be less than the amount collected last year.  Because this is a somewhat tricky field and because many people find it difficult <Col N="2387" /> to understand the various distinctions in the different types of death duties, they may be misled by the rash statement of the Minister that he was giving substantial relief. He has given scarcely any relief and he has done this within a few months of a solid commitment made before the general election, a commitment which had at least some influence on the outcome of that election.  No wonder the farmers and others would be annoyed.  They have been misled. They were misled before the election and if they were to take the words of the Minister today at face value, they would be misled further.</P>

Maher has been read, a letter which was published in the newspapers on the 23rd July, I consider it only fair that the House should be made aware that at the time that letter was published, Mr. Maher had already received from me a letter dated the 17th July which he did not deign to publish.  In order that the House and the public may measure the good faith of the person who published one letter but who did not publish the reply I would like to read the reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  It may well be that people will think he was right not to publish the reply.  I will let people judge that.  This is the letter:</P>
      <P>Dear Mr. Maher,</P>
      <P>I refer to your letter of 20th ult.</P>
      <P>I delayed replying to your letter in order that I could check on the veracity of a report I had received that an employee of your Association boasted that an IFA statement some days prior to the Presidential election would be &ldquo;a time bomb to stop Tom O'Higgins getting into the Park&rdquo;.  I am satisfied that the account related to me is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is doubt as to whether the <Col N="2388" /> date of delivery of your letter to the Taoiseach's Office was Thursday, May 24th, or Friday, May 25th.  He personally did not see the letter until Monday, May 28th.  As you say so, I accept that you were not consciously involved in plotting the publication of a statement to cause political embarrassment to the National Coalition Presidential candidate.  I nevertheless consider that your Association has an obligation, not alone to consider the contents of any statement, but also whether the particular time of its publication is opportune.</P>
    <P>I note that in your letter to me you state&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That at pre-election meetings with the Coalition group and in our pre-budget discussions with you it was agreed that estate duty could not be abolished without an alternative method being introduced which would have the effect of preventing speculation in agricultural land.  We accept now, as we did then, this situation.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I note that in your letter of 24th May last to the Taoiseach and in the statement released to the press no reference whatsoever was made to the need to simultaneously replace estate duty with an alternative form of taxation.  I feel that on reflection you may be prepared to agree that your omission was unfortunate.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept that the very substantial reliefs in estate duty in the budget &ldquo;will do little to alleviate the burden of estate duty on family farm holdings&rdquo;.  As much as 25 per cent of the people formerly liable to estate duty have been relieved by the reliefs granted in this budget which were the greatest ever given.  A larger percentage of farmers' estates have been relieved.</P>
    <P>We are working on the preparation of a scheme of capital taxation to replace estate duty and the result of our labours will be published as soon as possible in a White Paper. In accordance with the promise which I gave to you in the pre-budget meeting I will be only too <Col N="2389" /> happy to discuss our proposals with the farmers' representatives.  The speed with which estate duty can be replaced will, as I mentioned in the budget, depend upon the co-operation which we receive from interested organisations such as yours.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Richie Ryan.</P>
    <P>That balances the exchange of views between Mr. Maher and myself.  I will leave it to the public to adjudicate on the relative value of the two points of view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that the Minister has called in question the said Mr. Maher, I will stay out of the matter from here on because Mr. Maher is not here to defend himself against what the Minister has said and implied in relation to him.  I do not wish to become involved on one side or the other in this dispute between Mr. Maher and the Minister but I would like to bring the Minister back to a question which is very pertinent and which I have put to him twice already in the course of discussion on this section, that is, is he referring deliberately to estate duty only?  Why does he refer constantly to that and not to death duty?</P>
      <P>I notice that in the letter he quoted he said specifically his hope was that, ultimately, estate duty would be abolished or phased out.  I wish to draw the attention of the House to this matter as it is of considerable significance.</P>
      <P>Apparently, at this very late stage the Minister is beginning to busy himself in regard to phasing out or, ultimately getting rid of, estate duty.  It appears now that he has no intention of getting rid of legacy or succession duty.  My surmise that this is so is confirmed by the provisions of section 54 of this Bill because if one is proposing to phase out something or to get rid of it gradually, one does not double it and that is what the Minister has done.  We seem to be facing the situation now where the Minister will phase out estate duty and phase in this capital wealth tax that will be payable each year by the living and will retain succession and legacy duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rates proposed in section 54 for succession and legacy duties are twice <Col N="2390" /> what they have been since they were fixed last, which, I think, was in 1909. They have been at 5 per cent and 10 per cent for a very long time.  The Minister has reiterated again that he is interested only in getting rid of estate duty.  He now proposes by implication &mdash;I have put this to him twice and he has not denied it&mdash;to retain succession and legacy duties and to retain them at twice the rates they have been up to now.</P>
    <P>In other words, we are to retain two of the three elements in death duties and at the same time we are to have a capital wealth tax payable, presumably annually, by people engaged in business or in farming or whatever.  If the Minister does not wish to say that I misread his statements, I can safely assume that what I have said now is correct and is the intention of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just would say that we are at the moment discussing estate duty and the Deputy will not mind my saying that he has made some statements recently which have given some doubt as to the value of his comments. I will leave it to people to decide when they see the White Paper what our proposals are.  I do not think he will be helped by being unnecessarily mischievous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay discussion of this matter but I do think that the point raised by Deputy O'Malley is of considerable importance and is not met by the comment we have just heard from the Minister.  The fact is that the Minister said in the House this morning, and, again, in the letter to Mr. Maher which he quoted he said the same thing, that his aim and the Government's aim was to abolish estate duty, not death duty but estate duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley asked twice, before the Minister read out that letter, whether the Minister said this intentionally or whether it was a slip of the tongue.  The quotation by the Minister from the letter to Mr. Maher seemed to indicate that it was not a slip of the tongue.  It was still open to the Minister to clarify the position. You saw, Sir, when given that opportunity, <Col N="2391" /> the way he availed of it was simply to be evasive.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>People have a view of the Minister also.  What is more relevant to the discussion is whether it is the intention of the Government to abolish death duties and replace them by an alternative system of an annual tax on wealth.  Most people were under the impression that this is what the Government were saying but Deputy O'Malley has highlighted the fact that that is not what the Minister is saying and in talking on this section he did introduce the question of the Government's intentions ultimately in this regard.</P>
      <P>I do think that it is reasonable of us to press the Minister to say specifically whether it is intended to try to replace estate duty only or to replace death duties entirely.  If it is the former, then it would appear that what we are faced with is that the Government propose to retain death duties and to bring in a form of annual tax on wealth.  It is true that since we do not have a White Paper yet it is not possible to discuss the matter in detail.  We do, however, have on the record certain thoughts on this matter put forward prior to the election by the present Minister for Foreign Affairs who said that what was intended was to apply a tax, probably at the rate of 10 per cent annually, on people's wealth above a certain limit and to carry out twice-yearly surveys to assess people's wealth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think many people have grasped the implications of that proposal. Clearly, in order to establish whether somebody is above or below <Col N="2392" /> the fixed limit one has to examine the wealth of everybody.  That would imply that everybody in the country will have the state of his wealth examined by or on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners at twice-yearly intervals and a person will have to pay a tax on approximately 10 per cent of his wealth if he comes above a certain figure and will at the same time be liable for two of the three elements of death duties which have always existed, as Deputy O'Malley has pointed out.  We are not trying to be mischievous when we say this.  This is what emerges from what the Minister has said and in particular from the letter which he quoted to the House.  If, in fact, this is not true the time to correct it is now and the Minister has an opportunity to do so now. We are giving him the opportunity and inviting him to clear up this matter if he wishes to do so.  If, however, he does not, then he cannot claim that it is mischievous on our part if the idea becomes prevalent that what the Government propose to do is to retain death duties as to two of its three existing elements and, in addition, to have an annual wealth tax payable, probably at the rate of 10 per cent, above a certain limit and, in the process, to have an examination and assessment of the wealth of everybody in the country at twice-yearly intervals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have nothing to add. The record speaks for itself.  The record said&mdash;this is the 14 point programme &mdash;that with a view to relieving the heavy and unjust burden on ordinary house purchasers and farmers the National Coalition Government will replace estate duty on property passing on death to women and children with taxation confined to the really wealthy and to property passing on death outside the immediate family.  That is our commitment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>The point that Deputy Colley and I were endeavouring to make in our amendment was that the marginal relief which is given in section 53 in relation to legacy and succession duty should also, of course, include the estate duty element and the proposal of the Minister, therefore, to insert after the word &ldquo;property&rdquo; in line 33 the words <Col N="2394" />&ldquo;after deduction of the amount of estate duty referable thereto&rdquo; seems to me to achieve the same effect, and possibly to do it more neatly or more clearly than my own amendment would have done.  It is very difficult to read this, because it is a rather long sentence with two amendments in it, but if this is so, we would be prepared to withdraw our amendment and agree to the Minister's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are <i>ad idem</i> for once.  As the Deputies know, estate duty is deducted before legacy and succession duty is assessed and must, in fact, be deducted, but I fear the effect of the amendment as drafted by the Deputies would lead to the situation of the snake eating its own tail, as it were.  The purpose of my amendment is to ensure that the value of the estate will not be reduced below £10,000 by the payment of death duties.  If an estate is valued at, say, £10,500, the estate duty at 4 per cent is £420, leaving a net estate after payment of estate duty of £10,080. Legacy duty on this figure would be £1,008 at the minimum rate of 10 per cent, ignoring, of course, the costs of administration which might alter these figures.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) of section 53 restricts the amount of legacy duty to £500, the amount by which the value of the estate exceeds £10,000.  If, however, £500 is deducted, the legatee will get £9,580, that is £10,080 less £500.  If the testator had left £10,000 the legatee would get £10,000.  He is worse off, therefore, by £420 than he would have been if the testator's estate had been valued at £10,000.  Therefore, the amendment ensures that the total duties will not reduce the net amount of an estate below £10,000.  I think that is the objective the Deputies had in mind.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the amendment, in relation to succession duty, is to cover successions which are conferred or arise after 16th May but where the death took place earlier.  Section 53 raises the limit of exemption for succession and legacy duty from £7,500 to £10,000.  It is expressed in subsection (4) to have effect only in relation to persons dying on or after 16th May, 1973.  That is all right as far as legacy duty is concerned, because the legacy duty would become payable on a death, whether testate or intestate, and payable as a direct result of the death and potentially at least payable as from the date of the death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Succession duty, as the Minister appreciates, is a different matter.  The succession has been conferred or can arise a substantial time after the death of a testator whose will creates that succession.  It would be unfair if a succession which only arises and arises for the first time on or after 16th May, 1973, did not have the benefit of the higher bottom limit for payment of duty.  It would be unfair, particularly when any question of payment of legacy duty would be covered but succession duty would not.  The sort of case I have in mind is where a testator died, say, well before 16th May, 1973, left his property to X, with the remainder to Y when Y attains 21.  Y attains 21 on, let us say, 20th May, 1973.  If the property comes within the category which is covered by the section, Y is caught for duty, is probably caught twice, because he is caught on the higher rate of duty and he has not got the <Col N="2396" /> benefit of non-liability for duty between £7,500 and £10,000.  This amendment is designed to obviate that situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, but the amendment cannot be accepted.  First of all, it is immaterial for the purposes of section 53 when the succession was conferred.  The section makes it clear that no matter when the succession was conferred, the claim for succession duty would be restricted.  A claim for succession duty is conferred when the settlement is executed.  The succession arises and the duty is payable when a beneficiary becomes entitled in possession on a death.  If the death is after May 16th, 1973, no legacy or succession duty is payable on the free estate where the value does not exceed £10,000.  No legacy or succession duty is payable if the value of the free estate plus the value of any property which is settled by the deceased does not exceed £10,000.  If the value of the free estate exceeds £10,000 the amount of the legacy or succession duty cannot exceed the amount by which the value of the estate exceeds £10,000.</P>
      <P>Subsection (3) excludes property settled otherwise than by the will of the deceased.  A claim for succession duty on such property would be independent of the value of the free estate of the deceased.  For example, A died in 1960; by his will he had settled land worth £10,000 on his widow B for life, with the remainder to his nephew C.  On B's death in July, 1973, there is a claim for succession duty at 5 per cent on the present value of the land.  B may have no free estate or may have free estate valued at £100,000.  B is the deceased for the purposes of section 53.  The succession of C was conferred in 1960 but C's succession arises only in July, 1973 on B's death.</P>

      <P>I am sorry for the long pause but the Deputies opposite will have shared similar problems in their daily professional lives.  There is not always an easy solution to problems.</P>
      <P>If a person died in 1962, at that time £5,000 was the level of estates below which no duty was payable&mdash;if at that time property was left to someone on a contingency which only now arises, no duty is payable, even if that property is now worth £20,000.  The matter which determines the liability arises on the date on which the benefit was conferred.  The benefit would have been conferred in 1962 and not now, so it does not matter what the value of the property is now.  If the estate was above the appropriate figure in 1962, the rate of duty which should now apply would be the lower rate of duty.  The rate of duty of 1962 would apply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have fairly clearly indicated that it was our policy to provide for the relief of the estate duty within the family and we considered that this is the appropriate thing to do.  Where property is passing to a stranger it is in many cases in the nature of a bonanza.  It is a gift.  In most cases there is no entitlement to it.  Payment of legacy or succession duty on a gift by a stranger is no more a hardship than payment of a very small proportion of the value of anything on getting something at a very small price.  A gift is a gift.  All that happens on the payment of legacy duty or succession duty is somewhat to diminish the value of the gift.  Nevertheless, what remains is still a gift, and a very substantial gift. We gave an undertaking to provide benefits within the immediate family. What we are doing in this Bill is not in any way a breach of what we have <Col N="2401" /> undertaken to do.  We consider it is perfectly legitimate to impose tax in this way.</P>
      <P>Let me mention that a very large number of countries impose taxation on gifts of all kinds, irrespective of whether they pass on death or otherwise? In some cases the rates of duty are even higher than what are proposed here.  It must be emphasised that these rates apply only to people outside the immediate family.  Taken together with the other reliefs in this budget in regard to estate duty and the artificial valuation on farms, we consider that no undue hardship is being created. The small amount of revenue which is accruing to the State is an indication that there is not real hardship.  It may be argued that the revenue is so small we should not bother about it.  I do not think that is the correct approach.  It is significant enough.  It has enabled us to give greater benefits to widows and dependent children.  That is the proper way to distribute it&mdash;to take the money from the stranger getting the gift, where there is no obligation to give the gift, and provide relief to the widow and dependent children who have been denied the benefit of the skill and work of a breadwinner.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This section proposes not just to increase the rate of two or three elements of the death duty, but proposes to double that.  It must be without precedent in any Finance Bill that the appropriate rate of death duty payable should be doubled at one stroke.</P>
      <P>We have had already this morning an indication that when the Minister for Finance and his colleagues before the last election were talking about the abolition of estate duty they were referring to estate duty only, and they were not referring, as the people of this country and particularly the farmers believed, to death duties.  We have already established this morning on a discussion on an earlier section that this Coalition Government propose to retain death duties and at the same time introduce a capital annual tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a fact that a significant proportion of the farms of this country are owned by bachelors or spinsters.  I do not know what the proportion is.  I <Col N="2402" /> would say it is not less than 25 per cent.  It is an unfortunate social fact, but it is a fact.  There are a certain number of childless married couples as well.  Many of those farms or estates which are liable for death duties, and where the owner dies on or after 16th May, 1973, will, in fact, have to bear considerably more death duties than before the budget.  In the limited sort of practice which I am able to engage in at the moment, I have come across one case of a death where the amount of death duty payable as a result of the budget on a death post-16th May, 1973, is going to be significantly higher than if the same man had died before this unfortunate budget was introduced.</P>
    <P>There are a great many cases in this country of farmers, landowners, leaving land to nephews and nieces, to brothers and people like that who are the most immediate members of the testators' families.  If a landowner does not make a will, if a bachelor does not make a will and if his brothers and sisters are dead, the property must go to his nephews and nieces.  They are the closest members of his family.  Now there is this savage new rate of taxation imposed.  There are many cases throughout the country, in every county who will suffer from this abnormally high percentage.  The Minister refers to nephews and nieces, who are the closest relatives that a testator might have, as strangers who deserve to be burdened in this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not.  Strangers are those who pay at the higher rate of 20 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Nephews and nieces are to pay 10 per cent.  In &ldquo;strangers&rdquo; the Minister technically is using the right word because the 1894 Act refers to strangers in blood, and first cousins may be referred to as strangers in blood.  If a bachelor dies without nieces or nephews and his closest relatives&mdash; this is a frequent occurrence in this country&mdash;first cousins or their children are regarded in the words of the Minister and of the Act as being strangers who will have to pay 20 per cent.  I hope this will be got home to people generally so that they will appreciate how totally and appallingly they have <Col N="2403" /> been misled by statements of the Minister for Finance before and since the general election because he announced in the most brazen way how he would give substantial reliefs in death duties.</P>

      <P>This is another section dealing with relief in estate duty given in this year's budget.  The cost of giving this immense concession in estate duty is another £800,000, added to the other concessions which I mentioned this morning.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put the statements of the Minister in perspective and to recall that in the budget statements one example which was given of the effect of the increased abatement was that a widow with four dependent children&mdash;not just four children, but four children under 18 in full-time education&mdash;would begin to pay estate duty on a net estate of £41,000 as opposed to a net estate at present of, I think, £34,000.  If I am wrong, perhaps, the Minister will give the figures, I am disregarding the hundreds and mentioning only round figures of £34,000 and £41,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I made previously which, of course, is equally valid now, is that the increased abatement of duty will be covered by the increase in the value of the land in the 12 months since the last abatement was fixed and that in real terms there will be very little benefit from this proposal. I am glad to welcome the abatement but it is not anything as significant, in an inflationary situation such as we have at the moment, as the Minister would suggest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley is quite wrong and, for the second time, he has produced figures out of his head which are inaccurate.  All that can be said today is that his figures, while as inaccurate as the previous ones, are somewhat more confusing.  The actual figures for a widow and four children I will now detail.  Prior to the reliefs given, a widow and four children would have relief on £33,330.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Now the figure is £46,200 so that the total relief earned by a widow is £12,867, or something in excess of one-third.  Whatever inflation has taken place it has not reached that level so that it is quite clear that we have given abatements here, together with other abatements in this year's budget, which are generous by any possible measure.  I recall, as I see Deputy Haughey is about to intervene, that Deputy Haughey was, perhaps, the only person on the Fianna Fáil side of the House who was gracious enough to acknowledge the extent of the reliefs which were given.  They are extensive, and I do not think that we are acting in a sensible way by trying to stimulate fears and anxieties amongst widows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped that the Minister would have taken some notes of a point I made earlier which was to the effect that he should have a look at the provisions where an orphan family is concerned.  By an orphan family I mean a family who have lost their mother and father at the same time.  I do not know whether there are any great difficulties in this but, unfortunately, this sort of situation can arise frequently enough these days, perhaps more often through a motor car accident than anything else.  It can happen that the husband and wife can be killed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that in that situation the dependent children are, perhaps, more in need of relief than a family where there is a widow.  Would the Minister consider granting to the eldest child in that sort of family the same <Col N="2407" /> abatement as would be granted to a widow where a widow remains?  Even if that was not technically possible, perhaps in the case where there are no surviving parents the abatement for each child could be brought up to equate with the sort of situation which would prevail if there was a surviving widow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have mentioned already to Deputy Haughey, I am very sympathetic to the problem which he illustrates because it does seem to me that where both parents are dead and there are orphaned children whatever property they have is divided amongst them, or probably held in trust until they attain their majority if the property is held intestate or divided equally amongst the children.  Where a person dies intestate the property has to be divided equally amongst the children, either because of that or because of the will.  Probably some next-of-kin or relatives have to look after the upbringing of the children.  Such relatives, while having some right to use the capital for the children's benefit, have, for estate duty purposes not got the benefit of whatever would have gone to a surviving spouse if a spouse had survived.</P>
      <P>I did take a look at this matter.  It did create a number of administrative problems and as we are proceeding, I hope without undue delay, to the abolition of estate duty for immediate families, we felt that for this year we should take the steps which we have taken, but not proceed to make any further amendment which might only, in the long run, generate more difficulties. It is a good point and one wonders why such a good point was not, long before now, translated into legislation. It was not and I am sorry that the time available this year, together with the administrative difficulties involved, did not allow me to do something about it. I would not like to say that we will be doing it in next year's Finance Bill because I hope that there will be no necessity to consider that relief in next year's Bill.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 56 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The problems in regard to estate duties, which, as Deputy O'Malley rightly pointed out this morning should be described as death duties, have centred very much on the farming community situation.  A great deal of the criticism of the present system arises from the fact that it bears very heavily on the farming communities. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that in recent times it has come to bear very heavily on the farming community because the difficulty has largely arisen from the escalation in land values, and also the spectacular increase in the value of livestock.</P>
      <P>These factors have combined to ensure that estate duty, or death duty, has become a problem for farmers Rather than making a sweeping commitment to abolish estate duty, or death duty, I would have thought that the better approach would be to look at the difficulties arising and try to see where hardships were arising, to deal with particular situations rather than to just say that because death duty is causing problems let us get rid of it.  I do not think that we should get rid of death duty entirely.  Rather, we should make sure that it falls equitably on the community as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that situation, while one naturally welcomes this proposal by the Minister in regard to the artificial valuation provisions to increase the figure from £2,000 to £3,000, would this not, perhaps, have provided a very useful method of bringing at least temporary alleviation to the farming community so far as death duty is concerned. I understand from practitioners that these provisions work quite satisfactorily where they apply and that they can be quite readily administered. It is a very valuable little provision in <Col N="2409" /> the type of case which comes under its ambit and I wonder why, when the Minister was doing anything in this area, he did not go further than just increasing it from £2,000 to £3,000.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give us some figures of what is involved here. I understand the £2,000 provision can operate to exempt estates of up to £150 PLV.  I am not sure if that is so and, perhaps, the Minister would confirm it or give us at least a typical illustration of what sort of farms or agricultural holdings would now come within the £3,000 provision.  I do not know whether these particular provisions result in any great loss of revenue but I doubt very much that they do.  The Minister might tell us, if he has not already done so, what is involved in this increase from £2,000 to £3,000 and he might give us an example of the typical sort of holding that will now be exempt.  When he is doing that, would he keep in mind the fact that the price of livestock and cattle today is very different from what it was when the £2,000 limit was fixed.  A man does not have to be a very strong farmer to have £9,000, £10,000, £11,000 or £12,000 worth of livestock.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad Deputy Haughey raised this question.  I had intended in my introductory remarks to deal with this, but Deputy Haughey got in first.  This agricultural assessment, which is an artificial one, is of immense benefit to farmers.  Out of every 67 farmers who die 43 avoid estate duty because of the artificial value at the old figure of £2,000 and it is expected that that figure will be increased by another 10 per cent at least so that, out of every 67 farmers who die, there will be 47 or 48 who will not pay estate duty, and this is taking into account current values of land and stock and the general economy of the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One aspect of the farming community at the moment, and it is a good one, is the fact that farmers are now borrowing a great deal of money for farm improvements and this means that in many cases this artificial value has become really significant because any liability is taken into account in <Col N="2410" /> assessing the artificial value.  I should like to correct something that Deputy O'Malley said on a previous occasion. He seemed to infer that the only liability that could be taken into account was the debt which was upon the land.  That is not so.  Every liability has to be taken into account in assessing the artificial value.  The estimated cost of this relief will be £100,000 this year and, in a full year, it may possibly be more.  It will certainly be £100,000.</P>
    <P>The increase we have given is obviously quite significant.  It will certainly compensate not alone for increases in the value of land but it will also confer a benefit on people who would not otherwise have enjoyed this relief.  The section increases from £2,000 to £3,000 the limit of the net value of an estate in which purely agricultural land may be valued on an artificial basis.  The Finance Act of 1894 provides that the value of property for estate duty purposes is the open market value but subsection 5 of section 7 of that Act contains a proviso to the effect that, in the case of purely agricultural land, the value of the land should not exceed 25 times the rateable value, less certain deductions.  In reply to Deputy Haughey, there is, in fact, no limit to the value of that property to which this artificial value may apply.  There is, of course, an upper limit when you have completed all your calculations and, if you are above that particular limit, then benefit is not conferred but, <i>ab initio,</i> there is no limit at all on the rateable value of the property.</P>
    <P>The scope of the proviso was restricted somewhat by the Finance Act of 1910; section 60 (1) of that Act repeals the proviso.  Section 61 (1) provides broadly that the proviso should continue to apply to purely agricultural land passing under the will or intestacy of the deceased in any case where, by using the artificial value, the net value of the estate did not exceed £1,000.  The £1,000 limit was increased by the Finance Act of 1969 and section 46 of the 1971 Finance Act provided that the artificial value should cease to apply and the market value as at date of death should be restored in the event of the sale of the lands outside the family within six years of death. <Col N="2411" /> One could give a number of actual examples but, for the reasons I have already given, it is not desirable to give details which might help people to identify those involved.  I will pick one case at random: a person died about five years ago; the artificial value of the lands, which contained 267 acres, resulted in the lands being valued at £200.15; the lands were sold on 13th April, 1970, two years after death, for £110,000.  In that case there was no duty payable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was sold two years later and from its location, somewhere in Ireland, I can say from my own knowledge that it would not have been in a development area and nobody could, with any reasonable degree of confidence, anticipate development of that kind.  Maybe &ldquo;there is gold in them thar hills&rdquo;, but I do not think that has been established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that is a case where there was obviously nothing in the estate except the land?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the land was an ordinary farm stocked in the ordinary way, and there were no significant debts on it, the situation could be <Col N="2412" /> different.  Nowdays, with cows making anything in the region of £200 each, and sometimes more, even a moderate amount of stock on a farm could mean that the value might exceed the £3,000 now proposed.  I am sure the Minister will agree with that.  When Deputy Haughey suggests that the provision is of less value, perhaps, than appears at first sight, I think he is quite right.</P>
      <P>My experience of working this artificial valuation is that it happens to suit the owner or the successor to the deceased owner of an unworked farm or an underworked farm, and a fully stocked farm does not benefit, because the value of the stock of itself usually is in excess of the amount involved, and the artificial valuation does not create any great benefit for that reason. It is only where there is considerable debts or considerable understocking that it seems to benefit farms of that kind.  It would in the normal way benefit very small farms with very low poor law valuation.  In my experience, and I have a fair amount of experience of working this section, there are considerable limitations on its value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, the farm that is worked efficiently benefits and the farm that is not worked at all gets away with it.  If you are efficient and have stocked your land you are caught, and if you do nothing with your farm you get away with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal of the stocking which is taking place is taking place on the strength of loans.  The immense increase in loans granted by the Agricultural Credit Corporation and by the Associated Banks, from the information available to us, is in respect of stocking.  In such cases where a man is working his land well, he is almost certain to get the benefit.  The increase we are giving will, we are quite satisfied, add at least 10 per cent to the number of people who will get the advantage.  No matter what private view Deputy O'Malley or anybody else may have, the facts speak for themselves. When you have a situation where 47 or 48 out of every 67 will get the benefit of this and not pay estate duty, it is quite significant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the point which Deputy <Col N="2413" /> Callanan makes that the inefficient can possibly get greater benefit but, in modern farming conditions, most efficient farmers have a liability to a bank, or the Agricultural Credit Corporation, or somebody else.  That liability is deducted.  It may be said by some that this is an encouragement to borrow, but I do not think people would borrow simply to avoid estate duty.  That would be a very risky and foolish way in which to borrow, particularly at the present-day rates of interest.  It is working to a very substantial extent.  We are providing this relief because we believe it will relieve a very large number of farmers.  It is interesting to note&mdash;I know these figures are now historical&mdash;that in 1971, of the total number of people paying estate duty, only 4 per cent were farmers.  The figure may vary somewhat now because of increase in the valuation of land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that there is a different situation but it is not multiplying so fast that there will not be considerable relief for people in this year's Finance Bill.  I believe that the improvements we have given will restore us to the 1971 situation, if I may put it at no lower level than that. Through the provisions in this Bill we are giving some alleviation against the inflationary trends which have exhibited themselves in recent times.  I think that is the right thing to do, while we proceed towards a system which the farmers themselves have requested, that is, a system which would replace the once in a lifetime estate duty, an almost penal tax, with a system which would enable them to pay the tax by instalment.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> If the policy matures some months before a person dies some consideration should be given.

It will be included in his estate if it matures a few months before he died.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will recall that I answered this argument before. It has some merit but it would be virtually impossible to deal with under the law.  Once an insurance policy has matured, the money would be received and could be dissipated, or it could be in other forms of property.  It would be mingled with the person's estate.  If we were to say it would be taken into account if a policy matured within two months or six months or a year before death, there would then be a demand to provide that every insurance policy, no matter when it matured, should be taken into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must remember that insurance policies get more benefit by way of estate duty relief than many other forms of saving which are equally meritorious.  I do not think it would be justifiable to say that one should give an exemption in the cases the Deputy has in mind and not give an exemption <Col N="2415" /> to somebody who put money into a savings bank so many months before death, or even over a period.  I would say it would be virtually unworkable without opening the floodgates to 101 abuses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an amendment down to the Ninth Schedule which arises out of this section because I think the charging is done in the section although the details are set out in the Ninth Schedule.  The purpose of the amendment is to overcome what seems to me to be an anomaly.  Small conveyances up to £1,000 are free of duty and mortgages up to £10,000 are free of duty, both of which are perfectly commendable, but, at the same time, a letting agreement, even the lowest form of agreement, an ordinary weekly tenancy, no matter how small the consideration or the rent, is subject to duty.  The Minister will probably agree that it is anomalous that this should be the situation even if the weekly rent of the premises is as low as £1.</P>
      <P>I have suggested in my amendment that a corresponding exemption for lettings and short-term leases should be given up to a rent of £500 a year which is £9 odd per week.  I would have no objection if the Minister wants to pick a somewhat lower figure than that but I think it is anomalous that very small weekly lettings at small rents should be subject to duty. Admittedly, the duty is not very great but the duty on conveyances under £1,000 was not very great up to now anyway.  It seems a bit unfair that somebody who is in a position to pay out a sum of money as capital to acquire a premises should be free of duty but someone who does not have that capital and pays for the use of the premises by the week should have to pay duty on it, irrespective of how small that duty might be.  Perhaps we can go into the details of this more on the Ninth Schedule but I wanted to make the point in principle on this section.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the premiums on the disposal of the property and not with rents as such.  As must be apparent, I was concerned in this Bill to do something about the stamp duty payable on <Col N="2417" /> smaller properties for two reasons, firstly, in order to relieve the purchasers of small holdings, to relieve people who were obliged to take on mortgages in order to purchase their homes, and also to provide some relief on the administrative side because you can often have, as we have on the Statute Book, provisions which cost more to administer than can be justified.  I do not close my mind to the suggestion made by Deputy O'Malley.  As I said yesterday, I am giving a lot of jam this year and I believe in spreading it around.  I will take a look at this between now and next year.  We are dealing with the premiums on transfers this year and we can have a look at the rent position next year.</P>

      <P>The House might like an explanation on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This chapter of this part of the Bill implements Directive No. 69/335/ EEC dated 17th July, 1969, which was issued by the Council of the European Communities to the member States &ldquo;concerning indirect taxes on the raising of capital&rdquo; by companies and firms in the member States.  The purpose of the treaty establishing the European Economic Community was to create an economic union whose characterstics are similar to those of a domestic market.  One of the essential conditions for achieving this union is stated to be the promotion of the free movement of capital.  The differing indirect taxes in force in the member States on the raising of capital give rise to discrimination, double taxation and disparities which interfere with the free movement of capital.  To ensure this free movement of capital, the tax on the raising of capital within the EEC by a company or firm should be charged once only and the level of the tax should be the same in all member States.  In short, the theme of the directive is that <Col N="2419" /> harmonisation of the duties on the raising of capital both as regards the structure and the rates of duty is essential.  The directive sets out the lines which that harmonisation should follow.</P>
    <P>The law in this State which is required to be harmonised in accordance with the directive is the law of stamp duties.</P>
    <P>The main changes which implementation will involve in our present system are the following:</P>
    <P>(i)  the base upon which the duty is charged.  The directive substitutes as the base the assets contributed to or belonging to a company for the existing base, which is the nominal share capital of a company.</P>
    <P>(ii)  the rate of duty chargeable, until January 1st, 1976, may not exceed 2 per cent or be less than 1 per cent.  The Bill proposes that our rate should be 1 per cent.  The existing rate is 0.25 per cent which is chargeable on the nominal share capital.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to estimate what effect these two provisions will have on the revenue from capital duty in the current year.  It should eventually result in an increase in revenue which it is not possible to quantify at this stage.</P>
    <P>(iii)  issues of loan capital are totally exempted.  The revenue under this head is negligible.</P>
    <P>(iv)  the effective centre of management is constituted the prime criterion for determining the locality of a company for the purposes of the duty.  Under the present system, only limited companies or partnerships which are registered here come within the charge to duty.  In future, the location of the registered office will come into the reckoning only when the effective centre of management of a company is outside the EEC. In the vast majority of cases, however, the place of effective management of a company and their registered office are in the same country.</P>
    <P>In its approach to the problem the Bill follows as closely as possible the <Col N="2420" /> existing practice which has grown up over many years and which has worked smoothly and efficiently with little or no inconvenience to the taxpayer, the Companies Office or the Revenue Commissioners.  As a result, it is expected that the new system will create relatively few problems for practitioners and that, in a short time, it will operate as heretofore.</P>
    <P>As regards the date of implementation, the directive, in common with the &ldquo;other acts adopted by the institutions of the Communities&rdquo; was, under Article 2 of the Treaty of Accession, stated to be binding on the &ldquo;new member States&rdquo; from January 1st, 1973&mdash;the date of accession.  However, arising out of protracted negotiations between, on the one side, Ireland and the UK and, on the other, the EEC Commission regarding mergers and the rate applicable thereto, Ireland and the UK were granted an extension of time until January 1st, 1974, to implement one of the articles of the directive.  The negotiations have been completed satisfactorily from the Irish point of view so that there is now no obstacle to the implementation of the directive.</P>
    <P>As regards share capital, the Bill proposes to implement the directive as from August 1st, 1973 or the date of the passing of the Act, whichever is the later.  The doubt remains, however, that January 1st, 1973, should have been the operative date and a company might challenge in the European Court the State's entitlement to duty on the old basis after that date. To avoid possible litigation, therefore, it is proposed to give any company that paid duty on that basis in respect of a transaction which took place since January 1st, the option to have the duty re-assessed on the new basis.  As regards loan capital, the Bill abolishes this duty on loan capital as from January 1st, 1973&mdash;the duty involved is negligible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised certain questions in regard to this section on other occasions that I did not receive replies to them.  However, I got a certain amount of vulgar abuse.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I put these questions again I wish to point out that in this and following sections there is the introduction of an entirely new concept in our law in relation to companies and in the method of assessing the revenue payable to the State on the formation of companies and in regard to other transactions in which they indulge.  Furthermore, we have a four-fold increase in the duties being imposed.</P>
      <P>There are reasons why this is being done as the Minister has indicated but our main complaint in this regard is that this was slipped in to the Finance Bill without any reference being made to it by the Minister.  It is an important matter since it represents a substantial increase in duty. When we asked for some clarification during the Second Stage debate we did not get it.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I ask the Minister for some clarification, first, in regard to paragraph (b) and the reference to capital or assets being dealt with on a stock exchange.  Does that mean that a company whose capital at present is quoted on a stock exchange or whose capital could be so quoted, would be granted a quotation if they were to make an application for such? The wording of the paragraph is rather loose.  Indeed, I might make the same comment in respect of some of the wording in consequential and subsequent sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In paragraph (c) there is the phrase &ldquo;without prior authorisation&rdquo;.  That, too, is a very loose phrase.  By whom is there to be authorisation?  I think it means that what is involved is the kind of thing that is involved usually in the articles of association of a private company which normally would provide that there could not <Col N="2422" /> be a transfer of shares without offering them previously to the other members of the company.  However, that meaning is not clear from the wording of the paragraph and I ask the Minister to spell out what he thinks it means and then to consider whether it is not necessary to make the meaning much more specific in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The third question I am putting to the Minister is whether we can take it that, if my interpretation of the phrase referred to in paragraph (c) is correct, what we know today of private companies are excluded effectively from this concept and would not be capital companies within the meaning of the section?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be as well to bear in mind in relation to the section that the European Commission have launched already a protest against Britain which may involve the British Government being brought to the European Court for their failure to implement this directive as and from the 1st January last.  The Commission are aware also that we have not done so and that is one of the reasons why we are providing for adjustment to take effect from 1st January last.</P>
      <P>This is the first occasion on which we are faced here very seriously with the obligation of fulfilling the duties which lie on us by reason of the directive of the Commission.  If we did not make this provision in the Bill which is the first opportunity that we have had of so doing, we would find that Ireland would be hauled before the European Court and could be fined for failure in this regard.  I am not saying that is the reason why we should rush the measure through without considering it.  I am prepared to deal as best I can with any queries raised by the Opposition but we must realise clearly that there is this obligation on us to comply with the directive in relation to our company law and stamp duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I did not advert to it in the budget speech it was because I did not regard it as a major financial matter because in monetary terms it is not such.  In fact, we do not know at <Col N="2423" /> present whether Revenue will gain or lose as a result of the measure.  As Deputies opposite know, there are a large number of companies registered where the nominal capital is stated to be, perhaps, £100, £500 or £1,000 and that stamp duty is paid on all such small sums although such companies may, eventually, have and be known at the time of their formation to be about to have assets which exceed to a large extent the nominal capital.  In future it might well have the reverse effect: there might be companies registered in terms of hundreds of thousands of pounds of capital because duty would not be payable on it at that stage and their assets might be much less.  So, we just do not know at the moment what the impact of this will be but we expect that there will be no significant pattern developing one way or the other and that the situation will be very much the same.  That is the only reason why it was not referred to in the budget statement.  Having regard to the fact that I read the longest budget statement ever in the history of the House, I could be excused for not making it longer by getting into a dissertation or long explanation on the implications of a directive of the EEC.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it is somewhat better than the French phrase which, I understand, is &ldquo;which are susceptible of being dealt in on a stock exchange&rdquo;.  So, we have gone for the English version and all I can say is that I think it has more to commend it than the French version.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did also ask the Minister in regard to paragraph (c) about the phrase &ldquo;without prior authorisation&rdquo;.  I assume that it is the same in that case, that it is taken from the English translation of the EEC document?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree with me that it is very imprecise for a statute.  Without prior authorisation by whom?  I am assuming that it would cover the case of a private company with articles of association, as is normal, prohibiting transfer of shares without their first being offered to the other members of the company.  I am assuming that but I am not quite certain that it does mean that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is true. In other words, it is a company in which the shares cannot be transferred without getting prior authority or consent of other shareholders or, perhaps, some other person or entity.  There are, for instance, cases of State-sponsored bodies where sometimes the consent of the Minister or more than one Minister might be required. One of the difficulties the <Col N="2425" /> Community have in drafting directives is that they have to draft them in language like this so as not to exclude situations in different countries. I know that we lawyers are horrified when we see loose drafting.  However, in this case it has to be done this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned, for instance, a State company which, perhaps, could not transfer shares without the consent of the Minister.  I agree with the Minister that it would appear that this phrase would bring in such a company but it is very possible, in fact it is more than likely, that it is not intended that such a company would come in under this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are some provisions in the directive which I think could not be applicable to Irish companies, only British companies, within our company law as it at present operates.  Nevertheless, the directive requires all these things to be put in because we are one community and we are supposed to have one law, one legal umbrella.  There are and there will be for some time to come in different countries different concepts as to what companies are.  In the meantime there has to be a directive written in this way to cover all possible forms of companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I make the point, in support of what Deputy Colley has been saying, that I have in front of me the directive and that the Bill follows very closely the wording in the directive?  The wording in the Council's directive is deliberately vaguely phrased because it has to cover nine countries.  It has to guide, as it were, the legal systems of nine countries.  I would imagine that what the Council had in mind was that they would state their requirements in broad general terms and that they would then let each of the nine countries put it in legal form in their own countries.  I do not think that the Council of the EEC envisaged that the precise wording they use in their directive will be reproduced in the domestic legislation of any one of <Col N="2426" /> the nine member States.  What the Minister is doing here is to a very great extent reproducing in the Bill almost the exact wording that is used in the directive.  He may say that, of course, he is keeping very close to what the Council are directing him to do when he does that but the Council consists of Ministers from nine countries.  They have no single common legal system and they do the right thing in this sort of directive in expressing their desires in a kind of neutral, non-legal, non-technical language.</P>
      <P>Neutral, non-legal, non-technical language might be a desirable thing in Bills but, unfortunately, we are going to be faced with the situation that a tremendous number of words in revenue law mean precise things and there is a whole set of new concepts brought in here in vague phrases which may be clear enough on a surface reading but which will have to be interpreted by our courts and interpreted in some detail.  I am afraid all of this Chapter 2 of Part IV will give rise to considerable, unnecessary and, perhaps, rather petty litigation where many of these things will have to be defined.  It will cost the State and individuals a lot of money to find out these things.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley has referred to certain phrases.  There is another phrase in the chapter&mdash;&ldquo;the effective centre of management&rdquo;.  I do not know what that means.  It has no meaning in English or Irish law.  It has a fairly obvious meaning to the layman but the manner in which our courts will interpret that phrase is beyond my powers to prophesy and, no doubt, beyond the Minister's powers.</P>
      <P>The article from which much of this section is copied, Article 3 of the directive, goes on in paragraph 2 to say:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the application of this directive any other company, firm or association or legal person operating for profit shall be deemed to be a capital company. However, a member State shall have the right not to consider it as such for the purpose of charging capital duty.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 60 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley and myself have made clear what our objections to this section are.  In particular, we pointed out that the wording of the section is very loose. Deputy O'Malley drew attention to the fact that it is worded almost exactly as is the directive of the Council, which was not intended to be the legal framework for implementation of it but rather the general principles laid down by the Council of Ministers.  Apart from that, I am afraid this section implementing the Council's directive might be used as a precedent in future.  If it were to be so used it would, in my opinion, be a very bad precedent which could lead to enormous difficulties in the courts and enormous difficulties for all the citizens in this country.  The Minister may say, and probably with a great deal of justification, that the section had to be prepared in a hurry, but, in our view, the correct approach to matters of this kind is not simply to take the wording of the directive and put it into a Bill.  The correct procedure is for the parliamentary draftsman to put the sense of the relevant directive into the legal terms with which the courts here are familiar, so that the Bill, as enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas, will then be in such a form that the legal profession here will be able to advise the citizens who <Col N="2431" /> consult them on what their rights and obligations are, and the courts will be able to interpret them in a way that will lead to an expeditious application of the relevant directive.  The approach adopted here is wrong and we very much hope this approach will not be adopted in the case of any other directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to realise that the terminology here is the terminology of the Council of the European Communities.  If we were to take the line Deputy Colley suggests, it might make it easier to process the matter through our courts within our own system of law, but that would not mean that the view of our courts or the interpretation of our law would stand up in the European Court.  It would more likely be a legal situation in which the State here would find itself challenged before the European Court, just as, for instance, the British Government now appear to be in peril&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, for related reasons, that they have not taken the steps we are taking.  We shall have to become more familiar with the terminology and the practice of the Commission.  We shall have more and more of this in our law over the years, and it will impose new disciplines on us.  Irish courts, looking at European obligations, which they will have to do from time to time, will themselves have to work in accordance with European law, because if they do not, they could well bring in a verdict which would be upset in the European Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will appreciate that this directive is not framed in terms of European law.  It is, as Deputy O'Malley pointed out, framed in terms understandable to a layman but, in the legal sense, very loose and open to misinterpretation. I hope the Minister is not saying that <Col N="2432" /> in the case of other directives the same procedure will be operated.  I think it would be very dangerous if this were to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out, in relation to what Deputy Colley said, that since this is a directive dated 17th July, 1969, before Britain or ourselves were members of the EEC and before the last formal application for membership had been made, the very strong probability is that this directive was drafted in either French or German, was discussed presumably in either French or German and that the copy which we have in the Official Journal of the Communities for December, 1972, and on which this chapter of this part of the Bill is based almost word for word, is almost certainly a translation from either French or German.  It is the common experience of those who were dealing with these translated documents that up to very recently at any rate the translations were often defective or less accurate than they might be.</P>
      <P>It is particularly dangerous, therefore, to use the precise terminology of a translation of a document that even in its original form was never intended to form part of the domestic law as such of any of the member States. When I was speaking before the House adjourned I pointed out to the Minister that under paragraph II of Article 3, on which this particular section is based, there seemed to be an &ldquo;out&rdquo; given to the Minister in relation to a lot of these companies.  At the end of paragraph II it states: &ldquo;However, a member State shall have the right not to consider it as such for the purpose of charging capital duty&rdquo;.  I wonder if the Minister made any effort to avail of any &ldquo;out&rdquo; in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The particular provisions which we have in this Bill and which define capital companies are mandatory.  There are other forms of capital companies, particularly in European law, which are not included in what is mandatory.  Under the directive such could be exempted.  We have not brought these in, so to that <Col N="2433" /> extent we have used the &ldquo;out&rdquo; to exclude them.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 67.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 67 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as this section is concerned, it introduces the concept of charging the duty on the assets rather than on the nominal capital. I should like to ask the Minister how it is proposed to ascertain the assets, because this is not an easy matter to ascertain at all.  There are two problems, as I see it.  First of all, there is the problem to discover what are the assets and, secondly, having discovered to the best of the Commissioners' ability what the assets are, the question then arises of valuing them.  I should like to hear from the Minister what proposals the Revenue Commissioners have in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy appreciates that, at the moment, when shares are issued for consideration other than cash, there must be a valuation of the consideration given, whether it be property, services, contract for services and so on.  At the moment all these transactions have to be adjudicated upon.  The situation will be somewhat similar in future where there is consideration other than cash for the shares.  The consideration will have to be valued, but there will be no difference in the machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that we are quite on the same point.  The particular type of duty we are talking about here is stamp duty on capital. There is no sort of investigation necessary because the memorandum and articles clearly state what the nominal capital will be and the Revenue Commissioners simply assess the duty on that.  I think what the Minister is talking about relates to the transfer of assets, which is not what is here.  This would be on the formation of what, for the purposes of this chapter, is a capital company and the capital duty will no longer be chargeable on the <Col N="2434" /> nominal share capital.  It will be chargeable on the net assets.  I know of no procedure at the moment whereby the Commissioners ascertain the net assets of a company.  The reason, of course, there is no procedure is that there is no need for the Commissioners to ascertain it because there is no form of duty which is chargeable on the net assets.  I should like to know what administrative or other procedures the Commissioners have in mind for this situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot visualise what the Deputy's difficulty is.  At the moment where there is consideration given for shares other than cash a valuation has to be made. What difficulty does the Deputy visualise in the future in respect of the new system?  At the moment you may pay stamp duty on the nominal capital which could far exceed in some cases what the assets might be. It could be four times greater and in such a case a person would pay more stamp duty than he would under the new system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is almost invariably well below what the assets are worth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that is the tendency but sometimes it could be the other way around.  That is why it is very difficult to assess what the net effect of these provisions will be. There will not be any new difficulties created except possibly there may be additional valuations to be made.  On the other hand the majority of shares are issued in consideration of cash and difficulties will not arise in these cases. If there is to be a transfer of, say, premises, as consideration the transfer has, as we know, to be adjudicated on if there is any doubt about its real value.  I cannot see that any problem will arise.  If it is being transferred for cash the cash value is taken; if it is a transfer for some other consideration it is a matter for valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is under a misapprehension that it is the shares or the issue or transfer of the <Col N="2435" /> shares which would bear the duty. That is not so.  It is the formation of the company which bears the duty.  It has nothing to do with shares.  The duty is payable at the moment, and under this chapter, on the presentation of all the necessary papers and documents to the Registrar to form the company.  The question of the issue of shares for cash or for consideration other than cash cannot arise until after the company is formed, registered and complies with certain post-registration formalities.</P>
      <P>The Minister is under a misapprehension when he thinks that the duty is payable in some way on the shares or in relation to the shares.  There might well be duty payable on the transfer of the shares afterwards, but that has nothing to do with this at all.  This is capital stamp duty on company formation. The question of the shares being issued or not issued, as the case might be, would not arise until afterwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but on the formation of the company the minimum stamp duty will be paid.  This is £1.  Afterwards, when the shares are allocated&mdash;the shares can only be allocated for value&mdash;an assessment will be made as to what the value, the consideration, is worth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying a pound will be paid on the formation of a company and then afterwards, when the shares are allotted, the com-when will be valued and the rest of the duty will be charged then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The minimum stamp duty will be £1, but you have to assess ultimately what the total stamp duty is and that depends on the value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister looks at section 68 he will see when this duty is payable.  It says:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>in the case of the formation of a capital company which is to be <Col N="2436" /> incorporated under the Companies Act, 1963, or formed under the Limited Partnerships Act, 1907, before the incorporation or registration thereof, and</P>
    <P>It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>in any other case within 30 days after the date of the transaction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will admit from his own experience that when a company is incorporated there are a couple or a few subscribers and no more for a small number of, say, £1 shares.  That is the stage at which the £1 would become payable, because they are subscribers or potential shareholders.  It is when you come down to the subsequent allocation of shares that the question will arise as to the value of the assets which were actually given in consideration of the shares.  As the minimum stamp duty payable is £1, you would apply that at the first stage if there were merely a few subscribers taking shares, in order to register the company.  Thereafter, the stamp duty will be assessed depending upon the actual value given for the shares when they are being allotted later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister tells me that is what is going to be done, I accept it.  It seems to me to be quite incredible that such a loose system should be operated.  If only two shares are issued&mdash;and that regularly happens, as the Minister knows; it is the two subscribers to the memorandum who take up two shares and the rest are never issued&mdash;there can be no question of valuation then, and a company in that situation with potentially enormous assets can get away with £1.  One would have thought in the Commissioners' own interest that the system would have been otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to operate the system which Europe says is to be general throughout Europe.  We are not merely providing for Irish companies. We must bring our legislation and Government practice into conformity with Europe.  The purpose of this is to facilitate capital transfer and formation throughout the whole Community.  We are aware that quite a large number of <Col N="2437" /> companies are incorporated and that they remain stagnant for a long time afterwards, notwithstanding repeated reminders from the Companies Office to get things going and to register the office, and so forth.  You can be certain, as the Revenue Commissioners would be liable to lose money unless there was a follow-through here, arrangements will be made in the Companies Office to ensure that there is a followup. If companies do not get into real being, and into their stride, some steps will have to be taken to strike them off the register.  A situation cannot be allowed to continue in which notional companies are formed and pretend to trade and not allocating shares and performing all the obligations which lie on them.</P>
      <P>The whole effect will be, not only as a result of these measures but, in general, that the whole company position will be strengthened.  There will have to be greater expedition and supervision and, in the long run, the danger which Deputy O'Malley referred to will not arise.  I would expect the position to improve substantially.</P>

It was for that reason we put down this amendment, to draw attention to this omission on the part of the Minister.

      <P>I raised a point on the Second Stage and I would be glad if the Minister would clarify the matter. As I see it, under this section the rate of duty imposed is 1 per cent. This relates to assets and transfers to a company after its incorporation.  The question that I would like to have clarified is: where the assets consist of real or leasehold property and are being transferred to a capital company, on the face of it this would attract a duty of 1 per cent, and I want to know will that duty operate in addition to or in substitution for the existing stamp duty on an assignment or a conveyance at the appropriate rates, that is, 3 per cent if the value is less than £50,000 and 5 per cent if it is £50,000 or more?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The ordinary stamp duty would apply in the case of a transfer.  I do not think I can justify exempting a transfer where it takes place to a company rather than to an individual.  The company stamp duty would also apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be in addition to the existing ordinary stamp duty. Is that correct?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I right in saying that at present before the enactment of this legislation such a transaction would attract the appropriate rate of stamp duty in the ordinary way but no duty in the Companies Office, if I may put it that way?  If that is so, <Col N="2439" /> what is happening is that the Minister is increasing by 1 per cent the stamp duty on the assignment or conveyance of property to a capital company. This could amount to a very substantial sum of money.  It seems to me that there is a case in such circumstances, where such a duty arises under this section, for reducing the ordinary stamp duty by a corresponding amount so as to ensure that the actual rate of stamp duty as laid down for conveyances and transfers of property would remain as at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has another option.  Surely he can provide that in the case of ordinary stamp duty it would be abated by the amount payable under this section?  This would mean the Minister would receive the same amount of revenue and the person liable would pay the same amount of stamp duty as at present.  If the Minister does not accept this he is imposing a very substantial increase in the case of property to which it does not now apply.</P>

      <P>It would have to be done across the board.  The obligations in regard to companies and not to others could not be avoided.  We have given substantial reductions in regard to stamp duties this year, also, wherever in the Community people have used dodges, if I may use the word, of this kind they have found themselves brought up before the Commission or the Court for breaching sometimes the letter and, if not the letter, then the spirit of directives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister has got the wrong end of the stick.  I understand that the object of the directive <Col N="2440" /> is to ensure that all capital companies are subjected to the same kind of charging but I do not think it should be achieved in this way.  I cannot say for certain, but there must be some member state in the Community which does not apply stamp duty in the same way as we understand it to real or leasehold property, and certainly not at the same rate.  Therefore, as Deputy O'Malley says, this is a domestic matter.  The matter of concern to the Community should be whether it is the same rate here.  What a state does in regard to its domestic inland duty is a matter for the state.  Therefore, it is quite open to the Minister to do what we have been suggesting.  The effect would be not to reduce the revenue and at the same time not to increase the duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give a sample of the situation Deputy Colley is putting?  If this applies, in effect it will mean an increase of 1 per cent in stamp duty.  If a company buy a factory for £100,000 the company pay £5,000 on the ordinary deed of transfer but that company become liable to 1 per cent, or £1,000, capital stamp duty in addition, under this section.  In other words, the company pay £6,000 in stamp duty when in equity they should pay only £5,000. What Deputy Colley is very clearly and fairly putting to the Minister is that although we cannot do anything about the £1,000 capital duty there should be provision in the Bill to remit so much of the duty as shall equal the special additional capital. The effect of this would be that a company would pay a total of £5,000 stamp duty rather than £6,000.  At the moment the proposal is one that cannot be defended in equity.</P>

      <P>The preceding section provides that the statement of assets, liabilities and expenses shall be charged with stamp duty at the rate of 1 per cent on an amount determined in accordance with the section.  The section falls naturally into two parts, namely, that dealing with the formation of a company or <Col N="2443" /> an increase in its capital or assets, and that where the transfer of an existing company is concerned, the section follows closely the format and wording of the relevant article of the directive and brings about the fundamental change required by the directive on the basis upon which stamp duty is chargeable in relation to capital companies.  Under the existing law, stamp duty is charged only on the amount of the nominal share capital of a limited company or partnership.  This section changes all that&mdash;henceforth the duty will be assessed on the net value of the assets involved in the relevant transaction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 41, before section 77 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Section 1, subsection (1) of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the insertion after &lsquo;November&rsquo; of or 4 months in the case of traders where 60 per cent. of their business is zero rated&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to change the Principal Act in regard to the taxable period which in the Principal Act means a period of two months beginning on the first day of January, March, May, July, September or November.  We feel that for certain sections of the trade, particularly those in the distributive trade who are now zero rated&mdash;I am speaking particularly about that section of the trade such as the grocery section&mdash;this change is <Col N="2445" /> desirable.  Representations have been made to me by many small traders, now that the largest part of their turnover will be zero rated, that it would be convenient for them if, instead of having to make returns every two months the taxable period would be put on a four months basis.  Even though these goods are zero rated it does not simplify the VAT system of returning accounts&mdash;if anything, quite the contrary.  This brings in another level of taxation and will mean four levels of taxation for the ordinary traders.  They maintain that they must, as many of them must, bring in accountants to make up these accounts every two months and that they could effect certain economies if they were allowed to return their taxes every four months instead of every two.</P>
    <P>There is a certain justification for this.  If we consider the people I am speaking about, traders the majority of whose turnover is in zero rated commodities, we can easily see that 70 per cent or more of their turnover&mdash;the average groceries&mdash;will be zero rated. Only 30 per cent of their turnover will be returnable for VAT.  The Revenue Commissioners will have received 75 per cent of that 30 per cent by virtue of the fact of the wholesalers having deducted tax at a wholesale level.  We are left with a very small figure of 30 per cent which I think will represent a very small amount of money in the case of the majority of traders but we are putting them through the process of trying to segregate accounts for a two-month period when, if we made it a four-month period it would simplify matters for them.</P>
    <P>The compilation of a VAT tax return can be quite complicated.  I was on the committee of the House which dealt with VAT and having gone through that I thought at the time that I understood the problems traders would face.  But I found that the theoretical end of it bears no relation to the practical application of it when one is trying to compile a VAT return. Up to now you knew the difference. When we had only turnover tax all that was necessary was to take the turnover of the month or the two months which would be normally added up in <Col N="2446" /> one's accounts and return it to the Revenue Commissioners but now, with VAT, we have to keep our different columns for the 5.26, which operated before this tax came in, and the 16.37. Some of the 16.37 is of a saleable nature, others are not.</P>
    <P>These are problems which, I find, have presented difficulties.  I believe that the Minister should come forward and try and simplify this in order to make it easier for these people to return it every four months. He could cut down expenses and, on the other hand, make it easier for the small trader, the people I am mostly concerned about.  I am convinced that the average grocer throughout this country will have 70 per cent of his turnover zero rated from September when the Minister zero rates food.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to change the Principal Act to read, a four months' period for businesses where 60 per cent of their business has a zero rating.  It was on that basis that we, in this party, put down this amendment.  Many traders in this city would welcome this provision and I am sure that representations were made to the Minister on this.  By complying with this amendment the Minister would be helping those people to get over these difficulties.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that VAT has caused complications in the distributive trades.  The acceptance of this amendment is a step which would help these small traders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment, which has been tabled for what I consider to be legitimate reasons, would mean that only those traders whose business was exactly 60 per cent zero rated would qualify for postponement. It is taken to mean that any trader with 60 per cent or over of his turnover zero rated will be entitled to make returns at intervals of four months.  Under the VAT system a trader who has suffered tax on his purchases in excess of that due on his sales is entitled to a repayment of the difference on submission of his periodical returns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the traders affected by the proposal in this amendment will, with <Col N="2447" /> the extension of the zero rating, be in a repayment position and the deferment of the repayment which would be due to them from two months to four months would not be welcome to them.  For the traders who would still be liable to pay tax on the taxable part of their turnover the effect of the amendment would be to postpone the payment of tax for a further two months with a very serious loss of revenue.  That, over a year, would mean a considerable loss of revenue for half of the year.</P>
    <P>The amount of the revenue would be substantial in some cases, for instance, in the case of big supermarket chains where 60 per cent of the turnover will, as a result of the removal of VAT from food, be zero rated.  There is no reason why any additional benefit should be given to such concerns. If it was intended to apply the relief only to small traders it could be worked only on the basis of an actual amount of tax payable.  If this were to be the criterion, it would have to apply to all businesses whose tax did not exceed a certain amount and not only to those where 60 per cent or more has a zero rating.</P>
    <P>The proposal would also create difficulties in operation as it would be uncertain which traders should be making returns every two months and which for every four months.  The issue of reminders and charging of interest on late payments would be confused and, I believe, in the long run, would add, rather than detract, from the difficulties which traders might experience.</P>
    <P>I might add, because this will not be generally known and this may be of assistance, that the Revenue Commissioners have power to make arrangements to vary the period of making returns and they would not look unsympathetically upon an application from very small traders to make returns at longer intervals than two months.  However, it would be undesirable to issue a global direction that returns should not be made, or need not be made, more often than every two months.</P>
    <P>Already such informal arrangements <Col N="2448" /> are operated and there are some traders who, as a result, are able to claim, and get, repayments at monthly intervals.  What I would suggest to Deputy Fitzpatrick, and to those who have approached him, is that they might present their particular difficulties to the Revenue Commissioners and I would be hopeful that they might, if they have particular difficulties, find some way, through the kindness of the Revenue Commissioners, of overcoming that.  I think that that is the better way of dealing with it.  If we find that administratively there are still great difficulties at the end of the trial period of these concessional operations, then I will be prepared to have a look at it again next year.</P>

I am certainly not here to fight the case of the Revenue Commissioners or to make it convenient for them.  I am here solely to put the case of the small traders who have put the case to me.</P>
      <P>If there are provisions whereby it will be possible for them to make the returns for a four month period, as the Minister has stated, then I will be satisfied. I did not realise that that provision was in the original Act.  That is the first I have heard about it.</P>
      <P>If the Minister says that this is so, then these particular traders, if they feel that only a very small part of their business, say 10 per cent, is taxable, should approach the Revenue Commissioners to see if arrangements could be made whereby they would return every four months instead of every two. I believe that it is their duty to make their case to the Revenue Commissioners. It was only a certain number of traders who made representation to me and for that reason I thought it right to bring it to the Minister's attention.</P>

      <P>The provision to which I refer is not in the Principal Act but the Revenue Commissioners have <Col N="2449" /> a general authority of care and management. Within that discretion, which is conferred on them from time immemorial, they have this right to allow a deviation.  However, what I say should not be regarded as a blanket permission to everybody to leave it to four months.  If they interpret it that way, they might find themselves in some difficulty regarding the payment of interest.</P>
      <P>Anybody who seeks a concession will want to apply and make his or her own particular case to the Revenue Commissioners. I feel sure that the Revenue Commissioners will be only too happy to deal with that.  Apart from their natural humanity and consideration for traders, the Revenue Commissioners would also be only too willing to cut down the amount of paper work that they have to do themselves.  In relation to small amounts, it clearly can be argued that it might be better not to insist on the two-month period.</P>

My amendment, I should like to assure the Minister, was not intended to apply to the big supermarkets if at all possible, because I am quite convinced that they have sufficient staff, and personnel, and are well geared, to cater for this type of thing.</P>
      <P>I was dealing entirely with the small traders who are not capable of making returns.  I was anxious that a simplified form should be introduced to facilitate them.  I accept that there are provisions to facilitate such traders and I would suggest to small traders that if they find that the amount of money due to the Revenue Commissioners is infinitesimal they should approach the Commissioners and, as a result of what the Minister has stated, I am sure they will be dealt with sympathetically.</P>

      <P>It appears that one effect of this section will be that workers who eat in canteens attached to their place of work will now find that they will have to pay more for their meals than it would cost them if they went home; if they went home the food they consumed would be zero rated whereas in the canteens a service element will be charged to tax and it will be charged at the 6.7 per cent rate. There are many thousands of workers and it would now seem that they will not be as well off as the Minister said he would leave them.  I realise the Minister has a problem in dealing with this situation so as to ensure that there is equality as between what I might describe as inside and outside caterers.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> When the Minister was zero rating food I believed he was zero rating it for the average working man.  I believed that was his primary objective. In cities and towns throughout the country it just is not possible for the worker to go home for his lunch, his principal meal of the day, and he is therefore compelled to eat in a canteen. What the Minister is doing here is victimising that worker by putting this additional charge on him under this section.  Is it the Minister's intention to force workers to go home for their midday meal?  Remember, as well as the time element, there is also <Col N="2451" /> the problem of transportation.  The whole idea of zero rating food was to try to alleviate the burden of heavy prices.  What will be the position where nurses are concerned?  They have a deduction made from salary to pay for meals they eat in the hospital or nursing home.  What will be the position in the Civil Service canteen? Will these not get any benefits, none of the benefits the Minister intended to confer by reducing the price of food?  They will not be able to go home and so they will get no benefit at all from the zero rating of food. These people take their main meal at midday.  They do not dine in the evening in the principal hotels in the city.  They should not be victimised. Is it the Minister's intention to tax them on their principal meal of the day?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is making a very big mountain out of a very small molehill.  One would think there were millions involved.  At the moment the meals to which Deputy Fitzpatrick refers are subject to 5.26 VAT.  All that is happening here is that they will continue to pay VAT, but at the 6.75 rate.  Many of these canteens provide meals for about 50p per day and that is why I say the Deputy's speech was a most eloquent one on the subject of saving three farthings a day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 78 is directly related to this because it emphasises that the service in canteens will not be exempt from VAT.  The reason for that was identified by Deputy Colley.  It is a very <Col N="2452" /> legitimate one.  It is designed to protect the workers, particularly those engaged in the catering industry.  As Deputy Fitzpatrick knows, there now is a large number of canteens serviced by catering firms and, if we do not preserve this position, the danger is these catering firms would suffer very seriously. That would be a grave disadvantage to the workers in the long run because most of these firms provide very good food on very good terms.  We have, I think, every reason to be grateful for the fact that one of these firms has been brought in to provide the culinary facilities in this House.  As a consequence, we have seen improvements.  If we did not retain this provision there would be a danger that employers, who now subsidise these canteens, would get rid of the catering firms and proceed to do the catering themselves.  We are concerned with the preservation of employment, as is Deputy Fitzpatrick, I am sure.  I doubt if any worker will impose upon himself the difficulty of going from his own place of work to his home for a meal which is zero rated for the sale of the small saving he could effect notionally by doing so. It would be purely notional.  I think he can be comforted in knowing that he pays an extra three farthings a day so that his wife and children at home can eat all their meals zero rated, and that for the first time in ten years.  That will more than compensate, I believe, for the small additional disadvantage of an extra three farthings per day&mdash;the price of a chip these days if you look at the price of potatoes.</P>

There might be some basis for his calculations if all that were happening were that he was increasing the appropriate rate of tax.  Of course, he is doing more than that.  He is zero rating food and, therefore, the comparison in that context is quite legitimate as made by Deputy Fitzpatrick.  The comparison is between the cost of the meal to a man if he has it in his home and if he has it in a canteen at work.  The difference is not simply the difference between 5.26 and 5.75.  It is, of course, between zero and 5.75.</P>

The Minister must remember that, when he is speaking about the big benefits he is giving in zero rating food, as between the husband and wife and one or two children, the husband and wife are the principal consumers of the type of food which the Minister is zero rating.  In effect, that family are getting the benefit of 50 per cent only, because the principal meal is during the day and the husband who is working in the factory is not getting the benefit, no matter how the Minister tries to gloss over it.</P>

A grocer who purchases goods which are zero rated will have to produce his registration number.  I find it very difficult to believe it, but I accept the Minister's word.  The situation now in a hotel will be that drink, cigarettes and various other commodities will be deemed as the delivery of goods.

That is a round figure and easy to calculate.  We thought the Minister could do the same here by making 6.75 6.50.  On the VAT Committee last year the then Fine Gael spokesman on Finance, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, was quite adamant that this would cause considerable confusion and trouble for traders in compiling the amount of VAT due.  On that occasion he put forward several amendments to round off the figure.  The Minister has an opportunity here of doing this.  I am only re-echoing the words of his colleagues.  I am not concerned about the higher level because I know that is only collected at wholesale level.  If the Minister would accept this amendment it would simplify things to some degree.

In that context it is very reasonable to make the case that Deputy Fitzpatrick has made because there is no doubt that there are complications, especially for small retailers, with these odd percentages. The justification for not changing them in the past was that we were not changing the rate of tax.  Today when we are changing the rate of tax the Minister <Col N="2458" /> has a wonderful opportunity to do some simplification of figures.</P>

      <P>All things in life cost money and nobody knows that better than Deputy Colley.  If we were to eliminate the decimal point, and that is what people would love to do, and bring say, 6.75 back to 6 per cent, the loss in revenue would be £6 million because each .25 at the lower rate of VAT represents a revenue of £2 million.  We are even informed that the 19.50 is an irritant and that it ought to be rounded up or down. Suppose we eliminated the decimal point altogether.  If we made it a rate of 6 per cent there would be a loss of £6 million, if we went up to 7 per cent there would be a plus £2 million and if we went to 20 there would be a plus of £1.2 million.  Having regard to all the arguments we heard about the 3.2 increase which occurred I would not like to bring further wrath from the benches opposite by any variation.  The budget figure has already been settled and it was settled on the basis of these figures.  While I can understand the desirability of simplifying life for everybody, including traders, it simply would not be possible to forfeit the £2 million which would be involved by this reduction.</P>
      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 79 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to delay the House unduly but I want to place on record that in section 79 we are asked to approve the increasing of VAT on every commodity and every service other than food as defined in earlier sections, and as Deputy Fitzpatrick has pointed out, that means we are increasing the tax even on food served in canteens and factories. We have always opposed the concept that is involved in this Bill in regard to the zero rating of food. We have opposed it because we believe that it amounted to a confidence trick on the general public, that the general public will never see the benefit which they are supposed to get from the zero rating of food but they certainly will see the direct and consequential <Col N="2459" /> increases in the cost of everything else.  In fact, it is our belief that the increases will be more than those which are directly consequential and provided for in this section if only because in some cases it is not possible to get a coin that will represent the difference.</P>
      <P>But there are other reasons for this. We spelled these out before and, therefore, we will not go into them all again.  However, I would point out that not alone is the price of everything else being increased but in the process of doing so, we are increasing by direct Government action the cost of such items as fuel for the home and footwear and clothes, all of which are essential items.  The actual increase in costs will be more than that brought about by this direct Government action and, of course, this is additional to the steady increase which is occurring at present in the cost of these items because of inflation.  In these circumstances we believe that this whole concept particularly as set out in this section is ill-advised and may have very serious social and economic consequences, that it will not benefit the consumer at all and that it could well contribute substantially to making extremely difficult the conclusion of a third national pay agreement, if not to making it impossible.</P>
      <P>We could say a great deal more on this but I will not do so at present.  I wish to record as briefly as possible our total opposition to the proposal in this section that the rate of value-added tax in every item, other than the ones I have mentioned, is to be increased.</P>

      <P>There was argument throughout the earlier part of this year, particularly during the general election campaign, that the EEC would not permit a reduction in VAT on food to a zero rate but that they would require tax to be charged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The interesting point is that within the EEC there are four countries which have a zero rating on some commodities.  This action on our part will bring the number up to five but our wisdom is proved by the fact that the EEC will provide that, unless a commodity is zero rated before 1st January, 1974, it may not be zero rated thereafter. Therefore, this was a timely step on our part.  That is one aspect of the matter but it is a very important one. The OECD report and other observations on EEC organisations indicate that where a country has a good social reason for zero rating or for reducing the rates on certain commodities, they should do so and OECD recommended that tax on food should be abolished.  There is a very good reason for doing so in Ireland, perhaps more than anywhere else, for the reason that the greatest element in our present spiral of inflation is in respect of food costs.  These costs are substantially beyond our control but they arise because we, being a foodproducing country, we have now available to us far more attractive prices for our produce than were available previously and because there <Col N="2461" /> are also certain increases in the import of other food commodities.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that in this whole field of inflation, the rate of inflation in relation to non-food items has been declining while the rate in relation to food has been increasing. In that situation we have been justified entirely in shifting taxation from food.  For the first time in ten years of tax.  That was justifiable socially and although one has to pay a higher tax on other commodities in order to compensate for the loss in revenue by reason of zero rating food, the step was desirable and progressive socially.  Economically, it is advantageous.</P>
      <P>Now that food prices have risen so fast the reduction we are causing by removing VAT from food is comparatively greater than it would have been if it had been given a few years' ago and the step we are taking will result in a considerable improvement. I emphasise that if we did not take this step now we might never again have the opportunity to do so and that is a very good reason why we should hail the 3rd September as a day of great deliverance for the housewife.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I do not know which section the Minister is speaking about but we are referring to section 79 which contains no reference to zero rating.  This section concerns increasing the rates of VAT.  I wonder if the Minister has read this morning's newspapers in relation to increases that have been sanctioned by the Prices Commission in respect of a substantial number of items.  These increases have been sanctioned before the date on which the revised rates are to come into operation.  Petrol, for instance, is being increased by a penny per gallon and we all know that when the increase in VAT on petrol proposed by the Minister is imposed the petrol companies will apply for an additional increase.  I saw no reference in the budget speech to petrol being reduced in price.  I know there are certain regulations in regard to spirits and tobacco but I am not aware that <Col N="2462" /> they apply in respect of petrol.</P>
      <P>A substantial increase, too, has been sanctioned in respect of transport costs but it is not very long ago &mdash;a short time before the Presidential election&mdash;that the Minister for Industry and Commerce told us here that the National Prices Commission were considering the question of transport costs.  I understood that they were considering the question as part of a social service and that help would come from central funds.  However, it is obvious now that the Minister is going back on his word.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Section 79 increases the price of many commodities, including petrol.  Even though increases have been granted in respect of transport in this city, additional increases will be necessary because of the increase in the price of petrol.  It is on this aspect that I speak. The normal turnover tax on petrol will be increased from 5.26 to 6.75.  This is bound to affect transport costs.  This is apart from the increase granted today of 1p a gallon.  We know that increases were sanctioned in respect of public transport before this was taken into consideration.  CIE will have to reassess their costings, taking into account the increase from 5.26 to 6.75. On that basis, transport costs will go up again.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce deliberately delayed sanction for a specific reason.  That is water under the bridge now.  According to today's papers, increases will take place in respect of various items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister if the Prices Commission sanctioned increases <Col N="2463" /> on items which will be zero rated after 3rd September.  It would be a mistake, and I doubt if the Prices Commission would do it, to sanction increases on items which will be zero rated after 3rd September because, naturally, there will be a reduction in the raw material here.  I have not gone through the list of price increases but it is quite extensive.  I was wondering if any of the items are items which will benefit from the zero rating on food. Apart from that, the Minister will find prices spiralling, which is happening all the time.  This section increases prices across the board.  Footwear, clothes, fuel and various other essential commodities are affected.  The price of petrol has gone up this morning and will be further affected by the increase from 5.26 to 6.75 with consequent effect on public transport although the Minister stated three months ago that he would have another look at this matter.</P>

There is an argument in principle for this, but here he appears to be introducing special arrangements in regard to VAT.  Is there some particular reason why this should be done?</P>

      <P>No.  The general approach has been to try and make penalties similar.  This is as nearly similar as it can be made.  While the particular offence does not correspond with any other particular act the penalty is of the dimension which is applicable to tax offences in other spheres.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I should emphasise in relation to both section 83 and the previous section that these penalties apply only when a prosecution takes place.  It is for the court to determine whether or not the action is such as to be so culpable as to deserve the penalty.  While the wording used here is &ldquo;fraudulently or negligently&rdquo; the courts interpret that as requiring that the negligence must be such as to indicate that there was an intention to defraud or there was an negligence so grossly fraud or there was negligence so grossly careless as to be indifferent as to whether fraud or a misleading situation arose.</P>

They do not prosecute, as a rule, unless there are good reasons for believing somebody is fiddling.  At that stage they prosecute and if that accused person is able to show to the court that that is not the position and there are grounds for believing him, then the court do not impose the penalty.</P>

      <P>This section explains the exemptions for hospitals and schools.  It adds three new exemptions for the delivery of horses, and the delivery of greyhounds, and the natural or artificial insemination of cattle, sheep or pigs.  I think I explained it on the Second Stage, and I am sure Deputies will recall the explanation for what seemed to be a rather peculiar exemption.  It arises by reason of the fact that in the bloodstock and greyhound industry animals have frequently to be imported and exported for races, training and stockbreeding.  This elimination avoids a situation of having to impose the tax and then refund it on the reexport of the animal.</P>
      <P>The provision in relation to noncharging on natural or artificial insemination of cattle, sheep or pigs is something that is being done for the relief of farming co-operatives which engage in this service.  If it is taxed in their case and not in the case of others who are not registered it works to the disadvantage of the farming co-operatives.  The exemption in respect of food and services provided in hospitals and schools is one which no doubt commends itself to the Opposition who were so angry about the tax being imposed on canteens elsewhere.</P>

      <P>The Minister made a very important statement on another section, and that was that a zero rate was another rate.  It is very important because I found it impossible to convince him and his colleagues about that fact in previous discussions.  It is some progress that the Minister has now learned that what I said was correct. The practical effect of this is that for shopkeepers the zero rating of food constitutes a situation in which shopkeepers have to handle three rates, not two as previously.  For the small shopkeeper in particular this will present very serious difficulties.  This constituted one&mdash;though perhaps not a major one &mdash;of the major objections to the whole proposal of zero rating in food and increasing the rate on other goods.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Minister has given much consideration to the problems which arise for shopkeepers. A number of them are extremely apprehensive in regard to the consequences of having to handle a third rate.  There are certain things which can be done to ease the burden. I have no doubt that the Revenue Commissioners are doing what they can to communicate this to shopkeepers, but with the best will in the world the third rate which the shopkeepers will have to handle on foot of this section will constitute a great difficulty for some, and an almost insurmountable obstacle for other small shopkeepers.</P>

      <P>I would not regard it as a sign of progress that I have accepted the use of the term &ldquo;zero rate&rdquo; as being valid in tax law.  I regard it as rather sad that I am forced by the exigencies of time to tolerate imprecision and untidiness in the use of language.  Apparently one has to do it in order to operate the system of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The zero rating aspect presents some problems but there are some benefits.  No longer will traders dealing with zero rating quotations have to mark up the commodities at the rate that they would previously have had to mark them in order to incorporate the tax.  They are saved at least that discipline.  Some suppliers <Col N="2474" /> who have had to give credit to people have had to give credit not only in relation to the actual price of the article but also in regard to the element of tax which the supplier himself had to pay.  There are some benefits, and they are not inconsiderable, for these people who will be handling zero rating of commodities.</P>
    <P>People who are handling zero rated commodities are happier to accept whatever little inconveniences arise because they realise that the benefits are much greater than the disadvantages. I should like to take this opportunity to express gratitude to the grocery trade and all traders in food for the way in which they have shown an anxiety to ensure that the reduction in VAT will be passed on to the consumers. While allegations are made against them that they might not pass on the reduction in tax, all the signs are that they are most anxious to pass on the reduction.  I am sure that this will be so.  There may be a few rogues who will spoil it but the Minister for Industry and Commerce will have available to him an army of inspectors to supervise the operation as best it can be done to ensure that the benefit is passed on to the consumer.</P>

      <P>This is the section which imposes further taxation on the rates of motor vehicle duty, known as road tax&mdash;on motor cycles, tractors, commercial goods vehicles and motor cars.  The overall effect of the imposition of these increases is very difficult to calculate, but one thing is certain.  The effect will be to increase the cost or the costings of almost every industry and business in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister knows, an unfortunate consequence of this kind of across the board increase is that if one could measure it as applied in a particular industry as amounting to X, it so happens that, because of the structure of industry and distribution, when it reaches the consumer it may be X plus 10 or X plus 20, depending on particular circumstances.  In <Col N="2477" /> other words, the total effect on the community will not be the amount of the increased amount it is estimated to yield but a considerably larger sum.  At a time of very serious inflation and when, as Deputy Fitzpatrick pointed out earlier, very substantial increases in the prices of various commodities have been announced, this section will add very considerably to the inflation with which we are already faced, apart from any particular difficulties it may entail for individuals affected directly by it.</P>
    <P>There have been some instances of very substantial increases under the relevant Financial Resolution which section 92 replaces.  I seem to recall one particular case in which the rate of tax is going up from 50p to £50 and I heard recently of some increases on the initial registration of commercial vehicles which were not very obvious to many people, and, indeed, I believe that some of the local taxation officers and gardaí were not aware of them and that they have had to get instructions from Dublin.  The consequence has been an even greater shock to those who have now learned something of the true effect of the proposals contained in the budget and being implemented by this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already pointed out, and I do not think it needs repetition, that the total cost of the additional taxation on motor vehicles is far less than 1 per cent of the total cost of operating motor vehicles, having regard to the fact that the cost of operating motor vehicles for reasons far beyond the Exchequer has increased by multiples ten times greater than that amount.  This has been so for many years past and I do not think this is at all an excessive burden for the motor fraternity to carry, particularly when the money which will accrue as a result of these minimal changes in the cost of motoring will be devoted entirely to the provision of much needed roads and associated amenities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That sphere of national investment has been terribly neglected.  The whole infrastructure is totally below the capacity of the existing motor stock and accordingly we felt it necessary, as <Col N="2478" /> a matter of urgency, to get the additional revenue in order to improve roadways and road services generally. That is all we are doing and I am certain from the indicators that it is well justified.  As the House knows, the sale of new motor vehicles rose in the first four or five months of this year by more than 30 per cent.  I might point out this was pre-budget and it indicated there was considerable buoyancy in this sector.  Since the budget the rise has been even greater.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister realise that the cost to country people, people who have been delivering milk to creameries, has gone up by £50? Contracts will have to be broken and remade with those people who are collecting the milk for delivery to creameries.  This is the most serious effect I see from this provision.  Of course, I also am thinking of people who use cars to get to work.  These people are very hard hit.</P>
      <P>I did not say much on this Finance Bill but this matter very much affects the country.  It had an adverse effect on the fate of the Government's nominee in the Presidential election. I am quite honest about this; I am not talking politics. We have many creameries and many of them have articulated lorries which had very small tax.  These have now gone up £60. Diesels have also gone up.  That means a completely new contract for drawing in milk.  It is a very serious matter in the country and I could speak at length on it but I do not want to hold up the House.</P>

      <P>In regard to what the Minister said a while ago I believe that very substantial as the proceeds of this section will be to the revenue, if the Minister thinks this will enable him adequately to tackle the problem of financing the necessary roadworks he is mistaken.  I think he will find, if he has not already found, that before the change of Government serious consideration was being given to the whole problem of financing necessary roadworks and that opinion was veering in the direction of what I have felt for some time, that the <Col N="2479" /> method by which we finance roadworks is antiquated and quite unsuited to our requirements.</P>
      <P>In effect, we finance roadwork by current revenue, sometimes supplemented by the Exchequer.  If we are to tackle the major problems that exist, it seems it will be necessary to regard it as an item of capital expenditure to be financed like the other infrastructural development necessary in the country.  In this connection I have considerable hopes of the European Investment Bank and some other international agencies but it will require a completely different approach on the Minister's part to the financing of roadworks.  Many millions of pounds will be required; the programme must be worked out over a number of years to enable this to be done and to enable money to be borrowed and interest to be repaid. I say this because I should not like the Minister or anybody to believe that, even though the additional revenue being raised here is very substantial it will go anywhere near solving the major problem of infrastructure involved in the roadworks that are required.</P>

      <P>Every little bit helps.  Directions have been issued to all authorities and to the gardaí that any person who has what is called a cutdown tractor and has an existing tax disc for it is entitled to operate under that tax disc for the duration of the period for which the disc was issued and should not be in any way inhibited in respect of the user of that vehicle during the currency of the existing tax.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the reality is that this practice of using cutdown tractors arose in the days of the previous Government and obviously caused so much concern that a number of farmers and operators of <Col N="2480" /> these vehicles were prosecuted and ultimately a case was stated to the courts in order to have the matter resolved.  Then it was clearly established that advantage was being taken of the loophole in the law so that vehicles could be taxed at this low rate so that they could avoid paying full duty on fuel to operate them.  We did no more than our predecessors had intended to do.  There is a draft for which I am only too ready, as Deputy Colley knows, to give credit where credit is due.</P>

      <P>This is a new charge in respect of the licensing of a mechanically-propelled vehicle for the first time for use on public roads.  The charge is £1 for motorcycles and £5 for all other types of mechanically-propelled vehicles with the exception of vehicles which are exempt from road tax.  This provision operates in the majority of European countries imposing a special charge in respect of original registrations because of the cost involved.  It seems there is a good social reason why society should, as it were, collect a fee at this stage because the cost of disposing of a mechanically-propelled vehicle when it comes to the end of its useful life is in excess of £5 nowadays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Dublin region the public authority have taken over the responsibility of disposing of these cars free <Col N="2482" /> of charge because they have become such a social evil.  I have always felt personally that there should be a built-in cost at the time of manufacture of every motorcar which would be handed over to the State to be held until such time as the car came to be destroyed because cars both in use and in their death are doing considerable damage to our environment.

      <P>This is a drafting amendment.  Paragraph 1 sets out conditions with which an endowment policy must comply in order to qualify for life insurance relief.

      <P>(2)  Liability for the payment of a premium is discharged in accordance with this subparagraph if it is discharged by the retention by the company with which the insurance is made of the whole or a part of any sum which has become payable on the maturity of, or on the surrender more than ten years after its issue of the rights conferred by, a policy&mdash;</P>

    <P>being a policy which was itself a qualifying policy, or which would have been a qualifying policy if issued in respect of an insurance made on or after the 16th day of May, 1973.</P>
    <P>The effective purpose of the amendments is to insert in paragraph 6 (2) the material contained in subparagraph (b).  For drafting purposes, however, it was thought preferable to substitute the complete subparagraph as amended.

      <P>There is, I understand, a small difference.  The Deputy will see on page 67 that there are different rates.  As regards the EEC, spirits are the subjects of a draft Council directive which is still under discussion in the Community.  It is in respect of beer, tobacco, mineral oils and wine. They are also the subject of separate draft directives, but they are still only drafts.  The aim of the draft directive is to harmonise the structure on the fiscal duty on spirits on a Community wide basis.  The directive does not relate to the level of the duty.  While the Community has harmonisation of the levels of fiscal duties as an objective to be achieved at some future date there is, as yet, no firm commitment to doing this.  Until such commitment exists the member states are at liberty to vary the rates of their fiscal duties. In fact there is at present an advantage in favour of home spirits under several heads.</P>

      <P>The Committee reported progress on Wednesday last on amendment No. 5 which was tabled to section 11.  Since then, a number of new and substitute amendments have been received.  It was not found possible in the time available to have a new green sheet of amendments prepared and, accordingly, all the remaining amendments to be considered by the Committee have been circulated on a stencilled and numbered sheet.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know Deputy Colley's form.  We will watch developments. Amendment No. 6 will enable the Government, whenever they so think fit, to increase the allowances for secretarial expenses, <i>et cetera,</i> to Leaders of the Government and Opposition parties by order.  This provision corresponds to that already in the Bill providing for increases, by order of the Government, in the allowances for Deputies and Senators and in the salaries of Ministers and Parliamentary office-holders.  As the House will recall, I have given a clear indication of the Government's intention whenever there would be a national wage agreement pattern to develop along the lines agreed under such a national wage agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 7 and 13 enable an allowance under section 9A or section 10 of the Principal Act to be paid to the Leader or Leaders, as the case may be, of a party or parties, one or more members of which is a member of the Government.  Under section 9 of the Principal Act, as amended by section 12 of the 1960 Act, a Government party were excluded from payment of any such allowance.  As pointed out in the course of the Second Reading debate by more than one speaker, the need for secretarial service arises in the case of Government backbenchers just as much as it does in the case of Opposition members. This amendment is designed to enable a contribution&mdash;and it is only a <Col N="2491" /> contribution&mdash;to be made towards the cost of such services and facilities.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 provides for the introduction of an allowance arrangement for the benefit of Government parties and amendment No. 9 provides for an increase in the rates of allowance payable to Leaders of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>The conditions that will apply to the grant of an allowance to a Government party are the same as those that apply to an Opposition party&mdash;each must have a minimum of seven members elected to Dáil Éireann at the most recent general election to qualify for an allowance.</P>
    <P>The rates of allowance which are to apply in the case of a Government party are, however, being fixed at only 40 per cent in each case of the rates that apply in the case of an Opposition party.  The disparity in these rates derives from the fact that the allowances for the Leaders of the Opposition parties consist of two components, a contribution towards secretarial expenses and a contribution towards research facilities.  This arrangement follows the precedent set at the time of the 1968 Act, when a provision for research facilities was made for the first time.</P>
    <P>No similar provision for research facilities is seen to be required for the Government parties which can, of course, rely upon the Civil Service advisers to the Government to provide the necessary backing in research.  The provisions of this section have emerged as a result of the consultations that have taken place since the House adjourned discussion of the Committee Stage on Wednesday last.  The allowance that will be paid under these provisions to the Leader of the present Opposition party will be £25,000, a generous increase of 66? per cent.  The Taoiseach and Tánaiste as Leaders of the Government parties will be paid respectively £7,000 and £3,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to amendment No. 6, the Minister explained that it is designed to enable the Government, by order, to increase the allowance either to the Opposition or <Col N="2492" /> to the Government parties in line with similar provisions in other parts of the Bill.  We certainly agree with this approach.  However, he also said that this would enable the Government, in the event of a national agreement, to adjust the various allowances and salaries involved in this Bill.  The question I want to put to him is this. If there is no national agreement, how does he then visualise the situation being dealt with?</P>
      <P>With regard to amendments Nos. 8 and 9 the Minister referred to consultation between the Government and the Opposition.  I am not sure that he used the right word.  To the best of my knowledge, information was conveyed from the Government to the Opposition.  I do not think &ldquo;consultation&rdquo; is the right word to describe what took place.</P>
      <P>In general in regard to these amendments, it will be seen that the principle which we sought very hard to maintain is being maintained, that is, that the allowance to the Opposition is being dealt with as a separate item from any question of secretarial allowances for the Government parties.  This is as it should be.  We regret that it took so long to establish to the satisfaction of the Government that this is what should be done but, even if it is belated, we welcome the fact that the Government now accept that we were right in trying to maintain this principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the proposed allowances to the Government parties, as we said all along, we certainly have no objection in principle to them.  We think there is a case for the provision of assistance to enable Government backbenchers to get secretarial assistance. I regard the provision here as a stock measure, satisfactory as far as it goes but by no means satisfactory from any long term point of view.  I say that because it became quite apparent to everyone in relation to the previous amendment which the Government put forward, where they endeavoured to deal with this problem, that there were various things coming to light which had not been covered and it will be noted that in these amendments one of the objections which had been raised to <Col N="2493" /> the previous amendment is not being dealt with and that is the question of independent Deputies in the House. That is only one of the reasons why I would regard this as a stop-gap arrangement.  I believe this whole question of the provision of secretarial assistance to Deputies on all sides of the House is one that needs to be examined thoroughly and with more time than is available at present.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to delay the proceedings of the House at this stage by going into some of the problems that arise and even if I did I am quite sure there would be other problems that I would not have adverted to that would arise if this whole question of the provision of secretarial assistance for Deputies on all sides of the House were gone into in a calmer atmosphere with more time available.  It does seem to me that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges is the right forum in which to examine this problem and I would certainly urge that this should be done as soon as possible and that all facets of the problem be gone into and that the necessary legislation and/or regulations would then be introduced after that consultation had taken place.</P>
    <P>I would urge also that we should regard the provisions outlined in these amendments for allowances to the Government parties as merely an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement pending the outcome of such consultations.  We have maintained from the beginning of the discussion on this Bill that that was the right approach.  We are still convinced that it is the right approach and we accept these amendments on the basis that they are merely an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement and that further thought and consultation will be given to this whole serious problem.  We do think it is a serious problem and it is becoming more serious for reasons which were detailed at some length in the course of the debate earlier, the much greater degree of responsibility and complexity of matters with which Deputies on all sides are now required to deal than was the case in years gone by.</P>
    <P>For that reason as far as we are concerned we agree with the amendments proposed by the Minister with the qualifications which I have outlined. <Col N="2494" /> I trust that the Minister will be able to assure us that he takes the same view of the matter and that the kinds of consultation that I have suggested will take place at an early date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

      <P>I want to reiterate what Deputy Colley has said and in particular to say that I welcome the considerable change of heart shown by the Government in this matter since this Bill was discussed before. As Deputy Colley has said, the principle which underlines the amendments now put before the House by the Government is very close at least to the principle which we put forward and had to put forward at some length on the previous occasions when this Bill was discussed here.  We are glad to welcome the acceptance of those principles and I am particularly glad to see that the form of payment and the way in which it is expressed in this latest set of amendments are more or less in line with the provisions of each of the five previous Acts from 1938 to 1968.</P>
      <P>I am particularly happy to see the end of that very longwinded and illfated amendment which in turn was subsequently amended 37 times.  We, as an Opposition, were subjected to criticism because we were so strongly opposed to certain provisions in this Bill.  What has happened today in the amendments that have been put forward has more than justified our opposition to it.  We were opposed to the principle of it and we got the principle changed.  We were opposed also to the details of the lengthy amendment which was incorrectly drafted and that has been completely taken out.  We have been shown to have been justified in what we did oppose and I am glad to welcome the situation as it now exists.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would hope that when the Opposition come back from the recess they will be able to think a little more clearly than apparently they have been able to think over the past fortnight.  I do not want to inject anything acrimonious but I cannot accept that the alterations which have now been made to meet the <Col N="2495" /> objections of the Opposition amount to a change of principle on the Government's part.  They do not.  From the very beginning of this debate we have emphasised that the allowance made to the Opposition party contains two components, one in respect of secretarial expenses and the other in respect of research.  The Opposition, particularly the Leader of the Opposition, said that that is not so, that the payment was made in respect of research.  In order to put the matter beyond any doubt, and to save our successors in this House having to suffer the kind of vilification we were subjected to, we have written into this Bill in section 9 a provision that in respect of expenses paid to the Opposition expenses incurred will include expenses incurred in respect of research.  I know it was a matter of some surprise to people to hear that the 1933 Shanley Committee, on which the 1938 legislation was based, spoke about secretarial expenses and that is what has been paid all down the years and to that, for the first time in 1968, was added research facilities.  There has been no change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the legislation of 1938 did not include the word &ldquo;research&rdquo; but it did say allowance for expenses and the Shanley Committee upon which this legislation was based referred to secretarial expenses. I hope now that this is all water under the bridge.  This matter has been clarified and we are ensuring that there will be no further argument by putting the necessary description in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that it is a good thing that we have left it in the anachronistic form that was used in 1938 and since then.  The form we were proposing is a form which is in operation in most of the European Parliaments and one which I believe can be justified because it relates more closely to the numerical strength of parties in the present system but I suppose it is a bit late in the day to be arguing all these points.  The only <Col N="2496" /> effective change between the Bill as it was and as it is now is that the Opposition allowance has been increased by a further £4,000, making a total increase for the Opposition of £10,000 in their allowance compared with what the Opposition was earning before now and on the Government side of the House the increase is only £2,500.  That is the net effect of the consultations which have taken place. Whether they are called consultations or communications I will leave it to Deputy Colley to argue over.  The fact is that views have been exchanged and a reasonable compromise has been reached.  I hope the Opposition will enjoy their holidays now that they have got so much additional money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no wish to revert to the kind of situation we had two days ago but I would point out that there are four amendments under discussion at the moment, two of which are minor in the sense that they change only certain words but two of which are major in the sense that they import two whole new sections into the Bill.</P>
      <P>The significant point is that not one line relative to these four amendments was in the Bill which was ordered to be printed on the 17th July and neither were they in it when it passed the Second Stage.  These four amendments have been inserted since then and are the result of points raised by Deputies on this side of the House and, in fairness, points raised also by certain backbenchers on the other side.  This must be one of the most amended Bills to go through this House for some time.  It is wrong to suggest that the Bill is not radically different now from what it was when it was introduced.  If the Government had put into the Bill certain sections that are now in in it, and which it should have contained from the beginning many of the problems that we have had in regard to it during the past week or two would have been avoided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley said a few minutes ago that the Bill was <Col N="2497" /> satisfactory as far as it went but that it should go a good deal further and he thought the proper forum for discussion of these matters was the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. That is what we said on the Second Stage.  We said then that these matters which have caused so much acrimony and a great deal of debate, which at times was very heated, would not have occurred if the matter had been discussed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or if some proposals that have come from that Committee during the past number of years had been dealt with more expeditiously.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to re-open all that but Deputy O'Malley is making the point that we made at the beginning and which Deputy Colley made today. I have given an undertaking to discuss these matters and to be extremely generous in handling them. I would hope that we would have research and secretarial facilities in this House that would be comparable to the requirements of our Parliament, which are much greater now than they were in 1938.  We have not provided facilities to match the requirements of today.</P>

      <P>In the course of the Second Reading debate on this Bill some Deputies referred to the fact that section 12 applied as and from 14th March, 1973, only and they suggested that if some previous occupants of the position of Attorney General satisfied the conditions laid down for a pension they should be covered by the section.  In replying to that debate I indicated that if there was somebody in this category the matter could be <Col N="2501" /> looked at again.  Later, in speaking on the Money Resolution, Deputy O'Malley suggested that there might be four or five such persons or their widows.</P>
      <P>I have looked into the position and I find some evidence to indicate that a few former holders of the office of Attorney General may not have engaged in private practice while holding that office although the matter is not certain.  Whether they had any other position of emolument during their period of office is not clear at this stage.  This will require some further investigation.  However, on the assumption that some of them may fulfil the condition laid down in section 12, I have decided to apply it to former holders of the office with effect from the passing of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I might add that if it appears in relation to any such people that a gratuity was paid to any Attorney General in question on the termination of his services, in accordance with well-established procedure relating to public pensions, it would be necessary to have the gratuity repaid before the pension could be paid&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because it would be obviously inequitable that a person could receive both a gratuity and a pension.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments is to provide that the new pension arrangements for the Attorney General will apply, subject to the terms of the legislation, to former holders of the office or to their widows.  Thus, all references to the 14th March, 1973, which appeared in the original section have been deleted.</P>
      <P>It is provided also that the new arrangements will apply to, or in respect of, former office holders with effect from the date of the passing of this Bill, that is, no payment of pension will be made for any period prior to that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is some evidence to suggest that five former Attorneys General were not engaging in private practice but we do not know at this stage if <Col N="2502" /> any of them held any other office or position of emolument while holding the position of Attorney General. Some of the people in question have since gone to a better place&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the ultimate place of sinecure.  Others have become members of the Judiciary while others have not been survived by widows.  But we are leaving the situation open so that if it can be established that some person was debarred from and did not participate in any outside office which carried an emolument or remuneration, his pension application could be dealt with.  It was never intended to exclude anybody who was a fulltime Attorney General and who was not engaged in private practice.  The best knowledge we had at the time of the introduction of the Bill that the one person who would have received benefit was a person who was Attorney General in the 1920s, who has never been a judge and who is still hale and hearty.  However, the position is now open and no injustice will be caused to anybody provided they can prove their case.</P>

      <P>We welcome these amendments.  I regret, though, that the Bill has had to be amended to insert these provisions.  Surely these should have been in it from the beginning. The only reason why they are being brought forward now is because of the objection raised by us. I have never been able to understand why, when this Bill was being drafted, it was not drafted to include these provisions, because even if it were believed that there was nobody other than the present Attorney General who might benefit as a result of them, there was nothing to be lost by drafting the Bill in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way they were originally drafted certainly gave the impression that the intention was to confine the benefit to the present Attorney General and, if there were any previous occupant of the position who would have qualified for the same benefit, to exclude him or his widow, <Col N="2503" /> as Deputy O'Malley has pointed out. I am not saying that that was the Government's intention but I am saying that the Government left themselves wide open to the interpretation of this draft in that way and that it would have been far better if what is now before us had been in the Bill originally.  However, it is better late than never.  Again, I think it is an indication and it is a vindication of the attitude which we adopted on this Bill that we now get these sections being introduced in these two amendments which make the Bill a far better and more acceptable Bill from everybody's point of view than it was before.</P>

      <P>This amends section 15 of the Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Act, 1938, which provides for the payment of a gratuity of one half of salary to an Attorney General who has three or more years of service.</P>
      <P>It is a technical amendment arising from the fact that, under section 8 of this Bill, two rates of salary&mdash;£4,430 per annum to an Attorney General who is a Member of the Oireachtas and £7,213 to an Attorney General who is a Member of neither House of the Oireachtas&mdash;will be payable in lieu of the existing single rate.

      <P>No.  If he is fulltime and a Member of the House he would be pensionable.  If he were not a Member of the House he would get the gratuity but he would not get the pension.  If an Attorney General were fulltime but not a Member of the House he could gather pension on his service but if he is not fulltime he could only get a gratuity.  That would seem to me to be a fair situation.  We are not giving both.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2506" />
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say on this Stage, as I have said earlier on the amendments, that it is unfortunate that the Bill as presented to the House did not contain what is now in it by way of amendments passed today.  If it had, there is no doubt that there would have been a great deal less difficulty with this measure.  I do not wish at this stage to reintroduce the regrettable acrimony which prevailed in the discussion of certain Stages of the Bill.  Nevertheless, I must say this much: as far as we are concerned, we found that the Bill as printed and introduced was drafted in the way it was without any provision whatever relating to the allowance for the Opposition and when we knew that every previous such Bill had contained such a provision and when we knew that the Government had been reminded of this we could not escape the conclusion that the omission was not a mistake, that it was deliberate. We protested against this and the Minister then introduced an amendment which, as we know, was ultimately withdrawn and which had certain provisions in relation to the Opposition allowance and in relation to an allowance for Members or parties on the Government side.</P>
      <P>It should be clearly understood that it was not intended by the Government when they introduced this Bill either to increase the Opposition allowance or to provide any sum to the Government parties.  If that had been intended, presumably it would have been in the Bill in the first place. If confirmation of that is required, the hasty drafting of the amendment brought in to do it reveals all too clearly just how hasty it was and how far absent from the Government's mind it was when introducing this Bill either to provide the increase in the Opposition allowance or to provide any sums for the Government parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, there are a number of lessons to be drawn from this.  One of them I would commend to the Members on the other side of the House, that is, that they should realise that but for the attitude adopted by the Opposition on this Bill the allowances being paid to the <Col N="2507" /> Government parties would not exist. But, we, as I said earlier, believe firmly that the Opposition allowance is one thing and that it should not be confused with the provision of secretarial services for Deputies on any side of the House.</P>
    <P>I do not want to get into an argument with the Minister on this as to what may have happened in the past but it will be noted that in response to an interjection by me the Minister agreed that the legislation which deals with this matter contains nothing to justify the claims he has been making about the segregation in that allowance between secretarial assistance, on the one hand, and research, on the other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does.  I do not agree.  I pointed out that the legislation was based upon the Shanley Report of 1937 which deals with secretarial expenses and that the first time research was mentioned was in 1968.  Even though the wording was not the same the allowance was always for secretarial expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was&mdash;and I thought the Minister's answer was in the affirmative&mdash;the legislation did not refer to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there were difficulties in draftsmanship in 1938 as well as in 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway the legislation does not justify the claim the Minister made.  The significant thing, however, in this regard is that the Bill as introduced did not contain any of these provisions.  We regarded this as ominous.  We regard the granting of an allowance to the Opposition and the increasing of it to an adequate amount, when salaries and allowances of Deputies and Senators are being increased, to be an essential part of democracy. <Col N="2508" /> We think it unfortunate that this Government was the first one which did not observe that practice, the first one which displayed a willingness to try to do down the Opposition in that way.</P>
      <P>We do feel that the efforts we have made in connection with this Bill, difficult as they have been&mdash;and they have been extremely difficult for us as well as for the Government&mdash;have been more than justified by the fact that we now have provisions in the Bill which were not there originally and which we strenuously sought to have inserted.  It is unfortunate, too, in our view, that the same success has not attended our efforts to try to have the full Employer/ Labour Conference report implemented in this Bill.  As the House knows, we introduced amendments which specifically called for the implementation of that report on the dates and as to the sum recommended therein.  Therefore, there can be no doubt that this is what we were looking for, no more and no less.  The Minister did not accept this. It is a prerogative of the Government not to accept a report, but we would much prefer&mdash;and a great deal of time would have been saved in this House, if the Minister's approach had been to say: &ldquo;We do not accept that part of the report and this is the reason&rdquo;, and then we could have discussed the real issues, instead of which we spent a great deal of time arguing as to whether or not this Bill did, in fact, implement the report.</P>
      <P>The fact that we put down amendments at that time and that they were rejected is, of itself, sufficiently revealing of the fact that the Minister was not prepared to implement the report. We did suggest to the Minister that he could, under the terms of this Bill, go ahead and implement it as it was drafted in relation to Deputies and Senators and, indeed, in relation to the Taoiseach and the Ministers, if, as he claimed at one stage, there was doubt about what the Employer/Labour Conference meant, he would seek clarification from that body and, if it showed that the Bill as drafted was not implementing it, make an order to implement it.  However, the Minister rejected that too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2509" /> I regret the Government thought fit to approach the matter in this way.  I think it was a mistake.  Apart from the consequences for the individual Members of both Houses, I sincerely hope that, in the context of the economy, the Government's approach in this matter will not have serious consequences.  We should not allow the Bill to pass without again placing on record our disapproval of the Government's approach in regard to the Employer/Labour Conference in so far as it relates to the salaries and allowances of Members and office holders.</P>
    <P>I also regret the tone in which much of the debate on this Bill was conducted.  If anybody wants to apportion blame in this matter, they ought to read the debate and they ought to look at what was said at a very early stage in the debate, where it was pointed out that there was a danger of this kind of acrimony developing, and that it could be avoided.  I regret that it was not avoided.</P>
    <P>I can say, therefore, in summary, that while we are not satisfied with this Bill, we are a great deal more satisfied with it than we were when it was introduced and that the progress that has been made, although it does not go the whole way, justifies the stand we made.  Let me say this, too, in all sincerity and, I hope, in a spirit of generosity, that, having regard to what did develop in the course of the debate, there is considerable credit due to the Minister and to the Government for the fact that, despite what did develop, they were able to come along with the amendments they have introduced today. I am quite happy to pay that tribute to the Minister and to the Government, although, as I said, I regret the provisions were not in in the first place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one bit of disappointing news I have in reply to this debate, that the blame does not lie on this side of the House but rather on those who engaged in what we call a filibuster and what they call something else.  If the delay in the <Col N="2510" /> processing of this Bill had not occurred, I would be happy to know that Deputies would be receiving cheques for increased amounts in respect of their very strenuous services throughout the month of July. However, because of the obstacles that were put in our way in trying to render assistance to them, I am afraid they will have to wait until Seanad Éireann gives the matter their consideration and, I trust, approval next week.</P>
      <P>There never has been in the history of this House an Opposition so well provided for as the present Opposition. We can understand why they were anxious to ensure they were well paid; they obviously expect to be there for a long time to come.  I hope that as they go on their holidays they will realise the enormous sums which they will now have and which were not available to the very inadequately paid Opposition which replaced them in government.</P>
      <P>The total amount of remuneration which will be received by Opposition Members and the total amount of emoluments, and we are not talking about the fact that at least one of them is lucky enough to have a State car and two chauffeurs, which was not available to the last Leader of the Opposition, will exceed £300,000.</P>
