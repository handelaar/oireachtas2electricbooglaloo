    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce in view of the serious difficulty at present in obtaining motor insurance at a reasonable premium, the action he proposes to take in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Keating)</NameTxt>
      <P>The interim report of the Committee on Insurance contains a number of recommendations with a direct bearing on the level of motor insurance premiums and the difficulty experienced in some cases in getting cover, and I am at present considering these recommendations. I hope to decide on a course of action fairly soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister, in his consideration of the Report and his examination of the situation generally, to bear in mind that there are quite a number of young people today, under 25 years of age, who find it almost impossible to get motor car insurance. In many cases this results in very grave hardship, because quite a <Col N="1190" /> number of these people require motor cars for their business or for trade purposes. For instance, quite a number of tradesmen in these days need a motor car to pursue their employment.  Will he keep this aspect in mind in his examination of the Report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy might allow the Minister to answer Deputy Haughey's question first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, indeed, acutely aware of the embarrassment of these young people and of others who find difficulty in getting cover.  One of the reasons was, of course, that the rate of profit for the insurers in the motor insurance area was very narrow, partly because of a refusal&mdash;I will not speculate on the reasons&mdash;to grant an increase in premiums.  The Deputy will be aware that in the April Report I accepted the recommendation of the National Prices Commission and granted a 10 per cent rise in premiums on motor insurance policies which may, to some extent, alleviate this situation. Other steps which were recommended to me in the Interim Report of the Committee on Insurance are under active consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I mention one other aspect of it to the Minister for his consideration?  As I say, people under 25 years of age seem to be very much discriminated against in this regard. Would the Minister bear in mind that the State insists that these people have insurance before they are permitted to tax their cars?  Therefore there is an obligation on the State and on the Minister, or the Minister for Local Government, to facilitate these people in getting insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the point the Deputy makes, but I am sure he is aware that a scheme is operated by my colleague in Local Government which assists such people by intervening with the insurance companies in this operation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lemass has intimated that he wishes to ask a supplementary question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister is examining this problem, will he bear in mind such people as professional drivers, as I would call them, commercial travellers and mature people like actors, and so on, whose premiums are usually very heavy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I will.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems to be a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That came up last week and I expressed my thoughts then.  I would refer the Deputy to the record.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>My question in relation to insurance might not be directly relevant, but has the Minister any plans for insuring vehicles that have been insured with companies who have now opted out of insurance for motor vehicles and they are left without any insurance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a scheme to which I have already referred in reply to Deputy Haughey which is operated through the Department of Local Government for providing assistance where such cases arise.  Perhaps it is not totally satisfactory but it solves the problem for many people who make representations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister arrange for the companies in question to notify to their insured persons that this arrangement exists?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LorcanAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that people under 25 years of age who have motor cycle insurance and apply for motor car insurance cannot even get a quotation from insurance companies?</P>

    <Col N="1192" />
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware not that it is impossible but that it is very difficult for some people to get cover. Perhaps the Deputy is aware that one of the items in the Interim Report was a recommendation that a representative board should be set up to advise on premiums, to advise on the collection of statistics, and to process complaints. I am pursuing this recommendation actively, which may go a considerable way to overcome the difficulty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he intends to introduce legislation to expedite the payment by insurance companies of personal injuries damages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of the delay in settling insurance claims for personal injury arises from the need to have cases heard by the courts and there is little that can be done by way of legislation to expedite such hearings.</P>
      <P>One of the recommendations on motor insurance in the Interim Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Insurance Industry is for the introduction of a system of interim payments of claims.  This and other recommendations in the report involve some difficult legal questions and require consultations with a number of interested Government Departments before decisions can be taken on them.  These consultations have been initiated and are still in progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that very often five years elapse before these claims are dealt with?  Is he further aware of the economic blackmail involved in the system that obtains at the moment whereby a man who has nothing but his ordinary weekly wages is offered, say, £3,000, when £10,000 would be a more likely offer?  He is left without work, without money, over this period.  It is scandalous economic blackmail.  Is the Minister aware of it, and can anything be done about it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware of it.  The Minister inherited a very unsatisfactory situation in regard to the whole matter of motor insurance. Various remedies are being actively pursued in the ways I have indicated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Trade matters of mutual interest were discussed in the course of these talks.  The talks were useful and constructive and helped to further develop the trade and commercial contacts between Ireland and Bulgaria.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>

Lest a wrong impression might be <Col N="1195" /> created by the wording of the Deputy's question I should mention that the larger agencies themselves would favour some sort of legislative control.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is perhaps aware that, in this particular area, there are good and bad.  I do not want to seem to agree with the impression in the Deputy's question.  There are two sorts and the good ones, in fact, seek regulation which I propose to introduce.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The free post-primary transport scheme is limited to the transport of pupils whose residence is not less than three miles from the nearest post-primary school at which free education is available.  The distance from Glenbrook to Rochestown, measured by the shortest available public road, is substantially less than three miles.  Glenbrook children, therefore, do not qualify for free transport.</P>
      <P>I may add, however, that children from this area who travel on public buses to school in Rochestown by a longer route, have the benefit of transport which is free in part since their fares are heavily subsidised by my Department.</P>

      <P>It is not correct to say that the judgment of the Supreme Court is to the effect that the method used in taking blood samples was improper.  It is rather to the effect that the manner in which the samples were dealt with after being taken did not comply fully with the provisions of the relevant regulations that were intended to ensure against the possibility of the samples being interfered with before being analysed.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court decision does not mean that there was a miscarriage of justice in those cases where a person was convicted of driving or attempting to drive while having more than the prescribed proportion of alcohol in his blood and I do not accept that there is a case for granting any remission of the penalties imposed solely on the basis of the Supreme Court judgement.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>There is no arrangement at present whereby maintenance orders made by our courts can be enforced in any other country, including other member states of the EEC.</P>
      <P>However, under Article 3.2. of the Act of Accession, which is an integral part of the Treaty of Accession signed by the three new member states on 22nd January, 1972, this country undertook to accede to the EEC Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgements in Civil and Commercial Matters and to enter into negotiations with the original member states to make the necessary adjustments to the Convention. This Convention applies to maintenance orders, as well as to certain other court judgements.</P>
      <P>An <i>ad hoc</i> Working Group comprising representatives from the nine member states is now engaged in examining the problems of adapting the Convention to meet the requirements of the new member states. When the necessary adjustments have been agreed it may be taken that legislation will be introduced to enable this country to adhere to the Convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Convention comes into force between this country and the other member states, maintenance orders made by our courts will be <Col N="1205" /> enforceable in any of these states.  It seems unlikely at this juncture that this position will be achieved for some time but, meanwhile, I am hopeful that it will be possible to negotiate an interim arrangement with Britain for the reciprocal enforcement of maintenance orders.</P>

      <P>No consideration appears to have been given by the previous Government to inviting the exhibition to come to Dublin during the course of its extensive tour in Europe.  Even if it were possible to make arrangements at this late stage the question of cost would arise.  I understand that this is very great and has been estimated at not far short of £500,000 for one European city.  We estimate that through admission receipts, it would be difficult to raise more than a tenth of this sum in Dublin.  I think that is an optimistic figure.</P>

      <P>The trouble is that the exhibition is, in fact, in Europe and it would be too late to do so now. In any event, I do not think I would support a proposal which would involve a cost of that order and of that magnitude when the prospects of recovering more than a tiny fraction of it would be virtually nil.  It would be necessary to recover that cost from something like half the adult population of Ireland visiting the exhibitions at an admission fee of 50p each. It would be optimistic to think that one could get such an attendance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost derives from the problems of transport and insurance.  The Chinese authorities insist that the goods in question must be transported in a number of different ways rather than together, lest they should be damaged.  Insurance costs are very high.  There are a number of other costs involved.  In one centre the cost is not far short of £500,000.  I understand that this cost has to be shared by the sponsoring country and the Chinese authorities, in what proportion I am not sure. Certainly, a very heavy share, if not the greater share, accrues to the sponsoring country.</P>

      <i>Economic Prospects for 1973.</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an upturn in the pace of economic activity in recent months and the indications are that, on current trends, the growth rate for 1973 will be slightly over 4 per cent.  For the past three years the economy has been running well below capacity and it is encouraging that this year we can look ahead to a growth rate nearer to what we must attain if unemployment is to be reduced and living standards raised substantially. A growth rate of a little over 4 per cent, however, while welcome, will not be sufficient to take up the slack which has developed in the economy and it is clear that a higher rate of growth could be achieved this year without causing serious difficulties. Accordingly, the Government have decided to expand economic activity to obtain a higher growth rate which, <Col N="1238" /> apart from increasing employment and improving living standards, will help to take up the slack and underused capacity of recent years.</P>
      <P>A major problem facing the economy in 1973, however, is that of prices. The Government have inherited a very high rate of price rise&mdash;the consumer price index at mid-February was 10 per cent higher than at mid-February, 1972&mdash;and it will be difficult in a short period to bring this rate of increase down significantly.  Factors originating abroad, which are outside our control, will unfortunately continue to push up prices in the months ahead.  At least in so far as food prices are concerned, there will be compensating benefits to the whole community, particularly to those engaged in agriculture, and to the balance of payments.  This does not apply, however, to the prices we pay for our imports which are likely to cost considerably more this year.</P>
      <P>Favourable conditions in external markets for agricultural produce are again likely to result in a substantial addition to farmers' incomes.  The agricultural sector, which for long tended to lag behind in income increases, has made considerable progress in the past year or so and future prospects remain promising.</P>
      <P>The volume of consumer demand is expected to rise by, at least, the same rate as in 1972.  Investment, aided by the stimulus resulting from the increase in the public capital programme this year and also by the rise in the general level of economic activity, is likely to move ahead noticeably faster than in 1972.  This is particularly encouraging since, in the years ahead, increased business investment is imperative if we are to realise our full potential in more competitive trading conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Assuming that our competitiveness is not seriously affected by the likely rise in unit production costs&mdash;a rise which is all the more a matter for concern in view of the efforts being made in other countries to moderate the increase in incomes and prices&mdash;we can expect that the strong upward trend in industrial exports that was evident in 1972 will continue this year.  Agricultural exports are also likely to be <Col N="1239" /> dynamic.  Tourist receipts should be somewhat higher although, of course, the trend of events in Northern Ireland will continue to be a major factor affecting the industry.</P>
    <P>Imports have shown a very substantial rise so far this year.  In the first quarter they have increased by a third and, for the year as a whole, a significant increase over the 1972 level is likely.  This rise is largely related to the quickening pace of economic activity together with certain other factors such as the reduction of tariff barriers and the increase in import prices.  However, the increase in exports, together with the current inflow from the EEC agricultural fund, should go a long way towards offsetting the prospective rise in imports and ensure, despite a much higher level of growth, that the balance of payments will improve somewhat in 1973.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Prices and Inflation</i>
    </P>
    <P>A strong&mdash;and accelerating&mdash;upward trend in prices has plauged the economy for some years past.  The year 1972 saw no real improvement in inflationary pressures.  During the year as a whole the consumer price index increased on average by 8½ per cent as compared with 9 per cent in 1971. While there was some improvement in non-food prices during the year, food prices rose rapidly and continued to accelerate into 1973.  The indications for the present year are far from reassuring. As I mentioned, at mid-February, 1973, the increase in the index was 10 per cent, of which food prices represented over half.</P>
    <P>High meat and potato prices accounted for by far the greater part of the rise in food prices in the past year.  Because of the present international shortage of beef and other quality meat, the prices obtaining for our cattle have rises considerably. While this brings worthwhile benefits to the farming community, it has also meant that the price of meat to the shopper has risen.  The shortage of potatoes-because of falling acreages and a generally poor growing season &mdash;was an additional and quite an <Col N="1240" /> unexpected adverse development in 1972.  I must stress that these increases in food prices are entirely outside the direct control of the Government. However, every effort is being made through the operation of the price control machinery to ensure that, as far as possible, unwarranted increases are not being passed on to the consumer.</P>
    <P>A further external factor pushing up consumer prices has been the increase in the price of our imports which in turn partly reflected international currency realignments, especially the floating of sterling.</P>
    <P>While external factors have been important in contributing to domestic inflation in recent years, we cannot overlook the undesirable fact that the rate of increase in money incomes in Ireland has been out of proportion to the growth in national output.  In manufacturing industry, earnings rose by about 15 per cent in 1972: the volume of output, on the other hand, rose by only 4 per cent.  The consequent rise of 11 per cent in unit wage costs was by far the highest among EEC member countries and has a bearing on the fact that the rate of increase in our consumer prices was also the highest among those countries.</P>
    <P>Excessive rates of increase incomes and prices of this type have the most serious consequences for the economic and social life of any country.  While few are completely unaffected, those who lose most are persons in receipt of fixed incomes and those out of work or those whose jobs are jeopardised.  Real improvements in incomes and purchasing power are more important than illusory and inflationary monetary increases.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, it is vitally important that any future wage settlement following the expiry of the National Agreement, 1972, must make an effective contribution to slowing down the rate of increase in prices.  Profits, professional earnings, fees, dividends and other non-wage incomes must, in equity, make a similar contribution.</P>
    <P>
      <i>National Pay Agreements</i>
    </P>
    <P>The National Pay Agreements are a recognition that the social partners see <Col N="1241" /> voluntary agreements at national level as making a positive contribution not only to reconciling the interest of the social partners themselves but to the achievement of national economic and social objectives.</P>
    <P>The current agreement, therefore, offers the prospect of a further period of peace on the industrial relations front.  Considerable effort have been made by most trade unions and employers to ensure that the terms of the agreement are fully observed and these efforts are greatly appreciated and must clearly be maintained and intensified. The agreement marks the first step on the national level to the implementation of the principle of equal pay for equal work&mdash;a matter to which I will return later in my speech.  It is noteworthy, too, for its constructive contribution&mdash;both in relation to increases in basic pay and improvements in conditions of employment&mdash;towards improving the relative pay position of lower-paid workers.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Finance I am aware, however, that the agreement has other effects on the economy.  Inflation arises from many causes&mdash;import prices, profits, costs other than wages, wage costs&mdash;nearly all of which are interrelated. Yet, if compensation is sought in full to meet rises in cost which have already taken place, the rate of inflation is consequently multiplied.  It is in this context, and not overlooking the other inflationary factors at work, that I note that the pay increases given under both phases of the current agreement are likely to result in arise of about 9 per cent in our unit wage costs this year and they will bring about a further substantial increase in the wage and salary bills for 1974.</P>
    <P>Increases of this order, inevitably limit the scope for achieving any appreciable improvement in the rate of price inflation this year or next year.  Yet, unless we begin to get our rate of inflation down to at least the level of the other EEC member countries, we will find it increasingly difficult to avail of the opportunities presented by EEC membership.  Unless we avail fully of these opportunities, we will make little headway in reducing <Col N="1242" /> unemployment and providing more jobs for our people.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed to the principle that voluntarily negotiated National Pay Agreements, which meet the economic and social objectives of the community, are the best basis for economic development, stability and growth in jobs.  They have noted that the statement of objectives in the 1972 National Agreement makes it clear that the social partners are looking at increases in wage and salary incomes in the wider social and economic context.  The Government intend in the near future to explore with the social partners ways and means by which wage and salary developments might best contribute towards these objectives.  The next National Agreement must be an essential part of an anti-inflationary campaign and must, therefore, be one which will contribute to a slowing down in the rate of price increases. In the national interest, other income earners and profit makers will be required to play their part, too.</P>
    <P>A prime aim of this year's budgetary policy is, therefore, to set a favourable climate for the conclusion of an agreement that will be of maximum advantage to the economy and thus to the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the National Coalition's announced intentions, substantial increases in social welfare benefits and services are being provided in this budget, as a first step towards implementing our comprehensive social programme.  These welfare increases, together with this year's move towards fulfilling the promise to remove health charges and housing subsidies from the rates over four years, and also the removal of value-added tax from foodstuffs, constitute major contributions by the Government in the fight against inflation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Price control</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government are giving urgent attention to devising ways and means of strengthening existing price control machinery.  Under the Prices Acts, wide powers, which were in fact extended during the past year, are at <Col N="1243" /> present available to the Government in relation to a broad range of prices and charges.  Guidelines disallow any element of price adjustments sought as a consequence of pay increases in excess of those provided for under the National Pay Agreements.  The Government draw on the advice of the National Prices Commission.  Steps have been taken, under the Housing Acts, to bring the price of new houses under control.  A major task immediately facing the Government is to ensure that the removal of the value-added tax from food&mdash;a measure indicating our determination to combat inflation&mdash;will be fully reflected in consumer prices.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has undertaken that his Department, in consultation with the National Prices Commission, will give top priority to this task. Special precautions are being taken to ensure that traders do not increase prices in anticipation of the removal of value-added tax.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The European Communities and the budget</i>
    </P>
    <P>As this is the first budget to be presented since our accession to the EEC, I now propose to refer to the budgetary implications and to certain other matters arising out of membership which are of particular significance to this country.</P>
    <P>We must, as a member state, contribute to the operating costs of the Communities and the net contribution this year being provided for in today's budget is £5.0 million.  Also arising out of membership, Ireland will make certain other small payments not falling to be met out of the current budget and amounting to about £0.5 million in all.</P>
    <P>That is the debit side.  On the credit side of the current budget, there are certain consequential reductions in expenditure which would otherwise have had to be met by the Exchequer and provided for in today's budget.  These represent mainly relief from agricultural support payments.  As a result of our participation in the Community's Common Agricultural Policy, our farmers have access to higher market <Col N="1244" /> prices.  Furthermore, the Community's Agricultural Fund bears the cost not alone of subsidies necessary to close any gap between the domestic and the export prices for our agricultural products but also the cost of any intervention necessary to keep domestic prices above the particular floor, or guaranteed, level set by the Community.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the resultant gross savings in current Exchequer expenditure in 1973-74 will be about £33 million.  This fact should be borne in mind in connection with table 5 of the current budget tables detailing State support for agriculture.</P>
    <P>A further financial gain is that, under Community regulations governing social security for migrant workers, we will be recouped by the British Government in respect of the provision in this country of social services for dependants of persons resident in Britain or for British pensioners resident here.  Estimated receipts under this head in 1973-74 will amount to about £1.5 million.</P>
    <P>In sum, taking account of the items I have mentioned, the net Exchequer gain on the current budget in 1973-74 from EEC membership is estimated to be of the order of £29 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Effect of EEC entry on agriculture</i>
    </P>
    <P>The most immediate gain from entry to the EEC arises in relation to agriculture. However, even before joining the Community, farm prices and incomes had begun to show a dramatic improvement.  The year 1972 was an exceptionally good year for farmers. Farm prices rose by about 20 per cent and out put by 2 per cent.  With the price of farm inputs rising at a slower rate than farm prices, this gave rise to the greatest ever annual increase in farm incomes.  Total farm incomes rose by over £70 million or about 35 per cent.  All the indications are that there will be a further very substantial increase in farm incomes in 1973.</P>
    <P>The EEC Common Agricultural Policy to which I referred earlier has operated in Ireland since February last.  While it will be some time before our farmers can enjoy its full benefits, <Col N="1245" /> it will nevertheless have a striking effect on farming, even in its first year.  The most immediate and obvious effect has been on prices.  The minimum intervention, that is the floor, or guaranteed, prices recently decided on by the Ministers for Agriculture are on average about 20 per cent above the level ruling in Ireland 12 months ago.  For cattle and milk, which are our main products, guaranteed prices are some 30 per cent above last year's level.</P>
    <P>The second gain to farmers is security of access to markets.  No longer do we face the threat that trade barriers will be erected against our exports to the Community.  Such trade obstacles as still exist will be gradually dismantled, thus further obviating the need for costly Exchequer export subsidies.</P>
    <P>The third and, in the long term, perhaps the most important effect of the Common Agricultural Policy is that our farmers will be put on the same competitive footing as those in other member countries.  Also, a common scheme for modernisation of farms and improvement of farm structures is being implemented throughout the Community.  A new scheme of aids for certain less-favoured areas, which can benefit large parts of this country, is being formulated.</P>
    <P>Our farmers, therefore, through higher prices, secure access to markets and improved competitive situation <i>vis-á-vis</i> fellow producers in other countries, will be in a position further to contribute to the growth not alone of their own industry but to that of the whole economy.  This, I am happy to say, they appear to be doing already.  Indications are that the level of investment in agriculture has increased significantly, particularly in the livestock and milk sectors where the greatest opportunities exist.  Demand for investment grants and especially for credit has increased sharply and it is the Government's intention to provide the necessary resources to meet this demand.  Increased financial allocations have already been made for farm building <Col N="1246" /> grants and land reclamation.  Particular attention as drawn to the increase of over £11 million provided in the capital budget for agricultural credit.</P>
    <P>I might add that prices this year for our main agricultural products&mdash;except those for sheep&mdash;have been settled satisfactorily by the EEC Council of Ministers.  The Minister for Agriculture is, however, pressing the EEC to introduce a common policy for sheep.  Although prices for sheep and lambs were good during the year, our sheep flocks are not showing the desired expansion and, accordingly, I am providing an additional £500,000 in this budget to promote the development of the sheep industry.  This sum will be spent on improving the hogget ewe subsidy scheme and on renewing and improving the extension made last year to the mountain whether lamb scheme.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will shortly announce details of the improvements.</P>
    <P>The EEC price settlement resulted in higher prices for our butter and other dairy products and in new subsidy arrangements for butter for home consumption.  The Government are anxious to keep the increase in the price of butter to consumers to an unavoidable minimum and I am, therefore, providing and extra subsidy of £0.6 million for this purpose.  Also in the context of agriculture, I would like to mention that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries will announce alterations in various capital aids for buildings and equipment. Provision for these, likely to cost about £0.3 million, will be a charge on the capital budget.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Economic and Monetary Union</i>
    </P>
    <P>I shall now turn to certain other major issues arising out of membership of the EEC which are of prime importance to this country.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the Community is committed since 1969 to achieving economic and monetary union in stages by 1980.</P>
    <P>The programme for the second stage of economic and monetary union, which is due to commence on <Col N="1247" /> 1st January next, is now being prepared. This stage will, the Community accepts, need to take full account not only of economic and monetary conditions within the Community but also of developments on the wider world scene and their implications for the future.  For our part, we will emphasise the desirability of priority for measures designed to speed up economic union since, in our view, progress on this front is a prerequisite to satisfactory progress on the monetary front.  The Government will be particularly concerned to ensure that, in line with the concept of harmonious and balanced development throughout the Community laid down in the Rome Treaty, the programme will include adequate policies and provisions relating to regional development and to the sectors of our economy which need basic adaptation and reorientation to help us to close the gap between our standard of living and that of other Community generally.</P>
    <P>Economic and monetary progress in the EEC will depend to a substantial degree on the level of economic and monetary stability in the other major trading nations.  The unsettled conditions on the foreign-exchange markets over the last few months have underlined the necessity for pressing on with the search for an improved monetary system that will be more responsive to the needs of the times. We are associated with our EEC partners and with the other members of the International Monetary Fund in this work and I hope there will be early and fruitful results.  All countries, big and small, need a stable economic and monetary climate if their trade and commerce are to expand.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Regional policy</i>
    </P>
    <P>The importance for this country of the Community's regional policy can hardly be over-emphasised.  It was agreed at the Parsis Summit in October last that the correction of the structural and regional imbalances in the European Community should receive high priority and that particular attention should be given to those regional <Col N="1248" /> problems which result from the predominant position of agriculture in certain countries, from industrial change and structural underemployment. Under these guidelines, our problems would qualify for particular attention.  Most important of all, the Summit agreed that a Regional Development Fund should be set up before 31st December, 1973.</P>
    <P>The Government are pledged to working for a Community regional development policy a that will assist Irish agriculture and our western and our other underdeveloped regions.  We intend, in accordance with this pledge, to do our utmost to see not only that the decisions of the Summit are implemented but that they are implemented in a manner and on a scale which reflects the major importance of regional policy for the future development of the Community.  It is clear that, unless the major imbalances within the Community are reduced significantly, the Community will lack the cohesion essential to its further evolution.</P>
    <P>In the implementation of Community regional policy, the main principles which we will strive to have adopted are these.  First, the Regional Development Fund must be financed on a scale commensurate with the great tasks it will face.  Second, its resources must be concentrated on areas where the most severe problems exist.  Third, member States must be allowed a certain measure of flexibility and discretion in deciding and applying the measures that are most suited to tackling their regional problems, while, at the same time, national policies should constitute a sensible whole when seen at Community level. Finally, Community institutions must ensure that their actions on different policy fronts affecting regional growth support one another and that the principles mentioned are reflected in their decisions.</P>
    <P>The Government will, of course, take any internal measures necessary to ensure that Ireland is ready to take full advantage of the opportunities which the Community regional policy will afford.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" />
      <i>Budgetary policy 1972</i>
    </P>
    <P>When the 1972-73 budget was being prepared, the economy was then, as now, experiencing a high rate of price rise and a steep rate of increase in unit labour costs.  As well, unemployment was high, and, for the third consecutive year, the economy was growing at a rate well below its longterm capacity.  There existed side by side the need both to moderate inflation and to boost domestic demand. In the event, the budgetary policy chosen by my predecessor was designed primarily to improve the growth performance of the economy and also to contribute to a moderation of the pressure on costs and prices. Current expenditure was set at a high level and this, together with improved personal income tax reliefs, acted as a reflationary stimulus.  To stimulate the economy further, it was decided to finance the deficit of £34.8 million partly by a receipt of surplus income from the Central Bank but mainly by borrowing.</P>
    <P>It was estimated that these budgetary measures would raise the growth rate by about 1¾ percentage points between mid 1972 and mid 1973.  It was explicitly indicated that, to the extent that increased tax revenue would arise from the impact of the budget on the economy, the projected deficit on current account would be reduced.  In fact, extra tax revenue of £31 million arose from a high rate of inflation, the general effect of the budget on the economy, and also because of a strong rise in consumption of the &ldquo;old reliables&rdquo;&mdash;alcoholic liquor, hydrocarbon oils and tobacco &mdash;together with a sharp rise in motor vehicle customs duty receipts and certain estate duty windfalls.  However, expenditure rose also&mdash;although at a lower pace of growth than in recent years and absorbed a substantial part of the increased buoyancy.  The net effect was that the actual deficit on the current budget in 1972-73 turned out to be £5.47 million.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital budget 1972-73</i>
    </P>
    <P>Expenditure on the 1972-73 capital budget was £278 million, of which almost £249 million was incurred on the public capital programme.  Details <Col N="1250" /> of the 1972-73 outturn are included in the booklet <i>Capital Budget 1973</i> which was published recently.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital budget 1973-74</i>
    </P>
    <P>The public capital programme for 1973-74 has been set at a level of £305 million.  This shows a substantial increase of over £56 million or nearly 23 per cent as compared with the expenditure in 1972-73.  If we exclude the expenditures of Irish Shipping Ltd. and of the air companies, most of which are incurred abroad and financed from foreign borrowing, the programme represents an increase of 27 per cent over the 1972-73 outturn.</P>
    <P>The importance of the programme for the advancement of national prosperity hardly needs to be stressed. The exceptionally large increase in the programme will provide a marked stimulus to economic activity this year.</P>
    <P>Major provisions include some £76 million for housing and ancillary services&mdash;an increase of £21 million over last year's outturn; £19 million for educational buildings&mdash;an increase of nearly £3½ million; £57 million for agriculture&mdash;an increase of £11 million; £51 million for industry&mdash;an increase of £9 million, and £34 million for electricity development&mdash;an increase of £7 million.  Details of the outlays and the financing are contained in the capital budget booklet.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Revenue and expenditure 1973-74</i>
    </P>
    <P>Total revenue for 1973-74 is estimated at £734.7 million.  The main constituent&mdash;tax revenue excluding motor vehicle duties&mdash;I am placing at £614.2 million, an increase of £74½ million over the 1972-73 outturn. When appropriate adjustments are made for tax changes and other factors, the true buoyancy increase is £95 million or just over 18 per cent.  This is an historically high buoyancy increase, both in absolute and percentage terms.  While I need not emphasise the major difficulties in forecasting tax revenue growth in an inflationary situation, I am satisfied that this year's estimate is realistically based.  It was arrived at after a careful analysis of the trend of tax revenue buoyancy in recent years and an examination of each individual tax <Col N="1251" /> head in the light of the macro-economic projections for the year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Rates easement</i>
    </P>
    <P>Since taking up office, the Government have&mdash;in the limited time available to them&mdash;examined the non-capital expenditure allocations for 1973-74.  Following this examination and in the light of the requirements of the prevailing economic situation, the Government have settled the pre-budget expenditure total at £754.9 million including the net sum of £12.7 million being provided towards easement of rates.  The inclusion of this provision in the Book of Estimates gives effect to the promise made by the National Coalition that part of the health charges and housing subsidies would be transferred this year from the rates to the Exchequer, to be met from general taxation.  What the Government have done is, first, to freeze the rates contribution to health charges and housing subsidies at their 1972-73 levels so that the full increases in these charges over the 1972-73 levels that would otherwise have fallen on the rates in this and future years will now be borne by the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Government have decided to relieve ratepayers of the remaining liability in respect of health charges and housing subsidies.  This decision will be implemented in four stages and the first such step has been taken.  As a result of these decisions, local authorities need levy a rate for health charges and housing subsidies in 1973-74 equivalent to only 75 per cent of the rate levied in respect of them in 1972-73.  This will make a substantial contribution towards the easing of inflationary pressures on ratepayers. The Book of Estimates also includes a grant of £3.29 million to the Road Fund to finance additional expenditure on roads.</P>
    <P>With revenue at £734.7 million and expenditure at £754.9 million, there is thus an opening gap, before account is taken of specific budget changes, of £20.2 million.  Full account has been taken, of course, as I have explained earlier, of the net saving <Col N="1252" /> attributable to EEC membership in arriving at this gap.  Accordingly, it will be seen that, prior to the change of Government, the net saving to the Exchequer of £29 million, resulting mainly from the reduction of agricultural subsidies within the EEC, had sunk without trace in the sea of inflation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Budgetary policy 1973-74</i>
    </P>
    <P>In determining an appropriate budgetary strategy for 1973-74, in the light of the options open to me as Minister for Finance, a wide variety of factors affecting our economy has to be taken into account.  I must first of all have regard to the high rate of unemployment which must be reduced.</P>
    <P>Our second major economic task is to slow down the continuing high rate of price increase, for economic no less than social reasons.  The difficulty, of course, is that any action designed to deal with either of these problems in isolation could have serious adverse effects on the other and conflict with the Government's basic aim of significantly increasing employment opportunities. Moreover, in a survey of priorities, account must be taken of the Government's aim substantially to improve the relative position in our society of the lower paid and of the social welfare beneficiaries.  Finally, the economy is faced with the continuing need for increased infrastructural expenditure if we are to compete effectively in the larger European economic arena.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that there is no clearcut prescription in terms of budgetary policy that will simultaneously serve the various objectives.  I concur, however, with the recent OECD judgment that the economy needs the continuing stimulus of substantially increased government expenditure in 1973-74 if its full growth potential is to be realised.  This must be regarded as an economic priority for the year ahead.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the pronounced boost to economic activity provided by the high level of this year's public capital programme, I am satisfied that a further contribution is required from the current budget.  A further <Col N="1253" /> increase in current public expenditure is, indeed, unavoidable if the Government are to honour their social commitments. Since I start with an opening deficit, I have had to decide whether the enlarged deficit should be met by increases in taxation or by resort to borrowing.  As increases in taxation of the order necessary to close the gap entirely would only accentuate inflationary pressures, I have had to rule these out.  On the other hand, borrowing to meet in full the higher deficit would run the risk of overstimulating the economy and would unduly inflate borrowing requirements which are already stretched because of the substantially increased public capital programme.</P>
    <P>Having reviewed all the options, I have decided to impose some additional taxation so as to reduce the deficit to a more tolerable level.  The National Coalition's proposals for the easement of rates and the very substantial benefits provided for in today's budget will, thus, be implemented with only moderate increases in taxes in certain areas where the impace will be borne mainly by the better-off and will be least severe on the less well-off, whose relative position, I should add, will also be improved by the removal of value-added tax from foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>I shall now outline the new expenditure proposals which are being provided for today in addition to those included in the Book of Estimates. The major item in this category is the set of social welfare improvements.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Social Welfare</i>
    </P>
    <P>The pre-election statements of the National Coalition Government made it clear that financial provision would be made in this budget for improving and extending the social welfare and health services.  I am happy to say that the steps which we are taking in fulfilment of this commitment exceed anything ever before done in this field in a single budget.</P>
    <P>I mention here, as an indication of the magnitude of the proposals, that they will involve a total expenditure of about £51 million in the current financial year and a total of £68.7 <Col N="1254" /> million in a full year, of which the Exchequer will bear £38.9 million and £52.5 million, respectively.</P>
    <P>The increases in rates of social insurance benefits, social assistance payments and children's allowances which are being provided go far beyond covering the increase in the cost of living since these payments were last increased, and also go a long way towards bringing these various payments, particularly pensions and children's allowances, into line with those payable in neighbouring countries.</P>
    <P>Because of the great variety of improvements in the social welfare and health services provided for in this budget, I will refer at this stage only to the main points.  A more detailed statement will be found in the summary of the principal features of the budget which will be circulated shortly.  The personal rates of all social insurance and social assistance benefits, as well as health allowances, will be increased by £1 per week.  There will be an increase of 50p in addition for adult dependants, with an additional increase of 50p for adult dependants, aged 69 or more, of old age contributory pensioners.  Child dependant rates in both the insurance and assistance categories will be increased by 50p. Exceptionally, the increase for child dependants of widows and deserted wives will be 65p per week.</P>
    <P>To improve further the position of families, the Government have approved a substantial increase in payments under the general children's allowances scheme.  The present rates of payment under this scheme are 50p per month for the first child, £1.50 per month for the second child and £2.25 per month for the third and subsequent children.  These allowances will now be increased by £1.50 per month for each child.  Thus, the allowances will become £2.00 per month for the first child, £3.00 for the second child and £3.75 for the third and each of the subsequent children. At the same time, the maximum age for receipt of those allowances will be raised to enable children who are continuing in full-time education, are in apprenticeship or are permanently <Col N="1255" /> incapacitated, to receive the allowances until they reach the age of 18, instead of 16 as at present.  As a partial contribution to the cost of these proposals, the allowances under the Income Tax Acts for each such child will be reduced in the case of taxpayers whose net incomes exceed £2,500.  This will yield £1 million in the current financial year and £2 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The position of the aged will be also much improved by reducing the qualifying age and easing the means test for old age pensions.  The qualifying age for both contributory and non-contributory old age pensions will be reduced by one year from 70 years to 69.  So also will the qualifying age for the free travel, free electricity and free television licences schemes. At present, the maximum rates of old age and widows non-contributory pensions and deserted wives allowances are payable only to those whose means are assessed as &ldquo;nil&rdquo; while assessed means in excess of £5.60 per week totally disqualify a person without dependants from receiving any pension.  The means test will now be radically alleviated by disregarding assessed means of up to £4 per week so that a person with means not exceeding that figure will qualify for full pension, while total disqualification from pension will not arise for a person without dependants until his or her assessed means exceed £9.50 per week.  There will be further extensions for those with dependants. This very substantial advance will apply, as I have said, not just to non-contributory old age pensions, but also to non-contributory widows pensions and deserted wives allowances.</P>
    <P>The means test for the disabled persons maintenance allowances scheme will also be greatly eased.  At present, in the assessment of means of a claimant under this scheme, not only the claimant's own means but also those of near relatives are taken into account. In future, only the means of the claimants themselves and of their spouses will be reckoned.</P>
    <P>In the past, there has been much criticism of the postponement of payments <Col N="1256" /> of new social insurance and assistance benefits.  I am, therefore, glad to announce that all the foregoing improvements will be effective from July this year: in previous years social assistance and health improvements took effect from August and social insurance and children's allowances improvements from October.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am putting aside £2.5 million in the current year to cover a number of important improvements in the social services generally which will cost £4.2 million in a full year.  Those areas where help is most needed have, of course, been long apparent or have been pinpointed through the work and representations of voluntary bodies. Indeed, one of the Government's main aims in the application of this sum will be to encourage and assist existing voluntary efforts to identify and alleviare local community needs.  To give a substantial impetus to this most necessary work and to enable a considerable expansion to take place, a sum of £0.5 million will be devoted this year to home care welfare services, building up to £1 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>One particular area where assistance is badly needed and no direct help is available at present is for the severely physically and mentally handicapped under 16 years of age who are living at home and need constant care.  For these a new allowance will be introduced, costing about £0.45 million this year and up to £0.9 million a year thereafter.</P>
    <P>I am, furthermore, allocating £0.2 million this year and £0.24 million in a full year as a first step towards the implementation by the Ministers concerned of the various proposals in relation to deprived children which have been made by CARE.</P>
    <P>In welcoming recently the Report of the Commission on the Status of Women, I stressed the importance of that document as a contribution to the formulation of a strategy of social refrom. As a practical earnest of this Government's intentions in this regard, I propose to devote the remaining £1.35 million of the sum I have mentioned to a number of significant improvements in the social services so far as they relate to women, of which I will mention the following examples.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1257" /> There has been growing concern in recent years about the lack of support for unmarried mothers who keep their children.  This year a scheme will be introduced which will provide assistance for them on broadly the same basis as the existing scheme of allowances for deserted wives.</P>
    <P>Although the existing non-contributory scheme of allowances for deserted wives which was introduced in 1970 has, in general, been successful in providing much-needed assistance for this needy section of the population, experience of its operation has shown that certain improvements and easements in the regulations are desirable: I am now providing for these.  Perhaps the most notable defect of the existing scheme has been that hitherto if a deserted wife was divorced abroad by her husband she became ineligible to receive a deserted wives allowance. This practice, which added injury to insult, will now be abandoned and such persons will in future qualify for deserted wives' allowance.</P>
    <P>Full details of all of the proposals for improvements in the social services generally will be given in due course by the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>There is one final point to which I wish to refer.  It relates to a change this year in the financing of the social insurance elements in the improvements which I have just announced.  This year, the employer will be asked to bear a higher proportion than usual of the cost of those improvements for two reasons&mdash;first, in view of the relief which employers at large are being afforded in their rates liability on industrial and commercial premises and, secondly, as a move towards the continental pattern of allocation of the cost of social insurance schemes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Aid to developing countries</i>
    </P>
    <P>During the debate on the Estimates for his Department last week, the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced the Government's intention to develop a comprehensive programme of official aid for the developing countries. I believe that in pursuing this course the Government will be responding <Col N="1258" /> to the generous feelings of the Irish people towards the poorer regions in the world community.</P>
    <P>The elaboration of such a programme, which will entail commitments to substantial expenditure in the years ahead, will take some time. Meantime, I propose to make available during this financial year a further £250,000 on top of the sum of £1¼ million already being provided in the Estimates Volume and elsewhere.  The total provision for official development assistance, at some £1½ million, is double the amount provided in 1972-73.  It will be applied to increase the level of Government contributions to agencies tradionally engaged in administering multilateral aid, to contribute our fair share of aid through the European Communities, and towards the development of new projects such as the Central Agency for service by Irish personnel on economic and social projects in developing countries already referred to by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>

    <P>
      <i>Higher renumeration in the public sector</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have given full consideration to the recommendations for pay revisions which were made in the Report of the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the public sector.  They have considered the Review Body's recommendations in the light of the Report of the Special Committee of the Employer/Labour <Col N="1259" /> Conference which was set up to consider and advise on:</P>
    <P>the extent to which effect might be given to the Review Body's recommendations for each group covered in the report on the basis of, and for the duration of, the National Agreement.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, the Special Committee of the Conference recommended in December last that the national pay agreements should apply to the categories concerned.  The Government consider that there is no justification for further delay in dealing with the matter and have decided, with some qualifications, mainly regarding the operative date, to accept the special committee's recommendation. In the case of members of the Government and of the Houses of the Oireachtas, they have decided that the consequential increase will take place from 1st July next.  Increases for the judiciary and for officials concerned in the public service will take effect as from the relevant dates in the national pay agreements.</P>
    <P>The special committee of the Employer/Labour Conference stated that some of the groups covered by their report might have claims under the &ldquo;anomaly&rdquo; provisions of the national pay agreements.  I propose to have these resolved at the earliest possible date.  Apart from any other consideration, delay will add to the retrospective elements in the ultimate settlement.</P>
    <P>I am providing £1 million to cover payments likely to arise in this year from these decisions.  This sum is necessarily conjectural as it is not possible, at this stage, to assess the cost of &ldquo;anomaly&rdquo; claims.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Public service pensions</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government reaffirm the principle of parity for public service pensioners. Parity will be implemented on the basis of revising pensions with effect from 1st October each year by reference to the rates of pay in force on 1st June in that year.  Provision has been made accordingly in this year's Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1260" /> Subject to what I have to say later about the Road Fund, this completes my description of the expenditure side of today's budget and I shall now turn to taxation aspects.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Value-added tax</i>
    </P>
    <P>One of the most important elements in the National Coalition programme is the removal of the value-added tax from food.  Expenditure on food constitutes a significant proportion of the average housewife's total weekly outgoings and, in the case of the less well off, the food bill is by far the largest item in their weekly outlay.  As I mentioned earlier, when dealing with prices generally, it is, unfortunatly, in food prices that the greatest increases have taken place over the past year or so.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I am happy to announce that value-added tax is being removed from food from the earliest date practicable.  This is the most immediate and most practical step that can be taken to bring about relief from rising food prices.  The Government had hoped that it would have been possible to implement this relief from an early date.  But, because of the alterations which will have to be made by traders to operate the revised system, it is not possible to introduce the change before 1st September next. To ensure that all the necessary preparations can be made by that date, I have arranged for the Revenue Commissioners to consult with the business community in the matter. These consultations have already started.</P>
    <P>I have decided, however, that there would be no justification for removing the tax from certain luxury consumable items which affect family outlay only marginally.  The categories to which the concession will not be extended, therefore, include alcoholic drink, sweets, chocolates, ice cream, confectionery, and soft drinks.  On the other hand, I have decided to extend the concession to include oral medicines for human consumption.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, the Government regard it as essential to ensure that there will be a full corresponding reduction in the prices <Col N="1261" /> charged by traders for the items from which the tax is being removed.  Prices will be carefully monitored by the Department of Industry and Commerce and the full powers under the Prices Acts will be invoked in any case where a trader is not implementing the reduction. I should point out that, while the rate of tax that is being abolished is of course 5.26 per cent, the corresponding reduction in retail prices is 5 per cent.  This difference is accounted for by the fact that the 5.26 per cent rate is calculated on the price before tax whereas the price reduction will be calculated on the full price including tax.</P>
    <P>The cost to the Exchequer of the relief will be £16.75 million in a full year and £8.35 million this year.  This cost, together with a modest contribution towards reducing the current account deficit this year, will be recovered within the value-added tax system by increasing the existing rates on other items.  It has been decided to keep the increase as low as possible on the rate applicable to basic commodtities and to increase to a greater extent the rates on other, less essential, items.</P>
    <P>A part from dancing, where a special regime applies, the new scheme of value-added tax rates, accordingly, will be as follows:</P>
    <P>A zero-rate, instead of the present 5.26 per cent rate, will apply to food including oral medicines but excluding the less essential items I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>A 6.75 per cent rate, instead of 5.26 per cent, will apply to services and to the other goods at present subject to the latter rate, for example, alcoholic liquor, tobacco, petrol, fuel and electricity, clothing and footwear.  The effective rate on housing will, however, remain unchanged at about 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>A 19.5 per cent rate will apply to those goods at present subject to the 16.37 per cent rate, for example, hardware, electrical goods and furniture, furnishings, jewellery and sports equipment.</P>
    <P>A revised rate of 36.75 per cent will apply to those goods at present <Col N="1262" /> subject to the 30.26 per cent rate, for example, motor cars, television sets and radios.</P>
    <P>Details of the revised arrangements, including the exact definitions of the items to be zero-rated as food, will be published at an early date.</P>
    <P>In joining the EEC we took upon ourselves certain commitments regarding the harmonisation of value-added taxes in the Community.  As yet, however, the degree of harmonisation achieved by the EEC is not such as to preclude substantial differences in the rates and structure of VAT applied in the member states, and, accordingly, in making the changes just announced, we are not in conflict with present Community legislation.</P>
    <P>The pace and degree of the movement towards a Community-wide unification of the structure of the tax and, later still, towards a narrowing of the differences between the various national rates of tax are matters for discussion and agreement between the member states.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Death Duties</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government, before taking up office, undertook to abolish estate duty and to replace it with a new form of taxation of capital.  This commitment will be honoured.  However, any radical reshaping of our present system of taxing capital is a matter that requires detailed consideration.  The question is being studied in depth and a White Paper will be published as soon as possible.  This will afford all interested parties an opportunity to give their views on this important and complicated matter.  The speed at which it will be possible to replace estate duty by a new form of taxation on capital will, therefore, depend on the cooperation of the interests concerned.</P>
    <P>Meanwhile, I have decided on a number of proposals which will greatly alleviate the present burden of estate duty in those cases in which hardship is most likely to arise under the present system.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Increase in the general exemption limits</i>
    </P>
    <P>First, I propose to raise the general exemption limit for estate duty from £7,500 to £10,000.  This will provide <Col N="1263" /> significant relief in the case of smaller estates and is a move towards the complete abolition of the duty.  At present, legacy and succession duties also apply in the case of estates exceeding £7,500 and I propose to increase this limit to £10,000.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Abatement for widows and dependent children</i>
    </P>
    <P>Next, I propose to double the present estate duty abatments for widows from £2,000 to £4,000 and those for dependent children from £1,000 each to £2,000 each.  These abatements apply to estates not exceeding £100,000.  The increased relief will mean that property passing to a widow alone will be exempt from duty where the value of the estate does not exceed £25,000 as against £17,750 at present.  The reliefs will raise the exemption ceiling in the case of a widow with one dependent child from £21,430 to £33,333 and with three dependent children from the present figure of £30,200 to £41,666.  These limits will also be further increased, in appropriate cases, by a new relief which I am proposing for life insurance benefits and by an improvement which I am proposing to the present relief in respect of superannuation benefits to which I shall now refer.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Insurance policy exemption</i>
    </P>
    <P>I propose to exclude from the value of an estate for estate duty purposes the first £7,500 of life insurance benefits. At present superannuation death benefits of £7,500 or less are exempt from estate duty.  In my view it is difficult to distinguish in principal between provision for old age or retirement or by means of a contribution to a superannuation scheme by employees and contributions to, say, endowment insurance which in many cases is a substitute for a superannuation scheme in the case of self-employed persons.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Superannuation death benefits</i>
    </P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, while superannuation death benefits are exempt at present up to £7,500, once the benefits exceed this figure the full amount <Col N="1264" /> is liable to duty.  This restriction can nowadays cause hardship in many cases particularly since the estimated present market value of the pension payable to a widow under a superannuation scheme is included as part of the exempt sum.  It is, accordingly, proposed to remove the restriction so that, irrespective of the aggregate value of the superannuation death benefits, the first £7,500 will be excluded from the estate and will not be subject to estate duty.  This will ensure equal treatment as between persons whose conditions of employment provide for a superannuation scheme and persons who must effect insurance to secure similar benefits.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Artifical valuation</i>
    </P>
    <P>The final measure of estate duty relief relates to agricultural land. Agricultural land is valued for estate duty purposes on an artifical basis, its value being taken as 25 times the rateable value, less the redemption value of the land purchase annuity. Any other charges on the lands for which the deceased was personally liable are also deducted from the value of the estate.  If the value of the total estate on this basis is less than £2,000, this artificial valuation system is adopted and no estate duty is payable. I now propose to raise this limit to £3,000, thereby relieving many more farmers' estates from estate duty.  This will go some distance towards meeting the special problems which estate duty has posed for farmers.  Farmer's estates will also, of course, benefit, in appropriate cases, from the other estate duty concessions I have announced.  These death duty reliefs will take effect in the case of estates of persons dying on or after today.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Inheritance taxes</i>
    </P>
    <P>Legacy duty or succession duty, as appropriate, is chargeable at the rate of 5 per cent on property passing to brothers and sisters of the deceased and their spouses and to descendants of such brothers and sisters and to their spouses and, at 10 per cent, on property passing to more distant relatives and strangers.  I propose to double the rates of these duties.  As with the reliefs, the increases will take <Col N="1265" /> effect in the cases of estates of persons dying on or after today.  These duties do not apply at all in the case of property passing to a spouse or children of the deceased.</P>
    <P>The death duty reliefs which I have announced represent a major reduction in the burden of death duties without precedent in the history of the State.  They will cost £0.75 million this year and £1.75 million in a full year. This cost will be partly offset by the yield from the increases in the legacy and succession duties which, because of the time allowed for payment of these duties, will yield only an extra £0.05 million this year and £0.25 million next year.  The eventual full year yield of the increased rates is estimated at £1 million.  Thus the net cost to the Exchequer of all the death duty changes is estimated at £0.7 million this year, £1.5 million in 1974-75 and £0.75 million a year eventually.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Income Taxation Simplification</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have been considering proposals for the reform of personal income tax. Such a reform is particularly called for because of the dramatic increase in the number of taxpayers now within the scope of the tax.  A basic goal of the reform would be to promote voluntary compliance by taxpayers with the income tax code by making it as simple as possible for them to understand but, of course, sufficiently detailed to prevent abuse by those who wish either to exploit loopholes in the law or to evade paying their proper share.  I envisage a reform of the basic structure that will make it less complex and more manageable than the present system which, essentially, has remained unchanged since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>The changes I have in mind involve the merging of the present anchronistic and administratively costly dual structure of income tax and sur-tax into a unified system, graduated over the whole range of incomes, and the introduction of rounded personal allowances. The existing distinction between earned income and investment <Col N="1266" /> income would be substantially maintained by the grant of earned income relief of a fixed amount, as well as by the introduction of a lower rate of tax on the first slice of earned income. Such a scheme would help to remove the confusion at present existing in the minds of many taxpayers with earned income that their marginal rate of tax is 35 per cent whereas this rate applies only after the deduction for earned income relief has been made.</P>
    <P>My aim is to devise a scheme which will achieve the greatest degree of simplification at minimum cost to the Exchequer.  If a satisfactory scheme can be devised, the necessary legislative provisions will be enacted at the earliest feasible date.  In the normal course, the new scheme would come into operation next year, 1974-75, but the timing of its introduction would have to be examined carefully in the light of the present and prospective burdens on the Revenue Commissioners in the tax field generally.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Evasion</i>
    </P>
    <P>Immediately, and without prejudice to the more fundamental reform I have just referred to, certain measures require to be taken in the income tax field.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons why our rates of income taxation are so high is that a great many people who ought to pay a lot of tax pay little or, indeed, pay no tax at all.  As far back as 1962, the Commission on Income Taxation referred, in their seventh report, to the belief that evasion was widespread. This belief is probably even more generally held today, and has serious psychological as well as revenue consequences in that it tends to create a climate where evasion becomes socially acceptable.</P>
    <P>Steps have been taken in recent years to counter evasion.  These have not, however, proved adequate to deal with the problem, and further comprehensive provisions to ensure that the burden of the tax will fall more equitable are being studied.  In the meantime certain measures will be taken in the forthcoming Finance Bill, among which are the following.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1267" />
      <i>Penalties and interest charges</i>
    </P>
    <P>First it is proposed to rationalise the income tax penalties legislation so as to enable defaulters to be dealt with more effectively.  This will be accompanied by the imposition of a minimum interest charge, payable by employers, in respect of PAYE tax not paid over by them within the stipulated time.  Such a minimum interest charge already applies in the case of value-added tax.  In addition, I propose to introduce legislation to ensure that, in general, interest on overdue tax will not be a permissible deduction for tax purposes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Business entertainment</i>
    </P>
    <P>Next I propose to introduce a stricter test for determining the admissibility of expenditure incurred on business entertainment.  There has been widespread criticism that some concerns are entertaining on an unduly lavish scale, ostensibly for the purpose of building up the goodwill required to secure and retain customers. Under existing law, expenses on entertainment, however lavish, are admissible in computing the profits or gains of a trade or profession if they can be shown to have been incurred &ldquo;wholly and exclusively&rdquo; for the purposes of the trade or profession.  While reasonable expenses incurred on business entertainment will, of course, continue to be admissible, I propose to introduce legislation to amend the Schedule D expenses rule so that such expenses will not be deductible unless they have been incurred, not only wholly and exclusively, but also necessarily for the purposes of the trade or profession.</P>
    <P>There will also be a restriction on the giving of capital allowances in respect of the use of a capital asset, such as a yacht, for purposes of entertainment except where such use is connected with business entertainment provided wholly, exclusively and necessarily for the purposes of the trade or profession.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Capital allowances for cars costing over £2,500</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Finance Bill will also contain <Col N="1268" /> a measure which will have the effect of restricting the amount of capital allowances in respect to motor cars used by business and professional people to the allowances appropriate to a maximum price of £2,500 for each car.  This will ensure that business concerns who want their executives to use more expensive cars will have to carry the excess of more than £2,500 themselves and not pass on, in effect, up to half the cost to the Exchequer.</P>

        <i>&ldquo;Loss-buying&rdquo; transactions</i>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Existing tax laws permits trading losses to be carried forward, without limit as to time, and to be set against future profits in the same trade.  Advantage can be taken of this situation through a tax-avoidance arrangement, so that trading losses accumulated by a run-down company may be claimed in certain circumstances where the shares of the company have been acquired by another&mdash;profit making&mdash;company carrying on a similar trade.  The Finance Bill will contain provisions to counter devices of this kind.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Friendly Societies</i>
      </P>
      <P>A registered friendly society which is precluded from assuring to any person a sum exceeding £1,000 by way of gross sum or £52 a year by way of annuity is exempt from income tax. There has been a sudden upsurge in the number of those societies and the indications are that the underlying purpose is tax avoidance.  I propose, therefore, to introduce a provision which will make the division of surplus funds, from today onwards, chargeable to tax in the hands of recipients.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Benefits-in-kind</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further measure which I propose to introduce in this general field of tax avoidance relates to benefits-in-kind. Under existing law certain expense allowances and benefits-in-kind given to or provided for directors and higher paid employees of trading bodies are chargeable to tax in the hands of the recipients.  When these general provianc <Col N="1269" /> sions were introduced they were applicable only in the case of trading bodies.  It has transpired since that similar benefits-in-kind are being provided by non-trading bodies and the charge will be extended to cover these.</P>
    <P>It is also proposed to amend the legislation so as to counter the avoidance of a tax charge on company directors, in respect of certain benefits-in-kind, by means of the device of having the benefit provided through an associated company.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Life assurance premiums</i>
    </P>
    <P>Another measure which I will provide for in the Finance Bill relates to a misuse of life assurance relief. Income tax relief is, subject to certain restrictions, available in respect of premiums payable on life assurance policies.</P>
    <P>Policies have, however, now been devised which technically qualify for this tax relief but the primary purpose of the scheme with which the policies are associated is that of investment over a period of three years only.  Life assurance relief was never intended to be available for this type of scheme, and provisions will be included in the Finance Bill to confine the relief to insurance policies for a period of at least ten years where the premiums are payable at regular yearly or shorter intervals.  The new restrictions will apply to policies taken out on or after today.  I estimate that the measures to combat evasion and avoidance that I have outlined will yield £600,000 in this financial year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tax Reliefs</i>
    </P>
    <P>I now come to the more pleasant task of providing tax reliefs and concessions.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Wife's earned income relief</i>
    </P>
    <P>Representations have been made to me by various organisations that the tax code bears harshly on married women who take up employment and, because of its deterrent effect, gives rise to a shortage of female labour and a high turnover in certain sectors.  I propose to increase the present allowance for a wife's earned income from <Col N="1270" /> £74 to £104.  The combined married allowance and wife's earned income allowance will then be twice the single allowance.  The cost of this proposal will be £500,000 in the current year and £850,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Free depreciation</i>
    </P>
    <P>Free depreciation in respect of new machinery and plant, other than road vehicles outside the designated areas and its equivalent in the form of 100 per cent initial allowance expired on 31st March, 1973.  In response to many representations which I have received, I propose to continue the operation of these allowances for a further period. In taking this step, I am conscious of the need to provide every incentive possible to assist Irish industry in the task of re-equipping and modernising itself to enlarge further its export markets and to face growing competition from abroad in the home market. The enhanced allowances will be continued for a further period of two years only and will, therefore, end on 31st March, 1975.</P>
    <P>The 20 per cent initial allowance applicable to industrial buildings in any part of the country and the 20 per cent investment allowance in respect of new machinery and plant for use in the designated areas, both of which expired on 31st March 1973, will also be extended to 31st March, 1975.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Irish thalidomide children</i>
    </P>
    <P>Under the present income tax legislation, although compensation paid to Irish thalidomide children from the West German fund in the form of a capital amount would be free of income tax, monthly payments would, however, be liable and, as well, the parent's maximum income tax child allowance in respect of a thalidomide child could also be reduced.  I have decided to include a provision in the Finance Bill to exempt from income tax all compensation payments made from this fund to Irish thalidomide victims.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Relief for patent income</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have been considering the possibility of tax relief for inventors who contribute to industrial development and improved competitiveness.  To encourage research and development <Col N="1271" /> in Ireland and to stimulate inventions I propose to provide in the Finance Bill for the exemption from tax of all income from royalties on patents first-registered in this country in respect of any invention where the work in connection with the actual devising of the invention is carried out in the State and the inventor resides here. The concession will, of course, cover royalties from abroad where the invention has been subsequently registered in another country.  However, the new relief will not extend to the proceeds from the outright sale of patents as I do not wish to encourage the disposal abroad of Irish inventions, to the detriment of our own industry.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Occupational pension schemes</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year new and more liberal income tax provisions governing pension schemes were introduced.  As an immediate change-over to the new code was not possible, existing pension schemes were given until 5th April, 1980, to make the change.  Under the new code, death-in-service benefits may be paid in lump sum form up to four times an employee's final remuneration, whereas the corresponding limit in the earlier code was one-and-a-half times final remuneration.  In response to representations, I propose to provide exceptionally that the relevant provisions of the earlier code be amended to enable existing pension schemes to make the higher lump sum payment.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Contributions to universities for research</i>
    </P>
    <P>Under the present law traders can claim a tax deduction in respect of certain payments made to universities to finance scientific research.  Certain companies wish to make contributions to universities to enable them to facilitate research in other fields by endowing chairs, for example, in marketing and industrial relations.  I propose to amend section 244 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, so as to permit deductions for tax purposes in respect of such contributions by traders.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Human rights and fundamental freedoms</i>
    </P>
    <P>I also propose to introduce two <Col N="1272" /> provisions for the purpose of giving some tax concessions, subject to certain conditions, to bodies established for the purpose of promoting the observance of the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the implementation of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</P>
    <P>The first provision will give such bodies the same exemption from income tax as is given under existing law to a charitable body the whole of whose income is applied to charitable purposes only.  The second provision will ensure that annual contributions made under covenant by any person to such bodies for periods exceeding three years will be recog-nised for income tax purposes.  As a consequence, a body in receipt of such contributions will be able, by virtue of the first provision, to claim a refund of the income tax deducted by those persons making the contributions.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Stamp duties</i>
    </P>
    <P>I am mindful of the extra financial burden imposed on house purchasers by the various expenses attached to buying a house and have decided to ease the burden substantially in so far as stamp duty is concerned.  I propose to introduce a new reduced scale of rates with complete exemption up to £1,000, a rate of ½ per cent on sales from £1,000 up to £2,000, 1 per cent on sales from £2,000 to £6,000, 1.1 per cent to 1.7 per cent on sales bettween £6,0000 and £7,500, 2 per cent from £7,500 to £10,000.  The rates of duty on transactions over £10,000 will remain unchanged.</P>
    <P>The new scale of rates will provide substantial relief to persons buying previously occupied houses, or new houses not qualifying for State grants, up to £10,000 in value.  For example, the saving on a house bought for £7,000 will be £110.  The new rates will also apply to sales of land and will benefit farmers purchasing small holdings or making additions to their holdings.  The cost of giving this relief is fairly sizeable&mdash;£0.40 million this year and £0.5 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1273" /> I propose also, as a further measure of assistance to persons who borrow money to buy moderately-priced houses, to abolish the stamp duty of 0.125 per cent payable on mortgages up to £10,000.  Mortages in excess of £10,000 will still be liable to duty. The cost of this concession will be £0.025 million this year and £0.03 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>To recoup some of the loss of revenue from these stamp duty concessions I propose to increase the stamp duty applicable to contracts for the construction, alteration and enlargement of office buildings from 10 per cent to 15 per cent.  This will yield an extra £0.33 million this year and £0.375 million in a full year.  These stamp duty changes will affect instruments executed on or after 1st June next. Effect will be given to these changes by way of an Order under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957.</P>
    <P>
      <i>White Paper on company taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>In response to the White Paper on Company Taxation in Ireland which was published last November, comments have been received from a number of organisations and these are being considered.  The main suggestion in the White Paper related to the adoption of a single-rate structure of company taxation with imputation of an appropriate proportion of the company tax to the shareholders.  In coming to a decision on this, regard will, of course, be had to developments in this field within the European Economic Community.  I will announce my decision as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Corporation Profits Tax Exemption</i>
    </P>
    <P>Last year the exemption from corporation profits tax provided on a temporary basis for certain public utility societies and other bodies, including building societies, was extended for one year only and therefore expired on 31st December, 1972.  Pending a decision on the issues raised in the White Paper on Company Taxation I propose to continue the exemption for a further period of one year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Taxation of mining</i>
    </P>
    <P>Under present law, profits from exploration or exploitation activities carried on in this country's sector of <Col N="1274" /> the Continental Shelf, for example those made by companies who are not resident in this country's jurisdiction for tax purposes, are not chargeable to tax.  It is proposed to include provisions in this year's Finance Bill to secure that such profits will be charged to tax. Provisions will also bring into charge employment on the Shelf which, in some cases, is outside the scope of Irish income tax.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that, in relation to the wider question of the exploitations of our mineral resources generally, an Inter-Departmental Committee have been examining and reviewing our taxation and royalty arrangements, with a view to recommending any changes deemed necessary.  It was envisaged that this review would assist in the formulation of a sound longterm fiscal policy for minerals exploitation which would give the State an equitable share of profits and which would, at the same time, be sufficiently attractive to the mining companies to ensure the continued development of our mineral resources in an orderly and efficient manner.  The Committee have submitted two interim reports.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Coal mining</i>
    </P>
    <P>The first of these related to coal mining which has been experiencing difficulties, resulting in the closure of two collieries.  In order to develop the industry and to provide employment, the Inter-Departmental Committee recommended that special concessions should be given to coal mining.  The committee considered that relief should be given in a flexible manner, on the lines of the abatement provided in section 55 of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960.  That provision enables certain payments to be made by the State to the lessee under a petroleum lease, related to the amount of taxation, royalties, <i>et cetera,</i> previously paid. Legislation on broadly similar lines could provide some relief from taxation for coal mining companies.  The amount of the relief would be determined from year to year by the Minister for Industry and Commerce with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The Minister for Industry <Col N="1275" /> and Commerce is, accordingly, making the necessary arrangements to introduce the requisite legislation to give effect to the committee's recommendation.</P>
    <P>The second interim report of the Inter-Departmental Committee related to non-bedded minerals and was received within the past few days.  The committee are now being asked to give urgent attention to the fiscal arrangements relating to other minerals principally oil and gas, including offshore operations.  The Government will ensure that effective policies serving the national interest will be formulated and implemented without delay.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Interest on certain bank deposits</i>
    </P>
    <P>At present, interest up to £70 on deposits made by an individual with the Post Office Savings Bank, trustee savings banks, and certain commercial banks is exempt from income tax. Banking institutions set up since the relief was introduced have sought to be included in the concession.  This, however, would be a costly move for the Exchequer.  On the other hand, the present position is clearly anomalous. Because the relief was introduced as a measure to promote thrift, I have decided that the best course would be to confine it to deposits with the Post Office Savings Bank and the trustee savings banks which are the main thrift institutions of the State.  The change will come into force with effect from 6th April, 1974.  I now come to the taxation measures necessary to reduce the deficit on the budget to manageable proportions.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Tobacco, spirits and beer increases</i>
    </P>
    <P>I have given careful consideration to the range of possible courses by which I could bring into the Exchequer some additional revenue to help close the budget gap with least effect on the less well-off and without unduly affecting the expansionary impact of today's measures.  I was struck by the fact that the &ldquo;old reliables&rdquo; have shown strong buoyancy over the past few years, particularly last year.  Moreover, they have not suffered a recent increase in rates.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1276" /> I have decided to increase the rate of duty on tobacco by the equivalent of 3p per packet of 20 cigarettes, and the duty on spirits by the equivalent of 3p per glass, on the retail price.  In arriving at these figures account has been taken of the proposed increase in VAT on these non-essential items as a consequence of the removal of VAT from food.  A Special excise duty equivalent to the increase in the ordinary customs and excise duties on tobacco will be levied on all duty-paid stocks of tobacco held by licensed manufacturers at five o'clock this afternoon.</P>
    <P>In the instance of beer, the retail price will go up by an amount equivalent to 1p per pint.  However, not all of the proceeds of the increase will go to the Exchequer.  The brewers have lodged a case for a price rise which has been considered by the National Prices Commission and an increase of 0.27 per pint has been adjudged to be reasonable by the Commission.  This finding has been approved by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The balance of the 1p increase that is 0.73, on the retail price will accrue to the benefit of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>These increases will operate from midnight tonight and will yield a total of £11.3 million this year and £11.4 million in a full year including the appropriate amount of value-added tax involved.  I might mention that the increases in taxation provide a margin for the incidence of value-added tax.</P>
    <P>This amount of additional revenue will help to finance the social and taxation reforms already described and I am confident that the consumer will understand the need for having recourse to these heads.  The duty on tobacco was last increased four years ago, and the beer and spirits duties were last increased two years ago.</P>
    <P>I should add that, with effect from 1st September next, when the value-added tax on these commodities will be increased by about one-and-a-half percentage points as a consequence of the adjustment following the removal of value-added tax from food, the increases now being made in the excise <Col N="1277" /> duties on tobacco, spirits and beer will be reduced so as to ensure that there will be no further increase at that time in the total taxation borne by these commodities.  In the case of duty-paid tobacco stocks, an appropriate repayment will be made, also.</P>
    <P>I did not have recourse to an increase in road fuel duties this year because the value-added tax rate in this sector is being increased and because of the changes in motor vehicle duties to which I will now refer.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Motor Vehicle Taxation</i>
    </P>
    <P>There is provision in the Estimates Volume for a grant this year of £3.29 million from the Exchequer to the Road Fund, from which grants are made by the Minister for Local Government towards the cost of road works undertaken by local authorities. Provision for an additional grant of £2.4 million to the Fund will be made by way of a Supplementary Estimate in due course.  The income of the Fund will thus be increased to £21.93 million which, after meeting the administrative and other expenses of the Fund, will enable grants for road works to be increased from £14.42 million in 1972-73 to £18.93 million this year.  The increase will, in particular, finance an expanded programme of improvement works on the national primary roads from which motorists will benefit.</P>
    <P>To meet part of the cost of the Exchequer grant to the Fund, motor vehicle taxation and charges for driving licences and driving tests are being increased with effect from 1st June next.  The principal features are a 10 per cent increase in the road tax on private motor vehicles; graded increases in the tax on motor cycles; revision of the scale of tax on commercial goods vehicles, which will increase the tax on vehicles not exceeding eight tons unladen weight; increase in tax on commercial and agricultural tractors and on driving licences; and a new charge on first registration of a motor vehicle or motor cycle.  Fees for driving tests and provisional driving licences will be increased by regulations to be made by the Minister for Local Government. <Col N="1278" /> Advantage is being taken of this opportunity to reduce the tax rates on commercial vehicles more than eight tons unladen weight, so as to bring current rates more into line with those for similar vehicles elsewhere in the interest of competitiveness in transport costs.  Particulars of the new rates are included in the statement which will be circulated shortly.</P>
    <P>The yield from these variations in road tax and related charges, is estimated at £3.75 million in a full year and £3.0 million this year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Post Office Charges</i>
    </P>
    <P>Apart from slight amendments in charges to bring them into line with the new decimal currency in February, 1971, the last increase in postal and telegram charges had effect from 1st October, 1970, while telephone charges were increased from 1st November, 1970.  In the meantime, the costs of these highly labour-intensive services have been rising steadily and a deficit of the order of £7½ million which this Government inherited would have to be made good from the Exchequer this year if corrective measures were not taken.</P>
    <P>In order to maximise revenue from all sources to meet not alone existing commitments but also the many concessions granted in this year's budget, I have found it necessary, therefore, to seek governmental approval for an increase in Post Office charges. This approval has been necessarily granted and the following increases will have effect from 1 July, 1973, and from 1 October, 1973 in the case of postal and telephone charges respectively.</P>
    <P>There will be a minimum increase of 1p for first and second class mail&mdash; letters, postcards and printed papers&mdash; and appropriate increases in other postal charges.</P>
    <P>Telephone charges will be increased as follows: coin box local calls from 2p to 3p: subscribers local calls from 1.66p to 2p and internal trunk calls by 20 per cent.  Rentals will be increased by £1 per quarter per exchange line and there will be some minor adjustments in other telephone <Col N="1279" /> charges.  Full details will be announced later by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. The estimated yield of these increases is £3.5 million in the current year and almost £8 million next year.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Deficit</i>
    </P>
    <P>I shall now summarise the budgetary position.  I opened with a deficit of £20.2 million.  To this must be added the extra expenditure of £43.8 million for which I am providing today.  These expenditure additions will be partly offset by the taxation increases proposed, which are estimated to yield a net £20.7 million.  There is a further offset, which arises in the following circumstances.</P>
    <P>Over the years, it has been found that the amount issued to Departments from the Exchequer has not been spent in full before the end of the financial year.  This is a recurring feature which operates to reduce the draw by the Departments concerned on the amount provided in their Estimate for the following year.  This feature has not been allowed for in the budgetary arithmetic in the past but I think the time has come, in view of its regular nature, to take it formally into account.  This I propose to do by making a deduction of £4 million from the expenditure side; this amount will represent approximately one-half of 1 per cent of the total budgeted expenditure.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, a total of £24.7 million to be offset against the additional expenditure of £43.8 million provided in this Budget.  The opening gap of £20.2 million is, therefore, enlarged by £19.1 million to give an apparent deficit of £39.3 million.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that, as a result of the expansionary effect of the Budget, the growth rate of the economy in the 12 months to mid-1974 will be about 5½ per cent without any appreciable deterioration in the balance of payments.  Tax buoyancy will increase accordingly and the actual deficit for the present financial year is expected to be less than now estimated.  Before concluding, there are a number of other matters to which I wish to refer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1280" />
      <i>Calendar year as financial year</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have decided to change the Exchequer financial year, the local authorities' year and the income tax year to a calendar year basis.  The changes will be made as early as practicable, hopefully from January, 1975, in the case of the Exchequer year and the local year. The change of income tax year will require more lengthy preparations but will follow the other two changes as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Government are satisfied that the switch to a calendar year basis will be in our best interests in the context of EEC membership.  The six original member states of the EEC already have the calendar year as their financial year and it is accepted that a switch by the new members would facilitate the co-ordination of economic and budgetary policies within the Community.</P>
    <P>A study of the legislative and other implications has been made and the various alterations required have been identified.  It is envisaged that the transition from the existing Exchequer and local year would be made through a nine-month financial period&mdash;from 1st April to 31st December&mdash;immediately preceding the first calendar financial year.  The change of financial year will involve rearrangement of the timing of the budget, yearly expenditure estimates, the Appropriation Bill, and other financial business in both Houses.</P>
    <P>Legislation will be required to give effect to the proposal and will be introduced in due course.  I shall give further information to the House when I have had an opportunity of further considering the various aspects involved.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Programme budgeting</i>
    </P>
    <P>The developing of programme budgeting is now under way in all Departments and it will be made fully operational over the next few years.  Programme budgeting will assist significantly in speeding up the application of modern management techniques in Departments generally, and will make a positive contribution to a rational allocation of public resources.  The system has, in addition to programme <Col N="1281" /> budgets, a number of components such as systematic analysis and review. So as to assist Ministers in planning their activities over a period of years ahead and to help the Government in their assessment of priorities, it was decided last year to advance the date of production of the programme budgets themselves.  It is hoped to use these budgets, on a trial basis, in connection with the settling of 1974-75 expenditure allocations.  While the emphasis is being placed for the moment on the programme aspect, which will help to ensure that public expenditure is applied as effectively as possible, the full system is continuing to be developed.</P>
    <P>
      <i>New Department of the Public Service</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Public Services Organisation Review Group regarded the setting up of the Department of the Public Service as the first priority among their recommendations.  The absence up to now of the legislation necessary formally to establish the new Department has been a restrictive factor.  The new Government are, however, determined to give priority to the enactment of this measure so that the new Department can be formally constituted as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Within the Department of Finance the foundations of the new Department are already taking shape.  As envisaged by the Review Group, three divisions have been created to cater for the basic functions of organisation, personnel and renumeration.  Each of these is developing its own activities.</P>
    <P>On the organisation side, much of the effort has gone into work on an experimental scheme to separate policy and executive activities of Government Departments on the lines recommended by the Review Group. The Departments concerned are Health, Industry and Commerce, Transport and Power and Local Government.  A concerted and phased programme to develop electronic data processing in the public services is being pursued.  A large computer, which will provide a service bureau for several Government Departments and public bodies, has recently been installed in a specially designed building in Kilmainham.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1282" /> On the personnel side, recruitment has improved generally and training continues to expand.  The effective development of the manpower resources of the public service is an urgent task demanding much attention.</P>
    <P>Central responsibility for pay and pensions&mdash;which constitute such a large proportion of Government spending&mdash;has now been concentrated in a single Division which has the major function in promoting staff relations.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Savings</i>
    </P>
    <P>The National Savings Committee deserve credit for the continued success of the Government's small savings schemes and I would like to pay tribute to the work which they have been doing.  The Committee have recently been reorganised and strengthened by the addition of new members and I wish them every success in their drive to promote the savings habit.</P>
    <P>The relative attractiveness of the Government's small savings schemes is being kept under constant review. Interest rates offered elsewhere have tended to fluctuate in recent times but it must be borne in mind that the rates offered by the Government are long-term assured returns.  Nevertheless, if it becomes evident that interest rates are going to be stabilised at higher levels than in the past, I will not hesitate to make appropriate changes in the rates available under the Government's schemes.</P>
    <P>Since its inception, the National Instalment-Saving Scheme has proved to be highly successful and, so far, has raised over £12 million for the Exchequer. Under this scheme a person agrees to save a fixed monthly instalment for 12 months and then to leave the proceeds with the Exchequer for a further period of two years.  At the end of that time, his savings are repayable with a tax-free 25 per cent bonus.  Savings agreements will begin to mature from next autumn onwards and I would like to encourage savers to leave their money invested in the scheme.  I propose therefore that savings left undisturbed after the original three-year period will have the <Col N="1283" /> bonus increased each succeeding year to rise to a total tax-free bonus of 50 per cent of the amount saved after three additional years.  For a person who has saved £1 per month and who is therefore entitled to a bonus of £3 at the end of the original three-year cycle, the offer will mean an additional tax-free £1 for each of the following three years, at the end of which his savings of £12 will have increased to £18.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Building Societies</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government are particularly concerned about the level of building society interest rates.  Recently, as a measure to lighten the increasing burden of housing loan repayment charges on borrowers from the societies, the Government decided that the special taxation arrangements which are operated by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to building societies would be available only to those societies which charge a rate of interest on house purchase loans that does not exceed a rate specified for the time being by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>In recent months there has been a decline in the net inflow of funds to the building societies.  If this trend were to continue it would have serious consequences for the construction industry and, in particular, for the achievement of the Government's programme to provide 25,000 houses annually.  An increase in the interest rates paid to investors and depositors would be necessary to arrest the falling off in funds available to the societies for lending.  The ability to pay higher rates on deposits, however, depends mainly on the return to the societies from their lending operations.  As mortgage rates are high, a further increase must be avoided.  My Department and the Department of Local Government are urgently examining the position to see how best to meet this problem.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Derelict sites</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government have been considering the social and economic consequences of the hoarding of property for profit, with particular reference to <Col N="1284" /> derelict sites and buildings in urban areas.  Where planning permission, either full or outline, has been given, the profits involved can be enormous. Non-use of existing buildings, and delay in developing derelict sites of this kind, impedes civic progress and militates against the common good.</P>
    <P>The Government are determined to discourage inaction of this kind by individuals or firms, and to take steps which will accelerate development and renewal.  As a first step, the Minister for Local Government proposes to ask local authorities in Dublin and other selected urban areas to examine this problem and report on the extent of it, and to obtain their views as to the most effective manner in which it could be tackled.  The Government have in mind the imposition of substantial financial penalties which would be progressive over time for unreasonable delay in development, and the possibility of imposing a timelimit on planning permissions.  Local authorities will be asked to consider the possibility of more vigorous action under the Derelict Sites Act to effect the clearance or possible compulsory acquisition of derelict sites and buildings generally.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Status of women</i>
    </P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the recently published report of the Commission on the Status of Women and to take this opportunity again to thank publicly the Chairman of the Commission, Dr. Thekla Beere, and the members for the valuable service they have rendered to the community. Their report is comprehensive and has wide implications for the social, political and economic life of the country. It is of particular significance that a group of men and women with differing backgrounds and occupations were able to produce an agreed report.  The National Coalition Government are committed to the ending of all forms of discrimination against women and the Commission's recommendations will be very helpful to them in considering how this objective should best be achieved.</P>
    <P>Many of the recommendations, of course, involve substantial additional <Col N="1285" /> Exchequer expenditure and will, therefore, require careful consideration both as to acceptance and timing.  I have, nevertheless, in today's budget moved some distance towards the implementation of the recommendations in relation to the income tax code in that I am providing for an increase of £30 in the wife's earned income relief.  The report also referred to the hardship attributable to the burden of estate duties on widows.  The measures I have introduced today, by removing many of the inequities of the system will ease the position of a great many families at this distressing time in their lives.</P>
    <P>On the question of equal pay, it is gratifying to note that the Employer/ Labour Conference in the National Agreement, 1972, has already accepted, in principle, the Commission's recommendations and has taken the initial steps to give effect to them. The equal pay provisions of the National Agreement will apply to the public service from 1st June, 1973. I shall introduce in the near future legislation to deal with the related problem of removing statutory prohibitions on the employment of married women in the public service.</P>
    <P>Also, of course, as indicated earlier, when I outlined the major social welfare changes, this year a striking amelioration in the position of women under the social welfare code will result from the improvements being provided for in the treatment of women in employment, deserted wives and unmarried mothers.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Conclusion</i>
    </P>
    <P>The budget which I have presented today, as well as being the first since our entry into the EEC, is the largest in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>Its primary economic purpose, within the room of manoeuvere allowed by inflation, is to provide a significant spur to growth which, by increasing employment and reducing unused capacity in the economy, will assist in solving our serious unemployment problem.  In the social welfare field, it provides the impressive improvements I have described which represent a major move towards creating <Col N="1286" /> the socially-just State which the National Coalition Government is determined to build.  The removal of value-added tax from food, and the shifting of the burden of rates to central funds, more equitably relate taxation to ability to pay.  The estate duty reliefs will go a long way towards easing the burden of the system pending its replacement.</P>
    <P>Any Minister for Finance, particularly a first-timer, is understandably disinclined to minimise the importance of a budget.  Nevertheless it is illusory and disingenuous to suggest that, with all the forces operating in our society, a budget alone can set right an erring economy or regulated personal incomes for a year ahead.  In a democracy the collective common sense of individuals is of much greater value than fiscal devices.</P>
    <P>Every citizen will benefit from this budget.  As I have indicated, the poor and disadvantaged are being helped on an unprecedented scale.  Everybody's prospects are being substanially improved by the growth in economic activity resulting from the massive injection of a 27 per cent increase in public capital expenditure and the expansionary effects of this budget.  There are new opportunities for investment in an expanding economy which is being prudently managed. If the value of these real improvements is not to be diminished, it is vital that they should be taken fully into account in the course of future pay and other income discussions.</P>
    <P>Speaking in the debate on the nomination of the Government on 14th of March last, the Taoiseach declared his belief in government by consultation. We propose to engage now in meaningful talks with representatives of the different interests in our economy so that the social and economic improvements effected by this budget will be properly reflected in future income patterns and wealth distribution.</P>
    <P>In sum, I feel that the proposals in today's budget will contribute to the transformation of our country into a progressive society based on social justice.</P>

    <P>NOTE:&mdash;Figures are net of appropriations-in-aid (receipts).</P>
    <P>* Includes both capital and non-capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>** The reduction arises mainly from the ending of Exchequer liability for export losses on the coming into operation of the EEC Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to view this budget in perspective, it is necessary to recall that no Irish Government has ever been in such a favourable position in introducing a budget as this Government and the reasons for that are nothing whatever to do with the present Government.  There are two main reasons.  The first main reason is the sound state of the economy at present, resulting from the sound management of the economy by the Fianna Fáil Government and the other is the bonanza available because of our joining the EEC, a proposition which was bitterly opposed by some of the Labour Party Members now in Government, so that neither of these reasons is of any credit to the present Government.</P>
      <P>Knowing that, the next matter is, the Government having been placed in this unique position, how do they avail themselves of the opportunity?  I noted that the Minister for Finance said that the EEC savings had sunk without trace.  The fact is, and he knows it as well as I do, that if we were not in the EEC, he would today have to provide over £27 million extra for agricultural subsidies.  He knows that, so there is no use trying to argue and make an alibi out of that one.  But I do think it is important to note that the basic strategy of the budget which this House had before it last year was successful, so successful indeed that the description by the Minister for Finance of the economy during the past year was scarcely recognisable when one compares it with the descriptions given by Fine Gael and Labour speakers a few short months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year, I would remind the House, we went for growth and we achieved it, and we achieved it without adding to the inflationary pressures already existing in the economy, but I would also remind the House that this growth was achieved in a budget which, for the first time since 1959, did not cause any increase in prices by way of taxation as compared with this budget which is going to cause a prices explosion.  At the same time, while it did not cause <Col N="1303" /> any price increases by way of taxation, it gave substantial improvements in income tax allowances, unlike this budget, and it also gave substantial improvements in social welfare payments and that without the benefit of the EEC bonanza.</P>
    <P>All the economic commentators are agreed, and today the Minister for Finance agrees, that in effect the economy is set fair.  Therefore, when one is faced with this unique opportunity which this Government have, and looks at how they approached it, one realises that any fool could spend the EEC money.  The real question is how is it spent and is it spent wisely.  This budget, viewed in that perspective, is a failure.  This budget is a budget of lost opportunities.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is, of course, primarily responsible for the budget but it is the responsibility of the Government as a whole.  Deputies will recall that in the weeks prior to the formation of this Government, and subsequent to the result of the general election, the newspapers were painting a harrowing picture of the terrible dilemma in which the present Taoiseach found himself.  The poor man was up to his armpits in talent. How was he going to choose?  I must say my heart bled for him but eventually he managed to overcome the difficulty and he assembled the greatest talent we have ever seen, according to some commentators, on those benches.  All of these talents were put into preparing this budget and now we see what they are worth.  Faced with this opportunity what did they do?  They have thrown away a unique opportunity that no Irish Government ever had before and no Irish Government is ever likely to have again.  We propose to spell that out.  The unfortunate fact is that there was an opportunity today for whatever Government were in power to make a huge stride in real distribution of income and at the same time continue the growth in the economy which was being brought about under last year's budget.</P>
    <P>That opportunity has been thrown away and, unfortunately, it has been <Col N="1304" /> thrown away, I believe, because the Members of the Government opposite, if they did not know themselves, had been provided with a blueprint by us on how to do it and they were too small-minded to admit that their hastily prepared election plans were socially wrong.  They adhered to them with the result that we have today this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out that taking the overall economic effects of this budget we find that there is, in fact, a deficit of £43.3 million.  The Minister for Finance produces a sleight of hand method of reducing that by £4 million.  If that happens to go wrong during the year we will find that payments of grants and other funds from the Government Departments will be held up towards the end of the year to make sure they will be proved right.  He ends up with a deficit in the region of £39 million.</P>
      <P>As far as any Government are concerned the question of whether to budget for a deficit is a serious one. Indeed, it is so serious that last year was the first time in our history that a Minister for Finance deliberately budgeted for a deficit.  To budget for a deficit for economic reasons is laudable and, indeed, is the duty of the Government&mdash;in other words, to budget for a deficit, because the growth rate is at a particular level and by budgeting for a particular deficit, one can bring the growth rate up to the figure at which our economy can sustain growth over a period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is certainly something any Government should do but to budget for a deficit because of political weakness, because of either inability to reduce expenditure, unwillingness to impose the necessary taxation, or both, is not only reprehensible but could lead to economic and monetary chaos.  I do not want to over-dramatise the situation here today because I know that the Minister for Finance was being subjected <Col N="1305" /> to pressures of all kinds to budget for a much larger deficit than he did here today.  I congratulate him on not yielding to that pressure because it really could have caused the most appalling consequences for our economy. Nevertheless, it is clear, when one looks at the figures for growth, that the deficit is too high.  I referred to the ESRI forecast which showed an estimated 5 per cent growth rate this year.  The Minister's own Department have recently forecast something over 4 per cent but in either case one has to add in 1½ per cent in respect of the effect of the terms of trade and you end up with a growth rate in the region of 6 per cent, perhaps higher.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows as well as I do when you reach that stage you are getting close to the danger area for any sustained period.  I know there are many people who do not seem to understand that to budget for an enormous deficit without relating it to economic realities is something that can cause grave hardship to every man, woman and child in this country.  Let me put it this way.  If this were not so is it not clear that many years ago a Minister for Finance would have budgeted for a huge deficit or, indeed, today the Minister for Finance need not have stopped where he did?  Why not £100 million or £200 million?  Of course, you cannot do that.  There are economic realities.  The Minister has, in my view, exceeded the budget deficit which would be justifiable on the best interpretation of the projections.  For that reason his budget on the overall economic aspect will add to inflation, will add to the amount of borrowing that has to be done by the Government, will probably reduce the amount of borrowing available to industry and in the private sector generally, and despite the very substantial borrowing and deficit that is involved this budget did not contain many desirable improvements, particularly in the income tax field, such as we had last year.</P>
    <P>In regard to social welfare, as I have said all of these alleged wonderful talents arrayed across there were brought to bear on this budget.  We know that in the past we have had amongst members of the present Government the most outstanding <Col N="1306" /> bleeding hearts in this country.  They have bled for every cause.  Here was their chance.  Here they were in action. They had the responsibility and we can judge now what their real thoughts are and their real talents are by what they have produced today.  Remember they had an opportunity that nobody else ever had or will have again and this is what they did.</P>
    <P>First of all, they have provided lower benefits for the social welfare classes than were going to be provided under the Fianna Fáil proposals but worse than that they are costing far more. Let me give an example.  There is £1.00 per week provided for the various recipients and 50p for adult dependants.  Our proposals, of course, were £1.00 for adult dependants as well as £1.00 per week for the recipient.</P>
    <P>This is just one example and we will spell out in greater detail all the differences, but there is a basic reason for this.  It is that the whole approach of the Coalition Government is to give benefits across the board, not related to the people's needs.  Children's allowances make a good example: everybody is getting them.  The Minister has now made a gesture in regard to income tax but he knows that this is totally ineffective and adds to the administrative cost of tax collection which in that particular area is presenting an enormous problem to the Revenue Commissioners.  All the various rates of tax allowances arising in regard to children's allowances are creating enormous problems for the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>The right solution to this problem is to give the money to the people who need it, not to those who do not, but the Government with bleeding hearts, come here today and they propose to give the benefits across the board to rich and poor, not just in social welfare but all along the line.  This is the characteristic of the Government.</P>
    <P>There have been some suggestions from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that promises were kept.  Of course they were not kept.  In the social welfare field, as we shall demonstrate later, there has been a complete <Col N="1307" /> breach of promises made during the election.  Let me give you one very good example.  I am sorry that the two men concerned are not in the House but it is easy for anybody to verify this because tens of thousands of people are witnesses to it.  There was a promise by the Coalition in regard to abolishing the means test and reducing the age limit for old age pensions that was spelled out at a joint press conference given by the Fine Gael and Labour Parties.  It was spelled out even more categorically on television by the Labour Party's then spokesman on Finance, now Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tully, when he said: &ldquo;The Coalition Government will reduce the pension age to 65 and abolish the means test in its first year of office.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>They reneged on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>When he said that he was sitting beside the then Fine Gael spokesman on Finance, now Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, who did not demur or object in any way.  There are tens of thousands of witnesses to that statement and here today is the clear evidence of the breach of that solemn and categorical promise.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs need not again try to bluff his way out and say that they kept their promises.  That is only one of many they have not kept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to sound a note of warning regarding the social insurance approach of the Government.  I have not been able to work out the figures yet&mdash;they will, I am sure, be announced later&mdash;for the increase in the amount of the stamp but clearly it will be substantial.  Any increase in the price of the stamp at present must be viewed very carefully in relation to the national pay agreement and its consequences but when the Minister for Finance said, as he did today, that it was proposed to increase the proportion of the price of the stamp payable by the employers it is time to watch out very carefully.  If that is done there is a grave danger that it will encourage employers to prune their staffs still further, especially in <Col N="1308" /> regard to older workers, when pay-related contributions and benefits come into operations.  This is a real danger and I ask the Minister to give further thought to it before he implements that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be dealing with rates in a minute.  Again, you have the same silly approach by the Coalition to that matter but first I want to say a little about the Minister's proposals now in regard to value-added tax.</P>
      <P>Of course the Coalition proposals to remove value-added tax from food is a confidence trick: we all know that and all the consumers will find it out quite soon.  Let us assume for the purpose of discussion that it is not, and that the full benefit of the removal of VAT from food will be given to the consumers.  Again we find that the outstanding characteristics of this Coalition Government comes to the fore.  They propose to remove the tax from food items and increase the price of practically every other commodity. If anybody thinks it is being confined to non-essentials or luxuries I wonder did he listen to what the Minister said, because what he said was that the increases will be on such items as fuel, clothing and footwear and certain medicines.  How can anybody talk of these as non-essentials or luxuries? The real point about this is that the relief is being given right across the board to the rich as well as to the poor.  What is the consequence?  For the richest person as well as the poorest the price of items such as fuel, clothing and footwear will increase. Is this essential?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course there is another and a better way to do this if you really want to help the poorer sections of <Col N="1309" /> the community, the people hardest hit by inflation and those who have only the Government to protect them. There is a better way to do it and we told the Government how to do it but they were too full of pride and prejudice to admit that they were wrong and they persist, to the detriment of the poorer sections of the community, in this foolish proposal with the result that they are increasing the prices of these essentials to the poorest people.  It is true that the cost of meals in expensive restaurants will go down but it is also true that the old age pensioners and all those who have been hit so hard by inflation will pay more for footwear, clothing and fuel and all because the Government are apparently incapable of approaching a problem like this with any degree of social concern or practicality.</P>
    <P>Apart from all that, the effect of the proposal in regard to value-added tax will be to change the price of almost every commodity.  That is a sure guarantee of what the present Taoiseach called a prices explosion.  That is the phrase he used in relation to the effect of decimalisation.  I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs does not agree with that but that is what the Taoiseach said and many agreed with his view.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>We know who is confused. A major test of this budget will, of course, be whether or not it is effective from the point of view of its effect on prices and income inflation. I could hardly believe my ears when I heard some of the proposals which are clearly, and this must be in the knowledge of the Minister for Finance, going to cause further price increases, apart altogether from the direct effect of the increased taxation he is putting on.  He must know of the effects on prices of what is contained in this budget.</P>
      <P>I should like now to remind the House that in the 14-point plan announced by the Coalition before the general election they stated that one of their immediate economic aims would be to stabilise prices and they went on to say that they would immediately introduce strict price control.  Has anybody noticed that prices have been stabilised since the election?  Has anybody noticed one iota of a change in the system of price control?  We heard some pious platitudes from the Minister today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A few days ago the Minister for Industry and Commerce, answering questions here on this matter, said he was examining the system.  That is a long way from, to quote their own statement, immediately introducing strict price control.  This was a major plank in the election platform of the Coalition parties.  The failure up to now and, in particular, the failure today by the Minister for Finance to announce measures which would achieve strict <Col N="1311" /> price control and price stabilisation, as promised by the Coalition, leaves one with the inescapable conclusion that the Coalition are, as far at least as this area of the campaign on prices is concerned, a group of confidence tricksters.  There is no way out of that conclusion.</P>
    <P>Remember that phrase: immediate strict price control.  There were, of course, references in that famous 14-point plan to housing which, I am sure, the Deputies opposite will remember but, in case they do not, let me refresh their memories by recalling to them that a sentence in that programme was to the effect that a declaration of a housing emergency would be made immediately by the National Coalition Government.  It was, of course, obvious to us that declaring a housing emergency was not going to produce one more house, but even that declaration of an emergency has not been done. But something has been done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to me worthwhile recalling that the two previous Coalitions, which brought about economic chaos, first showed the signs of that chaos in the building and construction industry and, that being so, I regard it as ominous that, even in the short time the present Coalition has been in power, building society loans have become practically unobtainable and men have been laid off work in the building industry.  I believe that these difficulties are due to some extent at least to the ham-fisted way in which the present Government have tried to handle this very delicate problem.  This situation can be retrieved and I hope, for all our sakes, that it will be retrieved; but, if it is to be retrieved, this Government will have to improve considerably on the inept performance they have shown in this area up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance in an interjection some few moments ago referred to the rates.  I want to remind him and the House that he has now embarked on a course which, at current prices, <Col N="1312" /> could cost the tax payer extra taxation of £68 million over the next four years, taking it at this year's figures, and a very substantial part of that sum will go to relieve rates on office blocks and other commercial properties, the owners of which are entitled to claim their rates as a relief against their income tax liability.  The owners of dwellinghouses are, or course, not so entitled and, when all this huge extra taxation has been raised, ratepayers will still be liable for substantial rates. The Fianna Fáil proposal in this regard would, at a cost of £40 million as against £68 million, mark you, have removed rates completely from all dwellinghouses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Deputy where his figure of £68 million came from?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>One quality I will concede to the Minister for Foreign Affairs is that, provided the figures are reasonably straightforward, he can do a sum, and so he can do that sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>£35 million to £40 million was our figure, not £68 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of rates on dwellinghouses is, of course, where the real inequity lies in the rating system, the inequity with which every party was concerned, and I was very glad to note that, in its pre-budget submission, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions supported the Fianna Fáil proposal in this regard, as, indeed, must anybody who has any real concern for social justice and for getting value for the taxpayer's money.  Here, at a cost of nearly £30 million extra taxation, we are not getting rid of rates at all.  We are just relieving commercial properties which can already claim relief under their income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that both the Ministers for Finance and the Minister for Local Government recently, in response to Parliamentary questions, resorted to cheap subterfuges, to bluster and to bluff in order to try to conceal the extent to which the heavy extra taxation would go to subsidise rates on commercial properties.  I will deal with that on another day, I can assure the <Col N="1313" /> Minister, but, in the meantime, their frantic efforts in this regard, and they are documented on the records of this House, show that they, I think, know that their policy in this regard is wrong and they are just not big enough to acknowledge that they were wrong and adopt the kind of policy we put forward, a policy supported by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>We heard a great deal during the election and since about the Coalition promises to abolish estate duty.  Their 14-point plan said the National Coalition Government will abolish estate duty on property passing on death to widows and their children.  It said more than that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with this promise, first of all.  In regard to death duties, that promise, as far as most people are concerned, has been reneged on by the Coalition in this budget today.  What do we get in substitution? A negligible concession, an annual reduction in a full year of £.75 million out of a yield this year of £11 million, about 7 per cent of a reduction and, at the same time, legacy and succession duties are being doubled; the 5 per cent rate for brothers and nephews, <i>et cetera</i>, goes up to 10 per cent and the 10 per cent rate goes up to 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>The artificial valuation change announced by the Minister as a sop to the farmers who were fooled on this by the Coalition, as he will find out when he talks to them, this concession, as far as they are concerned, is of very little value to them because any farmer who is carrying any number of stock will find it does not benefit him at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know where are the wealth taxes and the capital gains taxes about which we heard so much <Col N="1314" /> from over there when they were here as being essential to producing a just society here.  Not one word about them in the budget.  The public will, I think, be able to judge just how reliable the veracity of the gentlemen over there is when they read and hear about this budget.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the importance of the national pay agreements. I referred to the effect of his budget on prices.  Prices have an immediate and direct effect on incomes. If this budget were to be of any real benefit to the economy it would have had to be designed so as to facilitate in every way possible the conclusion of another national pay agreement. On the contrary, it seems to me to have been designed to make the conclusion of such an agreement much more difficult.  I do not think it is generally realised that the tremendous reduction in industrial disputes as a result of the conclusion of the present national agreements has contributed substantially to the increase in the growth of the economy.  For instance, the very low growth rate recorded in 1970, although it was due partially to the disturbance in the North of Ireland, was primarily due to industrial disputes. That was, of course, before the first national agreement had begun to operate.  The effect of that low growth rate was to hold back for every man, woman and child in this country increases in real incomes.</P>
    <P>Consequently, the role of the budget in facilitating the conclusion of another national agreement is vital from many points of view.  Apart from the effects in this budget which, in many areas, seem to be if not deliberately directed &mdash;and I find that hard to believe&mdash;at least directed at preventing the conclusion of another agreement, the budget would appear to have been brought in by the Minister for Finance without any regard to the problems involved in negotiating another national agreement.  There have been some disquieting signs that because of lack of political will and know-how this Government are either unable or unwilling to take certain steps which are necessary at the moment to support the existing national agreement.  One <Col N="1315" /> can only hope that these signs do not portend the failure to conclude a new national agreement arising directly from the failure of this Government to take the necessary steps to support the existing agreement.</P>
    <P>One of the chief methods by which this budget will be judged will be by its effectiveness or otherwise in increasing employment.  In this connection it is no harm to remember that under the Fianna Fáil Government the historic problem of emigration, which had bedevilled us for centuries, was ended.  At the same time as that was brought about, tourism and industry in our country were both badly affected by the situation in the North of Ireland and by a recession in Britain.  Despite those factors and the ending of emigration, unemployment here did not go near the 100,000 that the present Tánaiste, Deputy Corish, was shouting so loudly about.  In the latter part of last year and up to now this year, there has been a steady drop in the number of unemployed so that the Coalition Government have got a sound basis on which to work in tackling the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>Looking at this current budget it seems to me that there is not a great deal of help in it towards solving the problem of unemployment.  One must look at the capital budget and one finds that the capital budget is substantially that which the outgoing Government had agreed on before they went out of office.  I am speaking now of the capital budget, not the current budget.  The Minister proposes to apply additional taxation to what are known as the old reliables.  Whatever view one may take about the justification or otherwise for that, there is one thing which should not be forgotten and that is that the increased taxation proposed will add substantially to the cost-of-living index and will, therefore, have an effect on the national pay agreement.  When one notes that apart from those increases, there will be an increase also in the price of petrol and in road tax&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I hope that the Minister was not under the mistaken impression that that was not so.  If he was, he will find out that he is wrong.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1317" /> I want to say another word about the reference to the proposal by the Minister for Finance in regard to the Devlin Report and the special steering committee of the Employer/Labour Conference.  If I understand correctly what the Minister said it was this: the report which came from that special committee set up to see to what extent the Devlin recommendations conformed, or could be made to conform, with the national agreements, is not being accepted by the Government. It seems very peculiar that the Minister and the Government should decide that those findings should be applied to civil servants and to judges but not to Members of the Oireachtas. That of itself requires an explanation from the Minister which he did not give.  He just baldly stated this as what was proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very serious aspect of this, that is, that the proposal by the Government is a breach of the national agreement.  The findings of that steering group were in accordance with the national agreement and, indeed, provided for retrospection to 1st January, 1972, at a certain level which would be phased up higher later but the earliest date was 1st January, 1972. It also allowed, in certain circumstances, for an anomaly claim.  All of this is being set aside by the Government at the expense of Members of the Dáil and Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because it was your bill and you refused to pay for it.  We are not going to pay for the money you are now saying you should have paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>It simply is not good enough for the Minister for Finance of all people to say that.  One of the new Deputies behind him said something like it recently.  I do not blame him. The Minister for Finance knows the circumstances.  Just for the record, I am going to give them to him.  The report of the special committee arrived on my desk a few days before Christmas and <Col N="1318" /> was issued publicly.  Legislation is necessary to implement it.  The Dáil did not meet from that date until after the election, when the Minister was over there.  So, would the Minister please acknowledge that it was not possible for me or my colleagues to implement these findings while we were in Government?  The ball was in his court and when he had to face it, what did he do?  He ran away from it.</P>
      <P>The political weakness that is in this Coalition is clearly evident in their approach.  They are so apparently euphoric about it they cannot even see how they have underlined it for themselves. The Minister says now that he will apply it in relation to judges, he will apply it in relation to civil servants: he will not apply it in relation to parliamentarians and he gives no explanation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the explanation not obvious?  You did not have the political guts over there to do it.  That is what is wrong with you.  I hesitate to say this but in view of the approach by the Minister I am going to say it: It seems to me that the effect of the proposal he is making is to ensure that Ministers of the present Government will get their increase from a current date but Ministers of the previous Government who in accordance with the national agreement should have had an increase from an earlier date are going to be deprived of it.  I am not complaining about that.  I will live and so will my colleagues without any largesse from the Minister for Finance but I do object to this lily-livered approach by this Coalition Government.  They have underlined it in the statement today. They have not the political guts to implement the national agreement in relation to members of the two Houses of Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one looks at this budget one finds that the Minister for Finance had certain things he had to do.  He had to raise money.  I know as a former Minister for Finance, looking at what he has brought in, that he went around and every possible source <Col N="1319" /> that was open to him he grabbed it.  I do not think that many people will have taken in just yet&mdash;it will take a while for it to sink in&mdash;the full range of the items being affected by additional taxation under this budget. Practically every possible item open to him was grabbed.</P>
    <P>To me, the most significant feature of this budget is the unique opportunity available which this Government dismally failed to grasp.  The lack of real concern for social justice, as distinct from talking incessantly about it, is clearly illustrated in this budget, particularly in the approach to children's allowances across the board, to the rich and the poor, in relation to value-added tax, increased on essentials, to the rich as well as to the poor, and millions of pounds of extra taxation being raised to subsidise the rates of commercial property owners who are already claiming relief under their income tax.  Nobody over there can claim with any degree of credibility that this budget shows any real concern for social justice.  Neither can it be claimed that it shows any ability to manage the economy.</P>
    <P>With all these taxes that are being imposed, millions and millions of pounds are being raised unnecessarily, being raised so that people can have the privilege of subscribing to the subsidisation of the rates on the office blocks and the other commercial properties, so that we can pay increased children's allowances to the richest people in the country.  That is the kind of inefficiency and incompetence that we get in the management of our economy from this Government.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, this budget marks the first step on the path to the same economic chaos as the two previous Coalitions brought about in this country.  I trust that wiser councils will prevail over there and that they will draw back.  They have embarked on that path.  We in Fianna Fáil have had to clean up Coalition messes before.  I hope that when we do take over from them, which will not be too long, we will not be left with the same kind of mess as we had before, but it looks very like it. <Col N="1320" /></P>

      <P>It is not our intention to oppose this particular resolution but I think it needs some comment in the light of the approach to this item of the budget and the Finance Bill by the Coalition parties in previous years. I have had the experience of being in the Minister's position.  In regard to budget after budget that I introduced one of the main targets of the Coalition parties was the maintenance of the income tax allowances at the then existing rates for an inordinate length of time.  One would have imagined, having regard to what would have appeared to be their conviction as to the necessity to increase these allowances, that we would have seen something better at this stage than a mere £30 in the <Col N="1321" /> wife's earned income allowance&mdash;a miserable £30 after all the criticism we have been getting about children's allowances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

This specific Financial Resolution relates only to ensuring that the children's allowance goes to the more necessitous people in the community and can be refunded by persons whose net income exceeds £2,500.</P>

      <P>There seems to be a change in procedure here.  There is a change in the income tax code but, as I have already pointed out, if there was never a change in the income tax code, if there was no increased income tax or no allowance provided, there would have to be in these resolutions a resolution to re-impose income tax.  If the Minister would get advice on that point from his advisers, I think they will confirm what I have said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not need the advice.  Here is a Deputy who was the leader of a government that last year introduced legislation to make income tax permanent.  He does not know the law he passed last year.  That is why I am getting rather impatient that we should be wasting the time of the House.  He is responsible for the law to which he is taking exception now. This deals only with getting a refund of the children's allowances paid to people who receive an income in excess of £2,500.  The Deputy will see that figure stated in the seventh line of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the only item on the number of sheets before us where we can discuss this miserable allowance which has been given to income tax payers.  Under the ruling given by the Chair I will have to wait until the General Resolution.  However, it is a matter of wonder to me that Deputies who now form the Government and who support the Government and who were so vociferous in their denunciation of the non-increase in allowances under the income tax code, <Col N="1324" /> can support a budget that has granted this miserable allowance.  However, I will pass from that and come to what is in the resolution.  If I am mistaken under the rules of order in what I have done I will have another opportunity of dealing with it.</P>
      <P>We have criticised this budget in relation to children's allowance payments. We have criticised the programme of the National Coalition Government as published in advance of the election on the grounds that with regard to children's allowances we considered that the benefits were not being given to the most deserving. They were to be given right across the board and that is what happened in this budget.  We believe that is wasteful expenditure.  It would be better to increase the allowances to the categories we intended to provide for, that is, the categories with a certain income related to the number of children in the family&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not be too smart.  We are not completely devoid of talent and brains on this side and we can develop an argument as well as the Ministers opposite. The pretence was made that this was going to be a right-across-the-board increase but this resolution takes the increase from certain categories of people, those who earn £2,500 per annum.  There is in this an inequity. We were going to relate our payments of children's allowances to certain categories related to the size of family. A man earning £2,500 per annum, whether he has one child, 15 children or has no children, is going to suffer as a result of this provision.  The Government are giving with one hand and taking away with the other; they are going to deduct £42 and £50 in the full year.  I submit the scheme we proposed&mdash;and we will try to demonstrate this later&mdash;was more equitable. This is another form of eyewash.  There are people earning £2,500, skilled men for whom normally we would like to provide increased children's allowances. There is the further inequity that there <Col N="1325" /> is no grading system upwards or downwards, as we would have provided. This provision will operate unfairly against some people.  It is not giving the benefit to the most needy or in the proportions we would have done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to confirm that this resolution will bring in £1 million.  Apart from the equity or otherwise of this proposal, it seems to me if it is only going to bring in £1 million in a year, because of the complications it will entail in the administration of the income tax code it is not worth doing. In another part of his speech the Minister speaks rather vaguely about simplifying the income tax code but in this provision he is considerably complicating administration of the code.  I should like him to confirm there is £1 million involved in this resolution and, if that is so, in view of the complications involved he is convinced that it is worthwhile.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that anybody who has a net income in excess of £2,500 will have the children's allowances substantially withdrawn. The alternative system as proposed by Fianna Fáil to which Deputy Lynch has now made reference, would have required anybody applying for children's allowances to make an individual application each year accompanied by a certificate of income, and if in the course of that year the income of the person were increased, it would have been an offence for the recipient to cash the certificate if the income&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Income&rdquo; is taxable income.  The phraseology and verbiage used in tax law defines &ldquo;taxable income&rdquo; and that is the only income taken into account.  Taxable income is defined in a jumble of tax laws, about which the Deputy, who is well up in legal matters, will know. To deal with the other point raised by Deputy Haughey&mdash;he spoke about &ldquo;only a million&rdquo; and as high as £2 million in one year&mdash;it could go to even a higher figure.  The point which Deputy Haughey has been making is in conflict with what Deputy Lynch has been saying.</P>

      <P>There might be severe hardship cases above that limit who would be running into difficulties on that count.  The mere fact that only £1 million is coming back out of the £8 million that would be spent this year on this scheme indicates that the majority of families will be getting this benefit.

      <P>Does this resolution not constitute the entire effort of the Government towards selectivity as far as children's allowances are concerned? I was hammered, particularly from the Labour benches, about the necessity to introduce selectivity in the payment of children's allowances.  An interDepartmental committee studied it for <Col N="1328" /> months and came up with a number of suggestions.  The most acceptable one we adopted and before the elections we spelled out what it was.  The former Taoiseach is right in pointing out that this hits at marginal cases and could be rather severe.  We had selectivity on valuation and on incomes and it was graduated in accordance with the numbers in the family so that it did not really bear too heavily on any case.  Indeed, I thought there was a very nice choice of selectivity from the different permutations put forward at the time.  It enabled us to give very generous assistance to those who needed it.  We were doing what the demand of this House was during the years, particularly from the Labour benches who now, in this budget, have lost all shreds of pretended socialism.</P>

      <P>Before you put the resolution, Sir, I should like to ask if, as the Minister states, the words &ldquo;total income for the relevant year of assessment from all sources&rdquo; mean in fact net income, net taxable income, would it not be much simpler to state that because &ldquo;net&rdquo; and &ldquo;total&rdquo; seem to be contradictory.  So that we will know precisely what is in the resolution, will the Minister agree to the resolution being amended by substituting &ldquo;net&rdquo; for &ldquo;total&rdquo;?  I should also like to bring the Minister's attention to the fact that an income tax payer apparently will have this £42, or £50 in a full year, deducted from him in respect of children's allowances for income tax, irrespective of whether he gets children's allowance under the Social Welfare Acts, which is scarcely equitable.</P>

In fact, a longer phrase is used in the resolution which means &ldquo;net&rdquo;, the phrase which says, <Col N="1331" />&ldquo;income for the relevant year of assessment from all sources, as estimated in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Acts, exceeds £2,500...&rdquo;  That is, in fact, a net income of £2,500&mdash;the income as assessed in accordance with the Income Tax Acts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We will remember that and we hope it works out that way.  The other point is that a man may not, in fact, be in receipt of an allowance at all but he is charged the £50 a year.  Would the Minister not feel it would be more equitable to deduct that only in respect of those who are in receipt of the allowance.</P>

      <P>Every person who has a child is entitled to apply for children's allowance.  It would be extremely difficult administratively to require from each income tax payer proof as to whether that person had or had not applied.  In fact, because of the difficulties of operating the code, for any income tax payer even above this ceiling there would be a marginal gain as a result of the figure to-day.  There would be a gain of 30p this year and 50p in future years.  I understand from the Department of Social Welfare&mdash; and I am sure Deputy Brennan will confirm this&mdash;that it is not notable that any significant number of people fail to apply for children's allowance. If some person is a well off that he does not bother to apply for children's allowance the chances are that there will be no great hardship involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister how does he arrive at this figure and how does he justify such a figures as a stop-off point.  This whole business about total income and net income, and the little cross-talk that is going on that one means the same as the other, and that it is too hard to define what &ldquo;net&rdquo; is, or that it is too <Col N="1332" /> loose, does not impress me at all.  In arriving at the figure of £2,500, whether it be described as &ldquo;total&rdquo; or &ldquo;net&rdquo; income, or by the more lengthy description in the Act, I should like to know will the tax free allowance, the married allowance, the children's allowance be taken into consideration? If not why should they not be?  Why should we be talking about anything related to net income or taxable income rather than total income?</P>
      <P>My first question is why £2,500?  To my mind it does not make a great deal of sense, nor does it make a great deal of sense that somebody with £2,400 or £2,450 will gain £50 in respect of each child as against somebody with a large family who has £5 or £10 over the limit who will not get it.  As between £2,550 and £2,450 income, whatever you may term it, net, taxable or total, for the purpose of this cut-off or reduction of the tax free allowance, how do they tally and how do we justify cutting off a person who has £50 over the limit when somebody else gets the full benefit if he has only £5 or £10 or £25 or £30 under the limit?  Why should there be such a limit or such a low limit? In limiting it, why should there be a total discarding of the idea that surely has come to be accepted, that children's allowance, for various reasons, have been paid without question and without any consideration of income when those who will contribute most to paying over the £2,500 can expect to get nothing by virtue of this cut-out of £50 which, as I calculated it, is exactly the increase proposed by the Minister to be paid in respect of all the children of those who earn under £2,500.  I work it out that there is a matter of pence in the difference.  One cancels the other out, as I see it.  At any rate, why that figure?  How do you deal with the £2,450 versus the £2,550?  Why were not the deductible allowances that are normally regarded as tax free taken into consideration in arriving at the figure of £2,500?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that no matter what cut-off figure one takes, it will be open to criticism.  In the case of the old age pensions means test, there are cases of hardship of people who come into the grey area where they are just <Col N="1333" /> a little bit above the particular margin or cut-off rate for the higher benefit. Some figure has to be chosen and looking at the existing income levels and the likely burdens that fall on families on these levels, bearing in mind that for identification purposes in revenue laws £2,500 made it possible to identify people with the least possible difficulty&mdash;any other system would have multiplied the type of difficulty with which Deputy Haughey is familiar&mdash;it was considered that the £2,500 was an appropriate figure.  I accept that some people could be just above and suffer a little more hardship than people just below.  If you are to proceed to take the individual personal income tax allowances which Deputy Blaney has in mind into account, you are overlooking the fact that they are taken into account in assessing whether a person is liable to income tax at all so that even though you take the £2,500 after deduction of the necessary outgoings permitted by the law and then set off against it all the other allowances which the income tax law allows a person to have in quite a number of cases you could end up with a situation in which you would be arguing theory only because the cases would not arise in practice.  The proof of all this is that the amount received back is comparatively small compared with the benefits being given out.</P>

If that is the case, would it not be better to tell us that?  If, again, the knowledge is absolute and there is a <Col N="1337" /> definite formula, then I want to know whether, in fact, the tax free allowances in respect of the children of a person whose income is somewhere over the £2,500 are deductible from it before a figure is arrived at that would preclude him from the full allowances in the future?  If these are deductible is it on the higher formula or the formula less the £50 that is spoken about in this resolution?  Are they deductible at all?  If they are, is it the higher or the lower one?

Is it necessary that all calculations must be made in making the adjustments in the case of allowances and all the other alterations in the case of children's allowances so that in respect of a household, which may be typical of many households in the country, there is a net gain of £2 per year?

      <P>First of all, Deputy Fitzpatrick raised the point about variations in income that may occur throughout the year and the complexities that may generate.  Of course, it is in no way different by reason of the use of the tax code dealing with children's allowances because those variations, as the Deputy knows particularly in his own trade, can vary from month to month.  There is a rough and ready estimate as to what a person's income and tax allowances are in any year.  Tax free certificates are given on that basis and then there is a readjustment at the end of the year.  In fact, any adjustment of variations which occur in consequence of this resolution will be no different from the variations which occur at the moment and will not generate any additional difficulties or paper work which would be generated if he introduced the system as has been suggested by the Opposition.</P>

Now we are seeing that this reduction applies only to the better off.  We are doing the very thing which Deputy Colley says we are not <Col N="1339" /> doing.  We are withholding this from the better off and we are not withdrawing it from the people who need it.  I thought I had answered Deputy Blaney.

      <P>The Deputy is really asking me to be his income tax adviser and auditor.  The whole income tax code is extremely complex, as the Deputy knows but the kind of deductions which can be made from a man's gross income before you assess his taxable income are bank interest, mortgage interest, superannuation fund contributions and such expenses as a person is allowed to deduct.  When you have all that you say that a man receives X, you subtract Y and you get a figure.  On that you give him the various income tax and personal allowances to which he is entitled which, as I said, in many cases, will mean all this argument will not be applicable to a large number of taxpayers.</P>

      <P>I want to ask, or rather repeat, a question I have already asked.  If the Minister would not answer me, perhaps I could appeal to him on behalf of the ladies, the womenfolk in whom he is so interested, in respect of the non-working wife, the wife working at home minding four children?  Are we to take it that the increase available to her in this marvellous budget in respect of the family of four is £2 per annum? Would the Minister say: &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;No&rdquo; or &ldquo;Partly correct&rdquo; or &ldquo;Incorrect&rdquo; or &ldquo;Totally incorrect&rdquo;?</P>

I have made it perfectly clear that the effect of this resolution is that anybody earning under £2,500 net income receives the increases while anybody above it does not.  But nobody above it is at any loss as a result of people below it receiving the increases.  Fianna Fáil must make up their minds.  Do they want it for everybody or only for those under £2,500?</P>

      <P>I move Financial Resolution No. 2:</P>
      <P>(1)  That subject to paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) of this Resolution, the duty of customs on tobacco imposed by section 20 of the Finance Act, 1932 (No. 20 of 1932), shall, as on and from the 17th day of May, 1973, be charged, levied and paid at the several rates specified in Part I of the Schedule to this Resolution in lieu of the several rates specified in Parts I, II and III of the Second Schedule to the Finance Act, 1969 (No. 21 of 1969).</P>
      <P>(2)  That the provisions of section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to the duty mentioned in paragraph (1) of this Resolution&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  with the substitution of &ldquo;the area of application of the Acts of the Oireachtas&rdquo; for &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland&rdquo;, and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  as though the descriptions of manufactured tobacco mentioned in Part I of the Schedule to this Resolution were included in the first column of the Second Schedule to that Act after the expression &ldquo;manufactured tobacco&rdquo; and the appropriate preferential rates mentioned in that Part were mentioned in the second column of the said Second Schedule opposite the mention of those goods in the first column thereof in lieu of the rate mentioned in the said second column <Col N="1343" /> opposite the mention of manufactured tobacco in the said first column.</P>
    <P>(3) That&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  this paragraph applies to unmanufactured tobacco which at importation is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to have been grown and consigned from the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>(b)  the customs duty on tobacco mentioned in paragraph (1) of this Resolution shall, as on and from the 17th day of May, 1973, be charged, levied, and paid on unmanufactured tobacco to which this paragraph applies at the several rates specified in Part II of the Schedule to this Resolution in lieu of the several rates specified in Part I thereof,</P>
    <P>(c)  in this paragraph the expression &ldquo;the United Kingdom&rdquo; means Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.</P>
    <P>(4)  That&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  this paragraph applies to manufactured tobacco which was manufactured in, and consigned from, the United Kingdom and was manufactured therein from materials other than materials falling within Tariff Heading number 24.02 in the Schedule to the Imposition of Duties (No. 200) (Customs and Excise Duties and Form of Tariff) Order, 1972 (S.I. No. 220 of 1972),</P>
    <P>(b)  the customs duty on tobacco mentioned in paragraph (1) of this Resolution shall, as on and from the 17th day of May, 1973, be charged, levied and paid on manufactured tobacco to which this paragraph applies at the several rates specified in Part III of the Schedule to this Resolution in lieu of the several rates specified in Part I thereof,</P>
    <P>(c)  the provisions of section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, shall apply to the duties imposed by this paragraph&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1344" /> (i)  with the substitution of &ldquo;the area of application of the Acts of the Oireachtas&rdquo; for &ldquo;Great Britain and Ireland&rdquo; and as though the expression &ldquo;manufactured tobacco&rdquo; in the first column of the Second Schedule to that Act and did not include manufactured tobacco to which this paragraph applies,</P>
    <P>(ii)  as though manufactured tobacco to which this paragraph applies, together with the descriptions of such manufactured tobacco in Part III of the Schedule to this Resolution, were mentioned separately in the said first column and the appropriate preferential rates specified in that Part were mentioned in the second column of the said Second Schedule opposite the mention of those goods in the first column thereof, and,</P>
    <P>(iii)  subject to the last paragraph (beginning with &ldquo;Goods shall not be deemed&rdquo;) of subsection (1) of the said section 8 being disregarded,</P>
    <P>(d)  in this paragraph the expression &ldquo;the United Kingdom&rdquo; means Great Britain, Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands,</P>
    <P>(e)  the expression &ldquo;hard pressed tobacco&rdquo; mentioned in Part III of the Schedule to this Resolution and the next subparagraph of this paragraph has the same meaning as it has in section 17 of the Finance Act, 1940 (No. 14 of 1940),</P>
    <P>(f)  the expression &ldquo;other pipe tobacco&rdquo; mentioned in Part III of the Schedule to this Resolution means manufactured tobacco of kinds normally intended to be used in pipes, not being hard pressed tobacco,</P>
    <P>(5)  That the duty of excise on tobacco imposed by section 19 of the Finance Act, 1934 (No. 31 of 1934), shall, as on and from the 17th day of May, 1973, be charged, levied and paid at the several rates <Col N="1345" /> specified in Part IV of the Schedule to this Resolution in lieu of the several rates specified in Part IV of the Second Schedule to the Finance Act, 1969.</P>
    <P>(6) That, subject to the provisions of paragraph (7) of this Resolution, there shall be charged, levied and paid on all stocks of tobacco of every description which at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 16th day of May, 1973, are in the ownership or possession of a licensed manufacturer of tobacco and in any place in the State other than a bonded warehouse, a duty of excise, payable by the manufacturer, at the following rate, that is to say:</P>
    <P>(a)  so far as the stocks consist of unmanufactured tobacco, £0.627 for every pound weight of the stocks, and</P>
    <P>(b)  so far as the stocks consist of tobacco (including snuff) other than unmanufactured tobacco, £0.627 for every pound weight of unmanufactured tobacco from which, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, the stocks were derived.</P>
    <P>(7)  That the duty provided for by paragraph (6) of this Resolution shall not be chargeable on any manufactured tobacco (including cigarettes, cigars and snuff other than offal snuff) as to which it is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners that it was at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 16th day of May, 1973, fully prepared for sale by retail and that either&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  it was not the product of any operation carried out by any manufacturer in whose ownership or possession it was at that time; or</P>
    <P>(ii)  it was at that time held as retail stock in premises used for selling tobacco by retail; or</P>
    <P>(iii)  it was at that time in transit from seller to buyer under a contract of sale:</P>
    <P>Provided that no tobacco shall be deemed for the purposes of this paragraph to have been fully prepared <Col N="1346" /> for sale by retail if, according to the ordinary course of business of the person in whose ownership or possession it was or to whom it was in transit, it had still to be subjected to some further process (other than packing) before being sold by him.</P>
    <P>(8)  That every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall not later than the 23rd day of May 1973, make a return to the Revenue Commissioners in a form approved by them giving such information as they may thereby require and, in particular, showing the quantities by weight of tobacco of every description in his ownership or possession at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 16th day of May, 1973, in any place in the State other than a bonded warehouse.</P>
    <P>(9)  That every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  produce, if so required, to any officer of Customs and Excise the trade books and all accounts and documents belonging to or in the possession of such manufacturer which are necessary for verifying the return made in pursuance of paragraph (8) of this Resolution, and</P>
    <P>(b)  render all reasonable assistance to such officer in the taking of an account of the tobacco which was in the ownership or possession of such manufacturer at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 16th day of May, 1973.</P>
    <P>(10)  That every licensed manufacturer of tobacco shall, immediately upon making the return required by paragraph (8) of this Resolution or on the 23rd day of May, 1973, whichever is the earlier, pay to the Revenue Commissioners the full amount of the duty mentioned in paragraph (6) of this Resolution on any tobacco which was in his ownership or possession at five o'clock in the afternoon of the 16th day of May, 1973, and was chargeable with the said duty, and the Revenue Commissioners may, if they think fit, defer the payment of the duty to a date not later than the <Col N="1347" /> 1st day of November, 1973, upon the manufacturer giving security by bond or otherwise to their satisfaction that such duty will be paid.</P>
    <P>(11)  That every manufacturer required by paragraph (8) of this Resolution to make such return as is mentioned in that paragraph who either fails to make such return or makes a return which is incomplete, false or misleading in any material respect or fails or refuses to do anything which he is required by paragraph (9) of this Resolution to do shall be guilty of an offence under the statutes relating to duties of excise and shall for every such offence incur an excise penalty of fifty pounds, and all tobacco in relation to which such offence was committed shall be forfeited.</P>
    <P>(12)  That where drawback is payable in respect of tobacco on which the excise duty provided for in paragraph (6) of this Resolution has been paid, such drawback shall, to the extent of the duty paid in pursuance of the said paragraph (6) as determined by the Revenue Commissioners, be a drawback of excise.</P>
    <P>(13)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the Minister for Local Government that there is only one speaker from my side and he need not have any problems about this.  I gather from Resolution No. 2 that, in common with a number of other items of increased taxation and with only a very quick and cursory look at the impact of them, all are aimed at the one category of people, the generality of the younger generation who are smoking, drinking and driving cars and having a reasonably good time at an age when they are still able to enjoy it. It may be popular to talk about the <Col N="1352" /> damage that cigarette-smoking will do but in fact we are mealy-mouthed about this.  It will probably be said at some stage, with some justification, that in addition to raising the further revenue needed to bridge the budget gap and meet its new provisions it is an added advantage to make cigarettes dearer because they are bad for those who buy them.</P>
      <P>If the Minister for Finance thinks that way or expresses that view it will be with his tongue in his cheek because the amount of revenue being drawn from smokers is so large that it cannot be compensated for or done without. It is merely adding to what is regarded as a good source of income to put this threepence on the 20 packet of cigarettes, rather than any idea, no matter who may express it, that we are trying to curb this bad habit of smoking.  If we are serious about it, we certainly do not want to do it from the financial point of view here.  Since it is, I think, being used only as a source of revenue I believe those who are most likely to bear this extra burden should get some consideration. Generally speaking, none of the advantages or increases apply to those who contribute most through this particular tax to the Exchequer.  As we move through these resolutions I believe it will be seen that this is but one instalment of a number of items which will add together to have a very substantial impact on that group of people who, admittedly, are making money but who, at the same time, are doing what we often advocate, making money go round&mdash;it was round at one time; it is not always round now.  If money is earned it is spent and it is not necessarily all wasted even if it is spent on luxuries in that it is providing employment in industry or in services for the community and helps the general economy and the buoyancy of revenue and all that contributes to a pretty virile economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are, I think, not only knocking those who smoke in this budget.  The aspect that strikes me in particular is that all these things, and this one especially, will come to rest most heavily on those who, if they cannot spend and sport themselves at this <Col N="1353" /> stage of their lives, are unlikely to have the freedom or, indeed, the wish to do it at a later stage in their lives.  I do not like this imposition even though those who are health conscious may advocate it, not just as a revenue earner but as something that will improve the health of our people.  It is a very substantial increase.  Not so many years ago if one old penny or two old pence was imposed on cigarettes, or any other commodity, there would be quite a debate about it.  Here the Minister is putting on three new pence, the equivalent of seven old pence.  That is a fairly drastic imposition.  I do not know whether this will be a flat rate or whether there will be any differentiation, but the increase will represent an increase of between 11 and 12½ per cent.  That is a heavy percentage increase. It will hit those who will be hit in every other resolution in this budget. I do not appreciate it at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate will be somewhat different according to the quantity of tobacco in the particular cigarette, but the figure mentioned is that which will apply to the standard, non-tipped cigarette.  There are so many varieties it is difficult to list them all on an occasion like this without mentioning brand names and mentioning brand names might be contrary to the principles of the House since it might be regarded as advertising.  The lower the tobacco content the less the duty will be.  There is no evidence of profit for either the manufacturer or the trader in this.  It is purely a tax.  I accept what Deputy Blaney said; we are killing two birds with one stone. We are collecting revenue and, at the same time, we are discouraging people from smoking.  If people followed my example they would not smoke; but if they did follow it that would cause difficulties for the Revenue.  That is something else that would have to be looked at.</P>

      <P>I want to know whether <Col N="1354" /> there will be a differential in so far as the custom of purchasing the end product is concerned or will it be a flat figure?  Fractions will be involved and these fractions will be rounded up and the smoker will pay in round figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is all very well for the Minister to be virtuous and say he does not smoke and, therefore, no one else should.  The fact of the matter is most people smoke cigarettes. There are, perhaps, health reasons why they should not.  Most people probably smoke 20 cigarettes or more in the day. The increase proposed here is in terms of old pence 7.2d which is far and away the biggest increase ever proposed on cigarettes or anything else. There were outcries in this House when an increase of one penny was imposed.  If one takes the average packet at the moment as costing 25p, the cost of that packet will now increase by 12 per cent.  Whether we are advised by the Minister, among others, not to smoke for our health's sake, unfortunately the majority will continue to smoke after this monstrous increase is imposed and one is led inescapably to the conclusion that this imposition will have a major effect on <Col N="1355" /> the cost of living.  It will affect in particular the man who goes out and whose only enjoyment in life is a couple of pints at night and a packet of cigarettes.  The man who can least afford it, in other words, will be hardest hit.  It will inflate the cost of living for everyone and, in particular, for the less well off because the highest proportion of their income goes on things like cigarettes and beer.  This budget has done nothing to reduce the cost of living, about which we heard so much during the election campaign, but it is increasing it in a barefaced fashion.  For the Minister to come in here and increase the cost of a packet of cigarettes by 7.2 old pence, and then tell us that it is for the good of our health, makes me believe that he is totally out of touch with the reality of life today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. C. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dowling has raised an important point.  The Minister said he did not want to mention brands and I do not want to go into brands but with 3p on the packet of 20 across the board, the general recommended retail price now will possibly be 22, 23, 25, 29 and 30. These are marginals and, if you take then a standard 29, of course, the margin will go up on the vast majority of brands.  Deputy Dowling asked what will happen when value-added tax is increased.  Again, it will only be a marginal increase, but quite an increase from 5.26 at the moment to 6.75.  This is another marginal.  It is also going up and again it will hit at people whom, shall we say, are enjoying the few years between school-leaving and taking on the responsibility of house purchase, <i>et cetera,</i> the 18 to 21 voters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister on a number of occasions today in his budget statement referred to certain items as being the largest, or the first or a record.  I do not think he referred <Col N="1356" /> to this proposed increase in tobacco duty as being a record, but I have no doubt that it is a record.  In the past there has never been in one budget in this House such an increase imposed on tobacco.  That is not, perhaps, a very enviable record for the Minister.  Because of the size of it, any Deputy would hesitate to support it.  There could be circumstances in which one might support an increase, even of that size, but those circumstances do not exist today.  I cannot see any justice whatever in asking the taxpayers to pay so much more for cigarettes or tobacco in order to contribute to reducing the rates on office blocks and commercial properties, the owners of which can already set off those rates or claim them by way of relief against their income tax liability. If the Minister can explain to the House why it should be necessary to raise the revenue involved in this resolution for that purpose, and if he can justify it, then he can have our support.  Until the Minister does that, he will not have our support in asking the people to pay such a huge increase for the doubtful pleasure of subsidising the rates on office blocks and commercial property.</P>

      <P>I checked for some years back and I find that this is not really the case.  I plead guilty to interrupting on a number of occasions last year, as is my disorderly wont when provoked as I was by last year's budget.  Although I interrupted on a number of occasions, I spoke only once.  Going back to the records, I find that this has been the practice. There were brief interventions by individual Deputies once, and then the <Col N="1357" /> resolution was put to the House.  I cannot find any trace of repeated interventions, other than a couple of questions being asked of the Minister or occasional interruptions.</P>

      <P>The Deputy should keep to the Financial Resolutions.  The Chair has already said that the precedent was established that Members speak once and are allowed to ask questions.  Every Member of this House is well used to the financial procedures in regard to these resolutions and knows that these resolutions will form the subject of the Finance Bill where they can be teased out and amended if Members so wish.  That has been the normal procedure in the budget debate.  A Member speaks once and asks questions. These matters can be dealt with later during the debate on the Finance Bill.  The Deputies can tease out these matters then and, if necessary, amend them.</P>

      <P>(3)  That in lieu of the duty of customs imposed by section 27 (2) of the Act of 1971, there shall, as on and from the 17th day of May, 1973, be charged, levied and paid on all beer of any description imported into the State, a duty of customs at the rate of £31.913 for every 36 gallons of beer of which the worts were before fermentation of a specific gravity of 1,055 degrees.</P>
      <P>(4)  That there shall be allowed and paid on the exportation as merchandise or the shipment for use as stores of beer on which it is shown, to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners, that the duty imposed by paragraph (2) or paragraph (3) of this Resolution has been paid, a drawback calculated according to the original specific gravity of the beer, at the rate of £31.926 on every 36 gallons of beer of which the original specific gravity was 1,055 degrees.</P>
      <P>(5)  That where, in the case of beer which is chargeable with the duty imposed by paragraph (2) or paragraph (3) of this Resolution or in the case of beer on which drawback under paragraph (4) of this Resolution is payable, the specific gravity of the beer is not 1,055 degrees, the duty or drawback shall be varied proportionately.</P>

      <P>It is included in the general figure of the increase in the budget statement.  The effect of this increase is to increase the excise duty by the equivalent of .69p on the pint of average gravity.  The revenue in the current year is estimated at approximately £3,200,000.  There will be a reduction with effect from 1st September next to compensate the trade for the increase in the rate of VAT and the cutback will bring the yield to £2,400,000.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to a rather ironic situation that has arisen with regard to this resolution.  I remember the present Minister for Local Government year after year, on occasion after occasion, demanding that we make some allowance in the income tax code for those people who had to incur expenses in travelling to work. He pressed this very strongly on me and on other Ministers.  He had particularly in mind the case of tradesmen who had to use a car to go to work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as we are concerned an increase in tax on beer certainly could be tolerable and supported by us in certain circumstances. In regard to what is proposed here, it appears from what the Minister has said that, so far as the consumer is concerned, the increase will be 1p per pint.  Portion of that increase will go to the brewers and the balance to the Revenue Commissioners.  There is no mention of the publicans but I understand they are claiming an increase <Col N="1363" /> also.  Therefore, it seems possible that, apart from this increase of 1p per pint, there will be a further increase arising out of the application of the publicans.  We should bear this in mind when considering the effects of this resolution.</P>
      <P>I said there were certain circumstances in which we could support an increase of this kind but those circumstances do not exist today.  As I mentioned earlier, in this budget there is an enormous amount of what we consider unnecessary taxation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware the debate must be on a specific resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was about to say that, despite what the Minister said about the consumer recognising the reasons for this increase, I cannot see him saying: &ldquo;I can be reasonably happy about paying another 1p on the pint because I know the extra revenue is going to help the owners of office blocks and business premisies to have their rates reduced.&rdquo;  I do not think that they would be happy with that thought. Certainly I am not happy with it.  As far as I am concerned, there is unnecessary taxation involved in this budget. The rates subsidy on office blocks and commercial properties are examples. The amounts involved are so substantial that clearly what we are being asked to do is to increase the price of the pint in order to subsidise the rates on office blocks and commercial properties.  We are not prepared to support that kind of policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  I should like to make it quite clear that we are getting it back and that is the mistake that the Deputy has made.  In this case the amount of the beer increase is only 0.69p.  The present duty is 7.4p.  The Deputy might be interested to know that the consumption of beer last year increased by 89,000 barrels. For this reason it is not an unreasonable demand.  This is a relatively small increase when allowance is taken of the fact that the National Prices Commission has already considered this matter some time ago and that part of the <Col N="1364" /> increase is included in the recommendation they made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This particular increase is one which not so long ago we would have had a great song and dance about.  Surely it should have been possible to have avoided increasing the price of the pint, seeing that increases are to be levied on tobacco and cigarettes. Later we will be dealing with spirits and with a very savage increase, to say the least of it.  Of this increase of 1p in the price of the pint, 0.27p will go to the brewers; but from where will come the further amount that will be required by the trade and those who dispense the beer and collect the taxes to enable the Exchequer to benefit? Will we have an addition on to this penny and will we during this year, with hopes of a revival in our tourist industry, find ourselves, because of this resolution, hitting at that fundamental part of the tourist industry?</P>
      <P>The sale of beer and tobacco to our tourists is an important part of the benefits from which we derive some of the lifeblood of our economy.  If our tourist industry is as important as it is made out to be it is surprising that these Financial Resolutions contain the very elements that make for adverse effects on that hoped-for revival of the tourist industry.  I disagree with this increase because the pint at its present level is dear enough for the general run of the workers who are the main consumers of beer. I disagree with it also because of the adverse effect it will have on the attraction, enjoyment and entertainment tourists to this country have had.  We were hoping to bring them here in greater numbers this year but by this increase we shall not give them the traditional Irish welcome.  We are asking them in and at the same time we are about to nail them as soon as they arrive by charging them more for those things which they might wish to and which I know they enjoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like some information on what becomes of the trade who handle the beer and collect these taxes.  Where do they come in and will there be a further increase as a result of a just <Col N="1365" /> claim being further enhanced by this increased imposition?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from what the Minister for Finance said today, it appears to me that the National Prices Commission, on the one hand, have considered an application from the brewers for an increase and have made a recommendation, which the Minister has accepted, that an addition of the equivalent of 0.27p per pint should be payable to them.  In my capacity as Minister for Industry and Commerce I came under a lot of pressure from the licensed vintners in relation to an increased margin for them.  I did take quite a considerable amount of abuse in my dealings.  To my knowledge the application from the licensed trade was still with the National Prices Commission at a recent date.  Are we to take it from the statement made by the Minister for Finance today that, on the one hand, the National Prices Commission have sanctioned something which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has already approved, this increase of 0.27p per pint to the brewers but, at the same time, has again turned down the application for increased margins or a change in the margin by the licensed trade?  There is no doubt, as I see it, in relation to the increase which is now being built into the price of beer, that the straightforward increase of 1p on the pint will mean that there will be a very solid and heavy demand from the trade for an increase of 1p on the bottle.  They will hardly be satisfied with a corresponding ½p for the half pint, loose or bottled.  I am wondering if, in the Minister's statement today, there is an inferred statement from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he has refused to sanction an increase to the licensed trade?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach two questions on this resolution. Could he indicate the estimated yield from the increase in tax on spirits this year and in a full year, and secondly, could he indicate the reasons for and the meaning of Paragraph 5 in relation to immature spirits?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated yield this year is £3,800,000 and that will be reduced, by the reduction in the Customs and Excise duties on spirits with effect from 1st September next to compensate for the increase in the rate of Value-added Tax, to £3,200,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The paragraph continues certain additional duties and surcharges on immature spirits, that is, spirits under three years old, whether imported or homemade, imposed by section 9 of the Finance Act of 1926.  Under the Immature Spirits (Restriction) Acts 1947-1972, spirits may not normally be delivered for home consumption unless they are at least three years old. The age restriction does not apply to certain categories of spirits, for example,  liqueurs, perfumes and the spirits used in the manufacture of such products.  Retention of spirits in bond for three years involves the holder in certain expenses, cost of storage and loss of the product through evaporation. Earlier withdrawal from bond of the exempted categories minimises such <Col N="1373" /> expenses.  The purpose of the surcharge which ranges from 0.125 in the £ to 0.2 per gallon is to equate the position of such spirits with that of spirits compulsorily retained in bond for the full three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Taoiseach for that information but I want to say on this resolution that as in the case of one at least of the other resolutions which we have dealt with, this I think, speaking from recollection without recourse to the record, is the greatest single increase in our history ever imposed on spirits in a budget. The increase is three new pence per glass of whiskey which is 7.02 old pence.  Since many of us are of an age when we still have to put prices into old pounds, shilling and pence if we want to compare what is happening in this budget with what happened in budgets of other years I am putting in that figure of 7.02 old pence.</P>
      <P>This would in any circumstances be described as a savage increase in tax on spirits.  I do not think there is any other more appropriate word for it. Even though it is so big in the right circumstances, and for sound social purposes, this party would consider supporting even such a tremendous imposition on spirits if the purposes for which the money was required were socially desirable.  Of course they are not.  They are required in order to raise the many millions of unnecessary taxation which the present Government propose to raise.  I do not want to repeat what I said before but I am making the same point because it is as valid in relation to this as it is in relation to the other resolutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government propose to raise unnecessary taxation for the purpose of giving relief to people and to commercial firms who, viewed from any reasonable social point of view, are not in need of relief.  It seems when you are faced with such a savage increase in taxation on spirits it can only be justified if the money is required for really socially desirable purposes.  Nobody can argue that that is so in this budget, having regard to the amount of money required by the Minister for Finance in order to subsidise <Col N="1374" /> the rates on commercial properties, to give increased children's allowances to those who do not need them and other purposes which he has outlined here today.  As I said, there are circumstances in which this party could and would support even such a savage imposition.  Those circumstances do not exist today and this party will certainly not support this kind of taxation for the purposes I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that the Opposition have not learned how an Opposition should act.  This is becoming more and more evident as time goes on.  That is not surprising because when they were in Government they did not know how a Government should act either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not start talking.  The position seems to be that the gentlemen across the way, having found that the budget was a good one, so good that they could not believe their ears, are trying to raise matters.  Deputy Colley said a minute ago that he was repeating what he had said before.  A typical example of how confused they are is Deputy Colley's reference to the granting of additional children's allowances to those who do not need them.  He should know as a former Minister for Finance that there is a clawback arrangement which will take this money back from those who will not need it.  His colleague, a short while ago, complained that it was being given and that there was no arrangement being made to take it back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

They did not do those things so therefore they must be wrong.  A moment ago Deputy Allen referred to what he called the rates swindle.

We are now discussing Financial Resolution No. 4 and if anybody tries to tell me that it is better not to put the extra duty on spirits and to leave the old age pensioners, the sick and unemployed with the miserly allowances they were getting from Fianna Fáil then he does not know what is happening in this country.</P>

    <P>In regard to tourism, with which we are all concerned having regard to the difficulty that industry is experiencing at present, one of the points of the Government's programme was that they would carry out a new dynamic programme for tourism to enable the industry to overcome its present difficulties and to get back on the road of progress.  I suggest, from the experience we all have of Irish holidaymakers going abroad to enjoy the attraction of cheap food and drink and also the <Col N="1377" /> barrier this creates for people coming here, that this particular measure by one stroke has done as much damage to our tourism as many of the problems that are beyond our control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not suggest, and I hope nobody will so interpret me, that the function of a budget is to provide cheap drink for tourists: I am not saying that.  I appreciate that we are particularly concerned with the alleviation of hardship among the social welfare classes but all of us who have travelled abroad on Parliamentary delegations or otherwise have, over a considerable time, been concerned by the fact that cheap drink in particular in Europe is becoming a magnet for Irish people. This budget will ensure that magnet will become so much stronger.  It will also ensure that those who might otherwise have considered visiting our shores, particularly from England, where they are very much aware of the price of beer and liquor, will have second thoughts.  The Government may have cause to rue the effect this measure will have on tourism and no doubt the Minister for Transport and Power, with responsibility in this area, will have much to tell us in the future about what the Government are doing.  I hope that, even in some little way, they will alleviate the damage they are doing by this one resolution this evening.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy Colley refer to this as a savage increase in tax on spirits.  I do not think anybody would today begrudge an extra amount for luxuries such as spirits in the interests of improving conditions of the unemployed, the disabled and the old age pensioners. The problem of alcoholism is a very big one and I do not think it is wrong to tax spirits a little more.  I <Col N="1378" /> am delighted that we are hearing something from the Opposition because I note that their present Front Bench have not very much to say. The best attempt is being made from the back benches.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear from what Government speakers have said that the only people who drink are those who can afford it and that it is a luxury.  I think also of the many old people such as pensioners who also like the small quantity of spirits that they can afford from time to time. Surely this should be a consideration also.  I am particularly surprised by the previous speaker talking about luxuries, a man who has stood by these people for so long in the past.  All the increases affect all sections of the community. The aggression we have seen from Government benches reinforces the feeling that this budget, which is an anti-climax to all of us, is as big a disappointment to some of them as it is to us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to address a question to the Taoiseach as I think this has a certain significance.  This 3p increase on the glass of spirits is equivalent to 7.2d which would have been an unheard of increase in a budget two or three years ago.  The magnitude of the increase makes it appear to be designed by the Minister for Health to tackle the problem of alcoholism.  Apart altogether from the <Col N="1379" /> yield of £3.8 million, which the new tax is expected to produce this year, is the projection that it may produce a lesser amount in future years arising from this suggestion which has come from the back benches?  I noticed that the Minister for Local Government went up to Deputy O'Connell to prompt him and encourage him to make this contribution.</P>

      <P>I should like to know what amount of this tax is in respect of social welfare.  We were told by the Minister for Local Government that we are using this imposition of almost 7½d on spirits to finance social welfare.  The Government had almost £30 million handed to them for social welfare this year and did not need to impose anything on spirits.  We did almost as well <Col N="1380" /> last year when we had no EEC money without imposing a penny tax.</P>
      <P>I should like also to know what change has taken place in the social conscience since the Coalition came into power on the strength of abolishing the duty we had imposed on what they called the poor man's pint in order to subsidise foodstuffs in 1948.

      <P>May I advise the House at this juncture that I understand that it is not only desirable but very necessary, as the House will appreciate, that the Financial Resolutions before us be passed tonight as they involve taxation imposed today? Members will appreciate that they will get an opportunity of debating the budget in great depth on the General Resolution.  There are as yet some six more Financial Resolutions to be passed tonight before we come to the General Resolution, on which there can be a debate on the budget proper. So I would ask the indulgence of the House.  I understand it is in accordance with procedure and tradition that Financial Resolutions of this kind are passed on the same day as taxation is imposed.  I may advise the House of this important aspect of the matter and crave their indulgence for the passage of these essential Financial Resolutions on the understanding that we shall have a full debate on the pros and cons of the budgetary proposals on the General Resolution.</P>

We believe that, again, it is inequitable relief in that, while it is admitted that poorer families pay more for food, this relief will benefit the well off, the rich and the very rich to an even greater extent.  We had proposed that instead of removing the tax on food we would make appropriate compensation to the less well-off amongst us, for example, by considerably increasing the children's allowance payments.  There are other objections also that we see to it. I shall not go into them in detail.  I will enumerate them very briefly.  One is that we believe, as indicated by Deputy Colley, that the removal of value-added tax on food will certainly not be reflected in a reduction of food items.  The Minister in his statement today said that special vigilance will be exercised in this respect.  He gave no indication as to the manner in which this would be done.  We know all too well that the exercise of vigilance over retail prices is something that it is very difficult for any Government to do and to have it done effectively would require very many more inspectorate staff than we are likely to have available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1386" /> I want to remind the House again of what was said in relation to the introduction of the decimal coinage system.  Again to repeat what the then Deputy Cosgrave said, it resulted in an explosion in prices.  It is true that any change of this nature increasing tax on commodities generally inevitably leads to a much greater increase in prices.  This is something I would like the Taoiseach to tell us about in relation to the extra vigilance that he says will be maintained on these prices, the extra vigilance which, he said, would be required to ensure that the reduction in the value-added tax on food items will be reflected in across-the-counter payments.</P>
    <P>I think this will add tremendously to the problems of the ordinary housewife who does her shopping, particularly the housewife who goes to the supermarket and puts into her basket food items such as cheese, butter, bread, and who at the same time will have to buy other commodities like soap powder and so on.  She will find herself having to deal with two rates of tax on what she regards as essential items.  I am sure also it will impose an extra burden on retailers.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it will be interesting to hear from the Taoiseach, first of all, how the vigilance will be exercised and in what way confusion can be avoided and, secondly, in relation to the commodities which are regarded as non-luxuries.  The Minister spelt out some of these today in his budget statement and included sweets, ice cream, confectionery, soft drinks and oral medicines.  If somebody has to buy a bandage or a plaster for a cut hand, that item has to bear the extra tax.  The Minister also mentioned some of the other items that will be excluded.</P>

      <P>If I have to buy something to bind up my finger if I cut it I will have to pay the increased tax.  I am not going into detail.  I should like to pass on to other items that will have to bear the higher rate. These include things that everybody has to buy&mdash;clothes, footwear.  These are specifically excluded.</P>
      <P>There is one other item which it is very shortsighted on the part of the Government to exclude, now that we have been trying to find ways and means of enabling people to use their leisure time and encouraging young people to be more active in sporting activities generally.  If a young boy buys football boots he has to pay the extra tax on this item.  I think it was short-sighted on the part of the Government.  If they had the wit to exclude the items that have been excluded, surely they should have excluded these items that are not luxuries.  Perhaps they are nonessentials in that a young boy does not have to buy a pair of football boots or a hurley but it is better to encourage him to do this and keep him off the streets and thus confine his activities to the better things in life. These are just a few of the objections we have and we propose to oppose this resolution also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VivionDeValera" hpid="Major de Valera Major de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Major de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>There could be anomalies on this resolution.  For instance, oral medicines are exempt. Frequently brandy or whiskey are prescribed for old people in particular. If a person gets a prescription for a half bottle of brandy or for a bottle of stout, will it be zero-rated because it is an oral medicine or will it be put in another category and carry a higher rate of VAT?  That is a specific and incontrovertible case. However, I am not making the case only with regard to spirits being in <Col N="1388" /> one category because they are prescribed and in another category because they are not prescribed.  I am quoting this example to illustrate what can happen.  The trader, the purchaser and the tax authorities will have an administrative problem.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister considered this? I put it to him that he is walking into a peculiar kind of trap in the ambidextrous balance of this resolution. One part says certain items are to be zero-rated and the other part in effect says that VAT tax is to be increased.  Between the two an item could slip from one category to the other.  There is a question of what tax is to be imposed and this affects the Revenue, the retailer and the customer. The Minister should look at this on a broad basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This resolution is a clear example of the double-talk of the Government.  Earlier we heard of the various allowances that would be given to the family but we find in part of this resolution that tax on items such as petrol, fuel, clothing, footwear, non-oral medicines, building materials, laundry charges, cleansing materials for the home, furniture, kitchenware and hardware and kitchen equipment will be increased. Items such as fuel, clothing and footwear are important for the less well-off section.</P>
      <P>I should like the Taoiseach to distinguish between oral and non-oral medicines.  There is an increase in taxation on one and a zero-rating on another and this will mean the housewife will have to pay the extra cost. However, there is no change for dances.  Apparently the old age pensioner can still go to dances at the old rate of 11.11 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in petrol will affect the cost of living in a variety of ways. Many old people who have not electricity are compelled to heat their homes by fuel and the extra costs here will hit them badly.  The increase in clothing and footwear will put a substantial burden on the weaker section of the community&mdash;the section of whom we heard so much earlier.  The Government gave it with one hand <Col N="1389" /> and they are trying to take it back by increasing VAT.  People who send items to the laundry will also be affected.  If a person wishes to improve his home he will have to pay more because building materials will cost more.</P>
    <P>For newly-married couples and people who are setting up homes this will mean an extra burden as furniture, furnishings, kitchen equipment and hardware will cost more.  All this is an indication of the double-talk of the Government.  Housewives, especially those who have large families, will be severely hit with the extra costs for footwear and clothing.  Any benefits they have received will be more than absorbed by these new increases. Dances will still be at the old rate but there is no doubt it will be the Government's last tango in Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition referred to a matter which I think took the Taoiseach by surprise, namely, the increase in the rate of duty that will apply to sports goods and equipment.  The increase is a significant one of more than 3 per cent.  Having had experience in dealing with sport and recreational organisations for more than two years, and having established a sports and recreational council to promote recreational activity and to show the community the beneficial effects, I am sorry the Government have taken a detrimental step in the development of the sporting and recreational programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to tell the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Government that representations had been made to me by the various recreational organisations to reduce the rate of tax on sports equipment and thus ensure that recreation would be used to the fullest extent by as many people as possible, particularly deprived children from our cities.  It was pointed out to me that they should have every opportunity to indulge in useful physical recreation.  However, despite that and the attempts of the former Government to encourage and promote useful and healthy recreation, the Government have introduced this <Col N="1390" /> measure which puts a higher rate of VAT on sports goods and equipment.</P>
    <P>This is very different from the impression given to the public in the election campaign by the National Coalition Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the resolution and the Government's proposals that they would be able to take VAT from food by transferring it to luxury items.  If electrical goods, furniture and sports equipment are to be classified as luxury items, if this is the Government's way of fulfilling their pledge to the electorate, I think events will judge them for having misled the people.  In that connection, I said before I thought there were signs from hints that had been made that items other than luxury items would be included in the increased rate of VAT.</P>
      <P>A matter of great concern to me in my home town, Nenagh, is the price of hardware.  As a result of this budget &mdash;Deputy Dowling pointed this out&mdash; most articles of furniture as well as household fittings will be taxed at a greatly increased rate.  The manufacture and sale of kitchen utensils represents a very important part of Nenagh's economy and these will now be subject to a higher VAT rate.  It is obvious the Government have not heeded, or have forgotten, the text of the greatest authority of all: &ldquo;Not on bread alone doth man live.&rdquo;  They think that the exclusion of food from VAT entitles them to tax any other item.  They have apparently deluded themselves into the belief that in doing this they are discharging their promises to the electorate.</P>

      <P>Value-added tax was introduced by the party opposite when they were in Government.  The simple fact is that it is a complicated tax.  Whether it is at the existing three rates operating up to now, or whether they are revised as is being done in this budget, it is still a complicated system.  Deputies, and particularly Deputies who were Ministers, know that and appreciate it.  We gave an undertaking in our letters of intent to take value-added tax off food.  We have completed that.  We said it would be replaced by an alteration in the rates on other items.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1394" /> For the benefit of the House, the social surveys show that, in the lower income group, 40 per cent of the income is spent on food, and 60 per cent on all other items.  We propose to take 5 per cent off food which will certainly give a much greater benefit to the lower income group who spend 40 per cent of their total income on food.  In respect of a number of other items the increase will vary from 3 per cent in some cases to 1½ per cent in others.</P>

      <P>The fact is that there is a slight variation upwards but there is also a reduction in the stamp duty in respect of houses.  As a contribution to the newly marrieds Deputy Dowling was so solicitous about some months ago, we have given this reduction, announced in the budget, amounting in the case of lower priced houses to over £100.  That is a considerable benefit.  We are leaving the dance hall tax at the existing rate.  I was in a Government at one time which put a tax on dance halls and the then deputy leader of the then Opposition gave a written undertaking to the dance hall proprietors that he would take the whole tax off.  It was taken off in a subsequent budget when they got into office.  I think it is better to leave tax on dance halls and take it off food.</P>

I see that the rate of value-added tax on radio sets is being increased from 30.26 per cent to 36.75 per cent, an increase of 6.5 per cent.

      <P>I want to say something very briefly about death duties because this was a great plank in the Coalition's election manifesto.  It is <Col N="1406" /> proposed to reduce death duties by £0.7 million.  That is the net relief this year.  The total amount collected last year was £11 million so there is a reduction of approximately 6 per cent in death duties.  The so-called reduction in death duties, whether people have realised it or not, is negligible. While there has been some very limited reduction in some aspects of death duties and some parts of estate duty there has been the most appalling increase in two very important parts of death duties, in legacy duty and in succession duty.  I thought the time had come when we could begin to think of getting rid of legacy duty and succession duty because these are paid on top of estate duty.</P>
      <P>The fair, reasonable and equitable thing to do&mdash;this has been done in other countries&mdash;would be to get rid of them but today we find the Minister for Finance proposing to double these duties.  If a farmer leaves his farm to his brother, sister or nephew instead of that person getting the relief which was so generously promised him before the last election he will, in fact, be paying substantially more in death duties.  This should be brought home to the people as quickly as possible because the relief in death duties as a whole is negligible and there is a most vicious and brutal increase in a very important part of them.</P>
      <P>It must be a long time since the rate of death duties in any particular category was doubled in this country. I doubt if it ever happened before. Today, we have had a most vicious increase and the sooner the better the farmers and other people in the country who own property, which has gone up so much in value in the last few years, realise that not alone are they getting no relief whatever as a result of this budget but a lot of them will be paying very substantially more in death duties.  We have to oppose very vehemently Financial Resolution No. 6.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not time to deal with the other matters but there are appallingly heavy increases in motor taxation and driving licence fees which will have a most crippling effect on <Col N="1407" /> private individuals of all classes throughout the country and, above all, they will have a most crippling effect on business and will put up costs and make the inflationary spiral an even greater one than it is.</P>

      <P>One of the greatest hopes for the constituency I represent is the specially designated areas, the idea of a mixture of agricultural and industrial development.  The motor car is absolutely essential for the small farmer to take him to the local industrial town.  This is a very important aspect of rural sociology at the moment.  The European sociologists <Col N="1408" /> say that this is the salvation of the rural areas.</P>
