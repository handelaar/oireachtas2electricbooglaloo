      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>

      <P>The making of a supplementary grant under section 26 of the Housing Act, 1966, is entirely a matter for each local authority and not one in which I have any power to intervene. Jt is open to any applicant to request an authority to reconsider their decision if further relevant information is put forward in support of his application.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will ask local authorities to remove the anomaly whereby an applicant for a higher rate of new house grant may be paid the grant but can be refused a supplementary grant when application is made in a different year in which his income may be higher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 26 of the Housing Act. 1966, the method of assessment of the income of an applicant for a supplementary grant is entirely a matter within the discretion of each local authority concerned and is a matter in which I would be very loath to interfere.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the 1966 Housing Act.  Surely he is aware that under the 1970 Housing Act in the case of supplementary grants the income for any one of three years, the year in which the house is built, the previous year or the subsequent year, may be taken for grant purposes?  In a case where the applicant does not apply for the supplementary grant until he receives the Department's grant &mdash;which may be two years after the year in which he built the new house &mdash;surely the Parliamentary Secretary should urge local authorities to use the provisions of the 1970 Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter for the local authority concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Parliamentary Secretary in saying so is referring to the 1966 Housing Act?  I am asking him to operate the provisions of the 1970 Act which does give discretion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if in some way, by circular or otherwise, he would urge local authorities to use the provisions of the 1970 Act for the benefit of applicants for supplementary grants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will give in regard to North Tipperary details of the financial allocation for (a) housing construction and (b) loans and grants for the years ending 31st March, 1973, and 31st March, 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation for local authority housing construction for the year ended the 31st March, 1973, was £289,810 as compared with £490,000 for the year ending 31st March, 1974.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocations for house purchase loans and supplementary grants for <Col N="763" /> the same years are £132,686 and £250,000 respectively.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will arrange for the increased income ceiling for new house loans which applies to applications made on or after 25th May, 1973, to be applied also in the case of applications made before that date and which are still the subject of local authority investigations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent decisions regarding an increase in the maximum loan and income limits for house purchase loans and the income limit for supplementary grants were made in the light of all relevant factors and I do not propose to alter the operative date as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy who asks the question is entitled to ask a supplementary one?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, Deputy Power usually sits on my right.  I was looking for him but did not catch his eye.  Deputy Power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that in effect this would mean that applications will now be scrapped and that people anxious to build houses will be forced to make a new application and the consequent delay will have the effect of not putting into practice the Minister's intention of enabling people to build houses more quickly?  Does he not think that current applications not yet finalised should be given the benefit of this new legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows a time limit was introduced and we do not propose to change the date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should realise that this will mean that those wishing to build houses and who will qualify under the new regulations will now be forced to make a fresh application which will involve a further delay of two or three <Col N="764" /> months in starting the house.  If he is sincere in his intention to allow 25,000 houses to be built this year, surely he could waive this regulation and allow the cases to be examined now and enable people to build their houses straight away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, a loan limit of £4,500 was introduced in all areas on 25th May, 1973. The previous maximum loan was £3,800 in certain built-up areas and £3,400 in other areas.  A substantial increase was made there.  Secondly, an income limit of £2,000 was also introduced on the 25th May in respect of applications received on and after that date.  This new limit replaced the £1,800 limit.  The income limit for supplementary grants was also increased from £1,500 to £1,700 plus an allowance of £100 in respect of each dependant subject to a maximum of four.  This new income limit also applies to applications received on and after 25th May, 1973. It is very clear that we are interested in people and that we have given substantial increases in regard to housing loans.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the new scheme would a person be debarred from making a fresh application if his previous one had been rejected?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course he could and it would be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from the Parliamentary Secretary's reply that 25th May, 1973, is the qualifying date under the new scheme and that anyone who has got sanction before that date is out?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if a reconstruction grant will be paid to a person (name supplied) in Main Street, Rathcoole. County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="765" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>This house will be inspected this week.  If the work is found to have been satisfactorily completed arrangements will be made for early payment of the appropriate grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>This house has already been inspected and the inspector set out very strict regulations for this man who could be described as a very ill man.  I think it is a most unfair decision. When this man set about&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect the Deputy to ask a supplementary question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. Walsh Mr. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am within the limits.  If I ask a question I am trying to make a case for this man. The reply has been given to me that the house will be inspected this week but I asked this question in relation to the new regulations of the Department. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider the matter and have the grant allocated to this man. I think he is entitled to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>This applicant was allocated a reconstruction grant of £100 on 27th November, 1972.  This is the maximum grant allowed.  The house will be inspected this week and if the work is satisfactory arrangements will be made for a very early payment of the grant.  There has been an unavoidable delay in having the inspection carried out in this case. The applicant reported on 4th April, 1973, that the work was completed and requested an inspection.  Due to the shortage of inspectors, an increase in the volume of work and the engagement of housing inspectors on the national housing stock survey there have been delays in having housing inspections carried out.  This is being rectified in Dublin by the assignment of extra building inspectors to the area and the introduction on May 21st of an intensification of housing inspection.  I hope that satisfies the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>A general grant allocation of £374,410 has been made to Mayo County Council for the improvement and upkeep of main roads, other than national roads, and for the improvement of county roads.  In addition a special grant of £40,000 has been notified to the county council for the improvement of the Belmullet-Ballyglass county road.  I regret that the total moneys available to me for the Road Fund Grants do not permit of an additional grant for the purpose requested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that there are 1,500 miles of untarred roads in County Mayo to be done and that there is not <Col N="768" /> a hope in the next 20 years of these green roads being completed if a special grant is not provided?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a substantial increase of £88,000 this year, and if county roads in Mayo are not being black-topped, it is due to the engineering policy of that county.  If the county engineer was prepared to act as other county engineers and do the county roads instead of major extensions the situation in County Mayo would not be as it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinFinn" hpid="Mr. Finn Mr. Finn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that, due to the poor surface of roads in County Mayo, it costs a lot more money to tar a mile of road than it does in the eastern counties, and that the cost of constructing those roads is double the cost in any other part of Ireland.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter for the local authority concerned having regard to the superannuation legislation applicable to the particular case subject to the usual right of appeal.</P>
      <P>In general, a pensionable officer or pensionable servant of a local authority who was given a period of leave of absence to join the Defence Forces during the Emergency can reckon such period as pensionable local authority service.  Similarly, a pensionable officer or pensionable servant of a local authority who was or is given a period of leave of absence with pay&mdash;or without pay in certain circumstances&mdash;for annual training with the Defence Forces or the Reserve Defence Forces or who was called out on service with the Reserve Defence Forces First Line can reckon such period as pensionable local authority service.</P>
      <P>A pensionable servant of a local authority who had service with the Defence Forces during the Emergency and who had some service days with a local authority before and after the Emergency can reckon such Emergency Defence Forces service for superannuation purposes in the same proportion as his local authority service is now reckonable in the three financial years preceding and the three financial years succeeding his service with the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am having examined at present the question of providing that not <Col N="776" /> more than two years of Emergency Defence Force service may be aggregated with subsequent local authority service for superannuation purposes in cases where such survice is not now reckonable or where the existing entitlements of the persons concerned are not more favourable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Sections 26, 31 and 35 of the Local Government (Planning and Development Act, 1963, give planning authorities powers to ensure that developers satisfactorily complete estates.  Section 26 enables a planning authority to attach conditions to a grant of permission requiring the developer to carry out all necessary works and also to attach conditions for requiring the giving of security <Col N="778" /> for the satisfactory completion of the development. Sections 31 and 35 enable a planning authority to serve enforcement notices on the owner or occupier of the land or on the person who commenced the development or any other person who has carried out or is carrying out development authorised by a permission, requiring such persons to comply with the terms of the permission.  In the event of failure to comply with an enforcement notice a planning authority may enter on the land, do the works themselves and recover any expenses they reasonably incur.  A person failing to comply with an enforcement notice is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £100 with provision on further conviction for a fine of up to £20 per day for each day on which the offence is continued.</P>

      <P>The calculations which were the basis of the information in my reply to Questions Nos. 24 and 25 of 6th June, 1973, were undertaken by the Central Statistics Office using the weights in the official consumer price index.</P>
      <P>The CSO used the detailed weighting pattern of the index to estimate the overall effect of price changes for each affected item equivalent to the changes in value-added tax and other charges provided for in the budget.  Details of the changes in the index as thus calculated are set out in the form of a tabular statement, which, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.  Following is the table:</P>

      <P>The Special Committee of the Employer/Labour Conference did not, in fact, make any recommendations about parliamentarians' salaries: it indicated what the levels would be on the basis of certain assumptions.  The Government gave full consideration to the report of the special committee and they are satisfied that their decisions on the pay of parliamentarians as announced in the budget speech, are fair and reasonable and should be accepted as a final determination of the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government will not accept that it is an insult to compare the lot of social welfare recipients with the position of parliamentarians. May I say in reply to the <Col N="789" /> Deputy's other irrelevant point that if any change has been made in the status and pay situation of judges that change was made by the previous administration and it is one which we inherited and in relation to which we had to make amends.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of this assertion by the Minister that he or his Government inherited the situation from the previous Government as far as judges and parliamentarians are concerned, he said in his original reply that the Government decided to make their decision on a fair and just basis. How can he equate that statement with putting Members of this House in an inferior position to judges in light of the fact that the previous Government established what was regarded as a fair and just basis for the remuneration of both the legislature and the judiciary?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Lynch must be aware, after several years as head of the Government, that government is an exercise in choice and the choice facing this administration, which we took bravely and make no apology for, was the choice as to the date upon which the increases would operate.  If fair remuneration was not paid to parliamentarians before the change of administration that is not our responsibility, it is the responsibility of those who held office at the time in question.  As far as this administration were concerned the first date on which they could give amelioration to the misery of the under-privileged in our community was 1st July and we did not consider it appropriate that parliamentarians, who are comparatively better shod and better provided for, should receive any benefit at an earlier date.  We make no apology for that decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making any comparison with recipients of social welfare benefits and nobody can deny to this side the concern that we showed for that section of our community. Is the Minister aware that the previous Government submitted the Devlin Commission's report to the <Col N="790" /> Employer/Labour Conference to decide whether or not that report was in conformity with the national wage agreement and decided that the Government decision on it would be dependent on whether or not the commission considered it to be in such conformity?  Is he aware that there was no intention on the part of the previous Government to differentiate between the judiciary and the legislature in this respect?  Is the Minister further aware that the decision of the Employer/Labour Conference was conveyed to the Government only in the last month of last year and before the first session of the new Dáil could have taken place?  Is he aware, therefore, that the responsibility evolved on this Government and not on the previous Government fairly to implement that recommendation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;for the inclusion of any figure to meet the amount required to implement the recommendations of the Special Committee of the Employer/Labour Conference, as must be apparent from the budget figures where we had to make an additional provision to meet the bill. If the last administration decided to kick to touch instead of playing the ball and if they achieved no goal <Col N="791" /> theirs is the responsibility for kicking to touch. If they wanted the credit, if credit they call it, for paying parliamentarians ahead of social welfare beneficiaries they had the opportunity and they did not take it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether the report of the Special Committee of the Employer/ Labour Conference in relation to higher civil servants has been implemented; if so, from what date; and the dates on which the salaries of such grades were increased in any of the years from 1968 to the present year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1968 the pay increases under the various rounds have been applied to all higher civil servants with effect from the following dates : 1 June, 1968, 11th Round&mdash;Phase I; 1 June, 1969, 11th Round&mdash;Phase II; I April, 1970. 12th Round&mdash;Phase I; I January. 1971. 12th Round&mdash;Phase <Col N="792" /> II; I January, 1972, National Agreement 1970-Phase I; I January, 1973, National Agreement 1970&mdash;Phase II: I June, 1973, National Agreement 1972&mdash;Phase I.</P>
      <P>As regards the national agreement increases, these revisions and their effective dates were in line with the recommendations made by the Special Committee of the Employer-Labour Conference which were, as I announced in my budget statement of 16th May last, accepted by the Government.</P>
      <P>In addition, officers with scales of pay whose maxima fell short of the maximum of the assistant secretary scale were given an interim anomaly increase under clause 6 of the National Agreement 1970.  One half of the increase was paid with effect from 1st October, 1970, and the remainder with effect from 1st April, 1971.</P>
      <P>In so far as the report of the Special Committee of the Employer/Labour Conference is concerned the only outstanding issue in regard to the higher Civil Service is the resolution of their anomaly claims under clause 18 of the current national agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Hegarty</b> asked the Minister for Finance if he will consider abolishing the Agricultural Credit Corporation in favour of a direct Government lending authority in view of their failure to grant financial facilities to deserving applicant farmers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the total number of applications received by the Agricultural Credit Corporation in the year ending 30th April, the percentage of approvals issued was 84 in 1969, 85 in 1970, 90 in 1971, 89 in 1972 and 89 in 1973.  These figures indicate that far from refusing deserving farmers, the corporation have gone a great distance towards meeting the very large and continually growing demand for credit. It is not to be expected that the corporation, or indeed any responsibly-run credit institution, would have a 100 per cent record of acceptance of applications. I am satisfied that the corporation's record in regard to applications shows that they are achieving a balanced progress in which expansion is combined with reasonable prudence.</P>
      <P>As regards the proposal to abolish the Agricultural Credit Corporation in the first part of the question, I consider that the ACC, with the degree of independence which they enjoy as a semi-State body, are the most appropriate type of organisation for handling State credit for farmers.  I am satisfied that the corporation have shown that they deal with each application on its merits.  The Government would not be in favour of any change which might have the effect of impairing the corporation's day-to-day independence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Redundancy Contributions (Variation of Rates) Order, 1973.</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 13th June, 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This resolution proposes the approval of a draft order to provide for increases in the rates of weekly redundancy <Col N="798" /> contributions.  My authority to make this order is contained in section 28 of the Redundancy Payment Act, 1967.  The necessity for seeking the increases to be applied under this fund arises from the fact that the fund is now in deficit and advances from the Exchequer have to be obtained to meet payments from the fund.</P>
    <P>The main point I wish to bring to the notice of Deputies in relation to this order is that it is proposed that the necessary extra amount sought in order to keep the fund operative will be sought from the employer and not from the worker.</P>
    <P>For the information of Deputies I would mention that up to now the employer's contribution has been 5p in respect of male workers and 4p in respect of women workers and that the worker's contribution has been 3p for men and 2p for women.  In the changed situation as proposed, the worker's contributions will remain as they are while the employer's contribution will be increased to 10p in respect of both men and women.  We are not seeking increased rates of contribution but are merely altering the burden of contributions from employee to employer.  The belief I bring to this area is that, for the majorpart, the advantage of changes occurring as a result of redundancy goes to the employer.</P>
    <P>We are aware of situations where it is necessary for employers, in the interest of the better management of their businesses, to introduce new productivity techniques which must mean the removal of workers from their place of work.  Since the main beneficiary of technological change arising out of redundancy is the employer, the employee should not be asked to contribute to funds which protect him in redundancy.  That is the major change suggested here.</P>
    <P>There is quite an amount of redundancy that is planned in boardrooms for the purpose of better management. There is also the situation in which many workers, after being declared redundant, must wait some time before finding suitable alternative employment. These people should not be asked to contribute more towards the finances <Col N="799" /> that help them when they are out of work.</P>
    <P>In Britain, the employee does not contribute at all in this regard.  Here the employee will continue to contribute but I do not expect to ask for any further increases in his contribution.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that the new rate of contribution will bring in approximately £3,700.000 in a full year which is the amount estimated as necessary to keep the fund in credit to repay Exchequer advances with interest and to build up a reasonable reserve.  The new rate can be brought into operation by the passing of this order.  I hope Deputies will agree that it is necessary to keep the fund in a full financial credit situation so that in the event of redundancies, the people concerned can be paid their redundancy benefit and that they will agree also with the principle that the employer should bear the burden of the increased contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Minister's remarks.  This second increase in the rate of the redundancy contribution will bring it up to 13p or, in other words, will bring the cost of the stamp up to £3.14 per week.  This is a fairly substantial amount, most of which is paid now by the employer.</P>
      <P>As I said yesterday on the Second Stage of the Social Welfare Bill, Finance are ensuring that their contribution to the social fund will be less than it was in the past by reason of the employer and the employee contributing a greater part than two-thirds, which was the proportion they contributed up to now.  However, this is something about which one can only be definite in retrospect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would have liked the Minister to inform us what is the estimated expectation of redundancy during the year. The £3,700,000 must be a figure that was measured against some estimate. When I last introduced, by the same type of order, an increase in the cost of the stamp which was made necessary by the amendment to the Redundancy Act.  I was accused of providing for mass redundancy which it was said. <Col N="800" /> by my critics, would be due to the incompetence of those in charge of our economic affairs, namely, the Government. The Minister referred to rationalisation at boardroom level.  I would point out that the number of redundancies have fallen in the first quarter of this year as compared with the corresponding period last year.  In those circumstances, and if this reduction were to be a continuing trend, I would not have thought that any further increase in the rates of redundancy contributions would be necessary.</P>
    <P>When the amending Bill was before the House I was subjected to a good deal of criticism from the then Opposition who regarded the provision as being inadequate and not sufficiently generous.  At that time there was a reasonable surplus in the fund and on that account we considered that it was incumbent on us to make better provision for those who would be rendered redundant.  The amendment reduced the qualifying period while increasing the lump sum as well as making better provision for the weekly payments that comprised some of the benefits of the scheme.  At the time I was under heavy pressure to make the provisions retrospective but in view of the experience in the UK I did not do this.  In the UK the payments during the first year or two of the operation of the scheme were relatively small.  The fund built up a heavy surplus but after a while it became depleted and went into a deficit situation.  It was my opinion that we might have the same experience here. The situation that came about in Britain would seem to indicate that when workers became wise to the provisions of the Act, more ways were found for claiming redundancy payments.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister if proper supervision is maintained, particularly at the tribunal level, with regard to claims where persons are in a position to use the redundancy scheme to great benefit if they are nearing the retiring age.  A man working for the Forestry Division or some other body, discovers at the age of 64 that while he will be due his ordinary gratuity and pension in a year's time, if he can be discharged or <Col N="801" /> rendered redundant, he will qualify for a lump-sum and weekly payments and in a year's time qualify for his retirement pension.  I have always felt anxious to examine the question as to whether this is a device whereby a good deal of the fund is frittered away.</P>
    <P>The fact remains that the provisions of the Amendment to the Redundancy Act of 1967 did make rather generous provision for persons made redundant and made it much more easy to qualify. The result was that. while there was not any great upsurge in the number of redundancies&mdash;in fact they showed a very substantial reduction in the first quarter of this year, as I have already said&mdash;while the surplus was eroded, I thought the last increase in the stamp was a guarantee of sufficient income to keep current redundancies sufficiently in funds.  I question whether the Minister is not being overgenerous or else he is expecting a further increase in redundancies towards the end of this year in this increase which will bring in £3,700,000 that is now being provided for.</P>
    <P>I did point out at that time that any country, even a country with full employment, has to cope with a high percentage of redundancies, where techniques are changing and personnel is being moved around and rendered redundant as a result of ordinary efficiency methods being introduced. But I would not like it to be accepted that redundancies in our time were due to the economic situation as being managed by the Government and that they are now due to rationalisation taking place at boardroom level.</P>
    <P>One would always be prepared to support the provision of a substantial income to the fund because this is one of the most useful schemes that we had produced and it did make very generous provision for unfortunate cases of genuine redundancy.  Nobody on this side of the House would wish to see the fund depleted to the stage where payments would be in jeopardy but I did not think a further increase in the weekly contribution would be warranted as yet, particularly in view of the reduction in the number of redundancies in the earlier part of the year <Col N="802" /> which I would hope would be a continuing trend.</P>
    <P>There is nothing further one would say at this stage about this increase except that we must be eternally vigilant about any increase in the insurance stamp.  I have already said this on many occasions in the House. It is all very well to say it is in line with the EEC countries to make the employer pay the greater share rather than the employee and the State, but in a small country where relatively few people are contributing it is hardly appropriate to make comparisons with highly industrialised countries where there is full employment and a big population and where there is a totally different situation. We must have regard to those who employ the greater number of persons employed in this country, particularly in the services.  They are employed by small employers who sometimes find it difficult enough to provide for all contingencies.  It is most important that due regard would be had to the amount which the employer would be asked to pay.  The employer has to meet many charges in the course of the year.  He has to pay income tax and make provision for redundancies and the various other elements in the stamp.  There are various other obstacles that he encounters in the course of the discharge of his duties as an employer. One has to wonder at times whether the employer would not feel that he would be better to be an employee rather than an employer.  It is not unusual to find that an employer is less well-off at the end of the year than are those he is employing.</P>
    <P>We had a very difficult fight in this country to build up an industrial arm. I shall not go back to the days when the Fianna Fáil Government had to suffer the sneers that were levelled at them from this side of the House and were accused of organising workshops in back-lanes and calling them factories. When the tariff wall was built to encourage local investment in industries and to enable them to use the home market to get on their feet, the consumer was being told what he had to pay extra as a result of tariffs <Col N="803" /> and about the inferior products he had to buy as a result of those tariffs. Those were the days when industry was struggling to get a foothold.  We have reached the stage when most of our industries can compete against the best manufacturers in the world. Having achieved that standard and having reached that happy situation, they are facing into free trade, with the protection that was afforded them being rapidly dismantled.  We must have due regard, in a free private enterprise economy, for the burden we heap on to the employer time and again.  People too frequently think of the few wealthy employers in the higher category.  These could be counted on the fingers of two hands. The majority of our employers are small employers giving good employment. It is they who feel the brunt of the extra charges passed on to them time and again.</P>
    <P>It is not quite correct to say that the redundancy scheme, however good it may be, is entirely to the benefit of the employer.  He is caught for quite a percentage of the lump sum he has to pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly not to the benefit of the employee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The employee is the person who really benefits.  Compare the situation today with that which existed prior to 1967, when the employee who was redundant had to go home and hope for the best.  He now has the redundancy scheme plus social welfare benefits and he can move around and he can use the manpower service to train for another job. He certainly benefits.  In the case of the employer, the rebate he ultimately receives in respect of the lump sum that he pays is at best, if I remember correctly, only 70 per cent, depending on the length of notice he has given the employee before he is rendered redundant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a scheme that we welcomed and in which we had great faith, a scheme which has done a great deal to offset the effects of redundancies that have occurred since the scheme came into operation. We are not for a <Col N="804" /> moment shirking our responsibility to see that funds are made available and that the necessary disbursements can be paid.  It was provided in the Act that, if at any time contributions were falling short of outgoings, the contribution could be increased by bringing in a motion and getting the approval of Parliament.  I hope the substantial additional cost of the stamp proposed by the Minister is not as a result of an estimated increase in redundancies in the period ahead. Our party will support any required increase to the fund at any time provided it is necessary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has told us that he wants to keep the fund solvent and we will support him in this.  However, as there has been a downward trend in redundancies in the last quarter I find it difficult to understand the action of the Minister. It sows a doubt in our minds that perhaps the Minister and his advisers foresee large-scale redundancies in the remainder of the year.  It appears the Minister does not intend to overhaul the Act that has been in existence for six years.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister three questions.  First, does he anticipate grave redundancies?  Secondly, does he intend to review the entire Act at a future date and, thirdly, does he consider an increase in redundancy payments is warranted at the moment because of inflationary tendencies? I realise it is essential to keep the fund solvent but the Minister has sowed doubts in our minds about his action at a time when redundancies show a downward trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>The main factor which led to the deficit situation in the fund was the increase during 1972 in the number of people made redundant. During 1972 some 10,159 workers qualified for redundancy payments, compared with 8,556 in 1971 and 3,895 in 1970.  It was mainly as a result of the huge increase in redundancies in 1972 that the fund was decreased so appreciably.  I do not forsee any alarming increase in redundancies in the coming period.  I see instead that the fund has been depleted to a quite considerable <Col N="805" /> extent mainly because of redundancies during 1972.</P>
      <P>I know that most Deputies will agree that in a redundancy situation the workers are the primary casualties. That is why I have taken the line that the increase which is required to keep the fund in a buoyant condition should be asked for from the employer.  I may have misunderstood Deputy Brennan, but I am not sure if he was saying the employer should not be burdened with the increase required to keep the fund ill a viable condition.  His remarks left me in some puzzlement about whether he thought the employee&mdash;the unfortunate man made redundant by schemes of industrial reorganisation&mdash; should be asked to contribute the finances necessary to keep him alive while he is seeking another job. That is not my philosophy and I have made it clear this is a change from the past, that we seek from the employer the increases necessary to keep the fund in a good condition.  I maintain that, in fact the employer is the main beneficiary of any necessary redundancy which occurs at the place of work. After all, in the most part it arises from reorganisaltion of methods of work and, since he is the main beneficiary and as the employee is the unfortunate person who will have to search for other work, it is wrong in equity that the employee should be asked to pay extra for finance to be provided to enable him to find other work.</P>
      <P>If the worker is the primary casualty in a redundancy situation, the position is aggravated by the general absence of any process of consultation regarding the future of his job.  We all know that many workers have found themselves victims of week-end redundancy, where they left their job on Friday evening and it was not there for them on Monday morning.  My Department have engaged in a thorough review of the whole consultation procedure throughout industry and shortly we hope to produce plans that will change that state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Britain the worker does not contribute anything.  It is not because it is done in Britain that we are doing so here, but it is in line with practice in other EEC countries where the <Col N="806" /> employer has a far greater social cost to pay in his treatment of workers than has his counterpart in Ireland.  It is a good principle that the employer should have to consider his workers as more than the economic adjuncts of the workplace, that he should be asked to contribute to certain social costs.  All of us here, whatever our politics, agree that workers are entitled to be considered as human beings and to be treated as such in their place of work.</P>
    <P>These are the reasons we have sought the increases.  That is why most Deputies will agree in fairness that the employer should be asked to pay the extra cost and most enlightened employers will agree this is a fair proposition.  There may be certain employers who will object; perhaps, taking a cue from Deputy Brennan, they may say their bills are much too high at present and that they have too many costs to meet. I appreciate employers have these costs to meet but most fair-minded people, looking at industry, will agree that the weaker person is the worker and that the man who must primarily bear the extra cost should be the employer.</P>
    <P>The employee is forced to look for other work when he is made redundant. Frequently he is not consulted in the situation that leads to his redundancy and the changes in production at the place of employment chiefly benefit the employer.  It is for these reasons that we have broken with the tradition of a step-by-step approach by employer and worker in contributions to the redundancy scheme and we have given the burden of the extra contribution to the employer.  Most Deputies will agree that this is the fair and right thing to do and I hope that even the employers who may be critical will see that at least it goes in the direction of the other EEC countries and that it is a step in the right direction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>When progress was reported, I was exploring the Minister's mind in regard to his statement that many uneconomic services are provided by the Department on social grounds.  I hope the Minister will tell us what criteria he used when deciding that a service which was uneconomic might have a social value and should, therefore, be provided. In a letter I asked him to have a telephone kiosk erected on Shannon Bridge in County Cavan, not purely on social grounds because the area is developing from a tourist point of view.  People go there to see the origin of the Shannon.  Paul Gallico, the writer, has purchased a little place there.  If one were being cynical one might say that the best way to <Col N="808" /> cut him off from the world would be to provide him with a kiosk in that area.  Anybody who knows how slow the service is in country areas might be inclined to be cynical about it, but I am in earnest about the installation of a telephone in that area.</P>
      <P>Some funny things are going on in the Department in regard to telephones. This information has been elicited by numerous questions in the House since I joined it.  There is a system of not installing telephones or erecting kiosks where there seems to be a social and even an economic need and there is a system of transferring telephones from inside houses to outside houses where the service already exists.  I know that Deputy Geoghegan said here that this was a good thing in certain circumstances so that telephone services would be available throughout the night and that when the telephone was in the local post office it was not so readily available and this caused hardship. My theory is that if there is a telephone that is useable in the area for an all night service, it would be better to provide telephones where there are none.</P>
      <P>The Minister is a literary man and could, I think, write a play on the theory of the flying kiosk.  The pole is being moved around in certain villages while villages with no service are not being supplied with it.  The Minister knows that the Post Office has provided material for a play for Seán O'Casey and Tagore also wrote a play on the subject.  If this system of transferring phones from inside to outside the House is continued while people are crying out for telephones in other areas and not being supplied with them, there is raw material there for a reasonably surefire farce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister in his speech took a stand against unbridled commercialism.  It is a pity that we must rely in our television and radio services to so great an extent on advertising. The question of standards in advertising has been raised here and in other countries also.  We should insist on high standards of diction and English or Irish in advertisements and that Irish voices should <Col N="809" /> be used in them. It is no great encouragement to our actors if, for example, we are exhorted to use a certain detergent by heavily accented North English voices.  We should help the trade union concerned to insist as far as possible on Irish actors being used.  When these actors go to the US they are &ldquo;cribbed, cabined and confined&rdquo; by union rules there.  I know there are difficulties now since we have become members of the EEC, with the right of establishment and right of work, but there is a certain appropriateness in having Irish actors advertising wares if we must have advertising on our radio and TV programmes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister poses the question as to what the people want and should get from the television or radio service. Give them what they want.  He does not exactly say that but he implies they should get what they want. It is a very difficult thing to decide what type of programme people want &mdash;is lia daoine ná tuairim&mdash;and I personally thought, seeing that drama generally is a Celtic <i>forte,</i> that drama on our Irish television would be very <Col N="811" /> strong.  It did not come off quite as well as I thought it would and it is not quite the same as drama in the theatre.  There are problems connected with the medium itself and my initial disappointment is now wearing off.  I do not have a lot of time to watch television anyhow.</P>
    <P>One point I would like to make is in relation to standards.  A percipient critic some years ago did maintain that Dublin was deteriorating culturally into a kind of provincial city, a city which did not develop its own literary and cultural standards but rather looked to London or elsewhere. There was some evidence of this some time ago but I think we may be pulling out of that now in all the various media and developing our own kind of soul, our own standards, for both radio and television.</P>
    <P>The Minister, whose hand can be clearly seen in this section, allows himself the luxury of a great number of rhetorical questions as to what we mean by our national culture. Rhetorical questions are never meant to be answered and are very often a device for giving the answers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy has the answers, I would be delighted to hear them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to explore myself to see what answers I would have, but there seemed to be in the rhetorical questions an idea that many people did have a rather narrow view of our national culture and if that implication was there, while I admit that some people had that view, I do not think a great many people did. For the most part Irish people take a rather broad view of culture and I would have no difficulty in throwing the mantle of national culture over the most diverse people who contributed to the cultural development of this country, if &ldquo;development&rdquo; is the right word.  I think that all the traditions did make a contribution and I have no difficulty in putting Edgeworth with 6 Cadhain or a Monk's poem in Irish with any modern Irish poem the Minister might like to think <Col N="812" /> of.  I think that the greatest specific Gaelic or Irish language tradition was not at its best constricted or confined and I think the Irish mind for the most part is far more open than it is given credit for and this should be reflected on our national television service.  I think we did get a bad name, and in this context, deservedly so, for some scandalous censorship over a short period really in our history and I do not think this is indicative of the <i>geist</i> or spirit of the Irish people.</P>
      <P>I think our television service could be used in the context of a university of the air.  This has been mentioned already, but, again, I would like it to have, to use the Minister's words, our own accent rather than the importing of programmes <i>en masse</i> from any other television service. I believe there is a report on adult education awaited and the television service could be used&mdash;I am not going to anticipate what the conclusions of that report will be&mdash;to promote adult education.  I am thinking in particular of promoting diplomas in agricultural science, in home economics, using television in conjunction with the marvellous educational groupings in rural Ireland such as Macra na Tuaithe and Macra na Feirme.  Macra na Tuaithe deals with the younger group and Macra na Feirme with a somewhat older group. A well organised educational programme could be beamed on those two groups to the advantage of living, apart altogether from the economic advantage of such a programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To me the words &ldquo;national culture&rdquo; seem to be&mdash;and this may be a dangerous thing to say&mdash;almost a blank cheque on which you could fill in the details of cultural activities which have a kind of Irish accent, to re-use that word.  Most Irish people would find that easy.  An exploration of the various strands should be a chore for either radio, or television, or both.  The efforts of settlers in this country&mdash;and by &ldquo;settlers&rdquo; I mean comparatively recent settlers: people like Carleton at the great divide between the Celtic and the Anglo-lrish traditions&mdash;are rich in contributions and should be brought forward and presented and shown to the people.  The television <Col N="813" /> service and the radio service should act as mirrors to the nation.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about the freedom of the waves as being a possible area of interest and activity for the Council of Ireland.  I lived in Donegal for a considerable period and poached and BBC and UTV television programmes. Both programmes are available in my constituency as well as RTE.  They are also available in Dublin.  I cannot say that spiritually it is dangerous to have those programmes available.  There is one point I should like to make.  There is a certain way of looking at things, a weakminded way if you like.  There are people who believe that just because a programme comes from outside the country, no matter how meretricious it is, it has some excellence which our own programmes have not got.  That type of view also deserves castigation. It deserves to be examined and criticised because it is an easy enough error to fall into.</P>
    <P>The Minister did a marvellous job on assessing the reasons for the selfrestraint of corporations&mdash;the BBC in particular-and television authorities in general in Britain.  There they have the working of unwritten conventions. There seems to be an unwritten convention which demands that where Britain's interests are concerned one must be scandalously biased in favour of the home product and the home country.  This kind of thing is quite common, not merely in sporting events, but in internal and world politics.  We do not have such a respect for convention in Ireland.  The whole question of control in RTE comes up for debate in that part of the Minister's speech.  It reminds me of the story about Lord Halifax who taxed Goebbels during the war with censoring newspapers and got the reply : &ldquo;If I had your newspapers I would not have to censor them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Apparently the Minister is committed to a form of control in RTE. He discusses what form of control there should be.  It is <i>la même chose so</i> far with section 31.  That section was there when the Minister came to power and is still in effect.  The Minister goes on to say that he will take out that section altogether and specify <Col N="814" /> in detail what the RTE Authority must do.  I am not sure that, if you specify a number of things which the authority must or must not do, you are giving greater freedom necessarily. We must wait and see what the specified &ldquo;dos&rdquo; and &ldquo;don'ts&rdquo; in the new regime are.  Personally I would prefer the Decalogue to the Book of Leviticus.  The Book of Leviticus seems to be what the Minister has in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in this House but in another place, the Minister spoke of setting up an appeals tribunal, apparently&mdash;and he can correct me if I am wrong&mdash;on the old legal principle that <i>nemo judex in sua causa.</i> He thinks it would be a bad principle to be a judge in one's own case.  There is another way of looking at it.  As a Minister he is charged with special responsibilities and this tribunal would seem to be a passing of the buck.  I may be wrong&mdash;I do not want to be unjust to the Minister&mdash;but, if this is so, I would deprecate it and appeal to the Minister to deal with the matter himself.  As one who lived, worked and studied in Britain a point I should like to make is that we should see to it that RTE radio programmes are easily available to people in Britain.</P>
      <P>I do not know what the up-to-date position is, but it used to be very difficult to get Radio Éireann programmes. The Minister talked about a very powerful transmitter and I trust the operation of this powerful transmitter will make the programmes easily available to Irish people resident in Britain or people in Britain interested in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to his appointment of a man to the Government Information Bureau.  I know he appointed a skilled man. a man trained in television, a man who knows television and knows the personnel engaged in television.  Speaking politically, I sense a slight illogicality in this as the Minister goes to great pains, and thinks out loud, as to why a television authority cannot have the same freedom as a newspaper.  The reason is, of course, that there are more newspapers <Col N="815" /> than one and a policy advocated by one may be counteracted by another and we are not, therefore, tied to one particular point of view.  If the Minister appoints a man-I am not blaming him now&mdash;to plead the Government's case, a man with such experience of television, and gives him a position of very high rank approximating to that of assistant secretory of a Department, there seems to be a certain lack of balance, a balance which is demanded from the television but not apparently demanded from a Department of State.  As I said, I am not criticising the man, or his appointment, but there seems to be a certain falling down from the point of view of the principle of balance.  This man's skill is at the disposal of the Government and of the parties constituting the Government.</P>
    <P>I should like now to put in a word for sub&mdash;postmasters, some of whom have made representations to me on various matters.  I understand they do not hold pensionable posts and I should like to know if they can stamp cards as self-employed persons while they are doing this work.  Some of these village sub-postmasters were appointed long ago and they probably had to deal with just one or two telephones in the area.  I wrote to the Minister about a sub-postmaster in one village; not so long ago there were three or four telephones in that village and today there are 60.  The pressure on the man is very severe.  The system can be operated only by using family help and using family help practically amounts to slave labour because what these people are paid for running the service is wholly inadequate.  The man to whom I refer is ill and requires hospital treatment and he wants someone to take over while he is in hospital.</P>
    <P>The Minister speculated about televising the proceedings of this House. He quite rightly said that people have the right to know.  Traditionally, the people who were in power were never very anxious to publicise the laws. In early society the laws were kept secret from the plebs.  When the laws were published and the ordinary man knew what his rights were, it was then <Col N="816" /> society began to develop in a more civilised and humane way.  I suppose the people have the same kind of rights now to look at what goes on here.  I am sure they might not be edified by some of what goes on and there is, too, the danger that there might be an encouragement to engage in exhibitionism or histrionics.  There is also the danger that someone calling the shots might catch someone who had been visited by Morpheus in the afternoon. perhaps once in the whole year, and if he was caught in such a shot his constituents might be inclined to deal very severely with him.  However, I have an open mind about televising the proceedings here.  People have the right to know and the proceedings are already covered by the Press, the radio and, to some extent, by television.  Televising all the proceedings would be a colossal yawn.  It would be very difficult to achieve a balance.  An arbiter could be appointed whose set purpose it would be to achieve a proper balance but <i>quis custodiet ipsos custodes</i>?  &mdash;who will watch him or who knows how biassed or unbiassed he might be?</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his Department. I wish him success in both radio and television.  These are the aspects which interest me most from the point of view of education.  I am particularly interested in their use along the lines I mentioned earlier, namely, for the better education of our rural youth. There, there is a tremendous building up of a spirit of confidence, something that could not have happened 20 years ago.  The youth are curious, enthusiastic, gregarious, anxious to organise, anxious to exhibit and to show what they have done. The absence of this in the past was, I think, due to flaws in our educational system. The present trend is a comparatively recent development and, as we are talking about media which are exhibitionistic, I think this present tendency should be encouraged.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his elevation to that post and to thank him for having made available to Deputies such a wealth of information in his statement and in his notes for <Col N="817" /> Deputies.  Towards the end of his statement he gave us his clear incisive thinking on many contentious issues and we look forward to Posts and Telegraphs developing into one of the key Departments during his Ministry.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that it costs a total of £55 million to run the Department and that the Minister has a staff of 22,000 people, making up 2 per cent of the national work force. It is pleasing for me, coming from Tipperary, to note that Tipperary has been ear-marked for a new post office.  The Minister showed his fresh thinking on the building of post offices when he instigated a competition for architectural students to design that new post office.  We look forward to it eagerly and we hope that it will be a gem and a gleaming example to be followed not only in Tipperary but wherever a new post office or public building is to be built.</P>
      <P>I should like to join with the Minister in paying a well-deserved tribute to his staff.  Down through the years they have given a great service to the people.  They have been courteous, kind and most efficient. I would urge the Minister to think deeply about giving all his staff full political rights.  In this day and age to deprive this very deserving section of our community of complete political rights is an injustice to them. I am sure that being a responsible body they would use that right as responsibly as any other association or group.  Knowing members of that staff I know quite well that all shades of political beliefs are contained in their members.</P>
      <P>It is pleasing to note, too, that we have, on average, one post office for every 1,300 inhabitants.  Next to Norway it is one of the best ratios in Europe.  A total of 454 million letters and 9.8 milion parcels passed through the hands of the staff in 1972. We have a postal service second to none.  We have a twice daily service in most areas.  It is prompt, efficient and most dependable.  I should like to join with the Minister in his tribute to all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="818" /> This year there are six special commemorative stamps to be issued. In the past we have overlooked this very valuable source of advertising.  In Ireland we have a wealth of scenic beauty and of things treasured by the people.  We could have used our stamps to far greater advantage. We could have used scenic views and advertised our beauty to the wide world. It is a cheap form of advertising.</P>
    <P>The telephone service is one area which I know is causing the Minister great distress and worry.  There has been an unprecedented demand for telephones.  Even though the mammoth number of 27,000 conections were made in 1972 there is still a huge backlog of 32,000 on the waiting list. I would urge the Minister to give this top priority because, as he said, a telephone is no longer a luxury but one of the most necessary forms of communication especially in towns aiming at industrial development.  There is nothing more frustrating than an inadequate telephone service.  We look forward to the introduction of this new Telephone Capital Bill in which we hope the Minister will deal with many outstanding problems.  I note with pleasure that Clonmel is to go over to automatic working but I would urge the Minister as an interim measure to increase the staff in all these exchanges.  This would in a small way alleviate the hardship of a bad service in certain areas.  It is pleasant to note that the wires are being put underground now in most housing estates.  I commend this practice and urge the Minister to see that cables are put underground in all future housing estates.</P>
    <P>The building next year of the new Telex extension costing in the region of £1 million will facilitate the many people who wish to be linked up. Telex is a very valuable and, with our entry into Europe, a most necessary service.  I hope that with the new exchange the people on the waiting list will be facilitated.</P>
    <P>Radio Éireann during the past 50 years, in my opinion, missed out on many opportunities.  I maintain that it has helped to divide and to keep our <Col N="819" /> two traditions apart instead of being a unifying force.  I would urge the Minister to give this his deep concern.  A national radio service should embrace all traditions.  This goes also for television. RTE should be a unifying force. We have two traditions in Ireland&mdash;the green and the orange.  I suggest that the Minister should pursue his contact with his English counterpart and even though, as he said, there are various difficulties to be ironed out I would ask him in the name of Ireland and for Ireland's welfare to tackle these problems and to solve them at the earliest opportunity.  I should like to see both on RTE and UTV a programme embracing the two traditions so that we could have broadcast throughout all Ireland the best of both traditions, so that people could see that we have much in common.  The Minister would be doing the greatest service to the nation if through the medium of television he could forge that link and find the missing key to all our problems.  It is unexplored ground and I wish him every success in his efforts in this regard.  I hope he will continue to meet those responsible in UTV, and BBC and, with a joint effort, bearing in mind the Irish dimension and the British dimension and goodwill on all sides, RTE and Radio Éireann will become a unifying force.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement that a new high power transmitter is to be installed at Athlone, particularly in view of the fact that many Irish people in England are unable to receive our radio programmes. This has been the cause of great concern down the years to these people. In America Irish emigrants complain that they are unable to keep in touch with the homeland through Radio Éireann&mdash;that is not from a narrow nationalistic point of view&mdash;but if our emigrants were able to receive Radio Éireann programmes in the United States it would be a very good form of advertising.  We should aim to have the voice of Ireland clearly heard throughout Europe and the United States and I hope that the installation of this new transmitter will fulfil a great need in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="820" /> I am in agreement with the Minister's views on the broadcasting of the proceedings of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I believe that this should be undertaken on a trial basis.  If this was done I feel sure it would be possible for the Whips of the parties to work out some agreement on what is to be broadcast.  In the initial stages there will be a certain amount of histrionics and publicity seeking but, like the printed word, people will become accustomed to the broadcasting of the Oireachtas proceedings and will view it in the same manner as they view the printed word.  The novelty will, at first, cause headaches but, with goodwill on all sides, this very important facility could be made available to the people.</P>
    <P>The broadcasting of the proceedings of the Houses of the Oireachtas will help to make the people more politically conscious and will keep them in touch with the daily happenings of the Dáil and the Seanad. Nothing but good could come out of this and I hope the Minister will pursue this with all his energy.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister, with Mr. Muiris Mac Conghail as his principal officer, has responsibility for the Government Information Bureau. The Government Information Bureau is an essential part of Government because it is important that the people are made fully aware of Government thinking and planning.  It is important that the people be kept informed about legislation and about Government thinking on all issues.  I look forward to well prepared and documented releases from the bureau in the future.  I have no doubt that, with the Minister's own personal experience and that of the head of the information service, the Government Information Bureau will become very much more involved, and influential, in Irish political life.</P>
    <P>It was a source of great pleasure to me to learn that Radio na Gaeltachta was being extended to the eastern part of the country by the erection of two transmitters.  Radio na Gaeltachta has achieved much in its first year in existence but, regrettably, many people in the country are not in a position, because of their <Col N="821" /> geographical situation, to receive its programmes.  With the grant of £108,000 Radio na Gaeltachta will now be in a position to extend its services to cover the entire country.  I urge those in charge of Radio na Gaeltachta to continue to produce well-documented programmes.  Just because a thing is Irish is not a reason why programmes should be inferior.</P>
    <P>There is a wealth of original material in the west of Ireland and the Gaeltacht areas and I believe that the people would welcome the transmission of this material over Radio na Gaeltachta.  Such programmes would be a welcome change from the canned material of foreign stations. I have no doubt that, with the Minister for the Gaeltacht working in close co-operation with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, this station will fulfil a great need in this country. I have always felt that such a station was a necessary arm to the restoration of the Irish language and, for this reason, it is a pity that we had to wait so long for the establishment of Radio na Gaeltachta.  I believe that, with the proper choice of programmes and the proper presentation, things Irish will be made more attractive and that the people will feel proud of their heritage.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment and I wish him every success in his many undertakings in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I have no doubt but that at the end of his term he will have left an imprint on the Department of Posts and Telegraphs which was so sadly lacking in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In so far as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are concerned they strike most of us as being only concerned with the postal service, telephones, television, radio and, more recently, the acquisition of the Government Information Bureau. It is on these matters that I should like to make a number of comments. As far as the postal service is concerned it is a sad commentary that it is less effective and less expeditious than it was 30 years ago.  During the emergency, in so far as my experience <Col N="822" /> goes, we had a more expeditious postal service operating between the capital city and Donegal than there is today.  It may well be that excuses will be advanced on the basis that the mails have been re-routed through Sligo but the distance, whether one travels direct through the Six Counties or through Sligo, is not all that great.  With improved roads and improved methods of transportation I cannot accept this as an excuse for a deteriorating service which is years behind its time.  It is almost unbelievable that one can truthfully say that the service was better in the early forties than it is in the early seventies.</P>
      <P>In addition, the cost of this service does not lag behind that of other services.  It continues to make its demand and is, with the most recent impositions, anything but a cheap method of communication or a cheap facility.  We pay the cost but we do not get the service.  That is my sad belief and conviction from my observation of this service over the years.</P>
      <P>The telephone service is a scandal and there is no point in trying to whitewash any particular aspect of it. Despite the various new techniques and all the other opportunities that we have had during the years to build up this service, it cannot be said to be in keeping with any ideas of progress for the future.  The service becomes worse day by day.  The Minister has a difficult job on his hands in any efforts he may make to provide us with a satisfactory telecommunicating service.  I do not know what are the reasons for the state of the service.  Down through the years, did we buy equipment that was obsolete or did we buy poor equipment that cannot be integrated properly?  Users of the service are driven to the point of distraction because of the situation.  I say that with all sincerity and without casting reflection on any person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the trunk dialling or automatic system, I have experienced considerable difficulty in endeavouring to use this service.  I have kept a note of the various attempts I made to make <Col N="823" /> trunk calls by way of the automatic service and on checking these notes I find that I have been lucky to get through in one out of every five efforts. It is not good enough and is certainly not on a par with the system in operation in Britain and on the Continent. More often than not it is necessary to resort to asking an operator to obtain the number required.  The personnel at the exchanges seem to be overburdened with work already and this is imposing on them further.</P>
    <P>The manually operated trunk service, too, is very unsatisfactory; indeed, one might say that it is not a service at all.  In the first place the length of time it takes to get an answer from the operator is considerable.  Without any acrimony on my part, I have on many occasions asked an operator for a reason for these delays.  I have been given various reasons, one being that the exchanges are understaffed.  If that is the position surely it is time that the staff was increased.  If, on the other hand, it is due to inefficiency, the staff should be supervised better but if the delays are due to a shortage of equipment, every effort should be made to rectify this situation.  Not only are we failing to provide a decent service for new subscribers but we are eroding continuously the service for existing subscribers.  I appreciate that the delays in connecting new subscribers may be due to there being a big backlog of applications but it is not good enough to worsen the existing service in an attempt merely to appear to be fair to those waiting for connections.</P>
    <P>In regard to the trunk service, at least if one is down the country and wishes to call the capital or elsewhere, he can avail of a service whereby an operator will call him back if the number required is not available.  This is a matter that I would like the Minister to consider seriously in order that this service might be extended to all exchanges.  This service was abandoned in this city about 18 months ago.  I do not know why this action should have been taken but I would advocate the reintroduction of the facility.  At least it would result in the alleviation of some of the frustration experienced by telephone users in this city.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="824" /> It is not unusual for a person to have to call the operator as many as seven times before being able to get the number required.  Of course, it is not the fault of anybody that a number may be unobtainable at any time but it would be very helpful if one could rely on the operator to call one back when the number became available. This would also eliminate the waste of time involved in having to continue dialling the exchange and, perhaps, having to wait a considerable time for a reply.  Then the caller must wait while the operator asks for the number from which the call is being made, <i>et cetera</i> and, perhaps, it is found, after all that, that the number is not available. There is no guarantee that, even beginning to dial at 9.30 in the morning and continuing to do so at intervals of 15 minutes until 5.30, one would get a call through.  A reversion to the old system is very desirable.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister and the very able staff of his Department will give these matters their attention.  A big mistake was made some years ago, that was in regard to allowing unlimited time for local calls at the minimum fee.  Instead of increasing the fees for local calls recently, it would have been worthwhile to have put a time limit on each local call and if users want to take a half-hour or three-quarters of an hour, let them pay for it by the minute.  The system is overloaded, if we are to believe what we are told.  There is a concrete case for the abolition of unlimited time for local calls.  There should be a reasonable time, whether on public or private phones, allowed for the initial charge and there should be an additional charge for, say, every additional three minutes.  There is no reason for unlimited local calls.  In many cases they create an unnecessary and useless burden on an already overloaded telephone system.  Rather than the proposed increase in the cost of local calls the Minister should seriously consider imposing a time limit such as was ill operation some years ago.  This would have two advantages : it would avoid the necessity to increase the cost of local calls and, secondly, and more important, it would reduce the load on the system and thus tend to improve the service generally.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="825" /> There are other operations with regard to the telephone system that are not so easily cured.  One very much in the news in recent years is bugging of telephones.  This is a matter which requires very serious consideration by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. I understand that, in the past, before a telephone could be tapped legally it was necessary for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister for Justice to consult and reach agreement. It is the case now, and has been for a considerable time, that the Minister for Justice may, by order, have any telephone of any subscriber within the country bugged.  It is rather peculiar that it is technicians of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, employees of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, who are obliged to make the technical adjustments to enable the snoopers to listen in on behalf of the Special Branch which in turn would be said to be on behalf of the State and in the interests of security.  I am surprised that these technicians take this obligation so lightly.</P>
    <P>We have been told time and again by various Ministers for Justice in the recent past that they did not sign any orders.  This makes the case perhaps even worse.  Because, if they were signing the orders and if it were only cases covered by such orders that could be bugged, it could be said that even with the single control of the Minister for Justice at least there was some control. I should like to put it to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that the system under his control has been used and has been abused and not on foot of warrants issued by his colleague, the Minister for Justice in either this or any previous Government.</P>
    <P>Bugging has been carried out on behalf of the State through the agency of the Special Branch and there were no warrants issued.  This is very serious. Whether you agree or disagree with the whole idea of bugging, there is a procedure laid down.  If bugging is to be contained we should revert to the procedure of having two Ministers brought into it rather than one.  Whatever system exists should not be abused, allegedly in the service of the State. This is something that I would particularly <Col N="826" /> draw to the Minister's attention. I realise that he has many other things to do but this is an important matter.  It is of vital consequence that this sort of thing should not go on, related to a system that he as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is charged with operating on behalf of the Government for the benefit of the community. He is in control and he should be in control and no other agency, no matter who they may be, particularly an agency that is not a ministerial agency, should have any right to come in and take action allegedly in the interests of the State and security.  This manner of serving the interests of the State and security does not coincide with my belief as to how they should be served.</P>
    <P>A classic case, the only case in the history of the Act, took place in my constituency and my home town and was referred to by a colleague from my constituency who used to be very silent.  He was on here last week.  He was involved in this in that he alleges his phone was tapped.  It was not tapped by the Special Branch.  It was not tapped by ministerial order of the Department of Justice or otherwise. Apparently it was tapped, if tapped it was by a member of the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. The Deputy who spoke here last week complained about it and raised the matter by way of question.  He may have raised it in this debate.  He got publicity in the national papers the day after he spoke and then there was a re-issue in the local papers a fortnight later and it may be in some other papers next week in case it has not been seen properly.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Minister that that Deputy and his colleague should have gone to court when there was a court case in Letterkenny, instead of pulling the strings from behind the scenes to manipulate not only the prosecuting counsel but also the defence counsel and ultimately cajoling the judge into pronouncing from the bench on matters that were not even before him.  These two gentlemen and particularly our colleague who complained as to why there was nobody else brought before that court should have gone into court and told the judge in the court what <Col N="827" /> their knowledge was and how they came by it.  Why does this man not take steps to do that even now, publicly, in some form that would be intelligible to all of us instead of sniping from in here and manipulating other people outside to blacken me?  That is exactly the operation that was on.</P>

What the hell benefit was I to get out of what they were saying to each other?</P>

      <P>Would the Deputy mind substantiating what he is hinting at or shut up-one of the two?  I have taken enough stick over this thing both from the court officers and now from the Deputy who is not satisfied. He did ask the Minister here Why certain people named in the statement of the defendant were not taken to court.  Who was he alleging was named in the statement?  I want to challenge him through this House as to how the hell that Deputy knew who the defendant named in that statement, if he was not conniving and colloguing with the prosecution before the case came on, because I do not know what was in it nor do I know whose names were used but Deputy Cunningham over there seems to know.  I want to know how does he know.  He had no part in the case.  Where did he get his information, and did he have a right to it?  As the Minister quite rightly asked the other day, if he has information why does he not disclose it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The upshot of this episode was that Deputy Cunningham and his colleague succeeded in getting the man thrown out of his job and now he is unemployed. If that is their best effort so far as their constituents are concerned they are welcome to it.  We may deplore <Col N="828" /> what may have been done but we do not knife people and put them out of their jobs.  In fact, the attitude of most Deputies has always been that although they may deplore the indiscretions of some of our public servants, 99 times out of 100 Deputies will try to save these people from their own folly and will try to save their jobs for them. But, these brave men here, in order to have a dig at some of their constituency colleagues, do not mind sacrificing anyone if it serves their purpose. If that is the manner of their operations they are welcome to it.  I do not want any more of this blackguardism and the using of the Department in the manipulations that took place by these gentlemen.  I do not think it can happen now and for that at least we must be thankful.</P>
    <P>Getting away from the Watergate element on the higher and lower levels, I should like to deal with the matter of the erection of overground telephone lines.  I am referring to both the heavy cable lines and the old single wire lines.  Many of the new heavy cables are erected with little regard to the scenic areas.  Much of this cabling is unsightly but the situation could be improved if more care were taken with the siting of the poles.  Frequently the cable lines cross and recross roads.  On scenic roads no regard is taken of the view; poles are erected and the ugly heavy cables are strung from pole to pole, thus obstructing the view.  It is not a major matter but it creates unsightliness in the countryside.  If we do not stop this practice now we will find, as have other countries, that it will be a major job to undo the damage at a later stage.  It is much better to proceed in a proper manner now than to attempt to undo the damage later on.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have mentioned the matter of public telephones.  Telephones are not available to those who need them most.  There is no scarcity of phones in built-up areas but in rural areas, where post offices are far apart and where there are few, if any, private phones there is a grave need for public telephones.  The more remote the area the greater is the need for a telephone, particularly at <Col N="829" /> night time when a doctor or a vet may be required urgently.  I am not asking for a phone near every isolated house but phones should be available in an area where there is no post office within a few miles.  At the moment there is a lack of phones in such places and it does not appear that there will be any improvement in the situation.  I am not sure of the attitude of the Minister but in the term of office of previous Ministers there was far too much measuring of economics, of the likely usage of the phone as against the cost of erection of the kiosk.  There was little notice taken of the benefit this would give to people in isolated areas, even though we are trying to encourage people to stay in rural areas.</P>
    <P>We should have a dual standard in the provision of public telephones.  In rural areas we should not measure it from the point of view of economics, as might be done in an urban area. There is no comparison between the rural and the urban area.  A telephone is provided in a town or city as an amenity and people generally have not far to go to reach the nearest telephone.  In addition, people in urban areas are in the centre of communications-they have taxis, cars and buses.  I am talking about areas where there are no cars, taxis or buses, where there is no lighting at night time and no telephone communication and where the usage of the phone would not compensate for the cost of installation.</P>
    <P>We have approached these matters from the wrong point of view.  We have been treating all areas in the same way, on economic grounds only. If we were to be logical about this, if we were to consider matters only from the economic point of view, we should have stopped delivering letters to outlying areas long ago.  We should have suggested that people should come to certain towns in each county to collect their mail.  If that is the kind of service we think the people are entitled to, we should be logical about it and save a lot of money by adopting this method with regard to our postal service.  Far from advocating that I am advocating the reverse. <Col N="830" /> We should improve the service and, with regard to the telephone service, a special study should be made regarding the services in provincial areas.  We should ensure that rural areas get an efficient service and it should be consistent throughout the country.  It would not break us to do this and it might help to keep people in rural areas.  We should do more to stop the drift to the cities and should try to make life more attractive in the country. People in remote areas should be given the means of communication so that they will not be cut off from the rest of the country, particularly in the event of an emergency.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear that there will be a more powerful broadcasting system for our radio service.  I hope I am right in taking that up.  I am curious to know where is the sacred cow that was worshipped in the Department down through the generations and supported by several Ministers, the sacred cow of international conventions, that prohibited us from having a power output sufficient to be heard beyond our own shores.  In many cases because of this low output we are not heard within the four shores of our own country.  Is the sacred cow dead, sold or abandoned? I am not very much concerned but I am delighted it has gone.  The Minister may well be considering whether this higher output will be sufficient to make our programmes go much further, deep into our sister island and whether it is capable of being boosted sufficiently to enable us to reach our new Continental partners and, if not, whether from a technical viewpoint the much lauded benefits of the short wave transmission may yet be introduced.  I do not know if this will be necessary if we are to get the wide coverage that I believe we should have.  Many years ago during my short term as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs I was well on the way to dethroning the sacred cow. It was not easy then any more, I am sure, than now.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware, as are the Radio Éireann officials, of the number of black spots we still have. I have no doubt they will quickly <Col N="831" /> disappear if we have the higher output he has spoken of which will give us coverage far outside the country.  That increased output will immensely improve reception and may even wipe out most, if not all, of the black spots as regards sound coverage at present in this country.</P>
    <P>Television reception is not great in certain parts of the country.  This applies particularly in part of my own county and constituency.  It also applies as far south as Kerry where there are bad reception areas.  I do not know from the technical side whether a great deal can be done about some totally black areas, whether the disposition of our boosters and masts is such that unless they are changed or added to it may not be possible to get picture transmission into these black areas.  As far as I know, extra power is not of much importance; it is really the location of the boosters in relation to the particular areas that matters.  If anything can be done in this regard by additional boosters it should be done. If we talk of bringing in other broadcasts from outside we should first perfect the reception of our own programmes. Why give three, four or five stations to some people when other people have none or only a very inadequate one, our own, due to technical reasons?  I say that we should first remedy that position and ensure good reception of our own programmes. Then other programmes might well be considered but I would make it my priority to have RTE capable of being received in all homes in the country before talking of giving multi-station reception, perhaps, at very great cost.</P>
    <P>Speaking only of my own constituency, because it is only of that area that I have particular knowledge, while there may be problems regarding siting of masts and boosters that cannot readily be overcome and affect reception, there are other faults in the operation of the system on the technical side which can be overcome.  Far too often booster stations in my area go out of order and as things have been arranged over the years the maintenance man has headquarters at Sligo.  Without intending any reflection on Dublin, <Col N="832" /> there is a peculiar blindness about anything emanating from it.  People seem to think if something is made available in Sligo it is convenient to Donegal.  That is true in the sense that a 20 mile journey will take you to Bundoran but how many appreciate that it is 151 miles by road from Sligo to Malin Head while it is only 132 miles from Sligo to Dublin.</P>
    <P>If the powers that be-not only in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs-in Dublin would grasp this fact the idea of trying to service Donegal even though South Donegal is on Sligo's doorstep is like trying to service Sligo from Dublin.  It is quicker by far to get from Dublin to Sligo than from Sligo to North Donegal.  That is the sort of situation we have and we are not getting repair jobs done as quickly as would be possible if the maintenance men were based in the centre of the county.  This would reduce the mileage they must cover and would make service available much quicker after a breakdown than has been possible in the past.  This mistake should be rectified.  Perhaps it could be done by merely changing the service centre from Sligo to Donegal for Donegal.  There must of course be a service centre in Sligo also.  These detailed matters may not be sufficiently important for discussion here but very often if they are not mentioned here they are not taken into account when improvements are being brought about.</P>
    <P>Weather reports are a joke where I come from.  If we had the best of the joke I would not mind but we usually have the worst of it.  We do not seem to come into the weather chart at all : these reports, as we get them in the ordinary way, are not by and large reliable for North-West Donegal.  I seldom watch TV or hear radio but last Sunday being in Donegal I was intrigued to find that some part of the topical discussion that comes on after the 1 o'clock or 1.30 news was to be devoted to discussing whether the heat wave would last&mdash;I think those were the terms used.  I had listened up in Donegal to whatever they said about the weather and there was no mention that in Donegal it was any different from what it was in Montrose&mdash;and <Col N="833" /> apparently it was.  There was a fair wind blowing with squally rain and we had had this for three days at that stage and then we heard these boys discussing in radio time, which costs a lot of money, whether the heat wave would last.</P>
    <P>It has not lasted even up here because by the time I got back it was gone and the weather we had in Donegal three days before had arrived here.  That was not funny nor is it funny because we normally do not come out on the right side of this sort of thing.  We do not, for some reason, have as accurate forecasts of our weather conditions in north-west Donegal as I know the same prophets are able to give for people on the east and south coasts.  I have had experience of their accuracy there but I also have had experience of their inaccuracy in the north-west.  Is there anything that can be done in this regard because these reports are important to coastal counties and to people who farm and fish?  If we could get as accurate information up there it would help us to dodge the showers we all too frequently get but we do not get that assistance and so we get wetter than the people on the east coast.</P>
    <P>Another matter which was given a fair amount of airing, with certain inneundoes with which I do not agree, is the appointment to this new information service of Mr. Muiris MacConghail.  I do not agree with any of the aspersions cast on his appointment. From my knowledge of him over the years in his professional capacity, I think it is quite a suitable appointment and that the choice is good.  I hope he proves it is good and I can only wish that he will carry his new appointment as well as he carried his previous appointments and I wish him well in the job.  I do not go along with the suggestion that there is something wrong with his appointment or, as seems to be the very unfair innuendo, that it was a pay-off for services in the past.  I have known him for years and if there is a pay-off, I do not know who should be paid.  However, I do not think that is the manner of his appointment and I would dissociate myself publicly and refute <Col N="834" /> entirely and totally, any such suggestion or innuendo.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that most of what I have had to say has been in the nature of a crib but this is a service Department and as such is the recipient of more frequent cribs than praise, but taking the Department overall, if I have been specifically critical of various aspects of its working, that is in no way to take from my admiration of the staff of the Department, both indoor and outdoor, and of the very great work they do.  There seems to be a development in recent years when any service is set up, particularly by the State, to serve the community that those who provide the service are very often lost sight of.  If one wishes to criticise the service on the basis of deterioration or not improving fast enough, it is very often taken that one is being critical of those who provide the service, that if you want better service, longer service or later service, you are condemning those who give it to unduly long hours or bad conditions.  This is not what is intended but if the service is to be improved, it should not be at the expense of the operators of the service and, conversely, if the conditions of the operators are to be improved, it should not be at the expense of the public by reducing the service.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that there has been a balancing of one against the other time out of number over the years in various respects.  This is wrong and is partly responsible for the innumerable criticisms and complaints which people genuinely have in regard to the service.  We tend to try to balance one against the other, whereas the fundamental is that we set up a service for our people which it should be our whole ambition to improve and perfect so that it will be the best we can sustain and afford.  We should not, when under pressure to improve these services or to eradicate faults in them, whether it be postal, telegraphic, television or radio services, fall back on what I believe what has been fallen back on all too frequently, the argument that if we were to give this improvement, it would disimprove the condition of the people employed in giving the service.  We can and should <Col N="835" /> do both, improve the service while not in any way reducing the conditions of employment of those giving it.  If we keep that in mind we can do both with an effort rather than treading a little in either side and giving a poor service and not very good conditions of work to those operating it.</P>
    <P>This is a service which is under the public gaze and because of that, these people are more criticised and more mistakes or omissions are found than in other Departments.  This Department has the difficulty of being in the spotlight all the time and criticisms naturally tend to come, but the Minister should not seek to get over these at the expense of the operators or use their conditions to support the argument that if the service is improved their conditions will be worsened.  The services which the Minister administers are vital and are becoming more and more important every day.  In many respects they are not up to what they should be.  We have not been making the progress in perfecting these services that we should have been making and there is a lot to be done here.  It can be done and I hope the Minister will make a bold effort in many of these regards to improve, extend and perfect, without loss to those who operate the services which are so vital and so much criticised but which we cannot do without.</P>

Labour and Fine Gael combined.  The Chair seeks to be fair in this matter and has called Deputy Dockrell.</P>

      <P>Like other speakers, I would wish to start off by congratulating the Minister on the very erudite and favourable statement which he made.  Before I go into a few of the matters which concern this vast and very important Department, I should like to take up a few points which were made by the previous speaker Deputy Blaney.  He talked about the bad conditions of the postal and telephone services.  As far as I understand it, the difficulties which the Department labour under are very largely caused by a lack of capital expenditure in the past years.  In those years Deputy Blaney was a very powerful Member of the Fianna Fáil Party then in Government.  In all seriousness, and not in any narrow sense, I would say it is a great pity that, during that time, he did not use his undoubtedly strong powers of persuasion to get the Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am getting a great deal of rest in this speech thanks to Deputy Crinion's efforts to uphold the strictest rules of the House.  It leaves one with the view that his unwanted measure of interest in a quorum arises from pique because he was not called on to speak, and annoyance at what Deputy Blaney said about <Col N="837" /> some bugging which went on in his district.  I do not wish to talk about that aspect of interference with telephones. I know nothing of what went on in Donegal and, to tell the truth, I care less.  The old adage&mdash;I am not quite sure where it comes from; it may come from what is often referred to as the Good Book&mdash;came to my mind when I heard Deputy Blaney and Deputy Crinion squabbling across the floor of the House: when rogues fall out, honest men come into their own.  I do not know what happened on the telephone in Donegal but apparently somebody got an earful.</P>
      <P>Bugging means listening in to telephones. None of us likes that.  We live in a democratic country.  As a democratic party we do not like it when that happens.  Still less do we like it happening when our Ministers are in power. I should like to say to Deputy Blaney that it is in the interest of the State and society to protect themselves against people who would, in many cases, tear down the State and, in that sense, listening in or tapping has to go on.  It is regrettable that democratic countries should have to protect themselves against subversive elements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have now had a third breath.  I was discussing listening in on telephone calls.  None of us likes it but it is absolutely necessary and the State must protect the people in it by every means in its power.  Before this series of counts I was dealing with the difficulties in which the Department and the Minister find themselves.  He has not referred specifically to the point I am about to make; he is a man who is above making petty points.  The point, however, can be made by me.  The weaknesses and the inconsistencies with which the Minister finds himself faced have come about because the Department was starved of sufficient money by the previous Government and could not, therefore, function efficiently.  I know of one case in Dundrum, County Dublin, where a business opened but <Col N="838" /> not one telephone could be provided, not because of any lack of keenness on the part of the Department but simply because there were not sufficient cables to carry any more telephones.  As I say, that section of the Department in particular was starved of capital by the previous Government.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blaney referred to the sacred cow of convention and he said some of our stations were not powerful enough to be heard by Irish people across the water and, in fact, in certain parts of Ireland they were not powerful enough either.  He said one of the reasons given by the officials of the Department was that the wavelengths were set and were in compliance with international conventions. His approach is, of course, very typical of certain people we have in this country.</P>
      <P>We should all live by the letter of the law.  Unfortunately, we do not always do so.  If we break international conventions and have very, very powerful transmitters there will naturally be retaliation and no one will be able to get any station.  These conventions are drawn up internationally and they are designed to be fair to countries all over the world.  I am old enough, as are many others in this Dáil, to remember very clearly the 1930s when those horrible men, Hitler and Mussolini, were shouting and roaring over the radio.  Whenever one tuned into the medium wavelength one was bound to hear one or the other roaring his horrible propaganda all over Europe.  They would not keep any international conventions. What it must have been like for people in France, Southern England, the Dutch, the Danes and others on the borders of these countries I shudder to imagine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very wrong to advocate our breaking international conventions for selfish reasons.  We have been allotted certain wavelengths.  If we want to change them we can make representations but we should never regard an international convention as a sacred cow to be slaughtered for the gratification of our own selfish interests.  These conventions are born out of a sort of league of nations and we should uphold them with all the strength we have.  We have done so down through <Col N="839" /> the years and I know the present Minister would be the last in the world to break these conventions for purely selfish reasons.  It is strange that that dislike of law and order runs through certain people in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister, as I said, made a very enlightened statement.  He asked a number of questions and he asked for a considered opinion on certain aspects of the work of his Department.  One of the things upon which he sought advice was piped television and multi-channel television.  I think nothing but good could come from this.  We are the most westerly island off Europe and part of the tragedy of our past lay in the fact that we got out of touch with Europe. This was partly due to historical reasons.  I believe piped television and multi-channel television could only be for good because it would bring our people back again closer to Europe.</P>
    <P>There are not, of course, enough telephones to go around.  I have seen push-button instruments.  Instead of dialling the numbers with a circular motion the newest telephone can be operated by just pressing buttons numbered from 0 to 9.  This would mean a great saving of time.  Anyone who has to sit at a telephone and work it for any period finds that it is very painful on the figures.  The sharp edges tear them.  The pushbutton instrument would be a great boon and I am sure many people would pay extra for it.</P>
    <P>The question of televising and/or broadcasting the proceedings of Dáil Éireann has been mentioned.  I am not sure that I am altogether in favour of it.  In fact, I have been much against it because of my experience on the corporation over many years.  The real work of Dublin Corporation was done in the committees. Many of the members turned the monthly council meeting into an occasion for speaking more to the public than to the actual matter under discussion and there was an unreal atmosphere, a very political atmosphere, sometimes at the monthly meetings which there was not at all at the private meetings where the real work was done.  I would not be in favour really of broadcasting the proceedings <Col N="840" /> of this House.  I think it would lead to many speeches being made for the medium rather than for the good of the Department concerned and so on.</P>
    <P>The RTE Orchestra is a very fine one.  It has increased from year to year and I hope that it will continue to go from strength to strength and that the Minister will use his influence to see that that orchestra can be properly housed in a concert hall worthy of an orchestra as good as that and worthy of visiting orchestras and visiting artistes.  The RTE Orchestra has no real abiding home where the citizens of Dublin can hear it in comfort and in the numbers who would go.  I trust that the Minister will use his undoubted influence to get a concert hall built.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the Minister for his new approach in this very powerful and enormously important Department. It is one of the most important Departments we have, in some ways it is the most important Department because it affects so much of our lives.  I wish the Minister every success. In spite of what I have said about the lagging behind there has been on capital expenditure for the Post Office, the engineers and so on who have to deal with these inadequate conditions are to be congratulated for the work they do.  I hope the telephone service can be improved and that we will get one which is worthy of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the first money any of us ever saved was in the Post Office.  It is good to see that the amount of money in the Post Office savings bank has been increasing considerably.  There is up to £146 milion there at present in addition to saving certificates, investment bonds and the instalment saving scheme.  Since the instalment saving scheme was introduced two years ago it has been very successful although I thought it would have been even more successful.  In 1971 the amount lodged was £4.9 million and in 1972 there was a slight falling off; it was £4.7 million.  I thought that scheme would be very attractive to people paying tax.  In most large industries there is a savings scheme in operation, <Col N="841" /> sometimes for a Christmas fund.  I thought this scheme would be very attractive to workers, considering that those savings would not be liable for tax.  Perhaps the Minister could advertise it a little more because there is a tremendous potential in that scheme.  People have become used to budget accounts.  They pay such things as rates, motor taxation, <i>et cetera,</i> in instalments.</P>
      <P>Somebody praised the postal service. In the Kinnegad area the postal service is extremely bad.  The post from Dublin, and parts of County Meath, arrives in Kinnegad at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.  I raised this matter on a number of occasions but there has not been any improvement. It was mentioned in reply to questions I raised on this matter that 90 per cent of letters posted before 5 o'clock reach their destination before 9 o'clock the following morning.  This is not the case in County Meath.</P>
      <P>The post leaves Navan at approximately 4 o'clock in the afternoon, and in order to have letters delivered by that post a person must have them in the Navan post office at 3.30.  The next post leaves at 11 p.m. Most of the offices in the town and surrounding districts post their letters after the 4 o'clock post has been collected with the result that this mail does not reach Dublin until after midnight.  By the time it is sorted it is late for the early train to Mullingar and this means that it does not arrive in Kinnegad the morning after it is posted.</P>
      <P>We had the abnormal situation in County Meath where county council cheques sent to members of the staff living in Dunshaughlin did not reach their destination until two days after they were posted.  Since then Meath County Council has decided to send out the cheques for this area one day earlier so that the staff will receive them on the appointed day.  This is an indication of how poor the postal service is in this area. Dunshaughlin is but ten miles from Navan and 17 miles from Dublin.  It is also on the main road from Dublin to Navan but yet it takes two days for a letter from Navan to reach Dunshaughlin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="842" /> The afternoon post in Kinnegad is much greater than the morning post.  I had occasion to forward my post for a week to the Department as I received it and, in typical civil service fashion, the officials said they could not find that all of the letters had been delayed, They did discover that four of the letters should have reached me sooner and they apologised for the delay in this regard.  There is no way of guaranteeing or checking how long it takes a letter to be delivered except through the registered post.</P>
    <P>Some other arrangement should be made to ensure that at least 75 per cent of the post in County Meath for areas in that county reaches its destination the day after it is posted.  A collection should be made after office hours in Navan.</P>
    <P>I hope that the erection of the new post office in Mullingar will lead to an improvement in the situation.  I suspect that because my area is on the western run the early train from Dublin is used to convey the post there.  The result is that the people in my area suffer.  I have discussed this matter with staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and they suggested that there should be a direct mail bag from South Meath to Mullingar.  The staff felt that this would solve the problem. The sorting would be completed in Navan and go direct to Mullingar without any sorting in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I understand that this arrangement is in operation between Dundalk and Navan.  A suggestion I made to the Department in this regard was turned down and I should like the Minister to review the situation.  If the Kinnegad delivery was included in the Navan area it would improve the situation.  It should be remembered that the Navan area extends to Kildalkey in South Meath.  If the Navan Post Office covered all of South Meath there would be a speedier service all around.  Such a poor postal service is a big disadvantage to the business people of the area and it is frustrating for them that the letters they reply to in the afternoon do not reach their destination for two days.</P>

      <P>That is a matter for the ESB.  Therefore, that is the body with whom the Deputy should take up the problem or, perhaps, he would raise it with the Minister for Transport and Power who might have more power in this regard.  Section 31 gave the Government some say in television broadcasting.  It gave the Government the power to call a halt in certain circumstances. Therefore, the Minister may live to regret the repealing of this section.  One can only make representations to a watchdog committee and any action they would take would involve a slow process.</P>

      <P>Since the enacting of this legislation not much more than ten years ago, section 31 has been invoked only on a very few occasions so it can hardly be said that it has been harmful.  My opinion is that we should retain the section.  We have known of cases of television services getting out of hand in other countries.</P>
      <P>From the odd time I watch television I get the impression that producers on discussion programmes are inclined to have people on their panels who are way-out, who are that bit different and who will put forward various ideas as if what they were saying was authentic.  There have been occasions on which wrong impressions were created by having the views of some of these people aired on television.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say that it is the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;.  I am sure that when the Deputy returns from attending his clinics on Saturday evenings he likes to watch that programme, too.  Occasionally, it is worth viewing but very often it is presented in a manner that is not balanced.  This point was emphasised recently when an ex-priest appeared on the programme and told us that he had been a friend of the late Pope John.  This ex-priest put forward a number of theories which engaged the consciences of a number of people.  I understand that from many altars, priests found it necessary the following day to give the other side of the picture and told their congregations that that man had left the Church because he wished to marry, a fact that had not emerged during the programme. Researchers are available to producers and these should do some research into the background of people who may appear on programmes <Col N="846" /> in cases where there may be any doubt about such persons.</P>
      <P>A similar situation to the one I have mentioned arose when, on an &ldquo;Encounter&rdquo; programme some months ago a priest who was in charge of a college in Rome gave the impression that a marriage annulment was very simple to obtain.  However, that programme caused uproar to the extent that it was found necessary to bring that priest back again and have him participate in two further programmes.</P>

When that priest appeared on the subsequent programmes he had to face a Monsignor who deals with annulments in the Dublin diocese. The way-out theories that we had heard originally were not repeated then because that priest knew that he had to put forward facts.</P>

In the case of political programmes the debates here will ensure that programmes are well and truly balanced.  Other programmes should also be balanced, particularly religious programmes.  We have a very proud tradition of faith.  If anything, we are conservative.  I do not think that Telefís Éireann should lead to divisions in the country or produce programmes that may induce qualms of conscience in people about certain matters.  Following the &ldquo;Encounter&rdquo; programme to which I have referred there was a large number of applications for annulment.  That was brought out in a subsequent programme.</P>

As he well knows, before <Col N="848" /> he took office as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs he appeared frequently on television and radio.  I have said enough with regard to balance.  I hope Telefís Éireann will heed what I have said.</P>
      <P>Kilkenny is on channel nine.  UTV is also on that channel.  In a certain section of County Meath Telefís Éireann eliminates UTV.  UTV at a certain time in the afternoon shows sport programmes.  People in hospital and shift workers at home in the afternoons like to have something to watch. The moment the Telefís Éireann test card appears on the screen UTV is drowned out.  This occurs throughout a 20 mile radius.  People who want to overcome this difficulty can erect expensive aerials at a cost of about £100.  But not everybody can do so.</P>

      <P>He is not but he is responsible for the Kilkenny station and the wavelength that it is on.  A change to another band, possibly band six or five would eliminate the trouble.</P>
      <P>It would appear that the telephone system is overloaded.  One often encounters difficulty in getting a dialling tone.  Even in Leinster House if one is using the phone for any length of time the line goes dead and one has to try another telephone.  It may be at a time when everyone here is trying to get in touch with a Department.  With regard to outside phones, unless one makes a telephone call early in the morning or late at night it is very difficult to get. through.  We can consider ourselves lucky we are on the automatic service and do not have to ring the post office.</P>
      <P>I have found that when one rings the Mullingar post office there is a considerable delay in the reply.  I have often thought of using a tape recorder in order to demonstrate to the Department the delay in getting through to the post office.  When there is a breakdown in the service many people will call the post office and, of course, there will be delays.  On the whole there is much more delay when one has to contact the post office to obtain a call.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear frequently that new equipment is being delivered to post offices <Col N="849" /> in order to provide additional phones. it appears that a considerable amount of testing of the new equipment is necessary, although I should have thought a week or two would be sufficient, We are told new equipment is being installed at the post offices in Navan, Trim, Kells and Dunboyne although I understand that Navan is the only area in which they are taking new subscribers.  New equipment has been installed in Trim but they are a year behind in the installation of phones.  For the past year we have been told about the equipment for Kells but there is no improvement in the service.  The Dunboyne line has always given trouble and I am sure the Minister's colleague will tell him about it.  Some months ago we were told that new equipment would be installed in Dunboyne this month but there has been no improvement in the situation and I do not think any phones have been installed.</P>
    <P>Before telephones are installed, the terms are quoted and the people concerned pay the amounts due.  It is strange that normally it is three months before the phones are installed.  I presume the Department buy their supplies in bulk and that they do not have to order for individual installations. When a person pays the amount requested by the Department there should not be a long delay in the installation of the telephone.  I hope the Department will try to ensure that once the money is paid the phone will be installed within one month.</P>
    <P>At one time when the Department were working in an area they included all applicants but that does not seem to happen now.  In the Tara area, through Screen and Rathfeigh, the Department gave phones to half of the people and, as a result, the remainder were resentful that they did not have their phones installed.  I queried the matter and I was told the successful applicants had applied in 1971 and the others in mid-1972.  It would be more economical to complete an entire area and I think the Department should consider this aspect.</P>
    <P>It is frustrating for people to be told they cannot have telephones because the Department are keeping two or three lines for priority cases.  Very often <Col N="850" /> in the matter of telephones the disappointed applicants consider themselves as important as a doctor, vet or priest.  They are well aware that usually a new doctor or vet will be a replacement for the person already there and thus, will have the use of the telephone used by that person.  Consequently, the argument of the Department about holding a certain number of phones for priority cases does not hold water.  The priority case the Department usually does not quote is the ladies' hairdresser. Perhaps it is as well they do not state this to other applicants because it would really be adding insult to injury. The Department should consider how many priority cases arise in an area in a few years and should consider if they are replacements.  By doing this they would be able to gauge their requirements : I think they usually estimate the number at three to five in an area. Even if the Department add one extra to the anticipated number it would not make much difference but a study of this matter would help considerably.</P>
    <P>In the last week I have written to the Department regarding a Land Commission road known as the Rath road at Kilcock.  They are getting their telephones from Summerhill.  There are about ten houses on the road which is about one mile long and practically every house is getting a telephone.  To their amazement they find there is a difference in the bills in almost every case.  These vary between 95p and £3. It seems strange that on one road where quite a large number of phones are being installed there should be such variation.</P>
    <P>In a situation like that there is a case to be made that if the number is more than five or more than ten they should not be asked to pay the full advance rental. They are being asked to pay three years' rental in advance.  In such cases, particularly in a country area they should not be treated as if it was just one installation.  This is a classic case, a Land Commission road which was extended through the Commission's good work to join with another road giving a straight-through run.  One can picture the type of road with farmhouses at each side.  None of them had <Col N="851" /> a telephone before this.  They all applied last year and were quoted for the installations last week.  Being neighbours they have compared their bills and the only item that is exactly the same is the £25.</P>
    <P>In cases like this a concession could be made whereby, perhaps, only one year's rental would be charged.  If only one farmer was getting it he would have to pay the three years and another getting it the following year would have to pay a similar amount. That would be much more expensive and would absorb much more of the Department's time.  To take a leaf out of the ESB's book, the Department could consider such a concession.  In the case of the ESB, if your neighbour takes a supply the special service charge is less.  This encourages others and would be a good sales gimmick to get all the neighbours to accept a telephone.  This would save them having to walk to the next house for a hayfork or some other piece of equipment; they could ring up.  This would encourage group installations.  I suppose the Department never thought on those lines because there was always a big waiting list and if anything the Department wanted to hold them back until they could catch up with the work.</P>
    <P>The scheme to provide a kiosk outside every post office is welcome.  It is being spread over a five-year period; otherwise the capital requirements would be fairly heavy.  The scheme is welcome because it provides a service when the post office closes about 5.30 in the afternoon.  That meant hitherto that there was no telephone in the area until the post office opened next morning. People will welcome the all-night service as a social and community benefit.  The Department might also consider the case of other areas where there is a fair population for the provision of kiosks.  At present I understand the scheme is confined to post offices.  Before this programme if the Department felt or knew sufficient telephone calls would be made in an area a kiosk would be put there.  I think the return required was £100 in a year if a kiosk were to be provided in the area.  I know that kiosks have been <Col N="852" /> provided out in the heart of the country, at Rathcoe, Gibbstown and Balrath. These are welcome but there are other areas that should also be considered such as Kilmainhan on the Kells-Navan road.  There had been a shop there with a coinbox telephone but that no longer exists.  There is a large population there and this and similar areas where considerable use would be made of the service should be considered.</P>
    <P>I gather that every new issue of stamps is a money making project. People want first prints and there is good sale for such stamps abroad as well as here.  Perhaps more could be done in this way to advertise our country.  I remember a strong case was put up some time ago for Arkle as one of our outstanding horses to be shown on a stamp issue.  These issues could also include scenic views although I grant that it is hard to do justice to them on a smallish stamp.  However, other countries have done this or have shown other notable products of theirs. At least one stamp per year could be used for this purpose.  There is one stamp included in the six scheduled for issue this year which could be included in that category.  Items such as the World Ploughing Championship in County Wexford should be highlighted as well as other achievements or big events in this country.  With five or six new stamps being produced each year at least a few of them could be devoted to some internationally important happening in Ireland or some Irish achievement.  Even one devoted to a scenic view would help our tourist industry.  It is a cheap advertisement as the stamps go all over the world. The Minister knows how many are sold each year and how many go abroad.  It could not but help the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the possibility of extending evening broadcasting hours.  Earlier, I mentioned that some people would be looking at UTV at that time.  That would be in my own constituency but in the remainder of the country there are sports fixtures and you could use films and use our outside broadcasting facilities.  Quite often there are race meetings.  There could be films for children.</P>

      <P>Regarding programmes in the afternoon, a programme to which an hour might be devoted, if it were extended, is a programme of concerts by children.  In our part of the country, these are called talent competitions, in which areas compete one against the other. If one goes around the schools, one will find plenty of talent and if they knew well in advance, months in advance, they could produce good shows of half an hour to three-quarters of an hour with these children.  People who are old or sick would enjoy watching the young people in such programmes which would have the effect of showing the different areas and making each area known.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to many of the speeches and I intend merely to cover a few points which have not so far been covered. This Department is one of the Departments which have intimate connections with all the people.  The Post Office staff I have been in contact with have been courteous and efficient and though much of their equipment may be obsolete, they still have given great service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has inherited a Department that had the handicap in the past of lack of funds.  The position at the moment in my constituency is that hundreds of people have been writing for telephones for the past three or four years and a backlog of applications has built up that the Minister and his staff will find it very difficult to clear.  I have great sympathy with him in this part of his duty, to give telephones to the people.  Telephones now are not so much a luxury as a necessity and many of our people especially in the rural areas find the telephone an absolute necessity.  They need it for their everyday business and for emergencies and they are lost without it.  I have great sympathy with these people who have been waiting for years for a telephone and one of the <Col N="854" /> first things the Minister should do is to get as many of these telephones installed as he possibly can.  I know that he cannot wave a magic wand and provide them in a short time, but knowing his energy and ability I know that he will make more progress than has been made in the past.  One of the worst legacies left by the previous Government was their complete neglect of this Department.</P>
    <P>I have been up here on deputations and I saw the previous Minister.  We all know his bland smile and the courteous reception one gets, with the result that many of the people who came up with me&mdash;I did not leave in this frame of mind because I was aware that the smile was not too deep&mdash;were charmed and went home expecting that the telephone or whatever service they sought would be there before them, but as the weeks and months went by they found themselves in the same position as they were in when they visited him.  I know that the Minister, if he finds he cannot give them what they require, will have the courage to tell them the truth, that he will provide it as soon as he possibly can.</P>
    <P>Television reception is very bad on the coast.  People have paid for their licences and for their sets and they get a picture which is hardly recognisable. They have gone to that expense and they cannot even get the news.  Something must be done about this.  I discussed it with Deputy Collins on various occasions and he promised that a transposer would be made available. It did not arrive.  I would ask the Minister to have a look at this problem, which is a serious problem for a larger number of people.  People in the rural areas are anxious to have television.  Many of them parted with their money hoping to avail of the recreation and education provided on television.  I am not grumbling so much about the quality of some of the programmes.  Some of them are not anything extra.</P>
    <P>There is a regulation that members of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs should not take part in politics, but that is a joke.  In my own constituency I know a few postmen who <Col N="855" /> were always at the head of Fianna Fáil processions.  One man used hold an umbrella over Deputy Lynch's head when he was Taoiseach.  On a wet evening he was sure he would be well covered by this official from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. If some of them are allowed to express their views, and to parade them openly, every member of the staff should get the same concession.  We should get rid of that regulation.</P>
    <P>I believe that Members of this House and the people would be prepared to pay more money if they got results.  I appeal to the Minister to come into the House and look for increased funds for his Department. This Department has an effect on every family in the conutry.  From what I know of them, the local sub-postmasters and their staffs are courteous to the people.  They are the hub of the social life in the community. I am glad to see that the amount of money invested in the Post Office Savings Bank is increasing regularly.</P>
    <P>An effort should be made to deal with telephone applications which have been in the Department for so long.  Something should be done immediately about the bad television reception on the southern coastline.  I appeal to the Minister to provide us with transposers or with extra power from the station.  I hope he will have a happy time in the Department.  I know that with his energy, his ability and his courage, he will improve the service immensely.  I wish him every luck.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few aspects of the work of this Department which I want to talk about.  The first is the recent increases in postal and telephone charges which were announced by the Minister for Finance in the budget.  They were not announced in any detail.  We were told at that time&mdash;a month or five weeks ago &mdash;that details of these increases would be given shortly.  So far as I am aware, no details have been given to date other than those mentioned in the budget.  For that reason I must confine <Col N="856" /> my observations to the figures given there.</P>
      <P>We were told in the budget that first class and second class mail would be subject to what was described as a minimum increase of 1p.  By that I assume that some items of first and second class mail, or either first or second class mail, will be increased by more than 1p.  Since I have not got the details, as yet, I will have to assume that the increase is only 1p, although it looks as if, in some cases, it will be more.  At the moment the cost of sending a letter by first class mail is 4p. The proposal is to increase it to 5p at least, possibly more.  That is an increase of at least 25 per cent.  The cost of second class mail is 2½p at the moment.  The proposal is to increase it by a minimum of lp to 3½p at least. That is an increase of 40 per cent at least.</P>
      <P>We have a serious inflationary situation at the moment.  We have had inflation over the past few years and the situation has not been improving. Indeed, we have seen the figures which were issued in the past couple of weeks for the rise in the cost of living index over the past 12 months and the rise in the cost of food.  In particular the figures for the rise in the cost of living and the increase in the cost of foodstuffs over the past three months make serious and worrying reading. Faced with that inflationary situation, the duty of this or any other Government is to do nothing at this time which will add directly to the costs incurred by ordinary people carrying out the normal functions of their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is any one expense which is common to every business, no matter how big or how small, it is the cost of postage and telephones, because any business of any significance at all must use the postal service and the telephone service.  Here there are increases ranging from 25 to 40 per cent, and possibly more when we get the full details.  I cannot think of anything more guaranteed to increase costs and increased costs must inevitably mean increased prices. This will, of course, start the spiral off all over again.  This very brutal taxation <Col N="857" /> increase in the budget has got very little publicity indeed and possibly it has not been objected to as strenuously as it should be as yet because it does not come into operation until 1st July, which is ten to 11 days away. However, when people reflect on the fact that it will cost five new pence or, in terms of old money, one shilling or 12 old pennies to post a letter, they will, I think, realise the significance of the way in which costs are being allowed to run out of control, and not just allowed but deliberately increased by the Government, thereby increasing prices and adding seriously to the already serious inflationary situation.</P>
    <P>The figures I have been giving are based on the assumption that the increase will be only one new penny.  I may be wrong in that because the phrase used by the Minister for Finance was &ldquo;a minimum increase of one new penny&rdquo; and the figures and percentages I have given may have to be increased still further when the announcement is made of the actual details.  It seems strange, after an interval of about five weeks and the 1st July being only ten or 11 days away, that the actual announcement has not yet been made.  I wonder what the reason for the delay is.  Is it that the Minister is anxious to have this Estimate through before the announcement is made?</P>
    <P>What I have said in relation to postal costs is equally valid in relation to telephone charges.  The ordinary local call from a coin box will go up by no less than 50 per cent.  Subscribers local calls are also being increased fairly drastically.  Trunk calls within the State will increase by 20 per cent.  The telephone is absolutely indispensible in business.  It is a vital part of the activities of any business, no matter what its size.  Even if those carrying on business wish to avoid using the telephone to avoid incurring these extra costs that simply will not be possible. One cannot avoid the use of the telephone. We have this increase of 20 per cent in trunk calls, 50 per cent in some local calls and something less than that in the case of private telephones. Again, as in the case of postal charges, the additional burden being put on firms is a serious one and a very <Col N="858" /> significant one.  It is one that will inevitably push up costs and inevitably push up prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The deficit left at the end of the last financial year was approximately £5 million.  The deficit budgeted for in last year's budget was £28 million.  This is a matter of which nobody need be ashamed, I think.  I fail to understand how a Government, which allege they are concerned with prices and keeping down costs, and which had as one of their main planks as recently as last February in the general election the promise that there would be no price increases and. as a result of that promise, gained votes from people unfortunately gullible enough to believe their promises or that they would make any effort to keep down costs and control inflation, the largest single problem facing the country at the moment, can claim to be serious when they come along subsequently and increase postal charges by as much as 40 per cent and telephone charges by 20 per cent and more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next matter with which I wish to deal is the question of the employment by the Government and the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs of certain people in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs since the advent to power of the new Government.  I read in the newspapers&mdash;I think it was yesterday&mdash;a complaint from a civil service union in relation to the promotion of certain officials by the previous Government.  To the best of my recollection reference was made to four Ministers having promoted officials.  Exception was taken to this. I find it very curious that the four Ministers referred to were all Fianna Fáil Ministers in the outgoing Government when, in the past few months, we have had people brought in from outside the civil service.  We had one appointed under the authority of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and responsible to him.  He was appointed not just to an executive or a clerical post but to the post of assistant secretary in the Department <Col N="859" /> of the Taoiseach.  This is a very senior post indeed.  It is rather curious that certain appointments made by the outgoing Government should cause difficulty while an appointment of this nature should pass entirely without comment by the union.  I feel I am entitled to discuss the appointment of this particular assistant secretary in the Department of the Taoiseach because the gentleman was actually referred to by name by the Minister in his opening statement at column 881 of volume 265 of the Official Report.  Sometime after that I put down a question to the Taoiseach as to what precisely was the position of this particular public servant because we had what seemed to me to be a unique situation in that the assistant secretary of one Department was not responsible to the political or permanent head of that Department but was responsible to another Minister in another Department. I asked the Taoiseach whether the newspaper reports to that effect were correct and I was told they were. That appears to be borne out by the Minister's own statement to which I have referred.  We have this situation and, in the light of the criticism made of certain appointments of people who had been working for a long time in other Departments, it is no harm to advert, as the Minister did himself, to this particular appointment now.</P>
    <P>I wonder if this is the first of many instances where we will have civil servants brought in from the outside, appointed in what is called the public interest to a particular Department, and then told that they are in no way responsible to the head of that Department, that they are responsible to another Minister.  I can see the whole structure of responsibility within the Civil Service break down if this carryon is to be used as a precedent in any other case.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that Mr. Muiris Mac Conghail was appointed an assistant secretary at a salary of £5,000-odd in the Department of the Taoiseach, but responsible to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs only, because the Government were aware of the high professional capabilities <Col N="860" /> of Mr. Muiris Mac Conghail.  No doubt he is a man, as the Minister says, of high professional capabilities but if my memory serves me rightly he is also the same gentleman who was at one time editor of the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme on RTE and in particular, was editor of the particular programme on money-lending which caused a great stir at the time, three or four years ago&mdash;so much so that a tribunal of inquiry consisting of three judges had to be set up to investigate the matter.</P>

      <P>As well as that appointment, which to say the least of <Col N="861" /> it is a curious one, into the Department of the Taoiseach, according to the information given to me by the Taoiseach in reply to a Parliamentary Question there was brought another gentleman from RTE&mdash;whose name I do not have and which I think is not relevant&mdash;who was put there as what was described by the Taoiseach as a personal assistant to Mr. Mac Conghail. My experience of one very busy Department in which the assistant secretaries were extremely hard worked indeed, was that none of them, nor indeed the deputy secretary, ever had what is described as a personal assistant.  I put down a question subsequently to the Minister for Finance to inquire how many deputy secretaries or assistant secretaries of Departments had what were described as personal assistants.  The answer I got was that there were six, presumably including Mr. Mac Conghail, I do not know what the total number of assistant and deputy secretaries is but I suppose it must be in the region of 50, approximately, in all Departments.  It seems curious that this special and favoured provision should be made for the most junior of all assistant secretaries in the service when, to my own knowledge, very senior men doing work of very considerable importance to the nation do not have this privilege.  No doubt there is some adequate explanation for it but I cannot say that it occurs to me straight off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next matter I want to refer to is the fact that again within the very recent past, a short time after his appointment as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the Minister brought in, again from RTE, to the public service a gentleman named Mr. Nicholas Simms to act as his adviser in relation to broadcasting matters.  Again it strikes me as curious that the promotion from clerical officer to executive officer of an official by a Minister in the last Government should cause a great furore and protest, and the promotion from higher executive officer to assistant principal of an official of long standing and service in a Department should also cause criticism or protest, while at the same time another Minister is able to bring in at various levels in his Department and in another <Col N="862" /> Department, including the second highest level of all, people from outside the service, without any voice or criticism being raised in relation to it. I want simply to contrast these situations for those who may be interested so that the record can be kept right in relation to this.</P>
    <P>The next matter I want to deal with is the question of the section 31 directive which was given to RTE by the former Government last year.  That section 31 directive was the subject of very considerable criticism at the time by the then Opposition or by many members of the then Opposition, by no means all.  Indeed, Deputy Cosgrave expressed himself, by implication if not in so many words, as being in favour of that directive at the time. One of the principal if not the most vocal, critics of the issuing of that directive was the present Minister.  I have found it curious that, if he believed in what he said on those occasions, he did not annul or revoke the directive when he came into office. He did give an explanation in the House and also elsewhere of his proposal ultimately, assuming of course the Oireachtas agreed to it, to repeal section 31 and to replace it by a different system which would, apparently, include a form of appeal tribunal.  That is a matter I want to come back to but I refer to this simply because it is a fact that the section 31 directive given by Deputy Collins when he was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, with the consent of the then Government, is still in force.  It is every bit as much in force and as effective today as it was on the day on which it was issued.  There were difficulties&mdash;everybody is aware of these &mdash;about the appearance of IRA members, and the advocates of violence, on RTE.  To a great extent the directive which we gave in 1972 overcame these problems and it prevented the appearance of members of the IRA on programmes. At least it prevented some people interviewed disclosing their support for the IRA on those programmes.</P>
    <P>The position remained satisfactory until recently.  While I did not see the programmes to which I will refer.  I <Col N="863" /> have spoken to a number of people who saw them and they agreed in broad outline as to what those programmes consisted of.  One programme which I have in mind was a news programme shown on Sunday night week last of a ceremony at Bodenstown, County Kildare.  This ceremony was held and organised by the Provisional IRA.  The meeting was addressed by members of the Provisional IRA.</P>
    <P>Considerable coverage was given to this particular ceremony and to the address of the main speaker.  It is interesting to note that one of the themes of the speech of the gentleman in question, although it may not have been part of what was reproduced&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on the screen, was the advocating of the overthrow of the institutions of this State. Mention was made, in particular, of Leinster House, the Dáil and the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not on television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that that part of it was not televised but my information is that this gentleman was televised and some of what he had to say was broadcast.  I regarded that, whether it was televised or not, as a serious matter.  I put down a question to the Minister for Justice concerning this and I received a letter today from the Ceann Comhairle informing me that the question which I addressed to the Minister regarding the action he proposed to take in relation to a speech made by a certain person in Bodenstown recently contained &ldquo;personal imputation&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must accept the ruling of the Chair when a question is disallowed but I am in some difficulty to know how asking the Minister for Justice what action he proposes to take in relation to a certain matter contains &ldquo;personal imputation&rdquo;. Because there was considerable prominence given to this ceremony <Col N="864" /> generally on television news bulletins I should like to inquire of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs why this sort of ceremony and these sort of people expressing these sort of ideas and advocating these principles, should now re-appear on our television screens when we had happily been rid of them since the directive under section 31 was given by the previous Minister in 1972.</P>
    <P>I understand that apart from the televising of this particular ceremony on news bulletins it was also shown on &ldquo;Feach&rdquo; some days later.  Much, if not all, of what appears on the news bulletins, together with further material on the same lines, appeared on this programme.  This brings me to the Minister's general attitude to section 31 which is one that I find totally unsatisfactory. The Minister expressed himself as being opposed to it or to any other form of control of broadcasting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>He said that he felt that these matters should be left to broadcasters themselves.  When he became Minister he found that things were not as easy or cut and dried as they were before.  He did not do anything in relation to section 31 but he announced that he would bring in a Bill which, he specified, would not be introduced until next year.  The Minister announced that this Bill would contain, among other things, a proposal to repeal section 31.  He proposes to substitute for the directive which can be given by the Minister under section 31 a right of appeal, presumably from either the Minister or a member of the public, to a tribunal which will consist of a judge, a journalist and a member of the public.  I am not altogether clear about this because the speech was not made in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apparently this tribunal will judge whether a particular item should have appeared on television.  Of course, the damage is done as soon as the particular item appears, particularly in relation to the IRA people advocating violence. I do not see how the existence of such a tribunal would be in the interest of <Col N="865" /> the people of the country.  I cannot see that the Minister, in proposing to substitute this for section 31, is doing anything but reneging on his responsibilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal has to do with section 18.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the proposal has to do with section 18, which I understand is the section dealing with the balance on programmes, it means that the situation is worse than I thought it was because it is not proposed to substitute section 31 which it is proposed to repeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>It shows that the Minister is the sole arbiter of balance and I propose to show, in my reply, how he uses that power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation is that any Minister of State in this country, when he is appointed to such an office, takes on himself certain responsibility. He has the interest of the public of this country to protect.  Part of the duty of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is to see that violence is not advocated over a national television or radio network. The situation we have now is that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs proposes to divest himself of the power he has to prevent violence being advocated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>He proposes in lieu of his own responsibility to the public to substitute some sort of appeal tribunal, about which we have necessarily to be vague, and ask them to say whether a particular programme was in order.  In other words, the Minister seeks to divest himself of his basic responsibility to decide these matters in the interest of the people of this nation.  He seeks to place upon a tribunal, who are not public figures and are not answerable to this House or the public at large, this responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that if he persists in that course it is a very dangerous one and one which could do untold harm to the public interest in this country.  The Minister proposes <Col N="866" /> to embark on this course at the worst possible time because, unhappily, the violence in the northern part of our country is not subsiding. In fact, the violence seems to be every bit as bad at the moment, if not worse, than it ever was.  The Minister has a power which the last Minister and the last Government used, as a last resort, wisely and effectively but now the present Minister proposes to divest himself of that power.  He does not propose to take any power in lieu of it but to have some sort of vague tribunal which will judge whether particular programmes are balanced.  This may be convenient for the Minister.  It may get him out of the difficulty of having to put his foot down and saying &ldquo;You cannot do that in the interests of the Irish people&rdquo;.  The Minister may not wish to do that.  Obviously, he does not wish to do it and it is no harm that we should all see clearly what are the Minister's responsibilities and that we should seek to ensure that he faces up to those responsibilities in the way that they were faced up to by Deputy Collins when he was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and in the way in which the last Government faced up to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Minister is anxious to reply and, consequently, I shall not delay the House unduly.  The Minister has introduced a considerable Estimate, much of which was prepared by his predecessor. The Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs has grown in stature down through the years and the various aspects of it affect the lives of all our people.  Therefore, the Minister's responsibility is great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the last speaker, I must say that I was very disappointed over one of the first appointments made by the Minister on taking office.  It was an appointment that smacked of patronage. The appointment of that particular person as the Minister's adviser was a bad start and will have led to many people, rightly or wrongly, viewing the Minister with some degree of suspicion and saying that he was up to no good.  Another early function of the Minister was the appointment <Col N="867" /> of a new RTE Authority, I know that the new authority are comprised of some very worthwhile people but the Minister also nominated people who had played a very prominent part in politics and in the formation of the present Government.  That, too, may be patronage.  However, I wish the authority the best of luck and hope they will do a good (lay's work on behalf of all of us.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed us that there are to be increases in the cost of the telephone service and also in the postage rates.  As Deputy O'Malley has said, these increases are alarming when one considers that they are of the order of 25 per cent.  No doubt the Minister is anxious that the postal service should pay for itself.  We can only wait and see whether this is achieved.</P>
    <P>There are many matters that one could discuss under this Estimate but it is not my intention to go into all of these.  One matter I would refer to is television.  We are in an age where television is beginning to rule our lives and it is a subject that evokes much discussion.  There are many people who accept as fact everything that is presented on their screens.  Perhaps older people can reach their own judgments but that is not always the situation in regard to younger people.  Therefore, it is of vital importance that programmes are well balanced and that they are in accordance with our Christian way of life.  There should not be too many programmes with a foreign influence.  Some television programmes are excellent but, of course, it is not possible to satisfy everybody's taste in regard to viewing.  On the whole, those responsible for television here are doing a good job but they must ensure that there is always a balanced presentation of programmes.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made here to the fact that in some cases the two sides of a story are not given.  That is a matter to which the new authority will have to apply themselves.  The presentation of programmes has advanced a great deal since the inception of our television service but, while many people are asking for the facility of multi-channel viewing, there are a <Col N="868" /> number of rural areas where reception from any station is very poor.  I know that those responsible are doing their best in this regard and that they have achieved much during the past few years.  The Minister will be aware of the situation in these rural areas of which I speak because no doubt there is an amount of correspondence on his files from the people concerned telling him of the situation.</P>
    <P>Since radio and television have a considerable influence on our lives, every effort must be made to ensure that programmes are factual.  Also, there should be more programmes which depict our very proud heritage. In this regard I would pay tribute to the programmes on the Treaty Debates which were presented very well.  We need more programmes of that type. Our young people, in particular, should be able to see programmes that deal with the history of our country.</P>
    <P>Television can be used in many ways.  At this point I would refer critically to what we might call political television but first, let me exonerate completely those people who present the Dáil programmes. These programmes are presented in a very balanced manner and we all know who are the people concerned with them.  However, I am concerned regarding what has been a thorny subject during the past few weeks.  I refer to the first presentation of a political Ard-Fheis in this country.  It may be said that agreement in respect of the broadcasting of Ard-Fheiseanna was reached between the political parties. Those responsible for broadcasting the Ard-Fheis to which I am referring cannot be faulted but, rather, the blame must be laid at the feet of the people who presented the Ard-Fheis. In future, the Minister and the RTE Authority will have to ensure that strict regulations are adhered to in respect of what constitutes an Ard-Fheis. We all know what an Ard-Fheis should be, that is, a coming together of delegates to discuss aspects of policy of the various Departments. These delegates put forward motions for discussions with the Ministers, or Shadow Ministers as the case may be, of the various Departments.  However. <Col N="869" /> in the first live broadcast of an Ard-Fheis that we have had there was nothing of that nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <P>I want to be fair to everybody.  The Minister wants to reply.  I am putting the case that that should not be allowed to happen again, irrespective of what party are in power.  Very strict procedure must be laid down as to what constitutes an Ard-Fheis.  It cannot be a glorified public meeting such as the last Ard-Fheis was, where they were harping on the one thing and there were cheer gangs, and all the rest.</P>

They did not want the references to certain establishments and to certain people. I hope the lesson has been learned and that we will not see such a despicable presentation again.  I do not blame RTE so much as the people who presented the programme.  The Minister should have known what was going on, being a member of the Government. Maybe he did not.  I could not tell you.  He did not belong to the party that presented that Ard-Fheis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have dealt sufficiently with the Fine Gael rally which proved to be such a flop and I shall turn to advertising on television.  Advertising on television brings in a <Col N="870" /> great deal of revenue but we should be very careful in regard to it.  At the moment everybody seems to be harping on the one thing, that the advertisements of alcoholic drink depict the entire family as being involved and enjoying themselves and that it is the right and proper thing at all ages to drink.  These advertisements should not appear on television before 10 p.m., by which time the younger people will be in bed.  I refer to children. It is all right to advertise in a fair manner but the concept of these advertisements is to involve the whole family, father and mother, sons and daughters of all ages.  That is very dangerous.  Strict regulations are laid down in regard to cigarette advertisements. RTE must be more strict in regard to the advertising of alcoholic drink.</P>
      <P>Many people from the United States tell me that they do not receive Radio Éireann.  Could anything be done about that?  There are many millions of our people in the United States, first and second generation Irish, who are very interested in what is happening in this country.</P>
      <P>The RTE Authority will probably read what Deputies say here.  I would ask them to ensure that interesting live programmes will not be cut.  Some time ago an Oxford debate went off the air at a very interesting juncture to allow the news to be broadcast at 10 p.m.  Even if it means postponing the news or some other programme, these programmes should be allowed to finish.  It is too bad that such a programme should be cut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The telephone has become a necessary item in our lives.  I sympathise with Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs in their efforts to provide telephones. It is the &ldquo;in&rdquo; thing to have a telephone.  The Department could not possibly cope with the rate of applications.  When an area is cleared, fresh applications come in.  There is a priority list for doctors and vets. It has come to my notice at health board meetings that there is one group who do not get priority in this matter and who should get it.  I refer to home assistance officers.  They play a very important part in our health <Col N="871" /> services.  They arrange for the transportation of patients to hospital and so on.  They should get the same facilities as doctors get because they are part of the health services and lives may depend on the speed with which they can get cars to patients, especially those in the lower income group.</P>
    <P>There is a great demand in rural areas for telephone kiosks.  This matter was discussed at the Cork County Council.  There is a 1908 Act which says that a local authority can go security if a kiosk is required in a rural area.  There may not be a post office in the area.  There may be a number of small farmers.  People have come together and have made representation to public representatives of all parties in regard to the provision of telephone kiosks. It can be done if the council adopt the 1908 Act but, unfortunately, Cork County Council so far have refused to adopt that Act.  Could the Minister introduce legislation whereby a group of people could go security and guarantee to the Department that there would be no financial loss incurred by the erection of a kiosk in an area?  Such a kiosk is essential for people who, in the main, are small farmers and cottiers living in, isolated areas.  I would like the Minister to consider this matter.  A private subscriber does not have to share his phone with anybody.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters which I would like to discuss but it is only fair that the Minister should be allowed to conclude tonight.  We will be critical if the Minister does not do his work properly.  That is our duty as an Opposition.  I hope the Minister has been listening to my remarks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the Minister who has been waiting all day.  First of all, I should like to congratulate him on his appointment and to wish him well.  Other speakers have covered the matters open for discussion on the Estimate and I ask to be forgiven if I concentrate on a number of the issues that affect my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Meaney spoke about rural <Col N="872" /> telephones and the installation of kiosks in isolated areas.  He made the case far better than I could.  I had on today's Order Paper four questions to the Minister in regard to the provision of telephone kiosks.  Since my election to this House I have received many requests for telephone kiosks in isolated rural areas.  The Minister has spent some holiday time in the Kerry Gaeltacht and knows from his own experience there the frustrations and the fear that the rural community experience. The lack of telephone facilities is a bone of contention in my constituency which is, for the main part, a rural constituency extending into very hilly and mountainy areas.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to set aside, even on a priority basis, a certain amount of money for the provision of kiosks in isolated areas such as these. I can well understand that it is not possible to erect kiosks in all areas in which they have been requested but I would ask the Minister seriously to consider the plight of the rural population.</P>
    <P>The matter of sub-post offices has been mentioned.  I would ask the Minister, in so far as he can, to put a stop to the intimidation that has been going on since the change of Government in some post offices.  He has received letters about a number of post offices in my constituency; at least, his Department have one, if not two.  I hope that in so far as it lies in his power he will ensure that the people who are being intimidated will have the protection of his Department and of the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred in his opening speech to the motorisation of postal deliveries in rural areas.  This is something that he has inherited.  It is something that I, as a member of a county council, have fought against for quite some time.  In my view, motorisation is the proper thing in an area where the roads are good but in the constituency that I have the honour to represent the roads are not that good and it is false economy to use vans in such circumstances.  I do not think the service has been improved.  It certainly has cost a number of jobs.  Jobs are very scarce in the constituency.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister, in <Col N="873" /> so far as Mayo is concerned, to review this matter.</P>
    <P>I should like to join in the tributes to post office staff.  In particular, I should like to pay a tribute to the staff of the Ballina post office.  On a sad occasion in the town recently I was asked by some townspeople to get in touch with the helicopter rescue service and the staff in the post office did all in their power to facilitate me and the parents of the unfortunate boy involved in the accident. They were available at all times to me and to others who were looking for help.</P>
    <P>The staff in post offices are often criticised with regard to the service but in many instances this is because they have to use inadequate and outdated equipment.  I should like the Minister to tell the House when automatic trunk dialling will be available in the Ballina area.  A building was erected for the machinery some three or four years ago but so far nothing has been done.  In the past few years there has been considerable industrial development and there have been many complaints about the telephone service.</P>
    <P>I noticed in the notes circulated by the Minister that it costs more to install telex in rural areas; the further away from Dublin the greater is the cost.  This is something the Minister should consider.  In western areas large numbers are engaged in farming but if we want to establish industries it is essential that we have efficient methods of communication.  Industries coming to the west will expect the same facilities at the same price as in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I should like to join with other speakers who referred to the right of post office workers to join political parties.  The workers are doing this anyway; therefore, they might as well be allowed openly to join political parties if they wish to do so.  It is not right or just that in 1973 people should be obliged to carry on their political activities behind closed doors.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the many Deputies on both sides <Col N="874" /> who have contributed to what, generally speaking, was a constructive and helpful debate.  I would have liked to reply in a great deal of detail to all the points raised but as we have a certain time difficulty I propose to concentrate on certain main themes. However, I should not like Deputies to think their particular points are being ignored; they are not, they are being considered in my Department and, where appropriate, in RTE.  The specific programming points about radio and television are really for the consideration of the RTE Authority, although they are quite rightly raised here.</P>
      <P>Before passing from my introductory remarks.  I should like to thank in particular the many Deputies on all sides who referred appreciatively to the work of the personnel of the Department.  It is a very large Department. In some areas there are serious difficulties, particularly with regard to telephones, it is inevitable that the staff of the Department should hear complaints, and it is legitimate and proper that they should from time to time.  It is a healthy and encouraging thing that they should also hear from so many Deputies praise for the courtesy and co-operation given by the staff.  Finally, I should like to thank Deputies on both sides of the House who were kind enough to wish me personally well in my tenure of this difficult post.</P>
      <P>The first matter I should like to deal with concerns the provision of capital for telephones.  Deputy Collins, spokesman for the Opposition on this issue, referred to Volume 265, columns 886-887 of the Official Report to the tremendous progress which had been made during his tenure of office and he attacked the previous Coalition&mdash; the one of 15 years ago&mdash;for starving the telephone service of capital.  I find that a somewhat surprising charge. I will not say it was an impudent charge, but it was a little far-fetched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Coalition of 16 years ago can now be left to the historians.  Their achievements and mistakes are not now impinging on our lives and I do not want to argue about whether they were wrong in their telephone capital policy.  The Coalition that concerns <Col N="875" /> the people is the Coalition now in office.  We will be judged on our achievements, on our mistakes, and on what we do.  At this stage we have to grapple with a very serious situation, as many Deputies have rightly stressed, in the area of telephone development. That serious situation was not created by the Coalition of 16 years ago or by their failure to provide capital.  It was created by the failure of the previous Government during the last three years to match capital expansion to the known expansion in demand and this is demonstrable.</P>
    <P>It is clear that a steep and progressive increase in telephone investment will now be required to make good arrears of development works and to provide the spare capacity needed to meet mounting public demand.  This Government will proceed to do that. Unfortunately, while it has been generally accepted in principle that the telephone service should be adequately financed, there has been a tendency in the past to treat telephone capital investment as investment of a kind that can be reduced, or at least deferred, without serious effects.</P>
    <P>The period immediately prior to 1957&mdash;the period Deputy Collins chose to dwell on for very understandable reasons&mdash;was not the only period when telephone capital expenditure was severely restricted, as well Deputy Collins knows.  Notwithstanding the continuous existence of a waiting list and other arrears&mdash;for instance, urgent trunk works, underground and modernisation schemes&mdash;telephone investment has been subject to the application of periodic financial constraints of varying severity depending on general pressure on Exchequer resources.  The most recent was not 1957, and Deputy Collins and his colleagues know this very well.  It was roughly from mid-1970 to mid-1971.  I do not know if that rings a bell with Deputy Collins.</P>
    <P>During that period, all Departments were being pressed by the Minister for Finance to reduce their capital expenditure and their demands for capital as much as possible.  For 1970-71 our approved allocation for telephones was £8.25 million, a reduction on a very <Col N="876" /> tight £8.8 million estimate submitted. Our estimate for 1971-72 was over £11 million but it was decided in September, 1970 that our allocation would be £9.48 million&mdash;another cut, not by the Coalition of 1957 but by the Fianna Fáil coalition that has just gone out of office.  In order to keep expenditure as far as possible within the allocations mentioned it was necessary from September, 1970 to take drastic restrictive measures.  I am quoting at this point from a Department brief.  These included suspension of recruitment of construction staff, reduction of overtime on construction works, curtailment of purchases of engineering stores and laying off of numbers of temporary casual staff.  Eventually, the allocations had to be increased but the effect of the measures already taken were continuing and are continuing.  The connection rate fell in 1971-72 and the development programme generally was set back seriously.</P>
    <P>In what I say here I should like to make it very clear that I am not criticising Deputy Coilins personally except for the remarks which were forgiveable in his speech on the Estimate in which he chose to harp on the Coalition back in 1957 instead of what he well knew happened in 1970-71. But Deputy Collins did put up a fight. He told his colleagues then what the effect of such cuts would be.  I am afraid they pretty well ignored him but we have to live with the results which he then predicted.  On the 18th December, 1970, he wrote this very proper letter to Mr. George Colley, T.D. Minister for Finance which I had better quote in full as I do not want to be accused of quoting out of context :</P>
    <P>Dear George, My Department has been trying to frame a workable Telephone Capital Programme for 1971-72 within the figures of £9.66 million (total proposed allocation £10.36 million less £0.7 million for RTE).  I wish to let you know what is the position.</P>
    <P>Contracts for engineering worksmostly for new exchanges, extension of existing exchanges, major trunks schemes et cetera are estimated to result in payments of £3.6 million <Col N="877" /> during 1971-72.  The amount will be higher if there is any undue carry over of the estimated excess this year.  Contracts of this kind must be entered into long before performance.</P>
    <P>This, of course, is very important.</P>
    <P>In addition, £0.6 million is required for buildings works, mostly under way or at an advanced stage, essential to take exchange equipment.</P>
    <P>Allowing for these commitments we expect to have at most £5.46 million to cover the cost of staff (including travelling <i>et cetera</i>) and of purchases of engineering materials. Of this figure it is estimated that at least £3.6 million will be required for staff, leaving £1.9 million at most for purchases of engineering materials. This is £0.8 million-nearly 30%&mdash;less than the £2.7 million in our original estimate and would be altogether insufficient to provide a minimum balance between construction staff and the engineering stores they would use.  The only way in which we could keep within the allocation, therefore, would be to lay off large numbers of staff, including quasi-permanent and permanent officers.  We have already taken drastic steps to reduce staff costs by suspending further recruitment of construction force, cutting overtime to a minimum and laying off temporary casual staff according as the works on which they are employed are completed.</P>
    <P>This is from the man who warned me against starving the telephone services.</P>
    <P>By 1st April next this force will be about 100 less than it was a few months ago and will represent a big reduction on the numbers provided for (in the light of arrears and the rising level of demand) in the original estimate submitted.  A programme based on this staffing will fall far short of requirements.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins clearly foresaw, and deserves credit for it, the situation that was building up but he proved a Cassandra who was pretty well, but not quite, ignored.</P>
    <P>It will involve severe restrictions in the provision of subscribers' lines. The most serious effect will be a <Col N="878" /> reduction in the amount of underground cabling we can undertake in towns and cities.  It will mean that in many areas we will provide telephones only on a priority basis and even this will not be possible in some areas (e.g. some new building estates or areas where all spare cables are exhausted).</P>
    <P>a catalogue of the evils that are afflicting us now.</P>
    <P>In rural areas we will have to defer the provision of lines involving more than a prescribed amount of construction work and reduce the number of rural kiosks to be erected. Certain urgent trunk and other schemes will have to be deferred.</P>
    <P>The restrictive programme outlined in the preceding paragraph has been costed at £9.97 million excluding 12th round increases.  Although it would leave us in a sorry state, indeed&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>I agree with that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;in relation to the mounting demand for telephones (applications up 19% on last year) we would at least retain our skilled staff, the building up of which has been one of the biggest difficulties in trying to overtake demand.</P>
    <P>He is now setting himself a very contracted objective.</P>
    <P>I must, therefore, emphasise that any laying off of permanent or semi-permanent engineering staff&mdash; which appears unavoidable if we have to keep within the allocation proposed&mdash;would have a disastrous effect on the telephone service now and for years to come.  No later measures could remedy the damage to output, recruitment and general morale.  We have not attempted. therefore, to work out in any detail what the effects would be on the works programme.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, may I point out that the telephone service has been consistently profitable, that it will be providing in depreciation provisions close on £3 million of its capital needs and over £4 million interest on previous borrowings. Few of the other services can claim <Col N="879" /> such a contribution towards their capital needs.  Finally, the waiting list is now 15,000 and new applications are coming in at over 30,000 a year.  The demand is already well. in front of our connection rate of 23,000 or 24,000 a year.</P>
    <P>I am afraid &ldquo;Dear George&rdquo; paid very little attention to that.  There is just a bare acknowledgment on the file. Again, I say it is an admirable letter. He wrote a similar letter then to the Taoiseach.  I do not think I need read all of it out; it goes over much the same ground.  He says in paragraph 5 of a letter dated 19th February, 1971:</P>
    <P>In earlier Government discussions I reluctantly agreed to a cut to £9.6 million and the Minister for Finance subsequently asked for a further cut back to £9.2 million.  I will, of course, accept loyally whatever figure you decide upon and will do my absolute best to hold to it but the effects even of a cut to £9.6 million will be very grave for the telephone service.</P>
    <P>Again, in paragraph 6, he puts in this theme:</P>
    <P>We have suspended recruitment of trainee installers although we are going to feel their loss not only next year but in future years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all right. I think I would get a better reply.  The point I am making, whatever the future may be, is a very serious one about the situation that was handed on to us in regard to telephones through no fault of my predecessor but through the fault of the Government to which he belonged as a collectivity in ignoring the very serious considerations put forward here.</P>
      <P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>A further quote from this letter to the Taoiseach of 19th February, 1971, is paragraph 7:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="880" /> The only ways in which expenditure could be held down to £9.6 million is by dismissing men (unskilled and semi-skilled) by asking works contractors to slow down necessary works, deferring the placing of new contracts if at all possible, and by asking contractors for stores to defer deliveries or accept cancellation of contracts.</P>
    <P>Then paragraph 9 :</P>
    <P>The cutting down of staff and of contracts work would slow down the necessary improvement of telephone service in exchanges and on trunk routes where it is less than satisfactory at present; reduce the rate of conversion of manual exchanges to automatic&mdash;something we would be very sorry to do because the conversion rate is already too slow and manual service is becoming increasingly unacceptable; and severely restrict the connection of new subscribers' lines.  We would aim at carrying out removals and installing priority category lines where possible and lines involving little work on stores.  It would probably be necessary to refuse connection of long rural lines.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, that catalogue of evils resulting from cuts of this kind has materialised.  Cassandra was right. The wrong decisions were taken and we are paying for these decisions now, and I took it a little hard from Deputy Collins that he should now lecture me as he once much more rightly lectured his colleagues on the necessity for providing capital.  What I would hope seriously is that the consequences we have seen will register with all those concerned as they will register with my own colleagues, and that we will see that there is a continuity. As Deputy Collins knows better than anyone else in the House, continuity of capital investment is what is required.  You cannot stop and then start again, or if you do, you are in chaos.  From what I have heard from Deputy Collins and from what I have seen of all he has done on this subject, I am sure his support will be forthcoming&mdash;and the support of his colleagues while in Opposition&mdash;for an expanded telephone <Col N="881" /> capital programme; but, even so, I am afraid we still have to pay the price for the past and have to pay the price for the mistakes in 1970 and 1971 because this is a system in respect of which we have to plan for years ahead and we are feeling the blast of that, but please, of 1970-1971, not 1957.</P>
    <P>I will not go into any detail about this aspect of our Government's plans, programmes and prospects in this reply to this debate for the good reason that I will be coming back here before very long with a Telephone Capital Bill on which we will have a full opportunity to go into the matter very thoroughly but I would like to take up a few other points which were made.  As regards service-again still on telephonesand staffing complaints, Deputy Collins asked me whether I had studied the report of the Survey on Management Procedures in Telecommunications Organisations.  This is the report submitted by Swedish experts which was submitted, I think, just before my predecessor left office.  I have read it and have discussed it with officials of my Department.  In general, we accept the broad principles underlying this report which are in favour of further decentralisation, further delegation of responsibility and rationalisation in general.  The team involved recognised that this will take some time to carry out and they indicated tentative time schedules.  What my Department is now studying are the problems involved in the implementation of the main principles of the report and this requires discussions with other parties. The trade unions have a very important interest in this and these matters will have to be discussed with them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling suggested that telephone components should be manufactured in Ireland.  In fact, considerable quantities of stores and equipment used by the Departments are of Irish manufacture.  During a recent period of 12 months, the value of such purchases amounted to £2.4 million.  A provisional five year contract for the supply of exchange equipment has been entered into with L.M. Ericsson of Stockholm, who for some years past <Col N="882" /> have been successful in getting most of such orders in competitions open to all manufacturers.  This contract will enable the manufacture of equipment to be planned by the company well in advance and delivery and installation to be effected more speedily.  A factory premises for this company is currently being erected in Athlone.</P>
    <P>I am skipping some of the more detailed points for the moment but any Deputy who feels that I have not covered his point can take it up with me, either by written or oral parliamentary question or direct communication, as he chooses.  Deputy Collins did make a point about the recruiting of extra staff for telephone development. I can assure the Deputy that the staff concerned is being expanded as quickly as possible.  The Department is in the process of recruiting additional engineers, technician trainees and trainee installers.  It will, however, be some time before this additional staff becomes effective.  For instance, it takes about four years to train a skilled technician, so that in this area also if the service has been starved in the past, the malnutrition will continue to tell in the present time.  Examination of means of stepping up the pace of telephone development generally will naturally cover the possibility of improving procedures in that regard.</P>
    <P>Questions were asked about the size of the waiting list.  The number of recorded applications for exchange lines on the waiting list on a recent date was 33,000, the figures having risen in recent years as follows : at 31st December, 1970, 14,600; for the same date in 1971, 20,650; for the same date in 1972, 30,900; and at 31st March this year, 32,000.  The figures shown include lines in course of installation, orders with the engineers for attention, and a proportion of ineffective applications which will not be proceeded with.  Applying a percentage based on experiences of the numbers of probable cancellations, the effective waiting list on 31st March, 1973, is estimated at around 29,000.</P>
    <P>Taking account of the number of telephones at present being installed, our present effective waiting list represents roughly about one year's demand <Col N="883" /> at the 1972-73 connection rate and we are all agreed that this is very unsatisfactory and disquieting and must be abated.  Applications for telephones increased last year by an unprecedented one-third over the figure for the previous year.  There is no sign of any abatement in the demand and the latest figure for the current year shows that it was almost half as high again as in the corresponding period last year.  There is little doubt that the stimulating effect of our entry into the EEC, increased prosperity and the utility of the telephone in present-day conditions for all kinds of purposes are among the factors which have contributed to the soaring demand.</P>
    <P>In order to meet demand at its current rate and effect a reduction in the waiting list within the current financial year, it is considered that the connection rate in 1972-73 would need to be roughly doubled, that is, raised to well over 50,000.  Unfortunately, there is no prospect of reaching this figure in the short term.  It is not a field in which you can plan and achieve things in a short time.  Indeed, if achievable, such a connection rate would impose an intolerable extra load on the present system and some Deputies have made that point.  Extra equipment must first be installed in existing exchanges, new exchanges must be provided in certain areas, extra circuits must be provided on trunk routes.  The numbers of skilled staff have to be increased.  Installation work is in progress in numerous exchanges; extra trunk lines are on the way; and relief will begin to be apparent in a number of areas later this year.  Orders for new plant and equipment now amount to over £25 million.</P>
    <P>In view of the explosive nature of the demand it would be rash, at this stage, to make any promises as to when the waiting list will be eliminated or, indeed, drastically reduced.  Priority must be given to providing a reasonable standard of service for existing subscribers, even if that involves an increased waiting list for some time.  My Department are determined to press on just as hard as they can and, above all, as continuously as they can, with the solution of this problem.  We believe <Col N="884" /> we will have the full support of the entire Government, something which, unfortunately, was lacking to my predecessor at one critical period.</P>
    <P>I should say something about the quality of the telephone service.  Deputy Esmonde, Deputy Desmond, and Deputy R.P. Burke referred to the quality of the telephone service. Mention was made in particular of delay, crossed lines, difficulties in dialling certain numbers, and so on, such as we have all experienced. Difficulties of the kind mentioned, and many others such as dialling failures, wrong numbers, <i>et cetera</i>, are due mainly to overloading of the exchanges and associated equipment, as I mentioned in my opening statement. This results in congestion in much the same way that heavy traffic will cause a temporary hold-up in a street or a road.  Repeat call attempts add to the difficulties.</P>
    <P>Congestion on the automatic system can have various side effects.  One is to throw a quite abnormal volume of calls for assistance on the operators in the manual exchanges, with consequent adverse effect on the speed of answer. We are suffering from shortage of spare plant which should be available and already installed in exchanges and elsewhere, but is not, to meet the mounting demand.  The increase of one-third in the application rate for new telephones last year, followed by an even higher rate this year, is indicative of the still greater potential demand which exists if it could be met quickly and fully.  Provision of reserves of plant to cater for a steep rate of growth will require heavy expenditure of capital. I shall be coming back to the House about that.</P>
    <P>As mentioned in my opening statement, equipment valued at over £20 million was on order on 31st March last.  This figure has since been increased to over £25 million.  Many other urgently needed schemes are in various planning stages.  Priority is being given to raising the quality of service for existing subscribers.  This does not mean that there will be any slakening of effort to provide telephones for new subscribers but, in areas where existing plant is overloaded, temporary <Col N="885" /> restrictions on the connection of new lines are unavoidable in the interests of all concerned.</P>
    <P>Again I am obliged to skip a certain number of points at this stage.  I should like to say something about kiosks and I hope to come back to that. I also want to come to the postal services. At this point, however, I want to say something about broadcasting. The curious thing is that some Deputies found fault with me&mdash;and it was a legitimate criticism&mdash;for devoting too high a proportion of my opening remarks to the question of broadcasting. I certainly agree that a Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who devoted all his mind to broadcasting and was not thinking about the other problems in his Department would be derelict in his duty.  The House is quite right to be vigilant about this.</P>
    <P>However, I note with some amusement that, some of the Deputies who found fault with me for devoting too high a proportion of my speech to broadcasting, themselves devoted a much higher proportion of their speeches to it.  For example, Deputy Haughey who chided me a little on this, devoted four times as much of his speech to broadcasting as he devoted to other aspects of the Department's work, while my proportion was fifty-fifty.  If the Deputy checks the record he will be rather amused to see what he will find.</P>
    <P>In some ways broadcasting is a subject for debate in a sense that some of the other more technical aspects of this Estimate are not.  They do not lend themselves so easily to it.  Nor are the issues affecting them&mdash;and this is another way of saying the same thing, I suppose&mdash;so controversial.  There is something quite controversial about broadcasting in its nature.  It is natural enough that, not only myself, but other Members of the House should have devoted quite a good deal of time to this matter.  I should like to say something about it now.</P>
    <P>First, I should like to say I am very glad that the new authority were so generally welcomed on both sides of the House, in the Press and, I believe, also by the profession generally including <Col N="886" /> broadcasters.  Only one appointment was somewhat criticised and that I think on grounds of a misunderstanding. Some Northern commentatorssome of them writing to our Presscommented on my choice of Mr. John Robb as not being representative of Ulster Protestants.  Of course I did not have the temerity to purport to appoint a representative of Ulster Protestants. That is not something which anyone here could do, or claim to do.  I wish expressly to exclude the idea that I was nominating such a representative.</P>
    <P>I was nominating a distinguished individual who has in a quite unusual degree something which is not easy to acquire in the conditions of Northern Ireland, that is, the respect of both communities there, the respect even of people who do not agree with his views.  I do not necessarily agree with all his views myself, but he is a valuable member of the authority.  He brings not a representative voice but his own individual voice and his own individual intelligence on to this board.  I think he can help the authority very much in all questions pertaining to Northern Ireland. Some people suggested I should have appointed A, B or C, well-known, distinguished, respected.  Northern politicians of one stripe or another.  I did not appoint politically active people to the authority from the south and I did not see why I should do it from the north either.  In general, this is fairly well understood.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the general idea of moving in the direction of an open broadcasting area was welcomed here. Many Deputies drew attention&mdash;very rightly&mdash;to the many difficulties with which this whole thing is strewn, and to the fact that it will be quite a long time before we can achieve anything like the full extension which I indicated was desirable and which Depu ties and the public generally see as desirable.  We can begin to move in that way.</P>
    <P>On the question of a second channel, the use of piped television, and a number of other matters I am somewhat inhibited in my capacity to reply at this stage.  I have received <Col N="887" /> the second interim report of the Broadcasting Review Committee.  It has been laid before both Houses.  It makes certain important recommendations in this area.  I am not in a position to tell the House at this point of any decisions about this report.  I sought it as a matter of urgency and I received it on 31st May.  As soon as I received it, I referred it for study in my Department and to the RTE Authority for their comments since, of course, it affects them in many ways.  They have promised me their comments before the end of this month.  During next month I will put my recommendations in this area before the Government and, having got the decisions of the Government, I will be in a position to make an announcement.  We are committed to proceed in these matters with urgency but, of course, it has to be deliberate and consultative urgency.</P>
    <P>All Deputies, I think, welcomed the idea of making RTE television available generally in Northern Ireland. On that, Deputy Collins referred to his Government having laid the groundwork for this.  I do not think really that any of that groundwork laying has been of any very distinct service in that the previous Government, without having received the agreement of the British Government, approached the International Frequency Registration Board on this for the strengthening of the signal into Northern Ireland&mdash;the Carlingford Lough project&mdash;and an objection was raised, very predictably and very quickly by the British, which, in fact, in practice amounted to a veto, and so we were back to square I, or not quite as good as square I, I would think.  I do not think this approach, the approach of trying to do it through an international body over the head of our neighbours could have worked and, measuring my words rather carefully, I do not think the recollection of it is necessarily helpful in the present stage of our negotiations. These, of course, still continue. When I met Sir John Eden it was decided there would be talks between officials; the groundwork has been <Col N="888" /> laid for these and the official talks will, I understand, begin shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins urged that the provision of the new high-powered transmitter to replace the Athlone transmitter be speeded up and Deputy Brugha and Deputy O'Brien also referred to the need for improving reception for the Irish people.  There will be no avoidable delay in completing this project, which is in the top priority category, and it may be possible, in fact, to improve on the completion date.  RTE now say the transmitter may be in service by the end of 1974. This transmitter will, of course, also improve one aspect to which a number of Deputies rightly referred, namely, reception in Britain, especially in the London area, of RTE.  This is also a matter I discussed with Sir John Eden.  He tells me that the interference which does at present exist by Radio London with our transmissions is a temporary thing, but it will go on, I am afraid, for a considerable time, for some two years in fact; however, when that channel is shifted and our new transmitter is available, reception in Britain will certainly be better than it has ever been.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins referred lo my appointment of Mr. Nicholas Simms as my special assistant.  The position is that Mr. Simms has been seconded from his post in RTE for a period of one year to act as special assistant to the Minister.  He remains on the same salary as he had in RTE and will return to RTE at the point on the scale he would have reached had he remained with RTE.  He derives no financial or other advantage from his temporary secondment to the Department and, in these circumstances, the charges of nepotism hardly hold water.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins, and I am grateful lo him for this, put on the record a statement I made while in opposition about the need that any Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would have for some assistance and advice outside the regular mill.  I decided when I went there that I did need such advice and help and assistance.  I needed somebody who would be close to me, with whom I could discuss things <Col N="889" /> informally, somebody who understood RTE, having worked in it.  Having confidence in Mr. Simms, I decided I wanted him.  I knew, because he was related to me, because he is my son-in-law, that this would give ground for criticism.  I considered which was more important, the proper and effective discharge of the duties entrusted to me or the possibility of receiving some criticism.  I decided I should do my best with my job and get the people whom I most needed. I informed the Taoiseach of the situation and of Mr. Simm's relationship to me before proceeding.  Deputy Collins has accused me of concealing a material fact, to wit, the fact apparently that Nicholas Simms is my son-in-law. As Mr. Simms was married to my daughter in St. Patrick's Cathedral in this city a few years back, and as I gave the bride away, I think Deputy Collins is regarding me as unusually naive if he thinks I could conceal that fact.  I am prepared to accept whatever verdict the people and those who are interested in these matters render on that and I shall not refer to it further.</P>
    <P>With regard to the broadcasting of the proceedings of the Oireachtas, Deputy Collins seemed to suggest that this is a solo idea of mine.  He does not seem to have listened to that much-discussed verbatim broadcast of the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis because, if he had, he would have heard the following passage from the Taoiseach's speech there:</P>
    <P>I should also add that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs has authorised negotiations between RTE and the appropriate Dáil committee on the question of broadcasting Dáil debates on an experimental basis and, in the first instance at least, on sound radio only.  While this whole question has several aspects of some difficulty and complexity the Government is anxious in general to open up our democratic process to the, I hope. sympathetic observation of the people.</P>
    <P>That is the statement made by the Taoiseach and that is, in fact, Government policy.  I understand the Committee on Procedure and Privileges <Col N="890" /> are now seized of this matter and they are aware that they can call on RTE for any advice and co-operation that may be required.</P>
    <P>Several people made the point that this would be a very complex and difficult thing and that the problem of selecting from Dáil debates would be almost insuperable.  I do not think that is really so.  For example, as regards sound broadcasting.  I think this would probably initially be proposed as a trial; everything we say here would be recorded and then it would be edited in RTE, very much as they edit the transcript of our statements here already.  We have not found them at fault in their editing of that and I see no reason why they should be at fault in the editing of what we say live.  If there are fears, it could be introduced for an experimental period of, say, one year and there could be a small committee of the House to keep the operation under review to see how it worked, if people feel nervous about it.  I do not think on balance there is really a problem any more than there is in the Press reports of the Dáil.  Then there is the problem of would the broadcasting of our proceedings affect the proceedings themselves.  I suppose it would, but not necessarily in a negative way.  It might lead to a greater interest reciprocally by both the Deputies and the public in what was happening.  There was a suggestion that speakers might become histrionic in order to catch the ear of the media.  I think they would probably find that that would not pay very well because I do not think the media work that way. I think people would get more response to a reasoned speech dealing with the subject.  I think that would be the evolution.  At any rate there is no need to assume in advance that it would not. I have discussed this with people in other countries, with people in Denmark, for example, where they are in the habit of having this and, according to them, after a while people simply forget about it: they take it for granted just as we take the presence of the Press for granted.  We are, of course, aware that the Press are there and we are also aware that our statements may or not be reported in the morning; it does have some effect on us and so <Col N="891" /> would broadcasting, but I do not think it would be necessarily an unhealthy effect.</P>
    <P>A number of criticisms have been made of RTE's programming and so on.  I do not think it is necessary for me to go into those in the sense that detailed questions of programming are for RTE itself.  The members of the new authority and the director-general of RTE will certainly take into consideration the remarks that have been made here.</P>
    <P>I would like to say something about section 31.  I have said we will be removing section 31 but I also made it clear in my opening statement that we do not intend just to throw out section 31 and leave the situation to float.  I said, at column 878, Volume 265, of the Official Report of 10th May:</P>
    <P>The autonomy I have in mind for the authority is not anything anarchic or arbitrary but a freedom defined and limited by clearly specified law.  Instead of the incalculable and unpredictable varieties of possible responsibility placed on an authority by the existing section 31 subsection (1), the new legislation would provide explicit definition of the responsibilities of the authority. I am in consultation with the Attorney General as to how best the responsibilities of the authority can be defined in relation to, for example, the activities of illegal organisations, in such a way as to protect the legitimate functions of RTE in relation to news gathering, analysis and discussion&mdash;all very important functions&mdash;while protecting the paramount interest of the community in peace and the observation of law.</P>
    <P>Various issues arise here.  In so far as the intent of section 31 is to give power to ensure that RTE is not used to advertise, glamourise, <i>et cetera</i>, the IRA, this purpose will be safeguarded in the legislation specifically.  Of course, section 31, as we all know, but not everybody who talks about it outside knows, says nothing whatever about the IRA and if we had a Government, headed perhaps by Deputy <Col N="892" /> Blaney, the powers under section 31 could be used to compel RTE to treat the &ldquo;heroes&rdquo; of the republican army with appropriate respect.  A directive of that kind could go out.  It is conceivable. So section 31 is no safeguard for anything.  On the contrary, it can introduce any form of arbitrary intervention whatever.  I grant that the Minister's directive did deal with that but we want to cut out the arbitrary element in this.  It is not a question of, even in a sense, giving greater freedom; it is a question of saying where the limits are so that everybody knows where the limits are.</P>
    <P>I referred in a statement to the Irish Transport and General Workers Union to the idea of setting up an appeals tribunal and I am sorry that I did not have an opportunity of saying this first here because inevitably, and through no fault of the Deputies opposite, discussion about it was somewhat confused.  I did not have the appeals tribunal in mind as a kind of substitute for section 31 as some people suggested.  What I had in mind was that section 18 of the Act puts certain responsibilities on to the authority, responsibilities for preserving impartiality.  Who is to be the ultimate judge of the impartiality?  I have found under the previous Government the Minister, as the final judge, ruled in relation to a post office dispute, a dispute affecting Lettermore Post Office. He applied pressure to RTE&mdash;I can quote chapter and verse and will&mdash;to induce them to present that dispute in what he regarded as a balanced way. He may even have been right.  RTE may have been quite wrong about Lettermore and the Minister may have been dead right.  It is quite possible. I have not investigated the merits of the particular dispute.  What is quite certain is that the Minister was a party to that dispute and as a party he ruled on what constituted impartiality.  With due respect to Deputy Collins that is not a power he should have. He was tempted to abuse it.  He did abuse it.  I might have attempted to abuse it too if I become hot about the collar about a post office dispute and saw something which I regarded as shocking on RTE.  I might <Col N="893" /> reach for my big stick.  I hope I would go out and take a walk and cool down a bit.  I might but I should not have that power.  If I can be party I should not be arbiter.  I think this is basic.</P>
    <P>Similarly, the Minister told RTE that they should not have on television a given Opposition Deputy who happens to be your humble servant, the present Minister.  Again, he may have been right in a sense that that Deputy, whom I can look at now in a certain perspective as an Opposition Deputy, went on television and had three long programmes.  He went on as a literary man but the cloven hoof of the politician showed and Deputy Collins was irritated.  I might have been irritated too if the roles had been reversed but the Minister should not have the power to say to RTE what is the balanced and impartial degree of coverage you can allow Opposition Deputies to have.  That is wrong.  It is open to abuse.</P>
    <P>I am not about to say that the two particular interventions are even all that bad.  I am much more concerned with the power that exists and the power that can be abused and with, it seems to me, the necessity to have in this area a balance, not about violence, to have an appeals tribunal.  As regards the use of the air waves for the encouragement, if it should happen, of political violence and the overthrow of the State <i>et cetera</i>, ultimate power must rest with this Parliament and with the Government responsible to this Parliament.  I am not seeking to duck out of that responsibility.  I want that built into the Act and I want it to be solidly there but I do not want to be tempted the next time there is a row about a sub-post office to wave the big sticks of sections 6 and 31 over the heads of RTE and to have them left in the position where their judge is the man who is accusing them because that has been the case.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley, who was a little cross, attacked me, and he praised Deputy Collins for his handling of these matters.  However, when the two gentlemen were in office Deputy O'Malley wrote to Deputy Collins in quite severe and critical terms about RTE &ldquo;getting away with murder&rdquo;. <Col N="894" /> Deputy Collins wrote back to Deputy O'Malley a very interesting letter which I wish to put on record, not only for its historical interest although we are not primarily concerned with history here, but as an illustration of the kind of difficulties that are involved here. It is a very interesting letter in more ways than one.</P>
    <P>This letter, dated 17th July, 1970, from Deputy Collins, then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, to Deputy O'Malley, his colleague and then Minister for Justice is a reply to one written to him by the Minister for Justice. I do not propose to read out the letter of the Minister for Justice because it is rather long and it does not bear so crisply&mdash;it is not if I may say so, so well written&mdash;on the matters we are concerned with here.</P>

      <P>If we are to have a vote on this matter tonight, something which I think is very desirable, the Deputy and his party did not leave me very much time to reply.  If I had had the two hours which I really needed to reply I could have dealt with many matters which I am now going to have to skip over very lightly. I could also have read out Deputy O'Malley's letters to the Deputy's heart's content.  Deputy Collins's letter runs:</P>
      <P Just="Right">14 Iúil, 1970.</P>
      <P>Dear Minister,</P>
      <P>Thank you for your letter of 13th July about RTE.  I am in general agreement with much of what you say.  You can rest assured that so far as my powers enable me to do so, I shall see to it that a proper balance is maintained in programme presentation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="895" /> Your letter raises two main issues which are really separate, (i) the IRA and (ii) Left-wing bias in RTE.</P>
    <P>That was an issue raised by Deputy O'Malley.  I do not know what Deputy O'Malley means by &ldquo;left wing&rdquo;. Whether that includes the Labour Party or not I am not aware.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter goes on :</P>
      <P>As regards the IRA and its various splinter groups, I agree entirely there must be no glamourisation of them or of figures identified m the public mind with these illegal movements. Mistakes have undoubtedly been made by RTE in this matter in the past; I shall do my best to see that they don't recur.  I note that almost all the events you complain of occurred a considerable time ago.</P>
      <P>On this subject, however, I feel bound to point out that in the past year or two the newspapers appear to have been tacitly released from the obligation not to refer to the IRA by name and there have been innumerable instances of their giving generous and favourable publicity to the IRA.  Less than two weeks ago (on 7th July) the <i>Irish Times</i> published an extensive report-far longer and more comprehensive than RTE would have given-of a statement by the &lsquo;IRA council in Dublin&rdquo; with a photograph of Mr. Cathal Goulding, &ldquo;Chief of staff of the IRA speaking at a press conference held in Dublin yesterday by the Army Council of the IRA&rdquo;.  Any foreigner reading this article would assume that the IRA was a legitimate recognised army in the State and many of our fellow citizens must be feeling that it has Government blessing as well as toleration.</P>
      <P>&mdash;these are Deputy's Collins's words&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been pictures of an IRA group marching with arms. There have even been statements from the Saor Eire Group in connection <Col N="896" /> with the murder of Garda Fallon.</P>
    <P>I don't know what the Department of Justice has done about all these matters, but until the situation which has been allowed to develop is changed, RTE cannot reasonably be forbidden to publish news items about the IRA which the newspapers&mdash;their competitors freely publish.  These matters are news and it would be absurd of RTE to draw a veil over them while the newspapers flaunt them.</P>
    <P>So, what RTE will be required to do&mdash;and I am sure the Authority will be very willing to do it&mdash;is to report facts on the subject in a &ldquo;play-down&rdquo; way and to avoid so far as possible making the illegal organisations sound attractive or appealing to the impressionable.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;then there occurs in this letter a memorable sentence from one Cabinet Minister to another&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>When the Department of Justice decides to enforce the law in regard to the IRA and its satellites, I shall be happy to deal further with the problem so far as RTE is concerned.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;That is not a statement addressed by one Minister in a loose coalition to another.  It is by one Minister in the last Government to another.  The letter continues:</P>
    <P>So far as Left-wing bias is concerned it is necessary to move with some care.  I am in no doubt that the Left-wing and even some pretty extreme elements of it have a good footing in RTE but it would be very easy in attempting to deal with that situation to do a lot more harm than good.  It is perfectly natural that a new exciting service such as RTE would attract very many young people to its staff and without considering the possibility of deliberate infiltration by hard line communists, the probability in present day circumstances is that a great number of these young people will be of Left-wing sympathies. There can be no question of eliminating these influences in RTE but what we can and will do is ensure to the utmost extent possible <Col N="897" /> that they will not be able by their influence to bring about the presentation of programmes biased in favour of their views. The Radio Éireann Authority has a statutory obligation to ensure that matters of public controversy are presented objectively and impartially. There can be little doubt that breaches of this requirement will occur from time to time but I intend to leave the Authority in no doubt of the absolute need to enforce the rule as fully and efficiently as is possible.  If prejudiced and unbalanced presentation does occur I shall certainly take it up with the Authority very firmly.</P>
    <P>You will appreciate that I don't have much time available for watching television programmes and I can of course deal only with what I see or receive authoritative reports about.  Accordingly, if any programmes come to your notice which you feel are condoning illegality, I shall be glad if you will bring them to my notice.  I will give any such complaints, made promptly, my immediate attention.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Gerard Collins.</P>
    <P>Deputies will see in that the Minister's conception that he is the judge of balance and that he will tell RTE what is balanced presentation and what is not.  I feel I have indicated, reasonably well, what the problems in the whole matter are.  My conception is to leave the RTE Authority alone as far as possible, to reserve to the State certain powers including the possibility of the removal by the Oireachtas of the authority on stated grounds, but to move the Minister more into the background and, above all, to deprive him of this objectionable power of deciding what balance is.</P>
    <P>I have to refer briefly to what was, perhaps, the most heated part of the debate.  This was the charge made by Deputy Colley that the Government permitted, and almost certainly demanded, the broadcasting of the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis.  In fact, the Government did nothing about it.  Permitted it, yes, in the sense that the Government did not interfere.  When I heard <Col N="898" /> that RTE was broadcasting the Ard-Fheis I did not take up the telephone and tell RTE not to broadcast the Ard-Fheis or I would send them a directive or fire them under section 6.  I did not do any of those things.  I did nothing at all and I can assure the Deputies opposite that if the news had been that the RTE Authority was committed to broadcasting the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis I would have done nothing. Nothing is also what a wiser Minister than I would have done.</P>

      <P>Deputy Colley used the words &ldquo;permitted and almost certainly demanded&rdquo;.  The Government flatly and categorically deny that they demanded, or even asked for, this coverage.  Deputies opposite accept this in. their hearts.  One or two of them explicitly did accept it.  Deputy Joe Dowling accepted that assurance from me.  I think Deputy Colley knows that the Government did not demand it and that there was no warrant whatever for his words that the Government &ldquo;almost certainly demanded it&rdquo;. In fact, Deputy Colley allowed those words to fade away but he never had the manliness to withdraw them. He never said that he accepted my word that the Government did not demand this coverage but I object to the use of &ldquo;permitted&rdquo;.  He has a right to <Col N="899" /> make what he likes of our permitting but having made a charge like that, and being unable to produce a fibre of evidence in support of it, and then not to withdraw it, is unworthy of a front bench Member of this House.</P>

      <P>I think we will leave that to the drafting stage.  I have not yet considered this fully but my inclination would be to give the tribunal, which would be purely an umpire on disputed questions of balance, a certain tenure and to leave them undisturbed within that tenure.  As I tried to make clear earlier, the tribunal would have no function in the direct area of violence although one can imagine a certain amount of grey area in this respect.  Supposing there was a general election in which Sinn Féin were putting forward candidates and should that party say that their candidates were not being given sufficient coverage, that question could go reasonably to the appeals tribunal but if the candidates concerned were advocating force and violence or the overthrow of the State, then it would fall under those conditions and would not be allowed.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the dilemma of Deputies in commenting on this because it was not made sufficiently clear before but I am glad to have this opportunity of making it clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the brief time remaining to me this evening I shall try to answer a few points that were raised in relation to the postal services.  Deputy Brugha referred to the need for the extension of the postal services in expanding urban areas.  Particular attention is being paid to this matter at present. There can be difficulties in maintaining <Col N="900" /> a consistently high standard of service in areas that are expanding very rapidly but every effort in this regard is being made and will continue to be made.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies paid tribute to the postal service as distinct from the unfortunate telephone service.  I would like to make it clear that, as is in the minds of Deputies and of the public generally, this is not a matter of our having good staff in the postal service and bad staff in the telephone service. The difficulty in relation to the telephone service is structural and arises from causes which I had an opportunity of considering earlier in this debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey asked whether there was a development unit considering the possibility of providing new postal and remittance services and in improving existing services.  Ths queston is under review and we are trying increasingly to enlist-indeed, we are enlisting successfully-the advice and co-operative effort of the various recognised trade unions that are connected with the Post Office and we are drawing these into consultation with other Departments in areas where there is an overlap between the work of the Post Office and that of another Department.  For example, I set up recently an interview between officials of the Postmasters' Union and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Social Welfare for the purpose of considering efforts in the area of simplifying the social welfare work of the Department to the benefit both of the Post Office and the general public.  Some constructive ideas are coming out of that.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer also to the question of a Post Office users' council which was recommended by the National Prices Commission in their Occasional Paper, No. 6.  I have decided that this council is to be set up and my Department are now investigating and will shortly report to me on the best way in which to implement the proposal for this Post Office users' council.</P>
    <P>I am expecting also the report of a departmental committee established by my predecessor with very wide terms of reference to consider the structure, <i>et cetera,</i> of this postal service, including the counter service.: The committee's <Col N="901" /> final report is expected later this year.</P>
    <P>Some Donegal Deputies referred, sometimes rather sharply, to the question of postal deliveries in Donegal. Of course, deliveries there have been affected by the existing situation in Northern Ireland.  However, the Deputies have tabled questions on this matter and I shall be replying to these very shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan referred to delays in the delivery of mail from Dublin to the provinces.  He thought that the cause for this lay in the Dublin Central Sorting Office.  In general the Post Office postal service is organised to ensure the due course, despatch and delivery of mail but the Deputy will appreciate that circumstances can arise&mdash;for example, because of unusual pressure of traffic or staff absences-in which a small proportion of mail is delayed.  These are unusual happenings.</P>
    <P>There were references to the philatelic services of the Department. Shortly we will have a display device at the Post Office in connection with this but I have been looking at the matter and it is my opinion that we could, with profit, and I mean that literally, put more effort into the promotion and merchandising of Irish stamps&mdash;areas to which I am sure my predecessor gave considerable attention.  Other countries in general make a good deal more commercial revenue in this field than we have been making and so far as I understand, this is in part due to a failure to furnish adequately attractive promotional material and is in part a question of timing in that the trade in other countries is not given adequate advance notice of our commemorative issue and that consequently, the advance demand is not built up.  If we can handle this matter satisfactorily, it could build up into a source of much-needed extra revenue for the Department.</P>
    <P>There were some other matters raised in connection with the telephone service.  For instance, there was the question of kiosks.  Of course, this question absorbs a greater proportion of the time of the Dáil than, perhaps, any other matter relating to the Department. More kiosks will be provided in <Col N="902" /> rural areas in the year 1973-74 than were provided last year: 250 are planned, including 200 in rural areas. Last year the figure was 199, including 182 in rural areas.  The increase is small but is, I think, welcome enough. Kiosks are provided in replacement of call offices at sub-post offices which are used to a fair extent even though a kiosk may not be fully self-supporting. The Department are reluctant to suggest to local authorities that they should subsidise telephone kiosks. Some local authorities have not taken kindly to such suggestions in the past. However, it is the practice to point out to a local authority that are pressing strongly for the provision of an uneconomic kiosk that there is a guarantee arrangement available to them.  A number of them have availed of this facility.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies referred to vandalism affecting telephone kiosks.  This problem is particularly heavy and unpleasant in the Dublin area but other cities have similar problems.  Kiosks in the Dublin centre city area and in other areas where vandalism is particularly prevalent, are inspected daily by maintenance staff from Monday to Friday.  Some are also inspected again at night and on Saturdays. Various measures have been taken to combat vandalism, although this is quite a difficult matter as Deputies know, and further measures are being considered, the most important of which is the proposed introduction of a stronger type coin box.  A new type coin box with a solid steel casing has been designed by our own staff and has been given a field trial in a number of areas where vandalism is most prevalent.  The result of these tests have been encouraging and arrangements are being made to have a substantial number of these special coin boxes manufactured.  As a further defence against vandals these coin boxes will be equipped with specially reinforced hand sets and cords.  This type of installation has proved quite satisfactory in other countries in combating vandalism and there is no reason to doubt that it will be equally effective here.</P>
    <P>The number of staff at present engaged on kiosk maintenance is <Col N="903" /> regarded as the maximum that can be made available from existing resources without detriment to other services.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, particularly in Dublin and other cities, very considerable problems in providing telephones quickly enough in new housing estates.  All Dublin Deputies are well aware of that problem.  The problem is that extensive underground cabling is necessary.  Several Deputies have referred. of course with approval, to the fact that the cables do now go underground. It is not possible to carry out this cabling until the position of roads and footpaths has been clearly defined. So, there is a time lag here as in much else in telephone development.</P>
    <P>A certain measure of priority is given to the provision of kiosks in extensive new housing areas where it is not practicable to provide telephones freely.  This was given, for example, in the Tallaght area.</P>
    <P>Again, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I should like to say that I regret the fact that, as we are to take a vote tonight on this Estimate-which we feel, I believe, we should-1 have not covered as fully as I would have liked the whole range of subjects opened up in what was quite a long and useful debate. But all the suggestions that were made here-and there were a great many suggestions, many of them very constructive-will certainly be taken into <Col N="904" /> account. Finally, on the greatest problem facing the Post Office, the effective development of the telephone service through a continuously and adequately expanding capital programme, that whole matter is one that we will have an opportunity to debate in a concentrated way, that is, by itself, later in this year when I shall be introducing the Telephone Capital Bill.</P>

    <Title>Committee On Finance. - Adjournment Debate: Bantry Bay Oil Spillage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I asked to have this question raised on the Adjournment was because it is a matter of special and immediate importance to the people living in the Glengarriff area.  I think the most important function that can be performed here tonight is to induce the Minister to instigate an immediate investigation under his Department to ascertain the source of the spillage.  This is not the first spillage in Bantry Bay and it is important that definite and positive action be taken immediately because if this type of spillage continues we shall have an orgy of destruction involving both marine life and the amenities in the area.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister has read in the newspaper that the beaches and coves in the Glengarriff area are very badly affected and local people say that this has been the worst spillage in the history of spillages in Bantry Bay.  One could try to blame various people but I shall not do that because I have not sufficient facts at my disposal to lay the blame at anybody's door.  We always come up against the problem in a developing area of the delicate balance between employment and conservation and it is important that we as legislators, together with the industrialists, should endeavour to build all pollution control methods into all our planning, physical and economic; in other words, ensure the rational exploitation of our resources. We all want growth but growth which is needless and not good for the area is of no advantage.  I would describe it as luxurious and frivolous growth. We must also reject false measurements of mere quantity and boldly learn to measure the good against the needless and the bad.  This demands constant vigilance by whatever group are responsible for this monitoring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="907" /> We, as Members of this Parliament, have a common and vital interest in maintaining unpolluted oceans, living inland waters and an unimpaired atmosphere.  We should strive for a sound ecological balance.  Every Member, I think, is aware of the present stale of affairs in the Mediterranean which is entirely due to the pollution of that sea by oil.  It is time that we earnestly tackled the business of locating the source, not only of the present spillage in Bantry Bay but of other spillages that have occurred there from time to time and of ensuring that never again will these outrages be repeated.</P>
    <P>I think it should be also mandatory that purification equipment be installed in all industrial enterprises in such sensitive areas as Glengarriff and Bantry.  I know you cannot compare this type of spillage with the disaster of the <i>Torrey Canyon</i>; yet small spills cause more pollution in the aggregate than major ones.  Our long coastline along which a huge tonnage of ships sails every year is very important to us both from the tourist point of view and the industrial point of view.  Oil pollution of Irish waters could become a major threat to our economy, to fish and bird life in the area.</P>
    <P>When we talk of the oil spillage that has occurred in the Glengarriff area we are talking of the area of highest amenity where there is what could reasonably be described, I suppose, as the most important sub-tropical garden in the world, an area on Garnish Island where 60,000 tourists visit every year, an area where the rarest plants and flowers can be seen.  We must also consider the number of people who are getting gainful employment through being involved in the tourist business in the Glengarriff area.  Their livelihood could very well be put in jeopardy if we are not vigilant and pretty severe in this House in dealing with the people causing this pollution.  Glengarriff is unique in its tropical climate, its rare shrubs and trees and its continuing emphasis on the tourist industry. People there depend mainly on tourists coming into the area for their livelihood and not only are they <Col N="908" /> affected but a considerable number of fishermen are also involved.</P>
    <P>In today's <i>Irish Times</i> I read of a cleaning operation where detergents were being spread on the oil by high-powered fire-fighting equipment.  We do not need to be chemical experts to realise that the use of these highly potent detergents on oil can cause very serious pollution of marine life.  In some cases, in fact, marine life has become extinct because of the use of these detergents.  I am not absolutely convinced that we are relieving the situation in any way by pouring on detergents.</P>
    <P>I think it was Hemingway who said that a continent ages quickly once we come&mdash;he was talking about Africa&mdash; and where you have development you have a certain amount of ageing and a certain amount of destruction.  I should be the last to say that we should not have industrial development in that area or deprive the people there of gainful employment; they would be far better if employed there than if they had to emigrate to Coventry, London or Birmingham to make a living. Yet, we cannot have development at any cost.  We must be very conscious of the fact that we have relatively unpolluted water in the seas around us and we must preserve that. This is a very important heritage and it would be very remiss of us if we did not ensure that it was passed on just as pure as when we got it.</P>
    <P>I spoke about the Mediterranean Sea: it could more aptly be called the Dead Sea because there is absolutely no vitality in that sea.  The vitality of any sea is measured by the amount of life in it and if this vitality is killed by the use of this type of detergent on the oils, it is the fishermen who are going to suffer and suffer considerably.</P>
    <P>I was trying to work out how this could have occurred and I was going back over some articles in magazines and books, and I find that 30 years ago British shipbuilders agreed that they would not dump any petrol product less than 50 miles from the coast and other countries in Europe followed suit, but these measures proved ineffectual because marine currents carried <Col N="909" /> them back again to the coast, even though they were deposited far out to sea, and also because of the extension of the oil business.  After the second world war, pollution of the sea reached a point which caused international concern.  Most of these products came from oil tankers transporting crude oil.  After the contents are discharged, the tankers are loaded with water to serve as ballast but they still contain oil products which mix with the water and are eventually cast into the sea when the tankers are emptied of the water.  Even after this a sticky mass remains in the cargo tanks.  It solidifies and cannot be emptied when the cargo is discharged.  The sludge which fills tanks and obstructs pipes has to be treated with steam and hot water under pressure to liquify it and it is then poured into the sea.</P>
    <P>A further source of pollution is water from various leaks which become charged with grease, oil and fuels before being dumped into the sea and I think that our legislation is not severe enough on the type of operation I have described, namely, the emptying of the ballast.  This is the operation that causes the thick, tar-like substance which we sometimes see on the seashore. Not alone is this destructive but it is also most foul and evil-smelling and causes considerable annoyance to the people who have to come in contact with it so that we here should be endeavouring to ensure that we do everything possible to make it as costly as we can, to make the penalties as severe as we can, to ensure that people do not take these sorts of liberties.</P>
    <P>I know that in the best organised circles accidents will occur.  In this particular case it is alleged that there were 150 gallons spilled on the sea but my information from the locals is that it would seem to be much more.  This would be considered minor enough if it occurred in an ordinary area, but of course, as we all know, Glengarriff and Garnish Island are not ordinary areas. I have already pointed out that we must ensure that especially in these high amenity areas no mistake is allowed to occur and that the penalties following such mistakes are so vast as to ensure that human error does not even come into it. <Col N="910" /> We have as well the plight of some of our fishermen when they go out fishing-and this is not confined to the results of spillage in Bantry Bay; it affects more than Bantry Bay and can affect 30 or 40 miles of coastlineand find their nets completely spoiled and made useless because tar and solidified oil gets into them and rots them. As you can appreciate, we have a two-fold attack here.  We have an attack on the tourist business and an attack on the livelihood of fishermen in the area because of somebody's carelessness.  How can we here honestly pass vast sums of money for ecology purposes, for conservation and preservation, if we are not going to appoint an inspectorate which will be constantly vigilant and constantly monitoring these sensitive areas? I do not know what the cost involved would be and I do not know even how this type of operation would be conducted.  All I know is that we must with all due haste get going on this because if we do not, we will find ourselves in the position of having a few minor spillages every week, with maybe the odd major one.  This cannot go on for an indefinite period so we must ask the Minister now to call a halt to this type of operation to ensure that we do not have any recurrence of what happened in Bantry last week, to ensure that these visitors we have coming here can see Ireland as we would like them to see it and not have our beaches and our rocks and our seas covered with this desperate-looking tar-like substance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure that every Deputy is as concerned as Deputy Crowley is, and I feel that he is very concerned, about this matter and would be anxious to ensure that a <Col N="911" /> recurrence of it will not be possible, but when the matter was brought to my notice yesterday, first by Deputy Michael Pat Murphy, I took it up with my Department and found that an official had already contacted Cork County Council on the matter.  Subsequently, Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Crowley spoke to me about it and I advised that they should contact Cork County Council also because I felt that the main responsibility for dealing with the problem was there. The county council are responsible for the clearance of oil pollution in its area and they were asked to ensure that the necessary steps were taken to deal with the oil spill.  We are awaiting a full report from the council and pending the receipt of this report, I have not got complete information but I have been informed that the amount of oil in the Glengarriff area was about 100 gallons&mdash;I do not know how one measures this sort of thing&mdash;and that the total length of shoreline affected was somewhat less than 100 yards. There was also slight evidence of oil at Garnish Island.  The source of the spillage has not been determined as yet, but the management at the Gulf Oil Terminal have undertaken cleaning-up operations.  I should like to tell Deputy Crowley that as far as I know mainly peat moss is being used to clear the oil.</P>

      <P>It is being used on the beaches and the rocks, but not on the sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The work is being carried out under the supervision of a marine biologist.  Every care will be taken to ensure that as little damage as possible will be caused to marine life there.  I might add that the county council offered assistance in carrying out the work but this was not required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The making of arrangements on a general level for clearance of oil pollution is receiving urgent attention in my Department.  Maritime local authorities are, at my request, at present engaged in the preparation of contingency plans and the purchase of the necessary dispersant and equipment. It is only fair to say that on <Col N="912" /> 8th January, 1971, and 12th November, 1972, my predecessor sent circulars to local authorities requesting that all the necessary arrangements be made to prepare for this sort of thing.  Detailed advice was given to local authorities on this, and on such aspects as co-operation with harbour authorities and neighbouring local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to talk about pollution and to tell local authorities to take steps to clear up oil, but it is another thing to pay the cost.  On 12th of this month I announced details of the State subsidy payable to local authorities for oil clearance work under which the State will meet a very substantial part of the cost. Under these arrangements the cost will be shared by the State and local authorities on a fifty-fifty basis, subject to a limit on local authority expenditure of a sum equal to the produce of 2½ in the £ on the rates in any year.  Any expenditure by local authorities over this limit will rank for 100 per cent State subsidy.</P>
    <P>I should also like to mention that last week my Department held a conference for local authority oil pollution officers at which lectures were given by a number of British and Irish experts on developments in the field of oil pollution clearance. Representatives of the Cork County Council and Gulf Oil, who, as I have already said, are clearing up the oil spill, were present at this conference. I was particularly interested in the conference and in seeing that all appropriate persons were fully alive to the dangers involved.  I took the opportunity myself to meet these experts and address the delegates.</P>
    <P>In the course of my address I asked local authorities to make a special effort to keep the beaches to which the public have access free from oil during the summer months as even small amounts of oil can seriously limit enjoyment of these amenities.  Beaches should be inspected regularly and any oil which may be found removed.  The cost of such work will, of course, qualify for subsidy.  While the threat of oil pollution is a serious one I am satisfied <Col N="913" /> that reasonable preparations are being made by local authorities, with the co-operation of harbour authorities and other bodies, to deal with the effects of oil spillages.</P>
    <P>I do not know what caused this oil spillage and I should not like to hazard a guess.  It has been said that it appears to be engine oil.  It also appears to have come from the land rather than from the sea, which would suggest some source other than spillage from a boat or a washing out such as was referred to by Deputy Crowley, and of which I am only too well aware.  I live on the sea coast, on a shipping line and, until the authorities got tough some years ago with the ship owners, it was quite a common occurrence for them to come out of the port and to wash out just outside the bar.  Even if small amounts of that oil spillage were washed on to the coast several miles of coast would be damaged by that relatively small amount of oil.  It turned into a sticky tarry substance and, if a family on holidays sat down on the beach and got some of this substance on them, in their minds it spread along the whole length of the beach, and they talked to everybody they met about it with the result that it appeared to be a far bigger problem than it really was.  Because of the actions of the Department of Local Government under my predecessor and I hope under myself, this matter is being tackled in the only way in which they know it can be tackled.</P>
    <P>This is not a matter on which any of us can disagree.  It must be dealt with.  If it is found that people have deliberately soiled this or any other beach the strongest possible measures must be taken against them.  I am aware that occasionally people use dumps near the sea or near a river for the purpose of emptying used oil.  I have seen two tankersful of such oil being spilled into a dump.  It was subsequently <Col N="914" /> washed into a river and carried out to the sea.  It was then carried back on to the beach and spoiled the beach.  The owners of the trucks concerned were not aware that this was being done.  People were being paid to take away the crude oil and they used what they thought was a convenient way of disposing of it.  The necessary action was taken and it did not happen again.</P>
    <P>If I possibly can I propose, through Cork County Council, to find out exactly what happened in this case.  I will let Deputy Crowley and the other Deputies from the constituency have any information I get and, if somebody is culpable, I will ask to have the necessary steps taken to ensure that he will not take a chance like that again.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I should like to emphasise that not much of oil spillage on beaches which occurs at present is caused by somebody who deliberately wants to spoil the beach.  It is very often caused by carelessness, or through an accident.  I am not sure what happened in this case.  It is regrettable that it should have happened in a particularly beautiful spot like this one. I am hoping that there will not be a recurrence of it.  My Department are prepared to do everything we can and I am quite sure that every Deputy in the House will assist in preventing any further pollution which can possibly be prevented.</P>
