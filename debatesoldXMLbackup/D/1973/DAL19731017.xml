      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will give details of the co-operation which exists between the peacekeeping forces of the State and the security forces in the Six Counties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is normal practice for one police force to assist another in the investigation of serious crime and in the prosecution of criminal offences but, for obvious reasons, I am not prepared to disclose details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Taoiseach in his reply deals only with the matter of serious criminal offences, the purpose of the question, as I have no doubt the Taoiseach will have recognised, was to elicit information as to whether there is co-operation and collaboration between the forces on both sides of the Border in regard to political offences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if, in fact, the co-operation and the collaboration that now exist are new departures in our relationship with the occupation forces of part of our country, changes that have taken place recently and under this Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Taoiseach if he is aware that, contrary to past procedure, members of our peacekeeping forces are, in fact, being used by the occupation forces in the Six Counties on identification parades to identify political offenders in order that they may be prosecuted and put into concentration camps at Long Kesh.  Is the Taoiseach aware of this?  Is it common practice or is it a new procedure?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach the policy of the Government with regard to the crossing of the Border by foreign troops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government would regard as unacceptable any unauthorised crossing of the Border by foreign troops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach if there would be circumstances in which a crossing of our Border by foreign troops would be authorised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a hypothetical question.  I am not prepared to answer hypothetical questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask if the recent statement by the Minister for Defence as to the circumstances in which foreign troops did cross our Border is Government policy; if there are circumstances in which we will ask and allow these people in without let or hindrance and in that way throw away whatever sovereignty we have or claim to have?  Is that Government policy now?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been no change in our attitude in this regard and any unauthorised crossing of the Border is not acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking what is authorised.  I am talking about the authorised crossings&mdash;crossings which were mentioned by the Minister for Defence&mdash;where helicopters might hover five feet or five yards from the ground.  We have heard this but I do <Col N="4" /> not know if it is true.  It is a most disturbing feature&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is indulging in long statements and arguments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Taoiseach to allay any fears that may have arisen as a result of a reported recent statement by the Minister for Defence. Can we have an assurance from the Taoiseach that no foreign troops are allowed over our Border in any circumstances, that there is no such authorisation, that there will not be and that there has not been such authorisation?  Can we have that assurance from the Taoiseach because this would allay all fears?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither the Deputy nor anybody else need suffer from any fears or disturbance about this.  The practice of allowing aircraft from another country to cross the territory is one that has existed for a long time and permission has to be given in each case.  There has been no change in that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Taoiseach's effort to allay fears in talking about authorisation of aircraft crossing our Border.  I am talking about military craft, military vehicles and personnel crossing our Border which would seem to be condoned by a reported statement by the Minister for Defence recently.  Was the Minister reported correctly and, if reported correctly, is this the case?  May they cross the Border and do the Government propose to allow them to cross? I am talking about military personnel on a military mission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said the only occasions on which aircraft are allowed to cross a border by any country is when permission is sought. There has been no change in that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the British Prime Minister at any time during the meeting of 17th September, 1973, raised the possibility of the complete integration of the Six Counties of Northern Ireland with Britain; if so, whether he pointed out <Col N="5" /> to Mr. Heath the grave consequences of such a development; if Mr. Heath did not raise the matter at that meeting, whether the gravity of such a course was raised with the British Government following Mr. Heath's public reference to it and if an assurance was sought and received that integration was not contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will make a statement on his recent talks with the British Prime Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Ceann Comhairle, I propose to take Question Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>A joint communique was issued following my meeting with the British Prime Minister on the 17th September last.  It would not be in accordance with practice to reveal other details of the discussions.  Much of the value of such meetings depends on their confidentiality.</P>
      <P>Mr. Heath's public remarks of the 17th September, 1973, on the integration of the Six Counties of Northern Ireland with Britain were superseded by his statement on the following day in which he made it clear that integration was not, in fact, envisaged.  No representations were made in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that it is implicit in the Taoiseach's reply that the matter was not raised during the course of his talks with Mr. Heath and I do not propose to press the Taoiseach further on that.  It appears that there was no official withdrawal of the suggestion that there was a possibility of integration in certain circumstances. Will the Taoiseach accept that the purpose of my putting down the question was to have this on the record of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, the remarks made by Mr. Heath on the 17th September were superseded by a statement which he made the following day when he spoke at a meeting in London.  I take it that was an official statement and one which represented the British Government's viewpoint.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That statement did not appear to be as explicit as the statement made to the Northern Ireland representative of the BBC on the evening of the 17th September. That, again, is the purpose of my putting down this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was explicit enough to those who heard it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding Question No. 4, can the Taoiseach say whether during the course of his discussions with Mr. Heath he, as Taoiseach, made it known to the British Prime Minister that we wish to have the British out of this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government have formulated proposals on the role, function and scope of the Council of Ireland; and, if so, the precise nature of the proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have approved a set of proposals as to the structure, role and function of a Council of Ireland.  It would not be appropriate, at this stage, to make public the details of those proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Government discussed also the question of the evolution of the council in view of the statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs when he said that the pace of the evolution will be dictated by the consent of the majority in Northern Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the same vein as Deputy O'Kennedy, may I ask whether <Col N="7" /> in regard to the statement of the Minister in question we are totally removed from the concept that it is the will of the majority of the entire Irish people that should be the determining factor in all these matters and not the will of the majority in the Six Counties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the council must be formed before it can evolve into anything else.  At this stage the council has not been formed but we hope that it will be formed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Taoiseach say whether the Minister for Foreign Affairs was expressing Government policy when he said that the pace of the evolution of the council would be dictated by the consent of the majority in Northern Ireland in view of the fact particularly that an evolution of executive powers in this part of Ireland would involve also a constitutional referendum?  Surely the pace of the evolution of any council would be determined by the concensus of the people of the whole country as expressed through their representatives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The pace of the evolution of the council would depend on all the members including the majority in the North as well as of the people here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that what the Taoiseach is saying is at variance with what has been said by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in regard to the pace of the evolution of the council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A council can evolve only by agreement, that is, if all the members accept its evolution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the statement made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs was misleading and unnecessary in the circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the council would, as of now, appear to be representative of the Assembly in the North and of the Oireachtas in the South and not of the Government of the South nor of <Col N="8" /> the Executive of the North only and since it would require at least the consent of the representatives of the Oireachtas who would form part of that council, would the Taoiseach say at what point he proposes to indicate to the House or to the Opposition the content of the proposals that the Government have now formulated for a Council of Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the Government of the opinion that a Council of Ireland, which does not have the security of the entire Thirty-two Counties as its prerogative, without any allegiance to any outside power, is only a gimmick?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Leader of the Opposition, in view of the different parties that are involved in the discussions which we hope will lead to the formation of a council, it is not possible at this stage to say precisely when the details will be published.  Regarding the other supplementary, it is a little early yet to comment on the precise form of what will emerge eventually.  The egg has not yet been hatched and, therefore, it would be premature to comment on the offspring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not asked the Taoiseach to comment on the appearance or the nature of the offspring. I am simply asking at what point he will make the contents of the proposals known to Dáil Éireann so that we in the Opposition who would expect to be represented on that council will be aware of what kind of council is proposed.  Further, is it likely that the parties constituting the Assembly in the North would be consulted also?  Is that not almost certain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can rest assured that at the appropriate time those interested will be consulted.</P>

      <P>In the period January/August, 1973, trade with the USSR amounted to £1.9 million imports and £0.3 million exports; in the case of the Republic of South Africa imports were £2.7 million and exports £2.3 million while the corresponding figure for trade with Chile was £0.1 million imports and £2.8 million exports.  There was no trade with Southern Rhodesia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the question is addressed to me as Minister for Health, I assume the Deputy is referring to the effect of bringing eligibility for the health and ancillary welfare services for which the Department of Health are responsible into line with what applies in Northern Ireland.  If eligibility for these services here were to be extended in this way, the additional cost to the State would probably be of the order of £30 million a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my information. A 70 bed unit will be commenced in Portrane in a matter of months.

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>A statement was made&mdash;it was not contradicted by the Department of Health&mdash;to the effect that proposals had emanated from the Eastern Health Board for the provision of proper units for these people and the Department have rejected them and said that they must look elsewhere. This report was published and it was never contradicted.  I would ask the Minister to look into this matter again.</P>

Publication of all such reports is a matter finally for decision by the Government.</P>

Doctors and chemists operating the scheme can then provide services for persons so authorised, making their claims in accordance with a special procedure.  I do not consider that there is a need for a change in the existing arrangements in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of a Press report to this effect.  However, there are no figures available to show the relative prevalence of mental illness in this country compared with that in other countries.  What the speaker probably had in mind is the number of patients in mental hospitals which is, admittedly, higher than in other countries.  This fact has been known for many years.  A conference to discuss it was called by my Department as far back as 1959 and since then efforts have continuously been made to have the numbers reduced by the development of out-patient and domiciliary services.  In 1958 the population in mental hospitals was 21,095 representing 7.38 patients per 1,000 of the population.  That number has now been reduced to 15,856, a reduction of 24.76 per cent, and represents a rate of 5.30 patients per 1,000 of the population.</P>
      <P>This significant decrease has been brought about by the development of community services and I would hope that continuing improvements in them and in the social services generally will lead to further reductions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>This estimate allowed for increased expenditure by health boards on their own hospital services and on their maternity services and the scheme of subsidies for expenditure on drugs, medicines and appliances.

A rise in expenditure under subhead K.1 of the Vote for Health to meet deficits of voluntary hospitals was also allowed for.</P>
      <P>The total of these elements, which included provision for increased remuneration, was £2.9 million.

      <P>I have consulted the Voluntary Health Insurance Board on the likely effects on the board's operations of extending eligibility for free hospital services to all sections of the community.  The board consider that, while there will be some reduction in premium payments as a result of the introduction of this service, and there may be some falling off in the number of members covered, the viability of the board's operations will not be affected.  The most pessimistic estimate by the board of the effect of the new arrangements on their business is a reduction of about one-fifth.</P>

      <P>The views of the medical organisations on the implications for them of a revision of the upper income limit for limited eligibility were obtained at a meeting on 11th June, 1973.  It was agreed at that meeting that if the Government were to decide to abolish the income limit I would see representatives of the organisations again.</P>
      <P>On 30th August, 1973, prior to the announcement of the Government's decision I met representatives of the medical organisations and informed them of the Government's decision.

I informed them that I would make a recommendation to the Government and as soon as the Government made a decision I would see them again.  I saw them on 30th August and told them of the Government decision and I referred to the matters which they had raised in the previous discussion. There was no discussion as such on the second occasion I met the doctors. The doctors said their associations would consider the Government's decision.

      <P>I understand that in the main these services are provided by funds from the local authorities, whereas when I had the privilege of having a holiday in Spain I discovered that the State provide these services there.

    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to provide for the reconstitution of An Chomhairle Ealaíon, established under the Arts Act, 1951.</P>
      <P>That Act provided that the council should consist of six ordinary members, appointed by the Government, and up to five co-opted members, and that the director, appointed by the President, should act as chairman of the council.  Under the Bill now being moved, it is proposed that the council should comprise a chairman, who will be part-time, and up to 16 other members. Under sections 4 and 12, the term of office of the present members will cease on the day before the new council come into office.</P>
      <P>By enlarging the membership in this way, I hope to ensure that the new council can be made representative of all branches of the Arts, including the visual and literary arts, drama and music, and that different areas in the country are properly represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1951 Act, the director of the council holds a part-time office, in addition to acting as chairman at meetings.  This arrangement makes great demands on the person holding the combined office and is not, in my opinion, the best way of getting the benefits of a council of this kind.  The Bill provides, therefore, for a part-time chairman appointed by the Taoiseach and for a full-time director, appointed by the council, subject to <Col N="34" /> the sanction of the Taoiseach.  The chairman will be paid such remuneration as the Taoiseach may decide, after consultation with the Minister for Finance.  He and the council will be responsible for broad policy in the ordinary way.  The director will be full-time chief executive officer responsible to the council in an advisory capacity and for the proper performance of its duties.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains in sections 6, 9 and 10, the usual provisions relating to membership of the Dáil or Seanad by members, officers and servants, and for the drawing up of a superannuation scheme for the staff of the council.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill contains a new and important provision enabling a local authority to assist the council or any group organising an exhibition or other event whose effect would be to further the aims of the council in relation to the development of the Arts. There has been criticism in the past of the concentration of artistic activities in the larger centres of population.  I would hope that this provision would stimulate interested persons and groups throughout the country to organise plays, exhibitions and other similar activities.</P>
    <P>Direct State aid to the theatre and the Arts is of the order of £500,000 in the current financial year&mdash;without counting money spent on museums, libraries, public art galleries, music, <i>et cetera</i>, and without counting the remission of taxes for income from artistic work.  The provision of more money cannot by itself remedy shortcomings in the fostering of the Arts. Often the contrary is the case and affluence can destroy the spirit of creation.  However, I do not think we need take so Spartan a view here.  I wish only to emphasise that the expenditure of more money need not necessarily result in a proportionate rise in artistic standards; indeed, it may tend to stifle what it seeks to help. For this reason, arguments about how money is to be spent by the new council may be just as important as arguments about amounts.</P>
    <P>From what I have said, Deputies will appreciate that support for the Arts exceeds the £100,000 provision appearing <Col N="35" /> opposite the name of the council in the Vote for which I am responsible. It is evident that there has been support for the practice under which aid for different branches of the Arts is paid from different Votes.  I think that a clearer view of the extent of this aid is presented if all moneys are voted together at the one time.  I also think that it would make the administration of this aid more effective if all voted subventions could be channelled to the Arts through a widely representative organisation of the type which the new council will be.  For this reason, I would hope to have considered, in consultation with the new council, the question of their administering not only the type of grant paid to the existing council but also the money, totalling almost £400,000, paid from the Vote for Miscellaneous Expenses as a grant-in-aid to the National Theatre Society Limited and in additional aid to the theatre.  At the present levels of expenditure, this would mean that the new council would have, for disbursement, approximately £500,000 a year. This change would, if implemented, be subject to reasonable savers for existing arrangements.</P>
    <P>With greater affluence and the probable shorter working week, the community is going to have greater capacity for leisure pursuits.  It is my hope that the work of the new council will guide this development in a way which will lead to an enrichment in the quality of life of all the people.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to the achievements of the last director of An Chomhairle Ealaíon and of the members of the present council who have devoted, without monetary reward, their time and effort to advancing the objectives of the council. Their work has not been carried on in ideal conditions and has often not been fully recognised.  They will have the comfort of knowing that it has ensured that a solid foundation now exists on which to base further development.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party welcome any Bill, the aim and <Col N="36" /> object of which is to promote the Arts.  We will have a close look at the Bill to see does it, in effect, do that, and are the structures there for this purpose, because outlining structures and organisations will not necessarily improve the position of the artist in our society, nor will it improve artistic standards.</P>
      <P>Looking at the Title of the 1951 Act, which this Bill purports to amend, one sees that the purpose of the original Act, and consequently of the one which amends it, is to stimulate public interest in the Arts in the first place.  Even a discussion here may do that.  Far more important, in my opinion, is the personality of the people who will be appointed director and chairman&mdash;two different people this time&mdash;of the Arts Council.</P>
      <P>In this regard I remember some years ago, having spent some time in involuntary exile, and having got around a few of the art galleries in Europe, coming back to see the National Gallery here in Dublin and seeing it as a very dowdy institution. Since then a new director was appointed and the place has been absolutely alive ever since.  It has a place in the hearts of the people not merely of Dublin but also of the provinces simply because the man who is in charge there is selling it to the people.  Admittedly, he has, through our good fortune, finances available to him which were not available previously and this enables him to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that it is important that a man in this position should have a certain outgoing personality, and should be a man who is prepared to sell what he is in charge of to the public because, after all, it is the public who own it and it is the public who have a direct interest in it and, in particular, it is the youth of the country who will benefit from such development. The purpose of the Act also was to promote the knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts.  In my opinion this is where the Department of Education come in.  This is where education in the Arts is important. There is no point in starting at the top. You must teach children to appreciate what the various Arts mean in society. <Col N="37" /> Society may achieve economic greatness but, in the end, it will be remembered for things of the spirit.</P>
    <P>In the 1951 Act there is a definition of the Arts: painting, sculpture, architecture, music, drama, literature and design in industry and the Fine Arts.  That is the range.  It is in all those fields that the incipient appreciation must be attended to in our educational system.  As part of their responsibility the council will have to think of what is going on in our schools in relation to art, knowledge of art, appreciation of art and the practice of art, where the Arts teachers will be all-important. The definition of the Arts in the original Act is comprehensive enough.  I should like pottery to be mentioned specifically so that, where patronage or money or exhibitions were concerned, pottery would not be excluded.  I presume it may be taken in under the Fine Arts generally, the phrase at the end of the descriptive passage in the 1951 Act.</P>
    <P>There are some points I should like to make apart from referring in passing to what is happening in Kilkenny, which is covered at the end of the definition in section 1 of the 1951 Act: design in industry.  I should like to emphasise something which was referred to in the Taoiseach's speech, that is, the importance of extra-Dublin activity and extra-large city activity. All the exhibitions <i>et cetera</i> tend to go to the larger centres of the population and there tends to be neglect of the lesser centres.  For that reason we welcome the reference to the powers to be given to the local authorities in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I think the local authorities have power already to buy paintings, for example, and to aid exhibitions.  I am subject to correction on that, but I think they have such power already because I remember reading of debates by local authorities on this matter some time ago.  If this is merely a reiteration of what is there already it is still worthwhile because, in general, it is a good thing if the Arts are encouraged outside the large cities.</P>
    <P>I might refer here to the encouragement in the old Act to co-operate with persons.  I have a very strong <Col N="38" /> feeling about the patronage of the Arts.  Semi-State bodies, <i>et cetera</i>, have given some patronage by way of purchasing pictures, or subsidising music festivals, or employing up-and-coming architects and so on but, taking it all in all, companies and firms have fallen down in this regard. We should appeal to them to do what they do in other countries and devote a substantial portion of their profits to the promotion of the Arts.  I believe that in some European countries&mdash;I am informed of this by a practising sculptor&mdash;it is <i>de riguer</i> that a percentage&mdash;a quarter of one per cent or 1 per cent&mdash;of profits should be devoted to the promotion of the various Arts.</P>
    <P>The provision which enables the Arts Council to accept gifts is a good one also and firms should be encouraged to make such gifts available to the council for the promotion of the Arts.</P>
    <P>In the present context it is important to keep an eye on expenditure in Europe.  For example, in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, or Galway, we could cater for some of the great European exhibitions which have been mounted with a view to emphasising the unity of Europe in the past and its growing unity at present.  Some time ago there was a question of this but because expenses were prohibitive the exhibition fell through.  I am thinking of the great Charlemagne Exhibition of a few years ago, held at Aachen which was an education in itself.</P>
    <P>Let us be blunt about this.  Money is a very important matter.  I mentioned already that James White in the National Gallery has made a wonderful job of selling the Gallery to the country, of improving rooms, and amenities where pictures are hung.  He can do this because he had a bonanza from a certain source. Spaniards have a proverb: <i>&ldquo;Don Dinero es un caballero poderoso&rdquo;.</i>&ldquo;Sir, money is a powerful gentleman&rdquo;. &ldquo;Don Dinero&rdquo; is very important and I do not see very much promise in the speech regarding the subsidy for the Arts increasing to anything like a realistic level.  Due to my inexperience this may be something <Col N="39" /> to which I should not refer here, but in the general philosophic view I take of the promotion of the Arts, it may be relevant: the chairman's term of office is not defined.  The period of years for which he will hold office is not mentioned in the Bill, nor is the term for the director mentioned. There is a tendency for a man to run out of ideas or to exercise his ideas in a special field and to favour one branch of the Arts more than another.  If he is in a very powerful position where money will be channelled through him or pictures will be purchased by him, or music festivals supported by him, or whatever his own forté is, there is a danger, if a man is too long in office that there will be an imbalance.</P>
    <P>The history of art is one of a movement starting, fighting its way, becoming an establishment, lasting a few years.  Another group then revolts, there is tension, discussion, and so on.  The new movement then becomes the establishment.  If there is no limit to the term of office for the chairman and director&mdash;I think I am right in saying that this is so&mdash; there is a danger of &ldquo;cliqueishness&rdquo;, of staleness, of dissatisfaction, due to people holding office for a long period.</P>
    <P>The appointment of the 16 members of the council will be made by the Taoiseach.  Formerly, only some were appointed by the Taoiseach and another five were co-opted.  It will be very important to select these 16 people from the full spectrum of the Arts. While it is true that the practising artists may not always be the best men or women to know what is good for the Arts in the country, and the outside view is often a good thing, nevertheless I think practising artists in all the fields should find a place on the new council. Patrons, as such, need not necessarily be the best people for such a council. We welcome the larger number because it may be easier to ensure that the various sectors are represented.  It is important that the regions be represented either on the council or by the setting up of regional councils.  It is important that the provinces be represented in the patronage, in other words, <Col N="40" /> that patronage will not confine itself to the large areas of population.  That is a double point I am making: on the council there should be representation and also the council itself should see to it that people who are practising outside the large urban areas are not neglected.</P>
    <P>It might appear, from the Taoiseach's speech, that a larger sum of money will be devoted to the Arts but what it means is that money which will be independently disbursed to the National Theatre Society, the Gate Theatre, <i>et cetera</i> will be put into one fund.  This does not necessarily mean that there will be an increase in the actual amount being spent on the Arts as at present constituted.  The Abbey money, the Gate money, and other moneys will be put together into one fund but this does not mean that the fund for the Arts, exclusive of those, will be larger.  Serious consideration should be given to a substantial increase in the amount of money given to the Arts covered by the outgoing council.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that there should be some kind of ombudsman who will hear complaints from practising artists about the activities of the council.  He would examine complaints that too much money was being expended in one particular direction to the neglect of some other particular direction, for example, the neglect of music, architecture, sculpture, pottery or painting.  I do not know what would be the legal requirement of that, but it would not be a bad idea to have someone who would be able to give an independent judgment on this type of complaint which, I can assure the Taoiseach, is made, and will be made, no matter what happens.  The usual complaint is that established painters, people who have &ldquo;made it&rdquo;, are favoured by the Arts Council whereas people who are on the way up and fighting hard do not get any such help.</P>
    <P>As I have already asked: how will the Taoiseach come to a decision as to who will be the 16 on the council? Who will he consult?  There is an onus on him to beware of cliques of one kind or another and the people in the living Arts, the RHA, and the Oireachtas <Col N="41" /> Art Committee should be consulted. The tax-free list could be examined, go through it, and perhaps even communicate with the people on it and ask them their opinion as to who should be represented on this 16-member council.  I dare say if the list made out by the Revenue Commissioners of the people who are entitled to the tax concessions were consulted, we would have an all-embracing consultation: you might not be able to come to any conclusion, but it would at least be an indication of how the people were thinking in that largish section of our art society.</P>
    <P>There are groups complaining&mdash;and I refer to an ombudsman type of person&mdash;that they are entitled to recognition and support from the Arts Council and that they are not getting it.  The Cork Film Festival is an established film festival, one of the six major ones in the world, and I would like to mention that committee as being a committee entitled to consideration for help from the council.  There is also the National Ballet Company which has an honoured place in the artistic and cultural life of the city of Cork.  The Focus and Project theatres here in Dublin are also doing a very fine job in their particular spheres, and they merit consideration from the council. Lest I be challenged on the relevancy of specific groups at this moment, I am simply mentioning these to show how important it is that the 16-member council be chosen with care and after the widest possible consultation with the people who are practising in the various artistic fields.</P>
    <P>Just flipping through the Taoiseach's speech, I want to ask a couple of questions.  The Abbey Theatre, the National Theatre Society Ltd. at the moment is getting a grant which is the equivalent of what is being provided for all the others put together, and the Gate, on top of that.  I should like to hear further about an expansion in the amount of money that will be available for the projects outside those mentioned, the Abbey and Gate Theatres, that were not catered for in the sum of money disbursed by the Arts Council before this.  Some weeks ago I was asked up to Barnhill <Col N="42" /> Gallery to open an exhibition there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>With the permission of a well-known patron of the Arts who lives in that area and who has a special interest there.  I did refer to a favourite topic of discussion with students which I have been using for years, based on Lessing's book <i>Laocoon</i> where there is a discussion as to which of the media is the most powerful used by artists: is it musical notes, words, stone, bronze, paint or oil which is the most powerful medium for expression?  It has been said by way of criticism of our civilisation that whereas we have made more than our proportional contribution to the Arts depending on the word&mdash; poetry, drama and general literature &mdash;we have been visually and aurally ignorant, that we have been behindhand very much in the sphere of music and so on.  This is a reasonably true criticism, and it is why I come back to the main aim of the 1951 Act, the stimulation of public interest in the Arts and the promotion, appreciation and practice of the Arts.  We should start with the schools&mdash;and the Arts Council has a function in this regard&mdash;and teach appreciation there. There is no point in merely enabling local authorities to aid the Arts.  They are doing that; in my own home town there was an art exhibition recently and the Arts Council helped it, I am glad to say.  There is no use in starting at the wrong end, because if the appreciation has not been picked up in schooldays by the people responsible, then they will not be willing to support and subsidise the Arts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly) John Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the Taoiseach in commending the Bill to the House, and I did not understand Deputy Wilson himself to do other than commend it.  I should like to make a few comments of a general kind on the provisions in the Bill, and I should like to comment also on a couple of topics which Deputy Wilson, quite rightly, went out of his way to raise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local authorities, up to this, had no explicit statutory power to <Col N="43" /> spend money on the kind of thing which was mentioned by Deputy Wilson.  My understanding is that the activity of local authorities, where, in fact, it appeared, in establishing and maintaining art galleries or something of the kind, was derived from a somewhat, to me, doubtful interpretation of an oblique reference in the Public Libraries (Ireland) Act, 1911.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a <i>felix culpa.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is probably a fair comment on it, but I think it is well things should be clear and beyond the necessity of taking to the county solicitor for justification.  Under section 11 of the Bill before the House the local authority is given a very neatly phrased power to provide money for the council.  It is not, of course, said in the section, but I take it to be implicit in the section that there will be a kind of bargain here whereby if a local authority provides money to the Arts Council the council will spend that money or some of it in a way conducive to the aims of the council and the desires and interest of its ratepayers and of the people within its jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>There is a case within my knowledge about which I shall not give details, as it might be an embarrassment to the county concerned and to the people concerned, but I do know of a case where a fairly large amount of money is being sought in order to provide a suitable setting for a very valuable collection and the provision of a suitable setting will cost an enormous amount of money.  The council of the county within which this possibility seems to exist is apparently without power to make any contribution towards this project, although clearly the county itself would benefit not only educationally but also economically because the thing would become an instant feature of tourist interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>How did the Municipal Gallery get built legally?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Municipal Gallery, I think, rests on a separate piece of legislation, but the ordinary acquisitions <Col N="44" /> by county councils of occasional pictures here and there throughout the country have rested in the past unless I am mistaken, on their interpretation of the Public Libraries Act, which obliquely refers to the establishment of an art gallery.  I may be wrong about that but I think it is true that so far there has not been any clear power given to a local authority to involve themselves directly in the promotion of the Arts, whether by acquiring and establishing a gallery for the use of the public or in some other way.  If this Bill becomes law, the council of the county involved will be in a position to make a contribution from the rates which they levy on the ratepayers towards the provision of a suitable setting for this collection.  That is a great advance and it will remove an anomaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach and Deputy Wilson referred to patronage.  Everyone in the House, even those with the most passing and superficial interest in the Arts, would hope that those in a position to afford patronage will do so.  I should like to draw the attention of the House to a kind of patronage other than monetary, namely the patronage implicit in the compliment of seeking advice from the council before doing something that has an aesthetic dimension.  I am afraid that due to reasons of administrative convenience or inconvenience, as the case may be, or because Ministers or the Departments did not want to have a project held up, the power contained in the Arts Act, 1951, enabling Ministers to seek advice from the council has not been made use of to any great extent. Things have been and are being done here which are aesthetically controversial. The Department concerned might have been in a stronger position to meet public criticism had they been able to say they took the advice of the Arts Council; they would have been able to point out that, although the Arts Council are not infallible, the council did not see any objection to what the Department proposed to do. An individual instance was the designing of the new decimal coinage where the council were not invited to provide any advice nor, so far as I know, was <Col N="45" /> anyone else outside the walls of the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so; there was a competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the Deputy's assurance I accept it, but it was not made public at the time notwithstanding the fact that the Deputy, when Minister, was criticised for the process by which the coins were designed.  If the Deputy states there was a competition I accept that, but I am sorry that years have passed and tempers have been lost in ignorance of that very important fact.  It is true the Arts Council were not asked about the design of the decimal coinage and they went to the length&mdash;unusual in a body of that kind&mdash;of writing to the papers specifically denying anyone had come to them for advice on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A more general instance is the position of the Minister for Local Government in his function in deciding planning appeals.  I know this is a vexed question and, no doubt, it might be said that no side is or can be perfect in this regard.  However, in a few conspicuous cases in the last ten years&mdash;for example, the demolition of the 20 Georgian houses in Lower Fitzwilliam Street and their replacement by the ESB building, or the controversy about the buildings at the junction of Hume Street and Stephen's Green&mdash;the Department of Local Government in one case, and the Office of Public Works in the other case, would have been in a stronger position if they had been able to say they had consulted the Arts Council regarding the architectural element in the problem.  I would remind the House that architecture is listed in the first section of the 1951 Act as one of the Arts.  If the Departments had been able to say the Arts Council had told them they were doing the right thing, that would have been an appropriate and dignified way of meeting the criticisms of the various voluntary bodies.  It was a pity the Departments and Ministers concerned did not think fit to equip themselves with reasonable and respectable arguments rather than <Col N="46" /> merely abuse those who criticised them as being trouble-makers, belted earls and so on.</P>
    <P>There are many spheres in which a Minister or a Government may become involved in doing something at some remove which has an aesthetic dimension, which will make the country more pleasant to look at; there is the provision of road signs, street signs and so on.  I recognise that many of these matters are functions of the local authority but there are many ways in which it is possible for a Minister to make the country more ugly and I am afraid that in the past Ministers, acting through their Departments, have done this.  I do not want to assign all the blame to one side in this instance but I hope the new Arts Council which will have an extended membership might consider writing to Ministers bringing to their attention the duty which section 3 of the Principal Act imposes on the council to provide advice when it is sought.  I do not want the council to be busybodies; it is not within their power to thrust advice on a Minister or on the Government but I think Ministers of all political persuasions should know about this function of the council which they can invoke at no expense to themselves and with no burden to their Vote.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson spoke about structures. I would ask him to notice that the expanded membership of the council will make it easier to provide a quorum for meetings of the council. In the past there has been some difficulty because of the small membership; where even a relatively small number of members were unable to attend, the provision of a quorum for a working meeting of the council has been difficult.  This difficulty will be a good deal less now.</P>
    <P>Because of its expanded membership the new council will contain a large number of new people.  The council might interpret their functions in such a way as to make it possible for An Chomhairle Ealaíon to co-operate with the Arts Council in Belfast financially as well as in non-financial facilities in promoting activities which would be of cultural benefit <Col N="47" /> to the people in all parts of the country. I will not go into the details of the possibilities that exist here and which may have been missed in the past&mdash;they will be obvious to any Deputy in the House.  I hope the new council will see the public and governmental interest which is evidenced by this Bill as an invitation to be adventurous in this regard and to try to put into effect the co-operation and brotherly working together between North and South which is common policy for both sides of this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson mentioned an ombudsman or someone with that kind of function to whom appeal could be had if the new council appeared to be spending more money on some art forms than on others.  I am sure he will admit that any judgment in this field is bound to be subjective.  I cannot visualise how an ombudsman could be chosen.  That task would be much more difficult than selecting the members of the council.  At the same time, I accept the possible difficulty to which the Deputy adverts and I can only suggest to him that the Taoiseach who is responsible for the Arts Council may be amenable to complaints about the functioning of the council by means of parliamentary question or, alternatively, that complaints can be voiced during the annual debate on the Estimate for the Taoiseach's Department.</P>
    <P>In connection with the personnel, I agree that the question of who is to be a member of the new council will be a difficult one for the Taoiseach to decide.  No doubt any suggestion from Deputy Wilson or anybody else that is well meaning and sensible will be considered as fully as possible.  I hope I can take Deputy Wilson as not meaning that he has any misgivings about the judgment by which the personnel of the new council will be chosen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GusHealy" hpid="Mr. Healy Mr. Healy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Healy</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome the Bill and I join with the Taoiseach in paying tribute to the director and members of the Arts Council for what they have achieved while working on a very tight budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw the attention <Col N="48" /> of the House to the tremendous increase in interest in the Arts generally, especially on the part of young people. This is due to circumstances that are very different now from those which obtained in previous years.  We must encourage that interest in every way possible.  It would be my hope that the Bill would go a little further than is envisaged at the moment.  Bord Fáilte are responsible for the promotion of various festivals throughout the country but I would advocate strongly that those festivals which have a cultural or artistic aspect would come under the aegis of the Arts Council.</P>
    <P>In Cork we have the International Film Festival which is a remnant of An Tostal of many years ago.  We have also an international choral festival. The film festival is now one of the six major international film festivals in the world and is recognised as such by an international federation.  It began from scratch 21 years ago and has continued without a break ever since mainly through the efforts of voluntary organisation.  However, the organisers of the festival are receiving only the same amount of money now from Bord Fáilte as they received ten years ago but that is not the fault of Bord Fáilte because they are operating on the same budget as they had a few years ago. We can only hope that the festival will not have to be discontinued because of lack of assistance but there is a great danger of this happening.  The festival is an art vehicle and it would be sad if the work of 21 years were to go by the board.</P>
    <P>The international choral festival which is due to celebrate its 21st birthday next year attracts at least one dozen choirs and dance teams from foreign countries.  The most recent one attracted six teams from Iron Curtain countries.  However, the more people come from these countries the more money we need because these visitors would not have spending money and, consequently, must be accommodated by the citizens of Cork during their stay.  From a cultural point of view they can contribute a lot and, therefore, every effort should be made to encourage them to come here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="49" /> The other point which I wish to raise relates to the National Theatre. I am associated with the Cork Opera House and it is no pleasure for me to criticise any art venture in the country.  The Opera House was reopened in 1965.  In the first season we had a visit from the Abbey Theatre Players but there was then some difficulty regarding their coming to Cork annually.  However, this difficulty was overcome but I am ashamed to admit that only once since then has the venture paid its way.  So far as I am aware the Cork Opera House is the only legitimate theatre in the 32-Counties that is paying its way.  For nine months out of 12 it pays its way on local talent.  It is a tragedy that both the National Theatre and the Opera House lose money on the Abbey Players' visit.  The difficulty is that they cannot put on the plays that we request them to put on.  When they came down a few weeks ago we endeavoured to persuade them to change the play they had arranged to put on.  They did not do so and the result was that they played to practically empty houses.  What is the point in having a National Theatre that is subsidised by the taxpayers of the entire country if that theatre is put on only in Dublin?  Surely the people of the entire 26 Counties should be able to derive some benefit from it. Therefore, any new council that may be set up will have to ask themselves how best the influence of the national theatre can be spread throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Theatres should be encouraged by way of subsidisation to put on shows. In Cork we have one lady who has dedicated her life to ballet but for many years the audiences for this form of art were very scant.  Now there is an educated public and it is no trouble for this lady to pack the Opera House for a week.  For a long period the Shakespearean Loft did not perform in the Opera House but they are back again.  The Opera House company subsidised them in the past and lost money in so doing but last year both the Opera House company and the Shakespearean company made money on their venture. <Col N="50" /> They expect to be able to maintain this success in the future.  Various players come from Dublin, Limerick and other places but the Opera House as a commercial concern cannot afford to subsidise them.  For instance, the Dublin Grand Opera Society come for a week and are subsidised to the extent of £2,000.  If some of the burden could be borne by the State it would mean that people would have an opportunity of seeing various artists and the artists themselves would have a chance of visiting first-class theatres in big cities and other areas.  We bring people to Cork. &ldquo;Siamsa&rdquo; from Kerry are excellent entertainers from an artistic and traditional culture point of view.</P>
    <P>These are my thoughts on this measure.  I would like to see this Bill channelling money in certain directions. It is no good approaching Bord Fáilte because they have not enough for their own purposes.  I have the greatest sympathy with them.  Every year I have had to fight them to get money for the festivals in Cork.  They find it impossible to help everybody. If one is holding international festivals one has to engage people 18 months beforehand.  There is a seminar held for the Cork Festival and composers are asked to compose original works. These are performed at the festival and one now sees in Europe music which has printed on it &ldquo;First performed at the Cork Festival&rdquo;.  It would be a tragedy if anything happened to stop that.  The Arts Council must be given sufficient money to help artistic ventures throughout the country. I am not unmindful of the fact that some commercial firms help out and I hope they will continue to do so. The practical way in which to help the artists is by commissioning their work or buying it.  I welcome the Bill. I hope it will mean a new chapter in the cultural life of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, would like to welcome this Bill.  I look forward to the new council pursuing a more positive policy from the point of view of the promotion of the Arts throughout the country.  What strikes me most at <Col N="51" /> the moment is the lack of activity in provincial centres.  More should be done by the new council and by local authorities to develop the Arts by organising exhibitions and so forth. There is too much concentration on Dublin and I appeal to the new council to adopt a more positive and active policy in relation to provincial areas.</P>
      <P>Not enough is being done.  People are made aware that various forms of art exist and it is left at that.  I want to see a more positive approach.  I want to see exhibitions mounted. Enough has not been done to promote the Arts throughout the country. Henceforth there will have to be greater co-operation between the council and the local art advisory committees through the country.  We have these committees in Waterford city. We have exhibitions mounted.  They are mounted on a shoestring budget and, therefore, not really properly organised.  There may be a lack of facilities but that difficulty could be overcome by co-operation.</P>
      <P>There is, too, a lack on the school front.  The present curriculum does not provide for the development of an appreciation of art.  The curriculum is too pressurised and there is too much emphasis on set text.  Students should be encouraged to widen their horizons and develop a real appreciation of art in all its forms.  This is long overdue and I would plead with the council to look into this aspect. Perhaps they might consult with the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>I should like to see provincial museums and libraries developed.  I should like to see art galleries and theatres developed in the provinces. There is no positive policy at the moment.  State Departments are anxious to avoid the issue altogether. This is a wrong attitude.  The attitude should be one of positive involvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no hesitation in paying tribute to the work of the Waterford Theatre Royal Society.  By their activities over the years they have kept alive a very fine theatre, a very beautiful theatre, which has contributed much to cultural life in Waterford.  This is the kind of body with which the council <Col N="52" /> should actively co-operate, especially from the point of view of financing their activities.  Not enough emphasis has been placed on this aspect.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest to the Taoiseach a constructive way in which gifts of art treasures to the nation could be ensured.  Would the Taoiseach consider allowing credit for gifts or bequests to the State.  To illustrate my proposal: suppose a person gives a gift of a painting worth £50,000 to the State I suggest that double the current value of that treasure, namely, £100,000, should be credited to his estate for estate duty or death duty purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to go into the technical aspect of this.  I put it forward as being possibly a way which would prevent exportation of art treasures and also a way of ensuring an enlarged collection of art treasures remaining in the State in Museums and art galleries.</P>
      <P>I do not mind giving credit to Deputy Haughey who, when Minister, made his own contribution in this field by allowing artists to reside in the country free of income tax.  That was something positive which we all welcomed at the time.  I am now making this suggestion: I know there are technical and legal difficulties involved but it is a way of keeping art treasures in Ireland, preventing their export and at the same time increasing the wealth of art treasures which the State can own and display.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Bill is under the aegis of the Taoiseach.  It is better that he should go to the Minister for Finance for money rather than another Minister; I should think he would be more welcome and would be dealt with more generously and, as Deputy Wilson said, money is very important in this whole matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like more art exhibitions to be mounted by the National Gallery.  For the first time Mr. James White has completed a catalogue of the art treasures in the National Gallery and I should like to see those on exhibition throughout the country. The exhibitions I have seen in provincial <Col N="53" /> centres, good though they were, were meagre in real wealth in an international sense.  Not too far from here we have an international selection of paintings which is second to none and which we should appreciate and which should be shown throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I think it is the function of the Arts Council positively to pursue this policy.  We all know the great lack of space to display paintings and sculptures and for storing books.  The National Library is so chronically short of space that the books are all stored away.  This should not be so. We should be proud of our heritage in this respect.  As a policy to alleviate this shortage I suggest that provincial centres&mdash;libraries, museums and art galleries&mdash;should be put on a sound and permanent foundation.  I see no logical reason for the concentration of art treasures in Dublin, even if it is the capital.  Why should we not have good displays of treasures in provincial centres such as Athlone, Limerick, Cork and Waterford?  Not enough is being done at present to decentralise, so to speak, our art treasures.</P>
    <P>I would not agree to the appointment of an ombudsman as such as suggested by Deputy Wilson: the Arts Council itself should set itself up as the body competent to judge such matters.</P>

      <P>This is my own opinion.  I am glad to see section 11 here.  Local authorities should be brought more actively into this sphere and I believe they are more anxious to be more active in this respect. Finally, in relation to appointments to the council, I hope the Taoiseach will ensure a regional balance in membership.  I should not like a concentration of Dublin people on it as it is important to keep a regional balance in the membership.  I welcome the Bill, which I consider important.  I am glad to see a reconstituted council and I shall look forward to it being more active and to seeing more emphasis <Col N="54" /> being put on provincial centres as regards all aspects of the Arts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reiterate the point made on this side of the House that we are all anxious to support anything which would promote the Arts.  We can only hope that this Bill will succeed in doing that.  But if we examine the case made by Deputy Wilson as regards money, and if it is true that the only moneys available are those already voted under other subheads and simply brought together under a single subhead, then I do not think we can hope for all we would like to see from this Bill.  I should like to express appreciation of the work done by the present body, which did a very worthwhile job.  If it is found necessary to make a change I hope the new body will do at least an equally good job and perhaps, with the extra facilities available to it, do even better.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Wilson that appreciation of the Arts should begin in the schools.  I do not agree with Deputy Collins that nothing is being done in this respect at present because very considerable development has taken place in recent years in primary and post-primary schools, particularly in the former, in relation to the new curriculum.  Anybody who has not visited a primary school for a number of years and now does so will see that a very worthwhile change is taking place in regard to art development and the giving of some idea of art appreciation. The fact that a relatively short time ago the universities agreed to recognise art as a subject qualifying for entry to the universities has done considerable good.  It has raised the status of art&mdash;I am speaking now perhaps regarding a rather narrow field&mdash; in schools and has helped to develop art education generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that the Bill contains a provision enabling local authorities to assist the council or any exhibition which the council may feel should be promoted.  It is not true to say that local authorities had no function in this respect previously.  Vocational education committees, who can be regarded as a local authority, did a considerable amount, particularly in <Col N="55" /> the field of traditional music.  We could, and should, do much more than has been done in relation to the development and promotion of the Arts.</P>
    <P>One of the problems is that because there appears to be more pressing needs the Arts do not get as high a priority as they should.  The development of art appreciation in the educational field in recent times is an indication that we are taking a greater interest in this particular area than heretofore.  One matter which struck me forcibly when I read this Bill relates to the manner in which the new council is being called into being.  On first reading the Bill I felt a sense of surprise, to put it mildly.  The first question I asked myself was: &ldquo;Where are all the liberals of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties gone?&rdquo;  When they were in opposition and I introduced a number of Bills which could be regarded as being somewhat akin to this Bill&mdash;for example the Bill I brought before the House establishing the board of the College of Art&mdash;they strongly opposed them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That was justified opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>During the debate in relation to that Bill very strong pressure was exerted on me by spokesmen from Fine Gael and Labour in regard to what they claimed was bureaucratic control particularly in relation to anything concerning the arts.  I wonder if the Minister for Foreign Affairs was present for the Government meeting at which this Bill was discussed.  If he was I would be anxious to know what his comments were and whether he made any attempt to change the terms of the Bill, or whether he was only playacting when we were discussing the Bill which established the board of the College of Art.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the Bill provides that the chairman will be appointed by the Taoiseach.  During the debates in this House in relation to the chairmanship of the board of the College of Art or to the chairman of the Higher Education Authority Deputy FitgGerald and Deputy Thornley argued strongly that the chairman should not be appointed by the Minister.  They argued that the chairman should be appointed by the ordinary members of the board.</P>
      <P>In this Bill the chairman is to be appointed by the Taoiseach.  I can imagine the case that would be made against me if I were to bring in this type of Bill were I still in Government. I can also imagine what would be said in relation to the appointment of all the members of this council by the Taoiseach.  One must remember what was said in regard to the proposals I brought forward, particularly when we remember that in the College of Art Bill I gave the right to the teachers to appoint a number of members to the board.  I also gave the right to students to appoint a number of members to that board.  Even in that particular situation I was strongly criticised.</P>
      <P>In this Bill we find that the Taoiseach not only appoints the chairman but also appoints the members.  I have no doubt that if I had brought in this Bill I would be strongly criticised for not giving the right to a number of associations which are closely associated with art to put forward or to elect members to this council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact of the matter is that it was argued that the Minister should not make the appointments. In practically every section of those Bills which related to the sanction of the Minister amendments were put down to remove this sanction.  I should also like to point out that the Bill establishing the board of the college of Art was held up for hours in relation to a section which is similar to section 6 of the Bill before the House.  This section reads:</P>
      <P>When a member of the Council is nominated either as a candidate for election to either House of the Oireachtas or as a Member of Seanad Éireann he shall thereupon cease to be a member of the Council.</P>
      <P>The case made when I introduced a similar section in another Bill was that I was denigrating Members of this House by insisting that they should not be members of the various boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

I am pointing out that when I brought in Bills with similar provisions that these were argued against very strongly by the Fine Gael and Labour spokesmen, one of whom is at present a member of the Government and, on the basis of collective responsibility, must accept responsibility for the contents of this Bill.  I am wondering what his attitude was in relation to these matters on which he held up the House for such a long time during discussion on Bills which I introduced.</P>

I would not have minded if they were said in the course of a speech, but on some occasions they were pressed to Divisions.  It was pointed out that the Minister should not have had even the limited control which I felt a Minister should have. We have a Bill here which brings in all the provisions which were regarded as non-acceptable when the present Government were in Opposition.</P>

I want to reiterate that I am not necessarily disapproving of a number of the matters on which <Col N="59" /> I have spoken in the discussion on this Bill.  I am simply pointing out the change of attitude of the then Opposition Parties since they went into Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other Deputies who have spoken, I would like to afford a welcome to this Bill. In my case it must be a limited welcome. In so far as it succeeds in directing the attention of Members of the House and through them, one would hope, that of the general public to matters artistic and cultural, we must all welcome it.</P>
      <P>However, having said that, I should point out to the Taoiseach that this Bill is going to come as a grievous disappointment to many people, particularly to those who are involved or even interested in the artistic and cultural life of our nation.  For some time past there has been a widespread feeling that some positive move must be made in artistic and cultural matters.  It has been felt on a fairly widespread scale that the existing legislation is no longer adequate for our purposes as a modern developing and expanding society and that something comprehensive and forward-looking was needed.  It is against that widespread feeling among the general public that this Bill must be looked at.</P>
      <P>I hope I will not be accused of political partisanship in this regard, but I would like to say that many people would expect more from the present Government.  We have been treated to a fairly intensive propaganda campaign to the effect that they are a Government of liberal intellectuals and that we can expect, apart from economic and social miracles, very considerable advance from them in the cultural fields.  If that were the general expectation, I am afraid that there will be severe disappointment with this Bill.  The Bill is very limited in scope. What surprises me is that the Taoiseach, with all his heavy responsibilities, should find it worthwhile to waste his personal time, the time of his Department and that of the Oireachtas with what is so comparatively limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will speak later on about the <Col N="60" /> structure of this piece of legislation itself.  At this point I want to emphasise that all this particular piece of legislation purports to do is to make relatively minor changes in the structure of An Chomhairle Ealaíon.  I would hope that we would continue to refer to this body as &ldquo;An Chomhairle Ealaíon&rdquo; and not, as we are always unfortunately inclined to do, slip into the error of referring to it as &ldquo;The Arts Council&rdquo;.  All that the Taoiseach is setting out to do is to enlarge the membership of the council and to make relatively minor changes in the structure. One minor change is that we will now have a full-time director and part-time chairman.  There is also a very minor and limited provision with regard to local authorities participating in the general work of the council.</P>
    <P>The first thing that strikes one about this piece of legislation is that no extension of activities by the new body is envisaged.  We have had the long Summer Recess.  There was plenty of time for somebody to give a great deal of thought to this piece of legislation in general terms.  I am disappointed that the Bill was issued only shortly before we resumed.  I, personally, have not had the time to examine it as thoroughly as I would have wished and to discuss it with as many people as I would have wished. The Taoiseach must be held culpable &mdash;I say this in purely parliamentary terms.  He did not give us time to get our teeth into this legislation, which I regard as fundamentally important. After the long Summer Recess, we got it only a week ago and we are expected to take it today and to discuss it.</P>
    <P>There is no extension of activities envisaged by the new comhairle.  There is not a single function added to those which were attributed to the existing body.  The comhairle has not been set any new objectives or targets.  More important, it has not been given any new powers.  The piece of legislation which was brought in in 1951 was admirable at that time.  Everybody in the House, on whatever side, would pay tribute at this stage to the then Taoiseach, Mr. J. A. Costello, for having brought in the Bill in 1951.  At <Col N="61" /> that time it could have been regarded as a very significant step forward in our affairs.</P>
    <P>The functions which the 1951 Act allocated to the council which it was establishing were very limited in scope.  It might not be any harm if I were to enumerate them.  Their first objective was to stimulate public interest in the Arts.  Their second objective was to promote the knowledge, appreciation and practice of the Arts.  The third objective was to assist in improving the standards of the Arts. The fourth objective was to organise or to assist in the organisation of exhibitions within or without the State of works of art and artistic craftsmanship. The fifth objective was the function of advising the Government, on which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach has spoken.  I agree with what he had to say about the way in which Government Ministers have neglected to make full use of that power.  The sixth objective was to co-operate with and assist other persons concerned either directly or indirectly with matters relating to the Arts.</P>
    <P>Those six functions were very fine in their time.  In 1951 they could have been regarded as a fairly significant step forward.  I do not think they are adequate today.  The Taoiseach should avail of this opportunity to re-cast them completely, to go into them in some detail and to add to them because it does not require any great attention to see ways in which they could be expanded.  I think they could be made a lot more precise and a lot more clearly defined as well as being expanded in scope.  In so far as there is nothing of that nature in this Bill I find it very disappointing. Furthermore, one has to look at the financial side of the piece of legislation. Admittedly it is a natural function of Opposition Deputies to encourage the Government to spend more money in all possible directions. It is equally the duty of a responsible Government to hold the scales as evenly as possible between various conflicting demands.</P>
    <P>In this case the Taoiseach might have said much more than he has said about the funds which are to be <Col N="62" /> made available to the new comhairle. If he even expanded them in proportion to the increase in membership it would have been something.  Not alone has he not given any positive indication of making additional financial provision available to the new comhairle but I, with some experience of the construction of ministerial speeches, find what he has actually said in his speech somewhat suspicious. His speech seems to me to be diverting attention from the fact that he is not undertaking to make more than the existing £100,000 available directly to the new comhairle.  He mentions the omnibus figure of £500,000 which is being made available in some form or another for cultural activities and the very fact that his speech makes reference to that figure seems to me to indicate that he is shying away from any positive commitment to increasing the actual £100,000 which is at present being made available to the comhairle as such.</P>
    <P>It is very easy for Deputies on this side of the House to urge additional expenditure by the Government in desirable directions.  Perhaps that is one of our legitimate functions, but I do think that if £100,000 or something in that region was appropriate two or three years ago a much greater figure should be envisaged by the Taoiseach now particularly as he is making a change.  Apart altogether from the fact that the situation as such would demand a status increase in expenditure on artistic and cultural activities, the very size of our budget here now offers scope for a far greater expenditure in this direction.  If the amount of the grant to An Chomhairle Ealaíon were looked at in relation to the overall total of Government expenditure a much more generous appropriation would be made either this year or certainly in the next financial year when the new comhairle will have got going.</P>
    <P>My approach to this piece of legislation and my disappointment in it is dominated by the fact that I believe, and I am sure many Members will not be surprised to hear me say this again, that the implementation of an enlightened <Col N="63" /> comprehensive policy for the Arts with adequate financial provision enshrined in it is an essential part&mdash; I use the word &ldquo;essential&rdquo; deliberately&mdash;of modern progressive government. It has become more widely accepted by the general public and, indeed, in this House, that it is no longer enough for a Government to cater simply for the material needs of the community and to be indifferent, if nothing worse, to spiritual and cultural requirements.  I have used the phrase before and I do not hesitate to use it again that I do not think we can any more have a situation in which we have economic planning but cultural <i>laissez faire.</i></P>
    <P>It is not for a member of the Opposition to put forward anything like a detailed comprehensive policy for the Arts because we have not got the resources to put together such a policy in anything like appropriate detail.  I think we can fulfil our obligation by urging the Government to give this area increasing attention.  Here I would like to be presumptuous enough to give advice to the Taoiseach and that is not to permit himself to drift into a frame of mind in which he is prepared to let matters like this be put on the long finger because of pressing present-day difficulties, problems and troubles.  It is true that some of the great reforms of modern times have been conceived and, indeed, have been planned at times of the greatest difficulty. One thinks of the great inauguration of the welfare state in Great Britain which was prepared and brought to planning fruition while Britain was engaged in a major world conflict.  If I may be presumptuous enough to say to the Taoiseach that even though the temptation to say: &ldquo;Artistic and cultural matters will have to wait&rdquo; is probably very great, nevertheless I do not think he should permit himself to fall for that particular temptation.  He should regard a comprehensive programme for artistic and cultural matters as an essential part of the programme of his Government.</P>
    <P>Such a comprehensive policy for the Arts would involve, first of all, of course, adequate financial provision.  It <Col N="64" /> would require a great deal of thought. It would involve some way of co-ordinating all the teaching bodies and institutions which are engaged in cultural and artistic fields and it would have to be tailored to our particular circumstances and the needs of our particular community.  It should not be just a pale reflection of what some other countries are endeavouring to do. In the framing of any such policy for the Arts a number of very important questions about An Chomhairle Ealaíon would have to be faced up to and they are not faced up to in this legislation. The basic question which has to be answered is: what precisely are An Chomhairle Ealaíon expected to do?</P>
    <P>Do we visualise them as just another body taking their place in the cultural field and making their own contribution, or do we expect them to exercise some form of guidance or even some control over all the other bodies and institutions involved?  This is very fundamental and it should certainly have been considered in deciding what functions the new comhairle will have: whether they are simply to carry out their activities parallel to all the other bodies which are there, or whether they will exercise some guidance and control over them.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the matter with which, perhaps, I am unduly personally preoccupied is whether or not one Arts Council is enough.  I gave a great deal of thought to this matter and I arrived at the conclusion that one Arts Council was not enough.  I am quite prepared to state at this point of time, looking back and relieved of any pressure of responsibility for taking the decision, that I might change that view.  At the time it seemed to me that the ideal answer was to have three different bodies: one body which would deal with writing, literature, drama, poetry, and so on; another body which would deal with painting and sculpture and the ancillaries; and a third body which would deal with music, ballet and that sector.</P>
    <P>I must admit that I came to that conclusion, influenced unduly perhaps, by the fact that the existing Comhairle Ealaíon, as they were at that time, seemed to me to be pre-occupied with one limited sector of <Col N="65" /> artistic endeavour.  They seemed to be very pre-occupied with modern abstract painting, very much to the exclusion of the rest of the cultural field.  I thought the solution to that sort of situation, and perhaps the way to prevent it arising in the future when some other comhairle might be equally pre-occupied with music to the exclusion of the other activities, was to have three separate bodies, each specifically directed towards its own particular field so that no major area of activity would be neglected.  Three bodies with three separate budgets was what I had in mind.</P>
    <P>As I say, I am quite prepared at this stage to withdraw from that point of view and perhaps to go back to the ideal of one central Arts Council.  Particularly if they were to have any sort of controlling or co-ordinating function with regard to other bodies, we would almost certainly have to have one Arts Council responsible to the Government. Even if you are to settle for one body, some machinery must be built into that body, whether it be a subcommittee structure or something of that nature, which will ensure that the body as such will never be permitted to become totally absorbed in promoting one particular sector of the Arts to the exclusion of the others.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have spoken about the question of the new Comhairle Ealaíon remaining the responsibility of the Taoiseach and his Department. That is another decision which should be thought about.  I am not sure if it has been on this occasion.  I am not sure whether a positive decision to leave the responsibility for An Chomhairle Ealaíon with the Taoiseach's Department has been taken, or whether it is just a question of leaving things as they are.  In my time I favoured transferring responsibility for An Chomhairle Ealaíon from the Taoiseach's Department to that of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Collins was guilty of an error of judgment when he said that no Minister can approach the Minister for Finance with the same authority as the Taoiseach.  With the exception, I would have added, of the Minister for Finance himself.  It was not simply because the Minister for <Col N="66" /> Finance was the financial authority that I thought of transferring responsibility from the Taoiseach's Department to that of the Minister for Finance.  I do not believe that the Taoiseach's Department is an appropriate home for a body of this sort.</P>
    <P>I must say I am delighted that the present Taoiseach has gone to the trouble of bringing in this legislation even though I am critical of it as such.  I hope it augurs well for the future that he is interesting himself in this area.  To that extent I very much welcome this development.  If, in spite of all the other pressures which are upon him, he is to take a very active interest in cultural matters and in the new comhairle, every Deputy in the House will commend him for that.  Apart from whatever personal interest he may bring to bear on the situation, a body of this sort attached to the Taoiseach's Department is at some disadvantage.  The Taoiseach has an overall co-ordinating responsibility, very often a responsibility to hold the balance between different Departments with conflicting priorities.  In that sort of situation it is not difficult to visualise a body like An Chomhairle Ealaíon, attached to the Taoiseach's Department, to some extent being neglected.</P>
    <P>I wonder even at this late stage, if the new comhairle are to be left in the Taoiseach's Department, whether the Taoiseach would not consider some similar type of arrangement to that which he has already brought into being in relation to the Government Information Service, in other words, leaving the comhairle attached to his Department but perhaps allocating direct responsibility for their promotion and development to a particular Minister who would not be as pre-occupied with all the broad spectrum of problems as the Taoiseach is.  I am prepared to admit that perhaps this is a sort of administrative matter on which one Deputy's opinion is as good as another's, but I have put that forward as my view for consideration by the Taoiseach if it is not too late and if positive decisions have not already been taken by the Government in that regard.</P>
    <P>One other aspect of the work of An <Col N="67" /> Chomhairle Ealaíon which I might mention is the fact that the comhairle administer a number of funds which are subsidiary to their main financial operations, the most important of those being Ciste Cholmchille.  I believe that the existing council has not been active enough in regard to these funds.  I believe Ciste Cholmchille offers a vehicle through which a very important impact could be made on our cultural life.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the new Comhairle promoting this positively. They should bring it to the attention of the public and invite contributions from well-disposed individuals, and commercial firms.  In any Government approach to the Arts there should be some thinking given to the role of the private patrons. In this House we are concerned with institutional assistance to the Arts.  In modern times that is the most important aspect of the matter. There is still, and always will be, a role for the private patron.  No matter how efficient our social services become there will always be a satisfactory, beneficial role for private charities and so also, I believe, in the artistic sphere.  No matter how adequate the institutional arrangements we make are, there will always be a role for that particular personalised assistance.</P>
    <P>The private patron can give that which no official body or institution can give.  The comhairle in its thinking about the Arts&mdash;Deputy Collins also touched on this aspect&mdash;should give some consideration to the encouragement of private patronage. That particular area is full of loopholes. Many countries have walked into serious difficulties through their taxation provisions in trying to do something in that area, but I still think that with careful consideration systems of encouragement of private patronage could be devised which would not be in any way against the public interest.  On that line of country these subsidiary funds which An Chomhairle Ealaíon administers could possibly be brought into much greater use.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have spoken of the <Col N="68" /> difficulties in selecting suitable people for membership of the new comhairle. With Deputy Faulkner, I would agree with the idea that the Taoiseach should make all these appointments. Perhaps I am not yet far enough removed from Ministerial occupational myopia but I still think that to a very large extent there is nobody better fitted to make impartial and objective appointments to this type of body than the Minister concerned. Deputy Faulkner endeavoured to say that he did not disagree with the appointments being made by the Taoiseach, nor do I.  In spite of the difficulties involved in making suitable selections, I feel sure the Taoiseach will avail of advice and will not have any great difficulty in procuring a suitable panel to act on the new comhairle.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to what the Taoiseach said in his opening speech when he mentioned that he hoped the new council could be made representative of all branches of the Arts, including the visual and literary arts, drama and music, and that different areas of the country are properly represented.  The Taoiseach has set for himself a very ambitious programme and I feel sure he will make every effort to meet the requirements which he has laid down in the selection of these people.  I urge him to be adventurous.  This is a case where it is necessary to meet imagination with imagination.</P>
    <P>The new Comhairle Ealaíon will be operating in the realm of the imagination. If I had the responsibility I hope I would not be afraid to appoint a practising artist&mdash;I use the word &ldquo;artist&rdquo; in its broadest sense&mdash;to the new comhairle.  I hope the Taoiseach will be courageous in that regard. Admittedly, there may be some difficulty, but it is worth taking a chance, and putting some creative people on the new comhairle.  We know artists are given to grouping themselves together in self-defence.  I hope any such difficulty can be overcome and the Taoiseach by selecting carefully can put a reasonable leavening of practising artists on the new comhairle.</P>
    <P>The new comhairle will be faced <Col N="69" /> with the central dilemma which is always there.  The wisdom with which they are selected by the Taoiseach will have a great deal to do with the way they tackle that dilemma.  That, to my mind, is simply in what direction should their main effort be made: should they make the resources available to promote public exhibitions and performances which can be seen by the general public and appreciated by them and where they can be seen to be getting value for the money they are spending, or should they tackle the much more dangerous task of endeavouring to finance individual creativity, a process which may never result in any realisable or visible concrete results?  This is the central dilemma which faces anybody operating in this area.</P>
    <P>The easy thing is to mount the public exhibition and the public performance or, indeed, as the last council were inclined to do, to buy the painting.  As somebody put it to me very succinctly; you can hang a painting on the wall for everybody to see but you cannot do that with a poem. I hope the new comhairle will be courageous in this respect and will advert to the need to subsidise individual creative activities even if the result of that subsidisation may never be seen in a concrete positive form.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention some of the problems which I have come across as an individual Deputy and to which I would direct the attention of the incoming comhairle with a view possibly to doing something about them. In recent times I found myself being approached frequently by young people or their parents, young people who are particularly talented in some artistic field and who wish to go abroad to further their studies and to have access to training which, unfortunately, is not available in this country.  There does not seem to be any machinery or any vehicle whereby talented young people of that sort can be subsidised for going abroad to procure further training in their particular art.</P>
    <P>I know that is a very difficult field and the problem of selection would be a very complicated one, but certainly it is an area to which I think thought <Col N="70" /> and attention should be given, because there are quite a number of our young people today who are in need of such subsidisation.  They have the talent. They have proved by winning scholarships or otherwise that they are of international potential standard, and they just have not got the resources to go abroad to get the further advanced teaching they need.  If a way could be found in suitable cases of helping them, that would be something that would be very beneficial in the long run.</P>
    <P>Another experience I have had as a Deputy is of well-meaning organisations coming to me who want to mount exhibitions or performances of one sort or another.  They have all the good will in the world and very often they have the talent, but they have not got the exhibition-mounting expertise.  Perhaps the new comhairle would give some thought to having a team, not necessarily a very large team but a few people at least, who would be available to voluntary organisations to instruct them in the mechanics and techniques of putting on exhibitions or performances. It need not be very costly because these voluntary organisations are always full of enthusiasm.  They have the finance and everything else, as I say, except the experience of the actual mechanics of putting on exhibitions or performances.</P>
    <P>I am sure nobody will be surprised if I mention very briefly in this context the provisions which are now incorporated in our income tax code whereby earnings from creative activities are exempt from personal taxation.  I have been, and I am sure other Deputies have been, approached from time to time as to the administration of these provisions.  I have never had any concrete evidence that these provisions are not working satisfactorily, but I wonder if the Taoiseach when he comes to reply would feel it appropriate at this stage&mdash;perhaps he would not but, if so, well and good&mdash;to say a word about the way in which these provisions are being administered and whether or not there are any complaints from practitioners as to their being denied the appropriate exemptions.</P>
    <P>Finally, I repeat what I said at the <Col N="71" /> beginning, that I welcome the Bill in so far as it does direct our attention to matters artistic, and I also very much welcome the fact that the Taoiseach, in bringing it in, is obviously going to interest himself in this area. However, I do express disappointment as to the serious limitations of the Bill and hope that, perhaps, on some other occasion a much more comprehensive and far-reaching piece of legislation for the promotion of artistic and cultural endeavour will come before us.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, when speaking on these benches, quite frequently made a statement which I never accepted and which I, sitting quietly on the far side, always thought ill became him. He talked about people in government who were anxious to keep their hands on the loot.  Apart from anything else, I thought it was a most uncharitable comment and a comment which does not reflect any credit on politicians whether in government or in opposition.  The Taoiseach now brings before this House a Bill which, <i>inter alia,</i> refers to the expenditure of £500,000.  He is reorganising structures which in themselves were democratic in the matter of the personnel of that council.  In so far as he proposes altering them so that he himself will have the right to nominate all the new members of An Chomhairle Ealaíon. I am hoping that he has forgotten <Col N="72" /> the charges which he has made against former Taoisigh and former governments and that there will be no question, in the matter of the Arts above all else, of embarking on an era when having one's hands on the loot can be alleged.</P>
    <P>If there is any feature or characteristic essential to the promotion of the Arts it must be that they be allowed certain freedoms.  The Parliamentary Secretary said he welcomed the Bill in so far as the council would be answerable to the House.  I am not sure if I share his welcome in this respect.  I am not too happy with the situation where apparently the Arts generally will become a political football. The Taoiseach and the Government might have a second look at how they propose reorganising the existing structures and they should think twice before satisfying themselves that in future the Arts will become a unit of the Taoiseach's Department or some other Department. People from whom we would expect a certain adventurous and imaginative contribution with regard to the Arts apparently must always be aware that if at any stage their imagination or adventure causes them to stand on the toes of any politician their sincerity, ability and desire to advance the Arts can be called to question here for reasons unconnected with the Arts&mdash;reasons which are purely political.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Faulkner referred to the appointment of the 16 members the Parliamentary Secretary said it was entirely different from the situation which arose in connection with the Higher Education Authority or the College of Art.  I am at a loss to understand this.  The director who is described in the Bill as the chief executive officer will be appointed subject to the approval of the Taoiseach. From now on all members of An Chomhairle Ealaíon will be appointed by the Taoiseach and answerable to him.  I hope that the Taoiseach will be prepared to accept some amendments to this section.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey referred to what he had expected and what he thought the country would expect from a <Col N="73" /> Government who could boast of so many academics and intellectuals. When the HEA Bill was being discussed here I remember taking issue with the present Minister for Foreign Affairs on the matter of university autonomy.  I made the point that where universities were being serviced by the taxpayers I thought the time had come for these institutions to be answerable in some way to this House. The Minister for Foreign Affairs who was then in Opposition jumped to his feet, he addressed himself to the Press Gallery and asked that they would pay special attention to the fact that a backbench member of the Government party was advocating the end of university autonomy.  I have not changed my mind about the universities. I do not know if the Minister for Foreign Affairs has been consulted about this Bill but I hope he will agree with me that there should be at least some autonomy so far as An Chomhairle Ealaíon are concerned particularly having regard to the fact that the amount of money is relatively unimportant as against the moneys paid to the universities.</P>
    <P>The Bill is dull and uninteresting.  It lacks imagination and the bite which would indicate that there was some real concern.  I refer to the terminology in the Taoiseach's speech when he stated that he hoped this provision would stimulate interested persons and groups throughout the country to organise plays, exhibitions and other similar activities.  That savours of words, not intent.  While we do not expect other people to dwell too long on the words we use these were the words of the Taoiseach on an important matter.  When we consider what we hope the Bill will achieve with regard to literature, language, drama and speech we should be more precise.  To me plays and exhibitions are just that and I do not know what other equation exists.  I am not making an issue out of this but it confirms my fear that this is only a veneer, something superficial, pretending we are doing something when, in fact, little has been done.</P>
    <P>At a time when all the Ministers of the present Government are availing <Col N="74" /> of every opportunity to indicate to the people how flaithiúlach they can be with money, the sentence in the Taoiseach's speech which says that the provision of more money cannot by itself remedy shortcomings in the fostering of the Arts is an indication of how ungenerous we are to be in the matter of providing moneys for the Arts.  I should hate to be an artist here and to be in need of money because reading that sentence I could not be very optimistic.</P>
    <P>Regarding the type of person who will be chosen for this council, I would hope that the Government would by now have recognised the many people and many organisations who, in their own way and with very little financial support from the State or elsewhere, have been doing tremendous work in such fields as drama, for instance.  I refer specifically to amateur drama.  Deputy Collins and Deputy Healy referred to what has been achieved in Waterford and Cork by voluntary effort.  I commend the people of both counties on the magnificent work which they are doing but I commend also those people in all other areas who are involved in the field of amateur drama.  If I were sitting on the Government benches I would hope that the Government would not be slow to acknowledge the work that is being done by these people.  It is my hope that the amateur drama movement will be represented on the council.</P>
    <P>My fear is that An Chomhairle Ealaíon may consist of personnel who during the years have been associated with the Arts but that their association may have been publicised out of proportion to the contribution they made. We all know that in this field, as in any other, it is not always the person who has made the greatest contribution, not always the best worker, who appears in the forefront.  However, regarding which sections might have representations I am confining myself to amateur drama in the hope that when the Taoiseach is examining the recommendations and the names that have been submitted to him, he will bear in mind the great work that is being done by all those who are involved in this field.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" /> Perhaps I can be accused of having a special interest in drama.  I hesitate to use the word &ldquo;exploited&rdquo; but this is an area on which we could and should capitalise.  An interest in drama should be stimulated in the schools.</P>

      <P>Before the interruption I was expressing the hope that when the Taoiseach is appointing the members of An Chomhairle Ealaíon he would consider the qualifications of all and that he would consider sympathetically all names submitted to him of people who are involved in the amateur drama movement.</P>
      <P>Representation will be given to the professional theatre and the professional theatre is obviously deserving of representation.  I would hope that the great work done for the promotion of drama, apart altogether from the great need that exists, would be recognised, recognised in the movement which has been catering to supply this need in the country to date.</P>
      <P>I should like to express my disappointment that the promised second national theatre has not yet evolved. I understood that before the last Government left office this decision had already been taken and we could look forward to seeing a second national theatre.  I believe this would satisfy a need which was stressed by some speakers about the centralising of the national theatre in Dublin.  I believe the object was to have a theatre which would visit provincial areas so that the people in those areas would reap some benefit.  When the Taoiseach is replying he might give us some indication as to when it is proposed to make funds available for this promised second national theatre.</P>
      <P>I will conclude on the note on which I began.  Looking at this Bill, and having listened to and read the Taoiseach's speech, I am afraid that we are embarking on a very unwelcome and undesirable situation in which art will become the straitjacket of the politicians.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally this Bill was welcomed and the remarks of Deputy Tunney, who concluded for the Opposition, were out of line with what Deputy Wilson and other Opposition speakers said.  This Bill proposes to extend the powers and functions originally laid down in the 1951 Act.  It makes one substantial change in that it enlarges the council.  Under the original Act the council could co-opt additional members not exceeding five in number. Experience over the years has shown that this limitation resulted in the council not being able adequately to cater for all aspects of the Arts, including the visual Arts.  This was adverted to by a number of speakers. It was certainly the experience of the council and of successive Ministers for Finance.  Deputy Haughey told us that he announced on one occasion that he proposed to set up three separate bodies, but that proposal did not get beyond the stage of announcement. <Col N="77" /> When he left the Department of Finance, his successor, Deputy Colley, moved towards the proposals now adopted in the Bill as a result of discussions he had and work that was done.  It is a mistake, therefore, for any Opposition Deputy to think there is any fundamental difference.</P>
    <P>The concept of an Arts Council was the brainchild largely of the late Dr. Thomas Bodkin who made a monumental contribution to Art in this country.  He did that in his capacity as Director of the National Gallery and, subsequently, as a member of the Fine Arts Institute in Birmingham he continued his interest in the Arts here. Prior to the introduction of the 1951 Act he had done an immense amount of work, including publishing a reprint, on a smaller scale, of his earlier work on the Lane pictures.  It was as a result of his interest and the interest the then Taoiseach, Mr. John A. Costello personally had in this, that the 1951 Act was brought in.</P>
    <P>It is correct that the council appointed under that Act could not embrace all the different interests and it was for that reason it was decided to enlarge it.  It is now recognised that three separate bodies would be unduly wasteful.  We have not got unlimited resources and having three separate bodies dealing with the Arts would be unduly wasteful.  While no formal decision was taken it was the general view, I think, of the previous Government that that was so and from what Deputy Haughey said it is obvious he shares that view.</P>
    <P>So far as the general form of the Bill is concerned, I accept responsibility for it, but I want to make it clear that there is no fundamental difference.  The members are appointed, as members are appointed under a number of other Acts, by the Minister responsible or by the Government on his recommendation. There is a difference between this particular body, however, and the body referred to by Deputy Faulkner.  The method of appointment is similar to that which obtains in a number of State companies.  The responsible Minister appoints the chairman and members of the Institute of Cultural <Col N="78" /> Research and Standards under the 1961 Act.  An Foras Forbartha is similarly appointed and also Bord na gCapall, under the 1970 Act.  The Government appoint the chairman of the Higher Education Authority on the recommendation of the Minister for Education under the 1971 Act. The President appoints the chairman of the Institute for Advanced Studies, again on the advice of the Government; a nominal appointment by the President on the advice of the Government.</P>
    <P>The intention in this Bill is, as a number of Deputies have said, to get representatives, people whose skill or talent reflects the various artistic groups in the community and, also, as far as possible to ensure that areas outside as well as inside Dublin are represented.  The decision on what money is to be provided initially will have to be taken by the council themselves. The council will come to the Government, as all State bodies do, and put up proposals which will be examined.  There is no specific proposal in the Bill dealing with money. At the moment the subhead under my Vote for An Chomhairle Ealaíon is for £100,000 but that by no means exhausts State assistance to different artistic and cultural activities.  So far as I and the Minister for Finance are concerned when the request comes from the new council it will be sympathetically examined.</P>
    <P>There has been some criticism which is difficult to answer because I do not know precisely what is meant. Deputy Haughey said the Bill was &ldquo;not forward-looking&rdquo; and was &ldquo;not comprehensive&rdquo;.  He said it had no &ldquo;new targets&rdquo;.  I do not know how you would set artistic targets; it is surely the wrong concept to think you would produce good art in any form by setting a target; it would cease to be art if targets were set.  Deputy Tunney suggested there was &ldquo;no bite&rdquo; in the legislation.  The phraseology of every Bill is in technical, legal language designed to enable the body or the undertaking, whether statutory or otherwise, to promote or do certain things.  Here, in the initial definition of the 1951 Act, we have defined a number <Col N="79" /> of matters which fall within the terms of the Bill.  The Long Title sets out that it is an Act to &ldquo;stimulate public interest in, and to promote the knowledge, appreciation, and practice of, the arts and, for these and other purposes, to establish an Arts Council, and to provide for other matters in connection with the matters aforesaid.&rdquo; In addition on this occasion we enable the council to assist local authorities.  There had been valid criticisms that local authorities are limited in what they can do.  They can provide buildings and facilities for exhibitions but under the Bill this is extended and under section 11 &ldquo;a local authority for the purposes of the Local Government Act, 1941, may assist with money or in kind or by the provision of services or facilities (including the services of staff) the council, or any person organising an exhibition or other event the effect of which when held would, in the opinion of the authority, stimulate public interest in the arts, promote the knowledge, appreciation and practice of the arts, or assist in improving the standards of the arts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>People generally react quickly to what they see although this sometimes applies to what they hear.  Recently the Arts Council promoted a very big exhibition in collaboration with the Australian Government.  Deputy Wilson adverted to the possibility that if there was more money the council might attract more exhibitions to this country. I think he mentioned the Charlemagne Exhibition.  As he appreciates, one of the difficulties is the cost not merely of transporting an exhibition of that size but of insurance and the risk involved in moving works of art which may be fragile goods.  This is a limiting factor.  Under the additional powers in this section the local authority will now have the opportunity of getting assistance from the council.  I hope this will be possible.  It has been said from time to time that too much of the artistic world is located in the capital.  That is due to a variety of circumstances, including the fact that there are two very good galleries in Dublin&mdash;the National Gallery and the Municipal Gallery.  There are <Col N="80" /> also very fine galleries in the provinces. I hope it will be possible for the new council to assist in promoting and developing artistic exhibitions, drama and other festivals.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Healy who remarked that sometimes the problem is that when touring companies go to certain places the patronage is not up to expectations and a loss is incurred and they must turn to bodies such as the Arts Council or in some cases to Bord Fáilte to meet deficiencies. We have introduced this Bill as rapidly as possible.  Deputy Haughey said he thought it might have involved more comprehensive legislation; it is an illusion to think you can promote either art or drama or music by legislation. No matter how comprehensive it may be it will not produce musicians, playwrights, painters or writers. It ceases to be art if it can be mass produced.  However, Deputy Tunney said we should not literally examine every phrase or comment made and perhaps this is true.  I am sure Deputy Haughey did not mean it in that way.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill a director will be appointed by the council subject to the approval of the Taoiseach.  I doubt if that can be said to be bringing politics into the matter; if anything, it strengthens the powers of the council.  Most members of the existing council were appointed by the Taoiseach and the Government and the remainder were co-opted.  Under this Bill they will all be appointed.  I think Deputy Wilson's comment on this was valid; it is a mistake for people to be left too long on any body.  One of the criticisms applied to the council was that when they can co-opt so many persons it is almost self-perpetuating.  The five-year limitation is reasonable; it affords an opportunity to reappoint people considered suitable and, at the same time, if, for any reason, whoever is responsible at the time feels there should be a change then it can be made.</P>
    <P>So far as the question of providing extra money is concerned, this will be a matter for the council and will be considered in the light of the proposals they make when the council is brought into being.  I think it is appropriate <Col N="81" /> that the view of the new council should be obtained before any decision is taken on this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey adverted to the fact that the Arts Council was under my Department and expressed the view that it was inappropriate that it should be there.  That is his personal opinion on it.  The Deputy expressed the view when he was Minister that it should be transferred to his Department.  The Devlin Report commented on a number of matters including the question of transferring certain functions from one ministerial Department to others.  This report recommended that a number of departmental functions might be transferred from particular Departments to other Departments and that some might even be merged.  These are being considered.</P>
    <P>Until that consideration has been concluded there is no proposal to transfer the Arts Council elsewhere.  Indeed the first step in implementing the recommendations of the Devlin Report was the setting up of the proposed Department of the Public Service.  As Deputies are aware, the legislation on that was passed prior to the Summer Recess.  That was the first step, and any of these matters will have to be considered in the light of that.</P>
    <P>There is validity in some of the comments made by Deputy Wilson and other Members.  In any body of this character one is dealing with people. Some Deputies pointed out that one of the criticisms of the council was that they intended to purchase works by established artists and, in certain cases. purchased quite a number of paintings or pieces by particular artists.  That, I believe, falls within the question of personal opinion, but during the course of the annual debate on the Estimates when the Estimate for An Chomhairle Ealaíon is being discussed matters of that character can be raised.</P>
    <P>I believe that if the council is an active body and members of it are adequately interested in its work then it will obviously mean that no particular view-point is dominant in decisions that are taken.  One of the criticisms that has been made is this one, and obviously it is one that must have some validity if a number of people <Col N="82" /> have made it.  I do not believe that it is necessary to have a particular official to deal with the complaints, as suggested by Deputy Wilson, but when the annual Vote is before the House matters of this sort can be raised.  In addition, I feel sure that the council would listen to representations and comments made.</P>
    <P>I agree with the view expressed here, a view which I have expressed on many occasions, that the present Director of the National Gallery has done a tremendous amount for art, not only in this city but in this country. Probably one of the attributes that he has is that he is alive to the necessity to go out to the people, to use a modern term, selling, not in the literal sense, and putting before the people the artistic treasures we have.  He has done so by conducting lectures and arranging talks and discussions on topics and different aspects of art.  That is part of the work and to that extent he has done a very praiseworthy job.</P>
    <P>One of the advantages that the National Gallery has had here is that it has been separate from any Department. If one thing more than another inhibits artists or writers it is the feeling that they are restricted in some way by any form of control. They feel that they generally prosper best when they have adequate freedom. I believe that is one of the matters which has helped the National Gallery.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey asked if there were any particulars to show whether the tax concession for artists and others was working satisfactorily.  There are no figures available.  As Deputies will appreciate it is not possible to get individual figures of taxpayers because the Revenue Commissioners cannot disclose them.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the question of co-operation with the Arts Council in Northern Ireland.  The report of An Chomhairle Ealaíon, referring to the joint efforts with the Arts Council&mdash;a report which I understand will shortly be available &mdash;points out that there has been considerable co-operation.  The Secretary of An Chomhairle visits the Northern Arts Council at least annually and <Col N="83" /> has addressed the Ulster Arts Club in Belfast.  The comhairle in its purchases of paintings and sculptures never distinguished between the North and the South.  In fact, many of the works purchased are works of Northern artists.</P>
    <P>In addition some of the fellowships administered by the council apply to persons in both parts of the country. The comhairle also showed many exhibitions here which were organised by the Arts Council in the North of Ireland.  They were also shown in Cork.  The comhairle has also paid for exhibitions from here which were shown in Belfast.  In addition they have organised joint exhibitions and both councils frequently have offered exhibitions from abroad to one another in order to reduce the costs.</P>
    <P>On all these fronts&mdash;the same applies in drama and in literature as well as in music&mdash;there has been a great deal of co-operation.  I believe that is as it should be and I have no doubt it will continue.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Title>Auctioneers and House Agents Bill, 1973 [Seanad]: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I formally move the Second Stage of the Bill I should like to welcome Deputy Andrews to the seat opposite and I look forward to happy relations with him in various matters of mutual concern.</P>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before describing what is in this Bill, I would like to indicate the present position regarding the employment of and remuneration of auctioneers and house agents.  Normally, the cost of the services of a person having a special skill or offering a special service, is borne by the person employing him.  This, however, is not the case in many transactions where the services of an auctioneer or house agent are availed of.  The custom in this country, with certain exceptions, <Col N="84" /> is that the purchaser ordinarily pays the auctioneer's or house agent's fees. In other words, the person who employs the auctioneer does not pay him, though, as his employer, he is legally liable to do so.  Instead, he passes over this liability to the purchaser.</P>
    <P>This practice means that the cost to the purchaser of the property in question is increased by the amount of the fees.  Of course, it is also increased by the stamp duty, if any, payable and by the legal costs.  There is one exception to this practice and that is sales in Dublin by private treaty, where the fee is borne by the person employing the auctioneer, namely, the vendor.</P>
    <P>The fee which auctioneers customarily charge is 5 per cent of the purchase price with one exception, this again in the case of sales by private treaty in Dublin, where the fee charged is 2½ per cent of the purchase price.  As I have already said, these fees, with the one exception mentioned, are passed to the purchaser. In addition to his fees, the auctioneer usually has a claim for out-of-pocket expenses incurred, those usually being the cost of advertising the land for sale.  The practice is that these are recovered from the vendor, that is, from the person on whose behalf they have been incurred.</P>
    <P>You will have noted that the fee charged is a flat percentage and that it is charged at the rates mentioned irrespective of the size of the purchase price or the complexity or difficulty of the particular transaction.</P>
    <P>The extent of the service given by auctioneers and house agents varies according to the circumstances of particular transactions and remuneration is not related to the work actually done in individual cases.  The fees can be, in cases, totally out of proportion to the work done.  The system whereby a flat percentage rate is charged irrespective of the value of the property is, in any case, open to serious criticism, particularly in the case of land and houses, which have appreciated so enormously in value in recent years.</P>
    <P>Auctioneers' fees charged as a percentage of the purchase price have an <Col N="85" /> inflationary effect.  To put it simply, present practice means that the price of a house is inflated by 5 per cent in most cases and this pressure falling as it does on a very vulnerable section of the community, the wage-earner setting up house, is a significant factor in the entire inflationary spiral.  Furthermore, the custom of charging the fee to the purchaser coerces him in practice into accepting the amount thereof without question or running the risk of losing his purchase if he bargains over the fee.</P>
    <P>This whole area of house purchase is a very sensitive area in the context of inflation and, because that is so, the Government in their budget considerably reduced, and in some cases totally abolished, stamp duty so as further to ease the lot of the person purchasing his own house.</P>
    <P>In the Seanad I gave as an example the case of a £7,000 house.  Prior to the budget a purchaser would have had to pay stamp duty and auction fees.  The pre-budget stamp duty was £210 and auction fees, assuming the transaction took place outside Dublin, came to £350, a total of £560, which the purchaser had to find in addition to his purchase price and the legal fees.  You will agree that this was a substantial sum for a newly-married man to find setting up his own house or for a family man moving from a rented apartment into his own house.</P>
    <P>The budget reduced the stamp duty in this instance to £100 and when this Bill becomes law the purchaser will be relieved of auction fees of £350, giving a total relief of £460.  The legal fees incidentally, assuming a title in the Land Registry free from equities amount to £80.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the Bill itself.  The Bill has two basic provisions.  It first proposes that, save in certain specified cases, contracts whereby a purchaser, lessee or tenant is made liable to pay the fees and expenses of an auctioneer or house agent shall be void.  The second provision proposes to increase from £5,000 to £10,000 the fidelity guarantee bond or deposit which must be maintained in the High Court by auctioneers and house <Col N="86" /> agents.  I will now go on to deal with these provisions in turn.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that, with one exception, any provision in any agreement or contract relating to the sale, lease or letting of property, other than personal chattels, whereby the purchaser, lessee or tenant is required to pay the auctioneer's or house agent's fees or expenses shall be void.  The exception is the case where the auctioneer or house agent has been retained by the purchaser, lessee or tenant to act for him and has not been so retained by the vendor, lessor or landlord.  I feel that in the latter cases it would be unfair to an auctioneer or house agent unless such arrangements are excluded specifically from the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A question arose in the Seanad as to whether a purchaser, who through ignorance, paid auctioneer's fees could recover the fees paid.  While I was advised that the probability was that such a person could recover, I have amended the Bill in a way that puts the question of right of recovery beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>I am primarily concerned with houses and lands and I specifically excluded personal chattels from the scope of the Bill.  In consultation with representatives of the auctioneering profession, the question of conacre &ldquo;lettings&rdquo;, as they are called, was raised.  I am advised that a conacre or agistment arrangement does not constitute a letting but is rather in the nature of a licence and that consequently such an arrangement is not affected by the Bill.</P>
    <P>A detailed examination is at present being carried out under the powers in the Prices Acts of the fees charged by auctioneers and house agents.  This involves consultation with the profession. The powers exercisable under the Prices Acts do not, in any event, extend to directing that the vendor, rather than the purchaser, should be responsible for the payment of auctioneers' or house agents' fees and that is why this measure is being introduced now.  The proposal in the Bill would not make it unlawful, in the sense of making it an offence, for an auctioneer or house agent to contract with a purchaser for <Col N="87" /> the payment of his fees; it would simply make any such contract void and hence unenforceable.  The main area of concern relates to the sale of property, that is, houses and land, and accordingly the provisions of the Bill are, in effect, confined to transactions in real estate.</P>
    <P>I recognise that if the vendor has to pay the fees the net cost of the property to the purchaser might increase but, on the other hand, the vendor who employs the auctioneer or house agent is in a stronger position to bargain for a fee commensurate with the job.  This will probably lead to a reduction in fees; and even if fees then are passed to the purchaser, the eventual amount which the purchaser will have to pay will be less and it is not unreasonable to assume that in many cases it will realistically be related to the amount of work involved in the particular transaction.  It has been argued that there will be no real saving to the purchaser and that the vendor will increase his asking price or his reserve by the amount of the fee he has bargained with his auctioneer.  I am confident this will not happen because the market prices which determine the price of a house will not tolerate an excessive asking or reserve price.  The vendor who would do this to a significant extent would find himself with his property left on his hands as potential purchasers would be put off by his inflated price.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, it is far less onerous for a house owner to pay agent's fees out of proceeds of sale than, as at present, having to raise them over and above the price of the house.  The latter might be more acceptable if the price were correspondingly reduced but I do not believe that this can be shown to happen in the normal case.  The price paid is usually the full market price regardless of liability to pay commission and I believe this situation will continue to obtain after this Bill is enacted. Furthermore, the proposal in this Bill will not inhibit those vendors who wish to do so from selling their houses without an agent.  At present vendors have no real reason for doing this. <Col N="88" /> I have no particular reason to make proposals to encourage people to sell their own houses privately, but on the other hand I do not think a system which actively discourages this is either economically or socially desirable.</P>
    <P>I will now pass to the second object of the Bill.  Auctioneers and house agents are required by law&mdash;the Auctioneers and House Agents Acts, 1947 and 1967&mdash;to maintain in the High Court a fidelity guarantee bond for £5,000 or to lodge this sum with the High Court.  In practice, almost all auctioneers and house agents are covered by bonds, collective or individual. The figure of £5,000 was fixed in 1967, the figure fixed in 1947 was £2,000.  The bond or deposit is required to provide a form of insurance for the public in view of the fact that clients' money is regularly held by auctioneers and house agents pending the completion of transactions.</P>
    <P>Having regard to appreciation in the value of property in recent years, the figure of £5,000 now appears to be too low.  This view was borne out during the Committee Stage in the Seanad when several Senators expressed the opinion that the increase to £7,500 originally proposed by me was too small.</P>
    <P>Having considered the points made by Senators I decided to introduce an amendment raising to £10,000 the amount of bond or deposit which must be maintained in the High Court.  I realise of course that any figure arrived at which is still within the bounds of reason can be faulted on the ground that it is insufficient to meet all possible contingencies.</P>
    <P>The fact is, of course, that in order to provide complete insurance against defalcations an elaborate compensation fund such as is operated by solicitors would be required.  In the course of discussions I have had with representatives of auctioneers and house agents I have suggested that consideration be given to establishing such a scheme and in due course I would be prepared to consider any proposals put forward in this regard.  I understand that the current premiums on <Col N="89" /> bonds for £5,000 are not unreasonable and that a collective bond at a very reasonable figure is maintained for members of the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers Institute.  I should add that no claims have been made against these bonds in the past five years.  The Auctioneers and House Agents Act, 1967, includes a provision requiring auctioneers and house agents to keep separate client accounts and stipulates the manner in which these accounts must be kept.  Despite these safeguards it was thought desirable at the time that Act was introduced to increase the amount of the guarantee bond or deposit from £2,000 to £5,000.</P>
    <P>In the context of the amending legislation which is now being introduced I consider that the amount of the bond or deposit should be increased to £10,000.</P>
    <P>I have now covered the two objects of the Bill in some detail and I accordingly commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank the Minister for his remarks of welcome to me as Opposition spokesman on Justice.  While I will be responsible and reasonable, I cannot guarantee the Minister that I will agree with him on every point.  I would imagine the Minister will agree with me that that is what opposition is about, so long as it is based on reason.</P>
      <P>It is the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party to support the principles of this Bill.  The Fianna Fáil Party supported the Bill in its entirely in Seanad Éireann.  During the discussion on the Arts Bill here concern was expressed that the Bill did not go far enough. With the indulgence of the Chair and the patience of the House it is my intention to express concern on this Bill.  Since becoming spokesman on Justice I have had an opportunity of examining the structure of the auctioneering trade and I believe we are missing an opportunity to restructure the whole field of auctioneering.  Since becoming spokesman a number of matters have been brought to my attention. Possibly between now and the Committee Stage I may table a number of amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="90" /> The Minister mentioned that the fidelity bond is to be increased from £5,000 to £10,000.  We welcome that proposal but, in common with quite a number of auctioneers who have expressed concern about the actual figure of £10,000, we believe it could have been increased to, say, £20,000.  We believe that within the auctioneering profession as a whole, assuming that the auctioneering profession would be a united whole or entity, there should be a common fund which would meet claims from time to time.  At present, as I understand it&mdash;the Minister and other Members of the House who are more experienced in this field than I am may correct me if I am wrong&mdash; the bond is confined to the amount expressed on the bond and no more and the person actually holding the bond is the only person liable.  This to my mind is a rather inequitable situation. A vendor, after the introduction of this Bill, may go along to an auctioneer and find himself in trouble relating to money he has given to that auctioneer.  Yet the vendor will have no action against the auctioneer except to the amount of his bond, although there may be a considerable sum of money in excess of the bond itself involved.  I am subject to correction on that point.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that there has been no claim against the bond for a number of years.  We are not in any way questioning the integrity of auctioneers. On the contrary.  It is proper that we should point out that there has been no claim against the bond of auctioners for the last four or five years because there is a fashionable point of view abroad, a doubt in the minds of people in regard to auctioneers.  Therefore, it is well to bring out that point.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister, if not on this Bill then at some time in the future, to consider the possibility of introducing a Bill consolidating the 1947 Act, the 1967 Act and this small but important measure which is before us today and to ensure that there will be a common fund from which compensation would be paid to an individual who may be hurt by some transaction. That is not a new principle. The Minister on becoming a Minister <Col N="91" /> had to give up his practice as a respected solicitor.  He is fully aware of the position relating to his profession. Solicitors pay an annual fee into a common compensation fund and if there are claims to be met this fund meets them.</P>
    <P>We welcome the transferring of the burden of paying the fees from the purchaser to the vendor.  We believe this is a socially just principle.  The Minister has also outlined the history of the fees relating to auctioneers.  He stated that the overall fee, with one exception, is 5 per cent.  Need I remind the House that the fee itself has no statutory effect?  Apparently it has arisen by custom, usage and convention.</P>
    <P>The exception to that principle is that in the Dublin area, and by private treaty, the fee is 2½ per cent.  In this instance the vendor pays the fee.  This Bill proposes to extend that principle nationwide.  I believe the vendor should pay the fee.  He is in a far stronger position to negotiate with the auctioneer on his own terms.  By definition the purchaser comes now into the transaction.  He is negotiating with the auctioneer and the vendor and, consequently, he is in a weaker position. The Bill, properly, seeks to cure that situation.  We welcome the curing of that situation.</P>
    <P>I must express my concern about the total inadequacy of legislation relating to the proper structuring and functioning of the auctioneers' and house agents' profession.  As we know, over the years this country has become a very attractive area from the point of view of industrialists.  People coming in here from other countries who wish to buy houses raise their eyebrows when they are asked, as purchasers, to pay the fees.  I would not be so much concerned about that in the sense that they are coming from countries where the practice is that the vendors pay the fees.  We are bringing out situation into line with that.  My concern and worry would be in relation to newly-weds, younger people setting out on a long and difficult economic road.  My concern would be for our own people, the <Col N="92" /> people I have just described who are purchasing a house.  In this instance it is proper that the vendor should be asked to pay the fee rather than the purchaser.</P>
    <P>I have studied the Bill and I have had a number of representations from auctioneers, particularly from the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers' Institute. May I state here and now that I did not meet them formally but in my capacity as a Deputy received a circular from them.  Every Deputy in the House received a letter from the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers' Institute dated 18th July, 1973, and headed &ldquo;Auctioneers and House Agents' Bill, 1973&rdquo;.  Basically it agrees with my thinking on the proposal before us.  I will quote a number of paragraphs, with your permission, Sir.  It states:</P>
    <P>Dear Deputy,</P>
    <P>I am writing to you on behalf of the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers' Institute which has a membership of about 800, and represents practically all the long-established Auctioneers in the country.  I feel, therefore, that the views of my Institute might be of interest to you in considering the above Bill.</P>
    <P>We welcome the views of this organisation and, indeed, of any other organisation who may wish to offer a point of view in relation to this legislation or any other legislation that comes before this House.  The view expressed in this letter is of benefit and help to us as Deputies in coming to our decisions on matters of this nature.  The second paragraph reads:</P>
    <P>My Institute does not oppose either section of the above Bill and has already met with the Minister for Justice and explained firstly the desirability of having the amount of bond increased from the proposed £7,500 to as much as £20,000, and secondly the obvious need for some test of professional fitness to be applied to applicants for Auctioneers' Licences.</P>
    <P>Here we have a responsible auctioneers' organisation asking us to consider legislation in regard to some test of professional fitness to be applied to applicants for auctioneers' licences. <Col N="93" /> This is an extremely frank and honest request from this institute.  To point out that all is not lost in the auctioneering profession, for the benefit of the House I might quote the penultimate paragraph in the letter.  It goes as follows:</P>
    <P>For a number of years the Institute has provided a course of professional studies for student members, and prior to that the system of articled apprenticeship obtained.  It has always been the aim of the Institute (formerly the Irish Auctioneers and Estate Agents Association) to maintain the highest possible standards of professional competence and conduct. The Institute has, from time to time, and especially on the occasion of the introduction of new or amending legislation affecting Auctioneers and House Agents, approached various Ministers for Justice with a view to having suitable legislation on the point of professional fitness.</P>
    <P>There is another paragraph in the letter suggesting an amendment to the Bill before the House at the moment. It is our intention, again with the Minister's co-operation, between now and Committee Stage to examine very seriously that proposed amendment to the Bill.  I might put the Minister on notice that we will be looking for a fortnight or three weeks to discuss and consider possible amendments.</P>
    <P>The 1966 Bill did not become law until 1967.  It might sound rather extraordinary to say that in the 1967 Act there was enshrined for the first time the principle of the keeping and preservation of accounts, clients' accounts, priority of claims to clients' money, and so on.  In view of the call by the Irish Auctioneers and Valuers' Institute in the letter sent by them to me in my capacity as a Deputy, we might consider other reforms also.</P>
    <P>I have already called for a consolidating Bill in relation to the whole field of auctioneers.  Our thinking on this matter is that, in addition to the reforms suggested already, consideration should be given to the possibility of a board being set up under legislation to perform the functions in the Bill, the setting up and maintenance <Col N="94" /> of a register, and the establishment and carrying on of schemes of education and training courses.  The institute, the organisation of which I have most knowledge, is indulging in this proper type of activity.  This lends status to the calling and gives the type of person coming into the profession an opportunity of giving himself a very thorough grounding in his calling.</P>
    <P>In addition to the establishment and carrying on of schemes of education and training courses we would suggest the provision and supervision of courses and lectures for the further education of auctioneers and house agents, the establishment and carrying on of schemes for the giving of scholarships, bursaries, prizes and other awards to persons wishing to become auctioneers and house agents, the holding and organising of conferences for house agents and conferences and exhibitions relating to auctioneers and house agents and their duties.  This appears to be part of the function of the programme of the Irish Auctioneers' and Valuers' Institute.  We welcome that.  This should be enshrined in future consolidating legislation along with the principle in the Bill concerning the transfer of auctioneers' fees from the purchaser to the vendor.  That does not seem to be acceptable at this time.  I would urge the Minister to activate his Department within the next 12 months.  Maybe I am asking too much of him now.  I know his Department are working to full capacity in relation to other matters.  But I would urge him to consider these proposals, proposals which are not specifically my own but arose out of discussions within our party.</P>
    <P>As the Minister says, there is nothing in the Bill which in any way changes the fee.  It is not a statutory fee; it never was and, as stated already, it is merely a matter of custom.  Again the vendor is in the position to make the best practical deal in regard to the rate of charges.  The vendor would be in a stronger position to negotiate a fee appropriate in the circumstances.  The vendor and the auctioneer are better matched in the market than the auctioneer and purchaser.  The give and <Col N="95" /> take of the market will ensure that a negotiating fee can, with the least possible danger of injury to the persons involved, be negotiated between the vendor and the auctioneer.</P>
    <P>The manner of payment proposed in this Bill, as I understand it from my researches into this field, is not a new principle.  There is a principle enshrined in the Revisionary Leases (Ground Rents) Act, 1967, similar to the provision in this Bill.  That section provides that in future any contract which requires one party to a lease to pay the costs of another party would be void. The principle, therefore, is precisely the same as that in this Bill.  The principle is that the person retaining services or ordering the work is the person who should pay for it.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the scale of fees, the Minister mentioned the Prices Act. I would mention the Prices Commission. It would be very difficult to write a scale of charges into the statute. Ideally this would be the correct way to do it, but due to the variations in the type of property and services any fixation of charges would be more appropriate to the National Prices Commission.  There is no reason why the National Prices Commission should not look into the position in regard to other professions.  I am not isolating the auctioneers for special treatment; quite the contrary.</P>
    <P>In his speech in the Seanad the Minister mentioned, directly or indirectly, that this measure was part of the campaign for the control of prices in which his colleagues were engaged in relation to other matters.  With respect to the Minister, I do not follow that line of thinking in regard to the house purchase field.  If the Minister considers this Bill, as he mentioned in his opening remarks, to be in some way anti-inflationary, I suggest that that is a wrong interpretation of the situation.  Auctioneers are genuine, honest and <i>bona fide</i>.  Because of the inadequacy of the deposit, about which we have spoken, and the manner in which a person can become an auctioneer, it is fair to say that in some instances licences have been taken out by certain individuals to deal <Col N="96" /> with one particular transaction.  I have no evidence myself to this effect, but somebody informed me of this recently.</P>
    <P>If one is discussing present standards and looking for a proper and efficient administration, one must set down very rigid rules relating to the profession itself.  If one has not that rigidity one will not have a proper profession.  The profession should be very difficult to enter.  We should have the same standard of entry into this profession as we have for others&mdash;dare I mention the legal profession to auctioneers&mdash;the legal profession, accountants and doctors.  This would lend greater status in the eyes of the people to the whole auctioneering profession and I use the word &ldquo;profession&rdquo; deliberately.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the House for listening to my remarks with patience. There are a number of my colleagues who are members of the auctioneering profession and they will no doubt give their views and bring their considerable knowledge to bear on this Bill. They may disagree with some of the views expressed by me on the Bill.  We are supporting this Bill and request the Minister to give us more than normal time to discuss within our own party the possibility of amendments, amendments which I have already stated we may table, but we reserve the right to take that action.</P>

      <P>I find myself in disagreement with Deputy Andrews on one matter and that is whether this Bill is anti-inflationary.  The Minister in his introductory speech on the Bill gave figures for a typical £7,000 sale which would cover many family home purchases by young married couples at today's prices.  I have some experience of the purchasing and selling of property in the way of my profession. It has been for a number of years always assumed that if a person asked a solicitor or lawyer what it was going to cost beyond the purchase price&mdash; this is before the last budget&mdash;the usual reply given was: &ldquo;Allow for another 10 per cent&rdquo;.  That is a rather wicked addition for a young married couple, going possibly into their first real home, to have to meet on top of <Col N="97" /> the price that they pay for their house. That is made up of the auctioneer's commission which they as purchasers have to pay, the solicitors' fees, and sometimes counsel's fees if the matter is of some difficulty, the stamp duty, and the matter that was not specifically referred to by the Minister, the legal fees and stamp duty associated with the mortgage on the purchase. By and large, the average case has meant another 10 per cent.  Where property is for sale you may have competing bidders.  What people are concerned with at the bidding stage is the market price of the property, but when they are finished there, they then have to provide 5 per cent on top of that for the estate agent or auctioneer, and that works out at approximately 50 per cent on the added cost of a sale.</P>
      <P>I think it is only right that the person who is selling the property and getting the benefit of the money should be made responsible, and I would certainly be all for this Bill on that ground.  I would also be in favour of it particularly because of its anti-inflationary effect, as it does not add to the price of a house and, more important, does not add to the price of the house to that section of society that is least able to bear it.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Andrews has correctly pointed out, there is no legal sanction for the 5 per cent.  It has grown up over the years as a matter of practice and is accepted in business and trade, and one can probably say in many circumstances very unhappily accepted, with no option but to accept it.  If one can call that an acceptance, then that is the meaning of the acceptance given to this rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us throw our minds back a little bit.  The people who used to buy and sell property were people with capital resources.  A certain section of society were the property owners.  Today every man, no matter what grade he is in society, no matter how humble his circumstances are, is a possible purchaser. I think, although it is not strictly relevant in this Bill, it is an argument for the transfer from purchaser to vendor of the responsibility for the fee.  Possibly the reason for the <Col N="98" /> 5 per cent having been accepted, is the class of person who was involved in buying and selling property in the past. I do not think it fits in with today's terminology or practice or with the type of people who are now involved in the buying and selling of property.</P>
    <P>In my experience valuers and auctioneers do very good work, and particularly in the sale of chattels, which is excluded from this Bill, an enormous amount of work has to be done by auctioneers and valuers quite outside what has to be done in many cases concerning the sale of property, because, basically, there is a big backup service to the sale of an estate, a factory layout or a factory estate.  That expense in most cases is not taken out of the auctioneer's commission.  It is a net commission to his own pocket, because the practice is that where an auctioneer incurs expenses he submits a bill, in addition to his 5 per cent, for his expenses and outlay.  I do not know of any profession that has that situation.  This is a matter for prices, but it is also a matter for us in this House to give a reason for endorsing the transfer of this 5 per cent to the vendor rather than to the purchaser.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>While, as Deputy Andrews has said, we support this Bill in principle, many of us have our own opinions on it.  The first question I would ask is: why the haste in bringing in the Bill?  As has been pointed out by the Minister, the Prices Commission are at the moment studying the fee structure of the auctioneering profession.  I would have thought it would have been wiser to wait until we heard from this body and then have a proper re-assessment of the whole auctioneering profession or business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume the pressure has come as a result of the publicity given to very big sales which have taken place in Dublin in recent times.  In the newspapers you read about some lucky auctioneer in the city selling a pub maybe for £150,000 or £200,000, and everybody suddenly starts calculating, at the rate of 5 per cent, how much he cleans up on this.  However, some of us who are engaged in auctioneering know <Col N="99" /> that it is not just that easy.  Some of the Dublin firms have done remarkably well in recent years and more luck to them, but this is not at all the case with regard to rural auctioneers.  The Minister, who comes from a rural constituency, would appreciate this.</P>
    <P>There are over 2,000 auctioneers in this country.  Many of them in the west and south of Ireland and the midlands are trying to make a living.  It should be remembered that a house which would be selling for £15,000 here in Dublin would command only £7,000 down the country.  Even though the house in Dublin at £15,000 is sold by private treaty there are fees of 2½ per cent, which is approximately £375, while fees for the house in the country will be approximately £350.</P>
    <P>Most of the contributions in the debate seem to have been about houses and newly married people.  I appreciate that in Dublin auctioneering firms, with few exceptions, act as agents for the large building concerns but this is not the case in the country.  While house property is not a big factor in our business&mdash;we deal principally with land&mdash;most of the houses we sell are second-hand houses. Many of them are sold because the original owners who purchased them as new houses are unable to meet mortgage commitments or occasionally there may be hardship cases where a young widow may have no option but to sell her house.  I should have thought that in such cases the purchaser would be in a far better position to meet the fees than the vendor.  Surely we are not so foolish as to believe that a big development company which employs an auctioneer to sell its houses will not add the auctioneer's fees to the net price of the houses.  Those concerns will not be at a loss with regard to the fees.</P>
    <P>A point has been made that since the vendor will be the person employing the auctioneer he will be in a much stronger position to negotiate the fee.  I find the fact that he should negotiate the fee very interesting.  I do not mean any disrespect to the <Col N="100" /> Minister, but how many people who employ a solicitor, barrister&mdash;either senior or junior counsel&mdash;an architect, doctor or chartered accountant negotiate a fee?  I have never succeeded in doing it nor have I heard of anyone else doing so.  Why is there all the emphasis on negotiating a fee with the auctioneer&mdash;in other words, why hammer the auctioneer on the fee? I do not see why there should be negotiations with the auctioneer about the fee.  The profession are offering a service which the public want and they are entitled to their fees.  They earn them more often than people believe and with much greater effort. It has been the accepted custom here, particularly in country areas, that the purchaser pays the fees.  This is also the custom in some other countries. It is customary in some parts of Germany and France but is not the case in England.  In some places the purchaser pays half the fee and the vendor pays the other half.</P>
    <P>In my business I have dealt mainly with Irish people and, strangely enough, I have heard little cribbing about paying fees.  I fail to see where the tremendous pressure for this change has been coming from.  I realise a change is necessary but not in this way.  Admittedly when I sell property to English people occasionally they complain and say this is not the custom in their country.  Continentals or Americans do not complain about it but accept what is customary here.  I do not think we should make this change just because English people complain.  In my experience Irish people have accepted this custom and there has not been any tremendous pressure for this measure. I realise that changes must come in every walk of life but they should come in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>Some previous speakers inferred that the 5 per cent rate was very high.  It is not high by international standards, although I am not saying that everyone who sells a business for £250,000 should get 5 per cent.  There are countries in the EEC where there are fees of 7 per cent or 8 per cent. I am not advocating that the fee here should be 8 per cent but I am merely <Col N="101" /> pointing out that by international standards 5 per cent is not as exorbitant as some people would have us believe.  If the vendor is put in the position where he can negotiate the fee, it will adversely affect many auctioneers in small rural communities who are having a difficult time even now.</P>
    <P>The greatest fear about changing the system of payment is that there will be a tremendous amount of horse-trading within the profession.  Auctioneering concerns spring up practically overnight.  This is completely legal and the people concerned are within their rights.  If a person knows his brother will be selling a farm for £20,000 or £30,000 he can apply for an auctioneer's licence, sell the farm and stay in business just for that one sale.  When the vendor is responsible for payment of the fee there will be an enormous amount of horse-trading. It may mean that reputable firms of auctioneers who have given good service to the public&mdash;many of them have carried out property valuations under CPOs for which they may not have been paid&mdash;will have to compete with a fly-by-night person who may have just taken out a licence.  The situation could arise that an established firm might canvass business from a client but a newcomer might offer to sell the property at a lower rate of commission.  There will be a general lowering of standards.  The people who will cut the fees will not stay in business but, unfortunately, they will put good firms out of business when they embark on this kind of venture.  It has been admitted in the statements made here that the vendor will be in a position to negotiate. While that might be all right if he is negotiating with one firm only, it may happen that he is negotiating with many firms and this will be of benefit to nobody.  It will not do any good to the service which has been given during the years by the auctioneering profession.</P>
    <P>There are small auctioneers throughout the country who are barely able to make ends meet.  The last speaker said that auctioneers are about the only people who can <Col N="102" /> submit a bill for expenses on the completion of a transaction.  Of course, an auctioneer can submit a bill for expenses but it is only on very few occasions that he will be paid.  Advertising today is very costly.  If the daily or provincial newspapers were to disclose the extent of the revenue they receive from auctioneers for advertising it would be realised how much advertising costs auctioneers.  If a property is sold such expense is likely to be recouped from the client but if for some reason it is not possible to make a sale, there may be no possibility of the auctioneer being able to recoup the cost of advertising.  Many properties are advertised but are not sold. This may be due to difficulties concerning title or the client may place an exorbitant reserve on the property which makes it impossible for the auctioneer to sell it.  Apart from these difficulties, the person may take away the business from an auctioneer if a sale has not been made within a couple of months.  It will be seen, therefore, that auctioneers must carry much advertising for which they are not paid.  Many people would be surprised at the amount of expense that is involved even in a small firm.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to assert that we are the only profession who submit a bill for expenses of this nature and are paid accordingly.  An auctioneer is lucky if he is paid even a percentage of the expenses involved.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Andrews has suggested, the way to tackle the problems involved is to form an auctioneers' board that would control the entire business.  This should be feasible. There is no reason why the auctioneering profession should not be entitled to run their own profession in the same way as Bord na gCapall control half-bred horses and Bord na gCon control the greyhound industry. Such a board could maintain a proper register and have some control regarding people entering the profession so that there would not be the situation whereby anybody can apply for a licence.  That situation has led to the present position of overcrowding in the profession.  Such a board, too, could be responsible for school leavers who wished to join the profession.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> Of course, our institute are doing a very good job but they are limited in what they can do.  A properly constituted board should be able to do an excellent job on the educational side of the business.  This is the most important aspect of the business because if there is adequate education young auctioneers will be able to give far better service.  Auctioneers should be trained properly but by that I do not mean simply that they are able to stand up on a box and conduct a sale. Their training should include surveying, evaluation and many other ancillary sides of the profession.  This can only be achieved by the setting up of a board such as I have mentioned. Such board, too, should be empowered to re-examine the question of the fees structure so that they could make recommendations to the Minister for sanction or otherwise.  I urge the Minister to have a further examination of this question particularly when the Prices Commission make their report.</P>
    <P>The Bill is totally inadequate to tackle the problems that we believe should be tackled.  It is not broad enough in itself.  We hope to bring in amendments which may benefit the profession as well as the public.  We are conscious of the fact that we are providing a service and that we are at the mercy of the public.  Our aim in the profession and in the institute, of which I am a member, is to improve the service we are providing in every way possible.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will see his way to setting up a body such as we have suggested.  This is necessary in particular to control the numbers entering the profession and to eliminate the fly-by-nights who survive within the profession for only a year or two.  My party are supporting the Bill but some of us have our own ideas in regard to it and I hope that the Minister will find these ideas helpful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Deputies who contributed to the debate and for the ideas they put forward.  The burden of the contributions from the other <Col N="104" /> side of the House is that an opportunity has been missed on the occasion of this Bill to restructure the entire auctioneering profession.  This case has been made to me already by the Auctioneers' Institute.  They wrote to me on much the same lines as they wrote to Deputy Andrews.  I will deal with that correspondence in a few moments.</P>
      <P>I am glad that it is accepted by both sides of the House that the basic principle of the Bill, that is the transferring of the liability to pay auctioneers' fees from the purchaser to the vendor, is just and equitable. Indeed, it is so just and equitable that it was never in contention and the auctioneers through their institute&mdash;I emphasise that it was through their institute&mdash;conceded that because they recognised that the Bill did not seek in any way to impinge on their position in regard to how they operate their business or as to what fees they charge.  It is not within the scope of this Bill, which is a limited measure nor is it within the scope of my Department, to move in that area but it was undesirable socially that the more vulnerable or weaker party in a transaction would have to pay a fee, a fee which by custom and not by any statutory basis is, with one exception, at the rate of 5 per cent.  When liability is transferred to the vendor negotiations will take place between the vendor and the auctioneer as to the level of fees to be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Barrett took me up on this and asked why should auctioneers be put in the position in which they are subject to negotiation by their clients when other professions are not in such a position.  The reason is that the fees chargeable by the other professions are geared according to the size and complexity of the transaction whereas, in the case of auctioneers, the custom has grown up whereby the fee of 5 per cent is charged irrespective of the size of the transaction.  It is a flat fee and it takes no account of the vastly increased values of property in recent years.  In many cases it is not proportionate to the work the <Col N="105" /> auctioneer puts into the particular transaction.  There may be a minority of cases in which five per cent would not be an adequate fee but there is nothing whatever to prevent an auctioneer negotiating under the new regime which this Act will bring in. There will be nothing to prevent the auctioneer charging a larger fee when he finds himself faced with a difficult and complex sale.</P>
    <P>The level of fees is being investigated at the moment by the National Prices Commission which operates under the aegis of the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It is not primarily my concern.  In their investigation the Commission will, of course, pay full heed to the representations of the auctioneering bodies and I have no doubt they will arrive at an equitable fee structure, bearing in mind the needs of the public.  It is not correct to say that, merely because negotiations will follow from the proposals in this Bill, I am asking auctioneers to accept a position inferior to that of other professions. That does not follow since they are not in the same position because they now charge a flat fee while other professional charges are on a sliding scale geared to the complexities of the particular transaction.</P>
    <P>There may be undesirable professional consequences in the sense that horse-trading may result because auctioneers may price cut one another and inferior standards may be introduced. This may happen to some extent but it will be to a very limited extent, and it will be compensated for in another area to which I shall refer in a moment.  It will happen only to a limited extent.  I am prepared to give full credence to the commonsense of the man selling his house; he will not employ a fly-by-night auctioneer or the auctioneer with no back-up facilities, who is in the business in a half-hearted way as a side-line and, because of that, can offer an attractive cut price since he has no overheads.  The majority of vendors will go to a reputable firm long established in business, whose integrity is beyond doubt and whose experience in the technical aspects of the business is superior to that of their <Col N="106" /> competitors.  That is the type of firm which will get the vast bulk of the business.  Occasionally a person, for reasons of cupidity, will no doubt engage the fly-by-night and he will suffer accordingly, but word does not be too long spreading as to the proficiency, or otherwise, of those engaged in the profession.</P>
    <P>Another reason why I think there will be a positive advantage in this for the profession is that there are too many <i>ad hoc</i> auctioneers at the moment because of the present practice of the fee being paid by the purchaser.  It has happened&mdash;Deputy Andrews indicated that it had been brought to his attention and I can confirm what he said&mdash; that a person has taken out an auctioneer's licence for the purpose of effecting a single sale.  That usually happens in the context of a farmer selling a substantial farm.  He has an articulate and energetic neighbour and he suggests to the neighbour that he should take out an auctioneer's licence and sell his farm for him, thereby getting 5 per cent on the sale.  This has happened. The auctioneer collects the 5 per cent from the purchaser.  If the obligation was on the vendor, I doubt if he would ask his neighbour to take out a licence and then negotiate the fee with him. That simply would not arise and the figure of 2,000 auctioneers which Deputy Barrett mentioned would be vastly reduced.  Only 800 of the 2,000 are members of the institute.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable increase in recent years in the number of licences granted and this increase is due to the number of <i>ad hoc</i> auctioneers who have taken out licences for single transactions; they get a taste of easy money and they continue in business in an informal and half-hearted way.  As well as that, people who had been toying with the idea of becoming auctioneers and who learned of the possible restriction on entry into the profession decided to beat the proposed legislation and took out licences.  This may be another reason why the number is so high at the moment.  Many auctioneers are very reputable people who carry on a reputable business, with very high standards.  I offer the reasons I have <Col N="107" /> given as an explanation as to why there has been such an increase in the number of new auctioneers in recent years.</P>
    <P>This brings me now to the question of the control of entry into the profession. It brings me back to the basic case made by Deputy Andrews and Deputy Barrett that an opportunity is being missed to restructure the profession and consolidate the existing legislation.  I sympathise with their point of view and I agree with the desirability of doing what they urge, but I submit this is not the proper Bill under which to do it.  The Bill is of a very limited character.  It set out originally basically to do one thing, namely, to prevent the transfer of the liability for fees to the purchaser and to make the vendor liable. It was felt that the bond was not a realistic figure and if an amendment in that regard could be introduced in this Bill there would be no inconsistency in taking this opportunity to increase the bond.  I shall explain later how the figure was arrived at.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the concern on the other side of the House for providing a new structure for the profession. This will be a large-scale operation involving provision for recruitment to the profession and subsequent training. It will involve deciding where the academic side of the training will be provided, by whom and at what cost. It will involve deciding on practical training and apprenticeship.  That, in turn, will involve deciding over how many years the apprenticeship should extend, how the qualifications of the masters will be determined, remembering that there are at present in the profession, and this is common case, people who are themselves inadequately trained because they are, as I said earlier <i>ad hoc</i> auctioneers who take out licences for single sales and then continue in business.  All these matters will have to be examined carefully. When the new entrant has been suitably trained decisions will have to be taken as to the standards required in examining that training.  Decisions will have to be taken as to who will provide the examination facilities, <Col N="108" /> who is to be the judge, and when the new entrant finally enters the profession there will be the whole question of control and discipline, the formulation of standards and the enforcement of those standards.  It is a very big area.</P>
    <P>Because of the increasing volume of property transactions of immense value and the increasing sophistication of the nature of these sales and all the financial sophistications now being employed in the property market area, the need is becoming more urgent to have the auctioneering profession capable of answering the demands of the day.  This subject has been mentioned many times recently and one effect of this was to tempt many persons to take out auctioneering licences in case they might need them, in advance of legislation which might restrict their entry into the business.  I do not think this Bill is the proper vehicle in which to introduce changes of that magnitude. The amount of research that will be needed to determine exactly what is required will be considerable.  Deputy Andrews put his finger on one problem, the resources available in the Department to do the preliminary spadework.  I do not concede that this would be the sole task of the Department of Justice.  The auctioneering profession should be involved in this and possibly do the bulk of the work.</P>
    <P>In this connection I should like to mention the correspondence and conversations I had with the profession, principally with the Auctioneers and Valuers Institute during the time this Bill was in the Seanad and subsequently. The correspondence is, I think, of the same tenor as that received by Deputy Andrews.  The institute is concerned at the standard of entrants.  They are entitled to be concerned because they ensure that entrants into membership of their institute have certain standards.  They have to serve an apprenticeship and undergo certain formal training so that when they come into the business they do so with specialised knowledge. Speaking from the strength that position gives them, the institute wanted me to introduce an amendment to this Bill which, in effect, would limit future <Col N="109" /> entrance to the auctioneering profession by providing that future entrants would have to serve an apprenticeship with a licensed auctioneer, the apprenticeship to be not less than three years or have <i>bona fide</i> service as an assistant for not less than three years.</P>
    <P>I have sympathy with the thinking behind that proposition but was unable to accept it because it was altogether too simplistic a solution for what is a very difficult problem.  I indicated in further correspondence that it was too simple an amendment and that it would have the effect of limiting entry to the profession without providing any guarantee that the new entrants would have any real training because all it said was that they had to have an apprenticeship or a <i>bona fide</i> assistantship with a practising auctioneer.  There was nothing to show the standard of the practising auctioneer or to control the standard of instruction given during apprenticeship or the type of work entrusted to an assistant.  They had to be <i>bona fide</i> but that amendment could allow in members who would not be properly trained, and without achieving what it set out to achieve, could restrict entrance to the profession.  For that reason I indicated to the institute that I was not prepared to accept the amendment at this stage.</P>
    <P>I respectfully suggest to Deputy Andrews who has indicated that he is considering, in consultation with his colleagues, amendments for the next Stage of this Bill that I would be opposed to amendments of that type because they would not solve the problem that he and I want to solve. I think the cure can only come from a detailed restructuring of the profession. The spadework for this must be done by the auctioneers themselves. I indicated this to the institute and they agree to make submissions along these lines, submissions covering qualification for entry to the profession and submissions which would also deal with the matter of controlling the operation of the profession when the standards have been improved and are being practised.</P>
    <P>I shall be glad to receive submissions <Col N="110" /> from any party interested.  I share Deputy Andrews' concern that in this House we should always be ready to receive the views of people interested in our problems so that we can deal with them from a fully informed or better informed position. Any other persons interested in the future of the auctioneering profession wishing to make representations or submissions on any of these matters are very welcome to do so and I look forward to receiving their views.  That is why at this stage and in this Bill &mdash;bearing in mind that it is a limited Bill to correct what I consider was a social injustice&mdash;it would be inappropriate to attempt to go further and attempt to restructure the auctioneering business generally.</P>
    <P>As regards the bond, I concede that as a matter of pure logic, having regard to the size of transactions and the amount of money handled by auctioneers, protection to the extent of £10,000 is hardly realistic.  But in addition to that protection, there is also the requirement that separate accounts be kept and that before the certificate of qualification is renewed each year in court an accountant's certificate has to be handed in to show that this requirement has been complied with.  That is the greatest protection to the customer&mdash;that the books are being properly kept, that there is an accountant in the background to oversee their keeping. Nevertheless, we felt the bond should make some concession towards the decreasing value of money and the increasing volume of transactions.  It was for this reason that the figure, after hearing the views expressed in the Seanad, is now set at £10,000.  It is a substantial sum of money bearing in mind that the person who is likely to default is probably a person who is not doing a substantial amount of business but may be practising in a half-hearted way and the amount of the defalcation will be proportionately reduced.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise again what I said in my opening remarks and which was endorsed by Deputy Andrews and Deputy Barrett that in the last five years there has been no <Col N="111" /> claim against auctioneers' bonds.  This is a remarkable tribute to the integrity of those in the business.  It consoles me in putting forward to the House the figure of £10,000 as being the appropriate figure for a bond.  One of the arguments advanced for increasing the bond to say £20,000&mdash;even that might not be a logical figure because there is no logical figure in the absence of a compensation fund&mdash;attracted me although it was not conclusive.  It was that the premium on a bond of that size could be heavy.  It might be impossible for a would-be entrant to the profession to obtain a bond of that magnitude.  Through no lack of integrity, through no lack of capital a person might find it hard or the insurance companies might begin to be chary of issuing bonds in that amount. I felt that to increase the bond to £20,000 would tend to build a closed shop at the moment for those already in without in any way getting any real benefit for the public.</P>
    <P>I think that the entrance to the profession should be determined by a consideration other than the consideration which would arise in that context.  It should be determined by proper training and an examination system.  I agree with Deputy Andrews that real and full protection for the public is a compensation fund such as is maintained by the Incorporated Law Society.  I do not think that such a fund can be set up or that it would be proper to set it up until such time as the profession is restructured and reorganised and possibly given a statutory life of its own.  Possibly it could be administered departmentally at the moment but this is a task I would be inclined to shy away from.  The need for it, happily&mdash;and this is a tribute to the integrity and honesty of the auctioneers&mdash;has not arisen over the last five years.  I do not think, because of the requirements to separately account for clients' moneys, there will be any change in that happy position.  Accordingly, I commend the Bill as it stands with the bond at £10,000.</P>
    <P>My reason for not wanting to expand the debate at this stage is that <Col N="112" /> the implications of the expansion are so large that this is not a suitable Bill in which to do it.  The amount of time, investigation and preparatory work will be very considerable and I do not think that it is of a nature to permit this Bill to be amended.  In conclusion, I should like to thank the Deputies for their very helpful contributions.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £5,627,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1974, for the salaries and expenses of the Offices of the Minister for Lands and of the Irish Land Commission.</P>

      <P>I feel that we should produce a land policy which will ensure realistic pensions and an active Land Commission.  Such a policy should be produced to ensure that the men who will be staying on the land will make the best use of it and be in a position to get full control of it.  Too often we have seen good productive land, as the owner gets older, falling in production.  This continues until such time as the new owner takes charge. Such a process could continue for a few generations but we cannot afford to have the luxury of that.  Neither can we afford to have land set for a period of time until it is taken over by a new owner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this age of the EEC we should produce a realistic pension scheme which will encourage older farmers to retire and hand over the running of <Col N="113" /> their farm to young men.  In this regard I should like to compliment Macra na Feirme on producing a booklet on this subject in the last few days.  This organisation has been studying the problem for many years and has now produced a very comprehensive document which covers this matter in great detail.</P>
    <P>The last scheme introduced was realistic at the time but it meant the start of inflation.  The pensions which were set then were absolute and could not be increased.  The upshot was that if a person waited for a year or so he found that what he would be getting would be very small.  With the way inflation has gone it has not proved realistic for people to hand over their land to the Land Commission.  If we introduce a pension scheme we must tie it in with a cost of living index so that a pension given to a retiring farmer will rise with the increase in the cost of living.  We should make sure that the pension given to the retiring farmer will have the same purchasing power in ten years' time as at the time he hands over his land.</P>
    <P>We have a good opportunity of producing viable farms, particularly in the West of Ireland.  if such a scheme is introduced.  Macra na Feirme, according to <i>The Irish Press</i> of today, has discovered that there are no successors to take over 50,000 farms.  This is a very startling piece of information. Those 50,000 farms are owned by farmers of 55 years of age and over. The absence of successors in the West of Ireland has been a big social problem for many years and one which will have to be solved.  There is no need to go into the reason for the late marriages but the fact remains that there are no successors for this big number of holdings.</P>
    <P>What is more serious is the fact that there are a number of apparent successors&mdash;sons, nephews and cousins&mdash; who are living away and are not interested in returning to take over ownership of such holdings.  Here we have an opportunity of producing a policy which will encourage the older people to relinquish their holdings before the running of their farms becomes a burden to them.  If such farmers could be <Col N="114" /> guaranteed a reasonable pension I believe a big number of them would be willing to sell the land to the Land Commission.  I believe that the idea of leasing has a lot to recommend it.  The person taking over the land as a security will have it for a number of years.  Macra na Feirme have advocated a 12-year period.  This period is necessary in connection with any farm plan.  Any farmer knows that if he wants to change his system of farming the change-over will take three or four years.  This may mean a change from dry stock to milk production, or from milk production to the rearing of calves.</P>
    <P>A person of 16 or 18 years of age may feel he has no future on an uneconomic farm, but he may see a farm nearby whose owner is getting old. Some encouragement should be given to young people.  They should be given a chance to lease land.  The land could, perhaps, be given to them completely if the Land Commission could buy it. The young people would then stay on the land.  It is sad to see people reared on the land who believe there is no future for them in farming.</P>
    <P>In the west of Ireland much extra land could be brought into production. In large areas of the west the land is dry.  Plenty of fertilisers are needed to ensure extra production.  Reclamation is not necessary because the land is already dry.  The land in the west is usually overstocked.  Store cattle are reared.  It seems advantageous to the farmers there to have the greatest possible number of cattle on the land. There is a demand for store cattle. Farmers from the eastern part of the country like beasts in store condition. When fattened up they are suitable for the English trade or for the factories. Something must be done to improve production in that part of the country.</P>
    <P>We know that there has always been a problem in regard to the transfer of ownership of land.  A father may be afraid of handing over to a younger man.  A young man may have ideas which seem a little wild to his father.  A transfer of ownership is absolute.  The young man has complete control.  This has some detrimental effects.  On some occasions <Col N="115" /> there could be disagreements when the young man marries and the older people cannot agree with his wife, or <i>vice versa</i>.  On some occasions old people have been put in what was known as the &ldquo;county home&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is another point in relation to ownership.  A man may be in his late fifties or early sixties and have worked his farm for 25 or 30 years. He may suddenly sign over the farm and a young man then takes over. The takeover is a big shock to the older man.  He has no say in the running of the farm from there on. The young man may be very thoughtful and consult him.  He may try to arrange matters so that the old man has some say in the running of the farm, but the shock is still there and the older man may be inclined to retire completely.  He may feel that he has no great aim in life from there on. He may take no interest in the proceedings. This is a social and economic fact which has a bad effect on him.</P>
    <P>Macra na Feirme have suggested that the father should lease the land to the son for a specified period.  This would give the young man full control of the land, but the older man would realise that he still owned the land; if anything went wrong at least the farm would not have gone from his ownership.  His home would also be safe.  Perhaps more research should have been done into leasing.  There may be difficulties regarding credit. Most farms look for credit at some stage or other.  Farm leasing, as at present constituted, does not give the bank manager or the ACC sufficient security.  The young man does not get a chance.  The Government or the Dáil are expected to create a situation where the finance houses would look favourably on the prospect of giving credit in such cases.  Some system should be devised to provide security for the finance houses giving credit to the sons leasing the farms.</P>
    <P>A great deal of thought has gone into this recommendation.  It is based on the idea of a viable farm.  We must all think in terms of a viable farm because for too long we have had uneconomic <Col N="116" /> farms.  The word &ldquo;uneconomic&rdquo; does not really convey the hardships that many farmers had to suffer. Their income was very small and we are seeing the result of that now when there are 50,000 farmers, aged 55 or over, with no successors.</P>
    <P>The leasing system would ensure that there would be an income for the father.  One reason why farmers would not sign over their farms was that they would have no income.  Quite a number of them signed over simply in order to get the old age pension.  I did not think it was right to see a man who had been independent all his life signing over to go on social security. He was entitled to something more than that.  Under this system the father will have an income from the land. He will still have his wife to support and possibly some younger members of the family.  He will still have ownership of the land.  I hope the death duties aspect will be taken into account when the White Paper is published because if, when the older man dies, there are big death duties it will defeat the whole object of the exercise.</P>
    <P>In Scandinavian countries it is usual for a son to buy the farm from his father.  This leaves the older man independent but it also creates grave problems.  I found there that farms were usually up to 80 per cent in debt. I visited and stayed in the homes of some of those farmers.  They would almost boast of the amount of money they could borrow from the bank.  In Denmark it was the Land Bank.  Those farmers were very deeply in debt. Where there is such a lot of debt there will be very frequent changes of ownership.  In the late fifties, when I was there, ownership of land in those countries extended on average only over 15 years.  One of the farmers with whom I stayed came over to stay with me for a few days a couple of years ago.  He had sold the farm on which I had stayed and moved to a smaller farm a mile down the road.  This happened because he had a very bad illness and was not able to do much work for a whole year.  After that his financial position was such that he had <Col N="117" /> no option but to sell the land, settle some of his debts and buy a smaller farm.</P>
    <P>If we move towards a new policy of farm ownership I hope we will never reach the stage where if a person is in bad health for a period he will have to sell his farm and buy a smaller one. We are moving a certain distance in this direction without any policy on the part of the Land Commission.  I would say the period of ownership of land in the eastern part of the country is a much shorter period than in the west.  In my part of the country 50 or 60 per cent of the farms sold this year will be re-sold in a period of 5 or 6 years.  One of the reasons for that is that a person who buys a farm usually has to borrow some money.  He needs a certain amount of capital to stock the farm.  He does not anticipate any difficulties. Anybody connected with land knows that one plans ahead but completely unforeseen difficulties may arise.  This year, for instance, nobody could have foreseen the difficulties of the tillage farmer.  Even with so much machinery in the country at present there will be a percentage of this year's harvest that will not be harvested at all. I would say it will be one of the worst we ever had.  Nobody could have anticipated anything like that.  If an unforeseen situation arises for a farmer he may not be able to meet his commitments and may have to sell.  If a policy of leasing is being devised on the lines that Macra has suggested we will need to ensure that the finance houses will be able to provide credit for the young man leasing the land from his father or from a neighbour.</P>
    <P>This idea can be expanded.  Macra na Feirme dealt only with the father and son relationship.  It can be enlarged quite substantially so that farms next door, or fairly near, could be leased. We must make it enticing to the owner. The Land Commission must build in something realistic as the basis of an income and it must be tied in with the cost of living and with inflation.  Otherwise it will not be enticing to the individual.  If a farm was leased for a good price 5 years ago that figure would be considered very small at present.  What will it be like in 5 or 6 <Col N="118" /> years' time taking into account the way the setting value of land has gone in the past 12 months?  It is now about £50 per Irish acre while five or six years ago it was about £10 to £15.  I do not think the figure will be quite as high during the next 12 months but we still must build in something realistic.  I cannot see them getting full market value but there will be some increase if ordinary prices increase and if there is a certain amount of inflation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a revolutionary idea.  It has not been dealt with by the Land Commission.  It is completely alien to our previous thinking on land. Our ancestors fought very strongly for the three Fs.  The first was fair rent and the second was fixity of tenure.  We are now departing from the concept of fixity of tenure.  Therefore, I thought we should go into all aspects of the matter.  It has been suggested by an organisation of young farmers, the people who will inherit the farms in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present a change of ownership is quite costly.  Farmers have not always got ready money.  Transferring land is costly and most farmers would consider that dead money because it is non-productive.  Another way to transfer land would be to form a company. The young man would have 20 per cent ownership at the start and in five years <Col N="119" /> 25 per cent or 30 per cent ownership. Gradually, over a period of 15 or 20 years, he would become the full owner of the company.  This is a rather costly process.  The Land Commission should consider the setting up of companies at a reasonable price.  At present even a straight transfer of a not very large farm from father to son could cost £1,000.  The older man will always feel: &ldquo;I will be better off next year when I sell a few more cattle.  I will not have the same commitments as I have this year&rdquo; and he will be inclined to put it on the long finger.  Even if he is getting a full managerial salary, it is not the amount of money the son gets which frustrates him but the fact that he cannot make a decision and has not got a feeling of responsibility.  In anything we devise we must give him a feeling of responsibility for decision making.</P>
    <P>The idea of forming a company is particularly suitable in a case where the father is young, say, in his early fifties.  Nobody could justly feel that a man of that age should retire.  But the man of 20 or 21 years has his life to lead as well.  We should be able to reach some compromise.  One form which has been tried in a few cases is the forming of a company where the ownership automatically changes after a five- or ten-year period.</P>
    <P>The company system was felt by the Land Commission to be the best suited to the combined ownership of lands.  We must encourage this by a cheaper system of forming companies and of stamp duty in the transfer of ownership.  We have done a lot in this direction because it is not as dear to transfer land from father to son as it was.  The value of farms has increased over the last few years because of inflation.  The price of cattle has risen also.</P>
    <P>Each time the £ was devalued the price of cattle rose.  If the £ was devalued by 10 per cent cattle prices rose by 9½ or 10½ per cent.  They kept pace with the £.  World economists have accepted that there will be a certain amount of inflation for a number of years to come and land will continue to increase in value. <Col N="120" /> Unfortunately, our system of stamp duty for the setting up of companies is based on actual money values. Farmers find that they are in a much higher bracket than they anticipated. Therefore, we should have a reasonably cheap system for setting up companies. This raises a problem for the farm with two houses.  Very few kitchens are big enough for two ladies. This is a human problem for which we cannot find a remedy.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission were originally set up to buy out the old landlords under the different Acts and then became rent collectors.  Later they bought land and redivided it to bring small farms up to economic standards.  There were 60,000 uneconomic holdings.  That figure still stands.  You cannot condemn people living on small holdings to an uneconomic way of life.  The farmer at present will not stand for that.  He will have to move to part-time farming.</P>
    <P>A good deal of work in this area has been done in Bavaria and southern Germany.  Instead of production going down in a number of cases with part-time farming production has increased. I have seen this in the two constituencies I represent, Kildare and Meath.  This was brought home to me in Newbridge.  There was a new factory there and a number of uneconomic farms.  The owners went to work in the factory and, instead of earning their livelihood from the farms, they lived on the income they got from the factory and re-invested in the land, manured it and carried more stock.  This resulted in greater production and a greater income for them as a result of part-time farming. The same is true of County Meath and a number of people from there are working in Dublin or working for the Office of Public Works on cleaning the Boyne.  Over 50 per cent of the people working there are small farmers.  This is convenient for them because they are finished early and can work on the farms when they go home.  The farm output is increasing and after a few years the farmer will have the income from the land and the security of his other work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="121" /> It was hard to get the Land Commission to buy farms suitable for division in those areas.  The IDA realise that when a factory is set up 40 to 50 per cent of the labour force comes from small farms.  They calculate the number in the area and anticipate how many will work in a new factory set up in a particular area.  The people of Meath and Kildare realise that if they want a good standard of living they must go out to work.  This will also happen in the west.  There are not as many factories or industries there as are in the east.</P>
    <P>The transfer of ownership of land has been exceptionally high.  In a number of cases the farmers were well over 70 before they transferred ownership. That speaks for itself, particularly when younger men are involved. Imagine the frustration of waiting for the older man to sign over the land. Getting back to the present day working of the Land Commission, the long delays in allocating a farm which has been purchased are very frustrating.</P>
    <P>Some of the criticism expressed in this regard is a little unjust.  Word gets around that the Land Commission have bought a farm, but they do not take over ownership until the deeds have been signed over.  If there is any problem about the deeds in the transfer, this could take a year or more, but the people think the Land Commission are already in possession of the farm.  However, even allowing for that, there are a number of farms throughout Ireland which the Land Commission have had for a long period of time.  There is one in my own constituency which comes to mind.  I was canvassing in the 1961 election, and visited a farm which the Land Commission took over in a year or less than a year afterwards&mdash;the Noone estate at Ballinakill, Enfield.  There is portion of that farm still not divided.</P>

      <P>Yes.  One of the sad <Col N="122" /> points about this is that when I called to this house it had been built only about a year or two.  The owner sold the farm to the Land Commission shortly afterwards and that house has not been occupied since.  This was a costly bungalow, even at that time, and it has been allowed to deteriorate until it is now nearly in ruins.  There were a number of changes of policy over the years.  When it was coming near to the time for division, there was a possibility of setting up a community pig farm.  That caused a delay of a year or two, and then that idea fell through. When it was coming up for revision again the community farm idea came up.  Some type of community farm may come, but I do not know what is going to happen to that house which has been left there for all those years. There was always a housing problem in this area and it is a shame that this property was not hived off and sold. The land could have been kept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the house not have been let?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCrinion" hpid="Mr. Crinion Mr. Crinion">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the policy of the Land Commission never to let a house. I can readily understand that if a person gets in as a tenant it might be impossible for the Land Commission to get him out when they were ready to let in a new person.  In any event, land should not be kept for any more than two years after it is acquired: one year should be allowed for interviewing all the local people and then the next year the land should be divided.</P>
      <P>The folly of the Land Commission policy could be seen a few years ago when a huge acreage was allowed to build up with the result that quite a number of people living around those farms became frustrated and naturally were often inclined to take the law into their own hands.  The Minister should issue a directive to the Land Commission that all farms should be divided in two years after being acquired.  If that is not done, the reason why it was not done should be laid before the House.  That would ensure that everything possible would be done to allocate the land within the specified time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main criticisms we hear <Col N="123" /> is in regard to the limit of one mile or a mile and a half.  Most farmers would be prepared to take a farm two or two and a half miles away from them. Normally they keep the home farm completely stocked; they have to travel quite a number of miles to get meadow ground for winter fodder over 11 months.  Therefore, two or three miles from the farm would certainly create no problem, because that would be the land they would use for making silage; it might be a bit far to have to draw silage back home, but they could have a yard up there for wintering cattle, particularly at a period when they would not be milking or at least the number of animals that would have to be milked would be on the home farm.</P>
    <P>In a couple of years' time the price of land to be allocated, particularly in my own area, will be £40 or £50 an acre.  A farm that was taken over this year will run as high as £57 per statute acre when it is allocated.  That would be a fantastic figure to expect a person to pay.  The farmers all around that area have about 22 to 25 acres so they will be getting at least 20 acres and will be expected to pay about £1,000 a year rent.  This will probably make the farm viable and economic, but the cost involved creates a great burden.</P>
    <P>Consideration should be given to reducing the rent for the first five years in order to give the farmers a chance to gear their system of farming to the higher figure.  The British Prime Minister recently recommended that the building societies should have a lower rate of interest for the first five years of repayment of loans.  The Land Commission should give serious consideration to this matter.  Practically all of the land they buy this year will be distributed in a few years time at more than £50 per statute acre.</P>
    <P>In the past year there has not been any sale of land under £500 per statute acre in the eastern part of Leinster.  The Land Commission are obliged to pay the market value for land and they must have regard to this when allocating the land.  There will be a major problem in a few <Col N="124" /> years time.  Although land is supposed to be cheaper in the west of Ireland, when I have met farmers at marts in that area I have been told that land prices are similar to those obtaining in other parts of the country.  I mentioned a figure of £500 but this is the lowest price.  Some of the land in my constituency is being sold at £1,000 which means it is out of the question for the Land Commission.  For the past six or seven years they have moved out of County Dublin because it has been impossible to buy land and be in a position to allocate it subsequently.</P>
    <P>In the Dunshaughlin area in County Meath many people are coming from Dublin to buy land.  They are not farmers but the amounts they are spending on land purchase means that the price is being increased for the farming community.  These people have been called many names but they are buying the land as good security.  A sinister aspect is that they borrow the money to buy this land in order to ensure that they get income tax relief, thus bringing them into a lower tax bracket.  Under PAYE a person pays 26¼p tax in the £; those earning more than £2,000 pay 35p; those earning between £4,000 and £5,000 pay 50p and there are other scales of 60p and 85p.  These people who buy land may borrow money at 2 per cent or 3 per cent; it is sound economics for business people to do this but it is not good for the farming community.  The Land Commission should ensure that the buyer of a farm must be a farmer himself.  It may happen that the purchaser may have sold his own farm. There may be the situation where a farmer in County Dublin is compelled to sell his land for building purposes to the corporation or the county council.</P>

      <P>He is paid an extravagant price for the land and, as a result, he wants to buy more land.  If he gets £5,000 per acre he will not consider it expensive to buy land in County Meath <Col N="125" /> for £500 or £1,000 per acre.  The upshot of this is that the price is so high other people cannot compete.  However, I realise that such people were farmers and are trying to get back into farming. There is also the situation where the businessmen, the executives or the <i>entrepreneurs</i> are coming into areas like County Meath and are keeping farmers who may wish to buy additional land out of the market.  A farmer may want to bring his farm to an economic level or may wish to buy an additional area which will allow himself and his son to make a comfortable living.  The Land Commission should examine seriously all sales of farms.  The law says that the Land Commission must sanction every such sale.  One of the reasons the Land Commission are loath to do this is because if they do not sanction the sale they must take the land for redistribution in the area. At least if they do not sanction a sale, the farm should be either put up for auction again or be sold to the next highest bidder.  The present system is creating inflation, especially in my constituency where professional and business people from Dublin have bought farms.  We thought that the 1965 Land Act would prevent these non farming people from buying land but that has not been the case.  The Land Commission should look at that again.  The present situation is anything but helpful to the farming community and this is a section of the community that we should help as far as possible, because we should help any section who are endeavouring to help themselves.  A restriction on the sale of land to non-farming people would result in there being less competition for agricultural land. These professional and business people are able to borrow money and because of the tax concession can borrow at a very low rate of interest.  Economically that may be good for them, but it is very bad for the country and for the farmers in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that we have entered the EEC we are in a time of change and of different thinking in relation to land structure and ownership.  The Land Commission should be the body to give the lead in so far as change is concerned. However, they have always <Col N="126" /> been regarded as being slow movers but perhaps they are justified in their slowness to some extent because any decisions that are reached in relation to land are bound to have repercussions for many years.  The EEC has systems that are well worth considering, particularly in regard to pensions.</P>
    <P>I understand that this Estimate covers forestry also.  Much has been achieved in a quiet way in this country down through the years in the field of forestry.  A target was set of acquiring 25,000 acres per year for planting.  This target has been almost achieved in most years.  Much of our afforestation will be reaching maturity quite soon.  This aspect of the Department provides much employment as well as adding to the wealth of the country.  Also, of course, we have been able to utilise land that would not have been capable of being used in any other way.  Economically, afforestation can be a very good proposition because it has been calculated that when the plantations are sold after about 30 years, the overall income in a number of cases will be equal to what good land would yield in the same part of the country.  However, there are very few private individuals who can afford to spend money on plantations and to wait 30 or 40 years for a return on their outlay. Therefore, it is a task that only the State can undertake.  Much of the land that has been taken over for this purpose is bogland or waste land that would be useless for any other purpose.</P>
    <P>One aspect on which I would fault the Land Commission is in regard to the price they pay for land acquired for afforestation.  This averages at between £15 and £20 per acre but can be as much as £50 or £60 per acre. The average price is too low and it surprises me that it is possible for the Land Commission to acquire so much land at such a low price.  The price paid should be increased.  Cutaway bogland and wasteland are ideal for afforestation purposes and every effort should be made to acquire as much of this land as is possible.  Such land would not be of any value for agricultural purposes because it would <Col N="127" /> be impossible to drain it but timber is a very good drainage plant.  The Americans discovered this when they planted large forests on the banks of the Mississippi.  They found that when they planted large forests on the upper regions the timber absorbed so much of the water that there was not the same amount of flooding as there had been previously further down the river.</P>
    <P>Credit must go to the Forestry Section of the Land Commission for the great work they are doing.  Plantations can add beauty to the countryside as well as being a very good economic proposition.  The achievement in this field to date is one that any country should be proud of.  In conclusion, I suggest that the Land Commission consider seriously the document published by Macra na Feirme regarding the leasing of land. They should also do something to stop the speculator, the business man, coming in and buying up land in Meath.  Steps must be taken to keep the land for the farmers.</P>

      <P>My interest is in the elaborate and carefully worked out farm apprenticeship scheme.  Model farmers are chosen and apprentices train with them.  Apparently the scheme is very successful and tremendous expertise is acquired by these young potential farmers.  In my constituency of Cavan there are young men as keen as mustard to learn all they can about modern farming.  Very often they have no land and I would suggest that the Land Commission should set up a land bank through which these young men could get land on which to use the very fine training, both practical and theoretical, they have received in modern agricultural methods.</P>
      <P>There might be a problem in that these young men finish their apprenticeship at a comparatively early age, but short leases could be granted initially for a probationary period, so to speak, and then, if they get married, the period of the lease could be extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="128" /> In the farming community there has been a tradition of antagonism to theory; the practical farmer is suspicious of the theoretician.  This may be a healthy approach in many ways, but I think the making available of land from a land bank for these young men would be a good idea because we would then see the results of highly scientific farming.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crinion referred to part-time farming.  In many areas this would be an ideal solution.  Cavan is a designated area for industrial development and industrial development is the only solution to the problem of the uneconomic holding.  Deputy Crinion adverted to European policy in this regard.  Sociologists have elaborated various theories about the semi-rural community where you have part-time farming plus industrial employment accessible to these part-time farmers.  This is something worth studying.  Small industries providing a reasonable weekly wage plus a small holding utilised to its full potential would provide a very satisfactory living for those based on the land. Farming is a way of life.  There will, of course, have to be some policy of restructuring in line with EEC developments and policies, but we must not in the course of this exercise lose sight of the fact that farming is a way of life. Peadar O'Donnell, experienced in both rural and urban living, told the Commission on Emigration that there was no better place to rear children than on a farm provided the amenities were sufficiently good to give these children a reasonable chance in a competitive society.  Those may not be his exact words, but that was the idea, and I subscribe totally to it.</P>
    <P>On the subject of afforestation, there are people who have been employed for a long number of years on this work and I appeal to the Minister now to ensure that long-serving married men are maintained in that employment.</P>
    <P>The common agricultural policy is very important.  Strictly speaking, this is more germane to the Estimate for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, but the Department of Lands will be employed on a policy of major <Col N="129" /> restructuring and it is very important that this restructuring should be worthwhile and that the common agricultural policy should be implemented for the benefit and not to the disadvantage of our farmers.</P>

      <P>I am interested in private planting.  A great many acres could be used for planting and these plantations would result eventually in additional incomes.  Has the scheme been sufficiently widely advertised? How many small farmers realise there is a scheme to assist them in starting small plantations?  I honestly believe very few.</P>
      <P>In 1971-72, 37,753 acres were acquired and in 1972-73 the figure was 36,474.  The money allocated this year, £1,136,000, is the highest sum, I think, ever allocated for the development of land.  One of the most disturbing factors in this particular area is the delay that occurs between the time the Land Commission acquire the land and its ultimate distribution.  In many cases in my constituency the delay has extended over five, six, seven or more years before the land is finally distributed.  This causes frustration among many small farmers, and young men who are willing to work to improve their farms.</P>
      <P>The point I want to hammer home is this.  I think that young men with families, as Deputy Wilson said, must be encouraged to stay on the land.  I know of many cases in my constituency where old men got land.  I know one case in particular where two years ago an unmarried man of 70 got land from the Land Commission.  The Minister must be rigid in deciding that only young men with families will get land in future.  These are the people we want to stay on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I noticed something in County Kerry which I feel will have a great influence in years to come.  I am referring to the deep ploughing system already operating in Kerry and I believe in parts of Mayo.  I know of many acres of land in Donegal-Leitrim where this system could be fruitfully employed.  When one considers the high cost of land and that if we can develop bad land which is giving no return for money by means of deep <Col N="130" /> ploughing it should be obvious that it is well worth tilling.  I believe that in the next few years many thousands of acres will be developed in this way &mdash;I hope with the help of the Land Commission.  I noticed one particular farm in Kerry of about 60 acres where the borders were marsh and bog.  One could not really believe the difference deep ploughing had made between two fields lying side by side.  We must use every inch of Irish land.  There are thousands of acres in my constituency outside Dungloe and Glenties that I have felt are neglected.  If deep ploughing cannot be employed there at least the land should be used for afforestation.  Some productive use should be made of it.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the fact that in this year's Estimate the sum of £171,000 is allocated for amenity development.  This is a very well worth while scheme.  Tremendous progress has been made in the past few years in places like Boyle.  There is also a forest outside Pettigo, a depressed area which I believe should get some amenity scheme.  Finally, I wish the Minister the best of luck in his new office.</P>

      <P>I have been charged with responsibility for speaking on environmental matters.  The Department of Lands is very seriously involved in these problems confronting the nation in regard to environment and quality of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil succeeded the last Coalition Government in 1957&mdash; I became aware of this only in the past four years when I was appointed to the Office of Public Works&mdash;trade, activity and employment were so slack that the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance turned over portion of the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park to the Department of Lands for the purpose of planting soft woods, conifers and so on there.  The result was that all wild life either died or evacuated the area.  With the falling of pine needles on the ground and so on all the undergrowth disappeared and there was no food for the wild life in what became a forest park instead of a national park.  That <Col N="131" /> was a very serious time for this nation with a very serious emigration and unemployment situation and, perhaps, the Government at that time were right to say to the Forestry Division: &ldquo;Take these acres from the National Park.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I have been down there and I have seen what is known as the Blue Pool in Killarney emptied of wild life.  I have seen the fish hatchery, where trout and other fish abounded, destroyed.  My immediate predecessor in the Office of Public Works and the former Minister for Lands' predecessor had a very serious disagreement about this development.  I am sure the present Minister has the files comprising many pages of foolscap on his desk.  Since 1957 I think the previous Administration brought the nation to a stage where the destruction of the natural habitat of wild life is no longer necessary.  If the Minister can now find anywhere else where this kind of destruction occurred under a Fianna Fáil administration as a result of maladministration by a previous Government and is still continuing, I would plead with him to ensure that it will be eliminated as quickly as possible. Apart from Deputies from the Killarney area, I think very few people have seen that pool.  I should like to welcome back Deputy Henry Kenny; I am quite sure that the Parliamentary Secretary who succeeded me will agree with me absolutely on this matter.  I am sure he will visit this area and that he will agree that the restoration of this fish habitat is desirable and that the wildlife habitat should be preserved and improved.  I believe the Fianna Fáil administration of that time may have been justified in the circumstances but certainly in the circumstances that have prevailed since the early 1960s this cannot be justified at all.  Industrialisation is absolutely no progress for the people of Ireland if it means that we are destroying the quality of life.  The Department of Lands, in my view, have a very important part to play in this regard.</P>
    <P>In the coming weeks in this House we will have arguments concerning the <Col N="132" /> development of mines, oil refineries or other petro-chemical plants all of which will certainly border on physical planning and environment.  What we must consider when we decide to set up any aspect of natural development is the effect this will have on the natural environment.  I am conscious of the fact that the Minister for Lands is not the only one involved in this. The Ministers for Agriculture, Local Government, Industry and Commerce, Transport and Power and the Office of Public Works are all concerned with physical planning and environment.</P>
    <P>In my belief the concept established some years ago&mdash;I think it was about the time Deputy Cooney was successful in a by-election&mdash;whereby a separate Department for physical planning and environment should be established was a sound one.  This has happened in Canada and New Zealand.  One Minister, or Parliamentary Secretary, should be given the responsibility of looking after all environmental problems with the right of veto over any other Minister in the event of his proposals destroying natural growth of the flora or the fauna.</P>
    <P>When I was appointed a Parliamentary Secretary I was considered a philistine but now I am a converted conservationist. This is as a result of the great amount of detailed information that has been available to me.  In my view to destroy a natural hatchery or the Blue Pool in the Bourn Vincent Memorial Park, as was done because of the philistine attitude of the foresters in the Department of Lands, is a sacrilege.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government, in order to try to reactivate economic activity in 1967, turned part of this national park over to the Department of Lands.  In the words of the former Minister, this Department planted &ldquo;christmas trees&rdquo;.  The pines came down, the undergrowth died and the hatchery and the Blue Pool were destroyed.  Kerry County Council, who discovered this beautiful area above the Muckross Hotel&mdash;officials of that body described it as one of the best views of the Lakes of Killarney&mdash;had <Col N="133" /> erected a car park and picnic tables for visitors.  However, these christmas trees planted by the Department of Lands have obscured the view of the lakes with the result that the county council's investment is dead.</P>
    <P>Having read all the documents in relation to this matter I can only remark that the situation is ridiculous. When Deputy Seán Flanagan was Minister for Lands I asked him to throw aside the foolscaps and view this area with me.  I misguided him somewhat because one of the park inspectors was a member of the Fianna Fáil organisation and was aware of everything that was going on.  Deputy Seán Flanagan, when we reached the area behind Muckross Hotel, remarked that he could not understand why the Department of Lands, with so many hundreds of thousands of acres, had planted the christmas trees in that spot.  The former Minister had the intention of removing those trees and, if this has not been carried out, I would ask the present holder of the office to do so without delay.</P>
    <P>Perhaps some of the Deputies from Kerry can bring me up to date on this matter.</P>
