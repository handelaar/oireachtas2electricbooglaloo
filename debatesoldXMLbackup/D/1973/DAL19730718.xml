      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision is being made in this Bill to increase the personal remuneration <Col N="1129" /> of the President.  Provision is also being made for certain improvements in the superannuation provisions that apply to a President or to the widow of a President.</P>
    <P>The governing provisions in regard to the remuneration of the President are contained in Article 12.11.2º of the Constitution which requires that the allowance payable to the President, as well as the emoluments, should be determined by law.</P>
    <P>The existing legislation was enacted in the Presidential Establishment Act of 1938 as amended by the Presidential Establishment (Amendment) Act of 1947.  Under section 1 of the 1938 Act as amended, a total sum of £11,500 was prescribed as the emoluments and allowances to be received by the President.  The personal remuneration of the President is included in that sum.</P>
    <P>On 13th March last, our predecessors in Government decided that the President should receive personal remuneration at a rate 10 per cent in excess of the salary currently payable to the Chief Justice and they made other decisions relating to the pensions payable to ex-Presidents and their widows.  This Bill gives effect to those decisions.</P>
    <P>The former Government also intended that in future Presidential entertainment expenses should be borne on the Miscellaneous Expenses Vote of the Department of Finance.  Having regard to the constitutional provisions relating to the emoluments of the President, the Government consider that it would be inappropriate to charge such expenses as proposed by our predecessors.  The arrangement whereby the allowances and emoluments of the President consist, in accordance with the Constitutional provisions, of two separate elements; first to meet the expenses of the President's domestic establishment and, second, the personal remuneration of the President, will therefore stand. The subvention to cover the expenses of the domestic establishment has been unchanged at £6,500 since 1947. It is now being increased to £15,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1130" /> The £15,000 is intended to do no more than to enable the President to meet the essential expenses of his office.  It is intended to cover the expenses including wages of the domestic establishment required in connection with his performance of the duties of President and second the cost of official entertainment.  I can assure the House that the provision of £15,000 has been the subject of careful estimation, and that it represents no more than is considered necessary to enable the President to discharge his official obligations in a fitting manner.</P>
    <P>A fundamental change is being made in the basis of the personal remuneration of the President.  It is being provided that the President's personal remuneration, the salary proper of his post, will in future be determined at a rate of 10 per cent in excess of the salary currently payable to the Chief Justice.  Whenever the remuneration of the Chief Justice is increased, an increase in the President's rate of personal remuneration will follow automatically.</P>
    <P>A link between the remuneration of the President and that of the Chief Justice was recognised when the rate of pay of the first President was being determined.  At that time, the President's rate of personal remuneration was fixed at £5,000 which was £1,000 or 25 per cent above that of the Chief Justice.  The differential of 10 per cent to which it is now proposed to give legislative effect is not as high as that which obtained when the personal remuneration of the President was fixed in 1938.  It is considered, however, that in present-day terms a differential of 10 per cent represents an appropriate margin.  When this Bill comes into operation the President's personal remuneration will be fixed at £11,413 a year.</P>
    <P>The existing rate of pension for a former President is £1,200 a year and for the widow of a former President. £500.  These amounts were fixed 35 years ago under the Presidential Establishment Act, 1938, and clearly need revision having regard to present-day values.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that a former <Col N="1131" /> President's pension will at any time be equal to half the rate per annum of the personal remuneration of the President at that time and a President's widow's pension will be equal to a quarter of the rate per annum of the personal remuneration of the President at that time.  In general, pensions in the public service are subject to a maximum of half of retiring pay and a widow's pension is half of her husband's pension entitlement.  This Bill will thus bring the system of Presidential pensions into line with this general practice.</P>
    <P>When this Bill comes into operation the pension of a President will be £5,707 a year and that of his widow, £2,853 a year.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill for the approval of the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly, this Bill is not before its time.  The salary and emoluments of the President have remained at a relatively low figure for a long time.  Any examination of the position in relation to current salaries and to the value of money would indicate the necessity for a Bill of this nature. For that reason we welcome the Bill and support it.</P>
      <P>There is not very much that I wish to say on this Bill except, first, to reiterate what the Minister has said regarding the arrangement proposed in relation to a pension for a former President or a widow of a former President. As the Minister said, up to now these figures have been fixed by statute and, of course, are now unrealistic.  This proposal will bring the arrangement for a pension of a former President or for the widow of a former President into line with the arrangements in the public service in general and, for that reason, it is to be welcomed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arrangement whereby the personal remuneration of the President should be fixed at a figure that is 10 per cent higher than that for the time being fixed for the Chief Justice is a suitable and adequate arrangement. It is only right that the remuneration of the President should be fixed at a figure which demonstrates that the President is the first citizen <Col N="1132" /> in this State, that he occupies the premier position under the Constitution. On the other hand, the arrangement whereby, as provided here, that remuneration would alter from time to time as the remuneration of the Chief Justice alters, ensures both the maintenance of the correct position of the presidential office and, at the same time, provides for suitable adjustment in the rate of the personal remuneration of the President as such adjustment is called for.</P>
    <P>The only other matter on which I should like to comment is that, in relation to a number of items which the Minister for Finance has brought before this House, I have had considerable difficulty in extracting from him an admission that the previous Government had anything to do with those pieces of legislation.  Even in some cases where the change was merely a change from &ldquo;1972&rdquo; to &ldquo;1973&rdquo; in the title of a Bill, the Minister found himself unable to acknowledge the fact that the legislation he was introducing was legislation that had been prepared by the previous Government.  However, I notice that the Minister seems not to have the same inhibition in regard to this Bill because he sets out in his speech the details of a decision made by the former Government in March last&mdash;at a time, I would add, when it was not known who would win the subsequent Presidential Election. The Minister does not hesitate to draw attention to the part played by the previous Government in this Bill.  There is a certain significance in that, not a major significance, but it is no harm to underline it.</P>

      <P>The practice in the House has been not to give any particulars in relation to the income of any individual.  However, it is impossible to say what would be the tax in respect of a person such as the one described by the Deputy because there would be several factors involved&mdash; bank interest, <i>et cetera</i>&mdash;and several other deductions would be made from a person's income before it could be assessed for tax purposes.  I accept the point that the Deputy is making, that is, that it is not improbable that a substantial portion of the salary would be subject to tax at a high rate.  It would be undesirable that unnecessary envy be stimulated by the reason of the extent of the remuneration without having regard to the amount of tax that would be payable.</P>

      <P>Briefly, I should like to take up the point raised by Deputy Colley on Second Stage when he expressed surprise that I was acknowledging the partial responsibility of the previous administration for this measure.  I thought it appropriate that, where there was agreement on both sides of the House, that fact should be recorded. But I also thought it rather odd that the last Government, on the day before the change of Government, concerned themselves with this problem and did not concern themselves with other problems about which many speeches have been made in this House, including the remuneration of Deputies and Senators.  The only decision the last Government took in this sphere on the day before leaving office was the one that has been put into effect now.  In those circumstances, I considered it appropriate that that peculiar development should have been underwritten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to engage in any acrimonious debate with the Minister.  However, for the record I want to point out that the previous Government were in the position where they could not introduce legislation and there were, of course, more difficult problems arising in other matters to which the Minister referred but he will find, if he has not already found, that there was available in the Department of Finance a memorandum for submission to the Government in regard to the other matter to which he referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as this Bill is concerned, the <Col N="1135" /> point which I made is still valid and is still acknowledged by the Minister in that on this occasion he did admit, acknowledge and draw attention to the part played by the previous Government in relation to the preparation of this Bill.  Speaking offhand and from recollection I think it is the only Bill the Minister has brought in where he has acknowledged such a fact although in virtually every other Bill he brought in the fact was the same but he did not acknowledge it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Colley has suggested that there was some difference between what was required to be done following a decision on the Presidential remuneration and the remuneration of Deputies and Senators and office holders.  Of course, legislation was required in both cases to give effect to the decisions.</P>

      <P>The Employer/Labour Conference reported on the 22nd December but no decision was taken on foot of that report before the change of Government.  It was only at the last meeting of the last Government that a decision was taken in relation to this matter so quite clearly there was not a possibility of legislation being discharged to give effect to it except by the incoming administration.  We can take up the matter, if the Deputy wishes, on the other Bill dealing with remuneration for Members of the Oireachtas this afternoon.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> This is the Bill to which I referred in the Seanad on Wednesday last when, in connection with a similarly entitled Bill introduced by Senator Robinson, I said I hoped to introduce legislation before the end of the present session to cure defects in the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to provide that, where an accused person has been sent forward by the District Court for sentence with a plea of guilty, an appeal shall lie against the sentence as if he had been sentenced after conviction on indictment.  This result is secured by section 1.  The Court of Criminal Appeal in the case of the <i>Attorney General v. Tyrrell</i> (1970) decided that there could be no appeal from the sentence where an offender is sent forward to the Circuit Court for sentence under the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967.  Section 1 will apply to persons sent forward whether before or after the passing of the proposed Act.  The ordinary provisions as to the need for leave to appeal will apply to all cases.  Both the Circuit Court rules and the rules of the superior courts already allow for the enlargement of the times for appealing.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides&mdash;section 3&mdash; for the extension of free legal aid in two respects.  Firstly, legal aid will now become available for the hearing in the court of sentence, where the accused has been sent forward for sentence, and for any subsequent appeal against sentence.  Secondly, legal aid will become available for all preliminary examinations in the District Court.  The grant of legal aid in either case will, of course, be subject to the conditions contained in the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962.  The provision in the Criminal Procedure Act, which restricted legal aid in preliminary examinations to cases of murder, is being repealed.  The Government see no valid reason why legal aid in preliminary examination cases should be restricted to murder.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is being taken in section 2 to make provision for the correction of defects in the charge, where under section 12 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, an accused waives the preliminary examination <Col N="1137" /> and is sent forward for trial; and also where the accused, under section 13 of that Act, is sent forward for sentence with a plea of guilty.  In relation to the case where the accused is sent forward for trial, the necessity for the provision in section 2 for correction of the charge arises from the fact that section 18 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, which allows correction of the indictment, does not, I am advised, apply to cases where the preliminary examination is waived.</P>
    <P>In relation to the case where the accused is sent forward for sentence, the necessity for the provision in section 2 for correction of the charge arises because the Supreme Court in <i>Williams v. Casey</i> (1969) decided that there is at present no power to amend the charge in such a case.  In both instances, the power now being provided for to make a correction is subject to the proviso that, in the opinion of the court, the correction would not result in injustice.  Where the accused has signed a plea of guilty in the District Court and the charge is subsequently corrected, the plea will be treated as a plea to the corrected charge.  However, this is, of course, subject to the existing provision in section 13 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, under which the accused may withdraw his plea of guilty if he so wishes.  This provision in the 1967 Act is not being disturbed.</P>
    <P>I hope that this short, though important, Bill will commend itself to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to welcome the Bill, the principle object of which is to correct the defect which has appeared in the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, with regard to appeals after somebody has been sentenced on pleading guilty.  This defect came to light a couple of years ago and I was asked at the time if I would undertake to rectify the defect.  I was glad to give that undertaking but we ran into the difficulty that an appeal was brought to the Supreme Court on the question of whether or not section 13 of the Criminal Procedure Act was constitutional. The Supreme Court, I understand, <Col N="1138" /> has recently found that the section was constitutional and the way is opened up then for this amendment to be made.  I do not think it could have been made any earlier than this. The error which occurred in the 1967 Act was purely accidental and I do not think it was the intention of the legislature at the time that this right of appeal would be done away with.  I suppose it is inevitable that errors of this kind would occur from time to time.  I know that there were in the last few years a few cases where people who had been sent forward and sentenced under this section, which it is now proposed to amend, did feel aggrieved at their inability to appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Happily there were not very many of those cases and what I did as a matter of practice when an appeal was not available for them was to consider petitions from them very sympathetically, perhaps more sympathetically than if the normal process of the Court of Criminal Appeal had been opened.  I hope that, as a result of this error being discovered, no injustice was done to anybody.  I believe that to be the case.</P>
      <P>I also welcome the extension of legal aid to these type of cases.  It is only reasonable that they should be given, particularly so on appeal, where the matter is not straightforward and where the assistance of a solicitor and Counsel is essential if he is to appear before the Court of Criminal Appeal.  I also welcome the extension of it to preliminary examinations in the District Court. It is, perhaps, no harm to point out that the number of preliminary examinations at the moment in the District Court since the passing of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, which we are now amending are very few compared with the sort of procedure which operated prior to this Act. Under the old procedure each witness had to swear his evidence and have it taken down in deposition form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great majority of defendants now opt for the procedure under the Act whereby a book of evidence is served on them and it is not necessary <Col N="1139" /> to call the witnesses at that stage.  It is, of course, open to an accused person, if he so wishes, to have those witnesses called and examined on oath.  On the few occasions when that occurs it is only right that legal aid should be available to the accused to enable him to avail fully of his rights in the District Court.</P>
    <P>Another section in the Bill, section 2, allows amendment of charges where a person has been sent forward under section 12 with a plea of not guilty or under section 13 with a plea of guilty.  I have, of course, no objection to that in principle.  The only reservation I have is that it would appear, on a reading of this section on its own at any rate, that these amendments&mdash;and some of them could be quite significant&mdash;could possibly take place without the consent of the accused person.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should consider adding some few words to this section to make it clear that that cannot happen.  I know that at the end there are the words, &ldquo;provided, in either case, that such correction would not, in the opinion of the Court, result in injustice&rdquo;.  That, of course, is purely a matter within the discretion of the court.  The accused's position in relation to amendments of the charge against him is not referred to at all.</P>
    <P>I think it would be desirable that his rights should be clarified in a section such as this, that he would have the right first of all to get notice, and reasonable notice, of any proposal to amend the charge or the indictment on which he has been returned for trial.  Having given him reasonable notice, I think he should be given the opportunity to consider his position again as to whether he wants to plead guilty or to plead not guilty, as the case may be, or possibly to plead guilty to some of the charges on the indictment and not guilty to others.</P>
    <P>I am not certain that these options are left open to him under this section. I would feel happier, in relation <Col N="1140" /> to section 2, if something of that kind was written into it to make the accused's position clearer and to guarantee that he will not be taken by surprise by any amendment or that he will not find himself in the position of pleading guilty to something more serious than the matter to which he originally pleaded guilty.  Lines 29 to 31 read:</P>
    <P>And his plea of guilty shall be treated as a plea of guilty to the charge as so corrected.</P>
    <P>With that reservation, which can be discussed on Committee Stage, I am glad to welcome the Bill, which rectifies a matter which needed to be rectified.  That matter could not have been rectified until now pending the decision of the Supreme Court which was given a few weeks ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Deputy had indicated, when he was Minister, his intention of bringing in this amending legislation but that he was inhibited from doing so by reason of the fact that there was a case pending before the Supreme Court.  We all had to wait until that case was decided to see whether there was any need for this legislation.  In the event the Supreme Court held that the particular section was constitutional and, accordingly, this legislation was necessary to cure the defect.  If the Supreme Court had held that it was unconstitutional then there would be no need for this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supreme Court decision was given three or four weeks ago.  The House will appreciate that there has been no delay in bringing this legislation forward to cure this defect.  As I have indicated, the ordinary provisions as to the need for leave to appeal will still continue to apply.  In other words, a person sentenced in the Circuit Court on return on a plea of guilty will still need a certificate from that court or go to the Court of Criminal Appeal for leave.  In cases where these applications have not been made because of the defect in the existing law the person may still apply and can ask for the time to submit these applications to be extended in accordance <Col N="1141" /> with the normal practice.  The normal power of the court to grant an extension of time is there and can be availed of by any persons who have been caught by this defect.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy has indicated, if there are persons for whom this cure comes too late they have had their remedy and I have no doubt they have had a sympathetic remedy by way of petition.  If any further petitions arise in which the right of appeal is in some way inadvertently lost my attitude to such petitions will be the same as the Deputy's was, one of sympathy.</P>
    <P>The other point raised is in connection with legal aid in deposition cases. I got the impression that the Deputy was under the impression that it was available now only in deposition cases where the accused opted for oral depositions. This is not so.  It will be available for all preliminary proceedings in the District Court, whether the accused opts for oral depositions or is content to rely on the written depositions as contained in the book of evidence.</P>
    <P>Sometimes, even in the absence of oral depositions, arguments on the book of evidence can take considerable time and can involve practitioners in a lot of research and difficult legal argument.  It is only right that legal aid should be available in those cases so that accused persons, at that important stage, should have the best legal advice.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point that the power of amendment contained in section 2 might prejudice the accused, I should like to say that section 2 is intended to cure what I might call technical defects without going to the root of the charge.  The court has an inherent power to amend on application by either party and it does not need the consent of both parties provided the court is satisfied the amendment sought does not go to the root of the charge so as substantially to change the charge on which the accused is arraigned.  The intention behind section 2 is to enable technical defects in the pleadings, which have no substantial effect, to be changed so that justice can be done from both sides and there will be no technical <Col N="1142" /> defect to be quashed afterwards; technical defects to be quashed afterwards could result in an unwitting miscarriage against the State.  The right to change a plea is not being interfered with; that right is contained in section 13 (4) (a) of the 1967 Act and the accused at any time, notwithstanding that he had opted to go for return on a plea of guilty, can withdraw that plea in the Circuit Court.  If he feels that the procedural amendment envisaged and permitted by section 2 prejudices him so as to alter his mind with regard to the nature of his plea he can, of course, at that stage, at that late hour withdraw his plea of guilty and enter a plea of not guilty.</P>
    <P>I made reference in my opening speech to section 18 of the 1967 Act and pointed out that section 2 was tied to it.  Section 18 of the parent Act of 1967 provides for the insertion of additional counts or the substitution of counts and it is, of course, much more significant from the point of view of the accused.  It could mean that extra counts, changed counts, different counts, could face him in the higher court.  What is proposed now does not do anything other than enabling the charge, not the indictment, in the face of a return on a plea of guilty to be amended where there is a defect.  Sometimes these charges have to be framed by someone who is not a skilled draftsman&mdash;perhaps a police officer in a hurry&mdash;and the actual form of the drafting may not be tidy or exact and, in order to cure that, this provision is being brought in. Deputy O'Malley will note it is not the indictment that is being corrected under this section but merely the charge as it appeared in the District Court.  If there were to be an indictment the position would be altogether different.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>There are a number of computer-linked studies being undertaken at the moment in relation to general hospital and psychiatric services which involve the use of patient records.</P>
      <P>The following studies are being carried out by the Medico-Social Research Board: (1) The hospital in-patient inquiry scheme which provides basic information about patients admitted to general hospitals for the purpose of producing local and national statistics; (2) The national psychiatric in-patient reporting system which analyses on an annual basis admissions and discharges into psychiatric hospitals and units; (3) The 1971 census of psychiatric hospital populations; (4) A case register study aimed at determining accurately the prevalence of treated mental illness in a number of chosen areas; (5) a study of the factors influencing the incidence of mental illness in these areas.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Eastern Health Board is operating a case register for the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All data in the aforementioned studies is processed on the Eastern Health Board computer.  In each case, adequate precautions have been taken to preserve the confidentiality of patient records.  The Eastern Health Board have informed me that the utmost precaution is taken with regard <Col N="1145" /> to security and strict instructions have been given to the punch card operators that no information is to be delivered to any person without authorisation. These instructions have been given as well as the normal security precautions in force where the divulging of medical information is concerned.  In essence, access to computerised information is so strict at present that it is more or less impossible to obtain it, without being given prior authorisation by the person supervising these projects.  If information was wanted, it would be much easier to go direct to the files within each hospital to obtain information than to try to obtain it from the computer.</P>

If, having considered the doctor's representations, he is satisfied that the doctor had not complied with the terms of the agreement, he may issue a warning or refer the case to a committee established under the Health Services Regulations, 1972. This committee are composed of five members, including representatives of the medical profession.

      <P>Surely it should be possible to get the figures on the cost of hospitalisation for any six months <Col N="1150" /> from October to March and compare them with similar figures for the same period in the previous year, so that differences in respect of hospitalisation during the winter period would not arise?</P>

      <P>As I have told the Deputy, the choice of doctor scheme has not been in operation for a full year and I do not think a comparison of one six months of a year with another six months of a year would represent a true picture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are at cross purposes. We are on different wavelengths. If we could get an estimate of the cost of hospitalisation from October, 1972, to March, 1973, when the choice of doctor scheme was in operation all over the country, and compare it with the previous year when the choice of doctor scheme did not operate at all, we might get some indication of the difference in hospitalisation costs as between these two periods.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer to get the cost over the full year.  It is only possible now to do it for a limited period in respect of most of the health boards.  The choice of doctor has been in operation only since 1st October.  In the Eastern Health Board area, granted, the scheme has been in operation for a full year and it probably would be possible to get these figures in respect of the Eastern Health Board area, but not for the others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health why a doctor is not permitted to prescribe a product (name supplied) for a medical card patient who as a terminal cancer case is unable to swallow solid foods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The product in question is a food, not a drug or medicine. Under section 59 of the Health Act, 1970, only drugs and medicines may be prescribed under the general medical service.  It is not, therefore, possible for me to have it prescribed as a drug or medicine.</P>
      <P>However, if a doctor certifies that a patient needs a certain type of food, the health board have authority and do, in fact, arrange for its supply through the home assistance service. I intend to speak with the chief executive officers of health boards this month to explore whether the product can be provided by means other than the home assistance service.</P>
      <P>I would like to stress again that any medical card holder whose doctor certifies that he or she needs the product can receive it at present from health boards in adequate quantities. If the Deputy knows of any such patient whose doctor has certified that this product is necessary and who has not received it, he should inform me immediately.  If the Deputy has a particular medical card holder in mind, he should, as I told him privately some weeks ago, give me or the health board the details and that medical card patient will have that product without delay, assuming a doctor certifies need.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister is he aware that this patient could have been admitted to hospital and it would have cost the State at least £40 a week?  What I was asking for was that the State would contribute 75p at a maximum to provide this product for a person who could not swallow solid food and, in those circumstances, <Col N="1152" /> it was a medicinal product. The patient has since died and it does not matter any more.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a very important point that the product should have been made available.  It would not have cost the State anything.  In the case of a person suffering from terminal cancer, 75p was nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to make it clear that I did not and still do not know the name of the patient or the address of the patient. Secondly, as I have said in the reply and as I have said repeatedly over the last two weeks, while the procedure for obtaining this product may be reprehensible to some people, it cannot be prescribed as a medicine; it is a food; but if, as I have said, it is prescribed by a doctor or is advised or recommended that this product should be made available, I have given the assurance, as I have previously done, that the product can be made available through the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>On this point, all I am asking is that in the case of a medical card patient, an old age pensioner living alone in a situation such as this, the doctor should have the power to prescribe this product.  That is a very simple request on behalf of many old persons who, because of certain medical conditions, are unable to take solid foods.  In their case this would be a medicinal product.  I am asking this for persons living on their own, holders of medical cards&mdash;&mdash;</P>

As far as my information and the advice given to me is concerned it is that the product is a food and not a medicine.  I appreciate the difficulty of a person who needs the product and of the doctor who says that the product is required but as far as the mechanics of obtaining the product are concerned, I have assured the Deputy, as I assure the House, that if any doctor recommends that this product is necessary for a patient, it can be given, and given very quickly.</P>

If he indicates either that a doctor has accepted him or that he has been unable to obtain acceptance by a doctor, the health board will make the necessary arrangements for him.

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply of 28th March, 1973, to a similar Parliamentary Question asked by him.  The position is that holders of medical cards are entitled to free treatment in public wards for specific medical or surgical conditions and in these circumstances no directive of the type mentioned is necessary.</P>
      <P>In view of the number of queries I have had on the subject, I have asked officials of my Department to write to each chief executive officer requesting them to ensure that a medical card holder who is hospitalised for a specific medical or surgical condition is not requested to hand over his or her pension book to officials of the health boards.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there are circumstances in which it is difficult to decide whether a patient should be seen as a medical patient or as a long-stay continuing care patient.  I am asking health boards not to make a distinction between these two conditions for pension book purposes until the person has been hospitalised for three continuous months.</P>

The amounts claimed range from 24 per cent in the case of interns to 42 per cent at the maximum of the scale for registrars.  Whether or not a claim such as this is admissible under the national wage agreement will be a matter, in the first place, for the arbitrator.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Health Board have submitted an outline programme of improvements to St. Mary's Hospital to be effected over the next three to five years.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he has received any reports that the hospital at Crooksling, County Dublin, presents a serious fire hazard; and, if so, the action being taken in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received such reports.  Crooksling Hospital is an old building and is of such a construction that it represents a fire hazard and, in my view, should be phased out of service whenever alternative accommodation <Col N="1162" /> for those housed in it can be provided.</P>
      <P>In the meantime everything possible is being done to minimise risks. A 24-hour patrol by male staff to cover fire hazards is maintained and continuous contact is kept between the Fire Officer, Eastern Health Board and the Fire Protection Officer, Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that a fire hazard exists here, where geriatric patients are accommodated, could the matter be looked at urgently, not merely by having patrols but by having the hazard eliminated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, being a member of the Eastern Health Board, might have a little more personal knowledge than I would have of Crooksling, but the difficulty is to find accommodation for these 200 elderly female patients.  It is proposed that they get accommodation in three or four other places, but this will take some time.  I am informed there will be 40 beds available for these people during this autumn and that next year there will be 80 beds available as well for patients who are now in Crooksling.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of suitable exits or means of escape from hospital buildings is primarily the responsibility of the hospital management. The fire protection standards issued by the Department of Local Government in 1967 lay down that &ldquo;Exits or means of escape in all buildings have to be considered on the merits of each case.&rdquo;  Buildings of modern design conforming with these standards do not need to be fitted with emergency fire escapes in the sense the Deputy has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to this problem generally, circular letters have been issued to health boards by my Department drawing attention to the fire hazards in hospitals; requesting that steps be taken to minimise the danger of fires occurring and urging that suitable <Col N="1163" /> arrangements be made for the safe evacuation of patients and staff where a fire does occur.  The Hospitals Commission have issued similar circulars to the voluntary hospitals.  I understand from the chief executive officers of the health boards that they are actively following up this advice and exhortation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    <P>I am advised that, in general, elderly patients admitted to psychiatric institutions <Col N="1164" /> have a psychiatric condition.  It would be exceptional to admit an old person simply because of physical infirmity and this is done only in urgent circumstances where accommodation in a more appropriate institution is not available.  As services for the aged, including the provision of more places in welfare homes, are extended the need for admissions of this sort to mental hospitals will cease.  I would like to add that some mental hospitals have already found it possible to discharge suitable patients to homes for the old and I hope that the number of such discharges will increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 36 together.</P>
      <P>The most comprehensive submissions on measures to deal with the problem were those contained in the report of the Working Party on Drug Abuse, submitted to the Minister and published in 1971.  A summary of the recommendations is contained in pages 55 to 58 of the report.  These have been fully considered in my Department and many of the measures have already been implemented.  Others will fall to be considered in conjunction with a Misuse of Drugs Bill on which I intend to consult the Government as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>Last year the Co-ordinating Committee on Drug Abuse was established, comprising representatives of relevant Government Departments and other bodies, to ensure that there is a full exchange of information regarding drug abuse and on the various measures being taken.  The committee also ensure that, where necessary, effective action is taken as speedily as possible to deal with matters arising in relation to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee do not issue reports as such but in discharging their functions as a co-ordinating and liaison body and in considering appropriate recommendations, they take full account of the latest position as reported by the representatives of the various Government Departments and other bodies present at the meetings of the committee, which are held regularly. In the intervals between meetings the committee's chairman maintains contact with the Departments and bodies concerned to ensure that there <Col N="1166" /> is adequate follow-up of matters calling for attention.</P>
    <P>As regards education on drug abuse, a special committee is examining the general question of communicating information on drugs to young persons, to provide guidance for school authorities and to indicate where research is needed.  The committee expect to furnish their report later this year.</P>
    <P>In the meantime my Department, in co-operation with a number of other bodies, have been holding a series of seminars on drug abuse for school teachers, clergy, doctors and nurses.  In addition, special lectures have been provided for adult and parent groups.  These were recommended by the Working Party on Drug Abuse.  Furthermore, a residential course was held earlier this month for a selected group of teachers.</P>
    <P>Apart from recommendations arising out of the work of the bodies mentioned above suggestions have been received in my Department from time to time from bodies and individuals regarding drug abuse.  These receive full consideration and, where appropriate, action is taken as speedily as possible on the suggestions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There are six sheltered workshops in Dublin receiving grants from public funds and providing sheltered employment facilities for 350 persons.  Vocational training centres are not included in these figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the Workshop for the Blind in Rathmines, which is under State auspices, and the Hanbury Lane Workshop, which is operated by the Eastern Health Board, the workshops concerned are operated by private <Col N="1168" /> organisations and I have no detailed knowledge of their activities or disbursements.</P>
    <P>Workers at the Hanbury Lane Workshop receive up to £5 a week and are entitled to retain any Social Welfare benefits as well.  They are also entitled to a transport allowance.</P>
    <P>Workers at the Workshop for the Blind receive an average wage of £23 a week.</P>

      <P>No changes have been made since 14th March, 1973, in the terms of reference of any body appointed under the aegis of my Department.</P>
      <P>Only in the case of two bodies under the aegis of my Department are the members paid.  In the case of one of these, the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, there has been no change in the composition.  In the case of the other, the Hospitals Commission, which is due to go out of existence shortly, the membership has been reduced from 1st July from six to three.  The continuing members were members of the former larger body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1171" /> The membership of the Mass Radiography Board, apart from the chairman, has traditionally consisted of members of the staff of health boards appointed on a rotating basis and members of the staff of my Department whose work is related to the work of the board.  Changes in the membership of the board in the period mentioned were in accordance with these principles.</P>
    <P>The Cork Hospitals Board consists of persons nominated by the Southern Health Board, the chief executive officer of that board and the president of University College, Cork, together with civil servants selected by the Minister for Education and by me.  Certain changes in the membership resulted from past nominations by the nominating authorities and from the appointment by me of an officer of my Department to replace another such officer who in the normal course had moved to other work unrelated to that of the board.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Blood Transfusion Board, a county manager, who has now no function in regard to the health services, was replaced by an officer of a health board.</P>
    <P>In two other cases, the Poisons Council and the Dublin Dental Hospitals Board, an appropriately qualified professional person was appointed to replace another such person.  In one case a man had died and in the other a man had resigned due to pressure of other work.</P>
    <P>In the only other case in which there was a change in composition, I accepted the recommendation of the BCG Committee for the appointment of two named additional professional persons to the committee.</P>

Apart from the proposed removal of the marriage bar for appointments under health boards, I am at present considering, in consultation with the boards, what further steps can be taken to improve the recruitment position.  Another factor which should improve matters is the decision of the two physiotherapy schools to increase this year the annual intake of students, i.e. from a total of 42 students to a total of 54 students.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>My reply on 5th July was as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incidence of uncertified deaths is falling steadily and in 1970 represented 1.5 per cent of all deaths registered.  It is hoped that this progress will be maintained.  An associated problem is the failure to register deaths.  A reorganisation of local registration services which is in course of implementation will include the <Col N="1178" /> appointments of a full-time superintendent registrar for each health board area.  The duties of these officers will include liaison with clergy, undertakers and any other persons associated with burials.  This development should, it is hoped, go a long way towards the elimination of unregistered and uncertified deaths.  If the results are not entirely satisfactory, a further review of the matter will be undertaken.</P>
    <P>Consideration was given to the possibility of requiring death certificates to be issued before burials could take place.  Such a measure would need the most elaborate administrative arrangements which would be justified only if the steps which I have outlined prove to be ineffective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw to the Parliamentary Secretary's attention a recent survey in the West of Ireland which indicated that the figures at least in the west of Ireland would be somewhat higher than those he indicated.  In that area 7.5 per cent of the deaths were not medically certified or registered.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that the Minister has power under the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registration Act, 1972, to make undertakers <Col N="1179" /> notify registrars of deaths in their area?  This might be effective as an interim measure until something more definite can be done.</P>

Investigations carried out on behalf of my Department by the operations research unit of the Department of Finance have fully endorsed the Southern Health Board's proposals regarding the location of vehicles.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Medical cards are issued to persons who are unable to provide general medical services for themselves and their dependants.  In deciding the question of whether or not an applicant is entitled to a card, the health board must assess the means of the applicant.  In the case of farmers, this involves getting information, among other things, on the <Col N="1180" /> stock held by the farmer.  I understand that, in some cases, documents on warble fly eradication are sought as evidence of the size of the farmer's herd.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position to comment on what effect this action might have on the eradication scheme but I understand that the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has dealt with this in reply to a similar question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>

I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of the danger that some young cattle not for sale may not be given treatment for warble fly in order to ensure that the owner qualifies for a medical card. Warble fly certificates are issued for calves and for three-year-old bullocks. A farmer could have ten cards for ten calves worth £50 or he could have ten cards for bullocks worth £200. There could be a danger here if this method of assessment is used.</P>

      <P>Pollution generally, including the discharging of sewage into the sea, is a matter which comes within the functions of the Minister for Local Government.  As Minister for Health I am concerned with possible health hazards arising therefrom.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, in relation to the Dublin coastal resorts, arrangements obtain under which regular tests are made on samples of sea-water taken at intervals from March to October at various points in Dublin Bay.  These tests give the E Coli count of the sea-water and the Dublin Chief Medical Officer reports to my Department on the general position.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the overall analysis of these tests indicates that the level of pollution is not such as to give cause for concern from the point of view of being a health hazard to swimmers.</P>
      <P>Apart from the foregoing tests I understand that a survey of the river Liffey and Dublin Bay is in progress which includes assessment of the present position regarding the pollution problem of the area including pollution by sewage.</P>

      <P>These recommendations are at present being considered by Comhairle na Nimheanna in conjunction with the preparation of new regulations to be made under the Poisons Act, 1961.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, the National Drugs Advisory Board have had discussions with the Pharmaceutical, Chemical and Allied Industries Association <Col N="1183" /> regarding the marketing and sale of aspirin generally.  The board and the association have agreed on a number of measures, for example, the labelling of aspirin to indicate that it is a medicine and should be kept out of the way of children; the use of dark or opaque containers so that contents are not clearly visible; the use of child resistant containers and the limitation of pack size.</P>
    <P>Some of these measures have already been implemented and steps are being taken to put the remainder into effect shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey) Frank Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <Col N="1184" /> With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 61 together.</P>
      <P>It was made clear in the course of the debate on the Social Welfare Bill in Dáil Éireann on 14th June last, and later in seanad Éireann that because of the enormous amount of work involved, not to mention problems in regard to staff, accommodation, equipment and in getting essential printing done, there would be some delay in getting the new increased rates of children's allowances into payment.  The general public were similarly advised in Press notices published on 19th June and 3rd July last.  These notices also contained instructions for obtaining the increases later if persons wished to cash allowance orders for July at the old rate.</P>
      <P>The position is that owing to the great number of families involved, some 359,000 representing 1,013,000 qualified children, it was not possible in the time available to have new allowances books for the increases printed and distributed within anything like a reasonable time and it was necessary to resort to the printing of special adhesive stamps to the value of the increase in allowance payable each month which could be affixed to existing allowance orders already in the hands of recipients.  Even this could not be done overnight, as I am sure the Deputy will appreciate.  The dies for the stamps had to be manufactured in England and even with the most strenuous efforts on the part of the Stamping Branch of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners the first delivery of these stamps was not received in my Department until 23rd June last.  They have been issued to recipients since then as fast as supplies have come to hand and, in fact, some 120,000 families had received their stamps in time to cash them with the July allowance orders payable on 3rd July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For example, practically all families resident in the counties Donegal, Leitrim, Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Roscommon, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth, received their adhesive stamps before 3rd July.  In addition, a substantial proportion of families in the counties of <Col N="1185" /> Wexford, Wicklow, Waterford, Kilkenny, Carlow, Kildare, Laois, Offaly, Meath, Westmeath and Longford, also received their stamps before the due date, as well as some thousands of families living in the Cork and north and south Dublin areas.</P>
    <P>The issue of stamps to all remaining families in the country will be completed within the next week or so.  As those who did not receive them in time to cash them with their July allowance orders have already been advised by press notice, and are also being advised by means of a leaflet enclosed with their stamps, they may, if they have already cashed the July allowance orders, affix both the July and August stamps to the August order when cashing that order on the due date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Generally speaking, refusal to pass a picket is regarded as a form of participation in a trade dispute and as such constitutes a disqualification for unemployment benefit.  The question of whether disqualification is incurred by a worker who does not pass a picket in the course of a dispute at his place of employment is a matter for decision by a statutory deciding officer having regard to the circumstances of each case.  Such a decision is, of course, subject to a right of appeal to a statutory appeals officer whose decision is final.  The trade dispute disqualification clauses of the Social Welfare Acts were designed to ensure that the social insurance fund should have a clearly neutral role in any situation where a stoppage of work arising from a trade dispute has occurred and amendment of these clauses is not contemplated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware of the growing concern of the public at the decision of appeals officers to disallow for unemployment benefit a married woman on the birth of a baby; and if he intends to introduce <Col N="1187" /> amending legislation to provide for appeals against such decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>There are no statistics available in my Department relating to complaints made about decisions of appeals officers regarding question of title of married women with children to unemployment benefit.  Dissatisfaction with those decisions of appeals officers in which unemployment benefit is refused to married women with children is due, I believe, to a lack of appreciation of the statutory conditions which govern title to unemployment benefit and which require every claimant to unemployment benefit, including a married woman with a child, to satisfy the conditions governing entitlement, including the requirement that a claimant be available for employment.</P>
      <P>I think that it might be helpful if I explained briefly what is involved in the availability condition.  Under statutory provisions in Social Welfare legislation, persons are deemed to be available for employment in certain circumstances.  These provisions affect only persons undergoing approved courses of rehabilitation training and define days of unemployment in the special case of night workers.  In respect of the generality of claimants to whom those provisions are not applicable, I am indebted for the following information to deciding officers and appeals officers who, as the House is aware, are completely independent in the exercise of their statutory functions and are not subject to direction or control by me or anyone else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The criteria used in determining whether a person is or is not available for employment are broadly whether a genuine desire and intention to obtain work is present, whether domestic or other commitments exist which might limit the person's freedom to accept, or might prevent acceptance of, full-time employment which would normally be suitable for him, and whether restrictions are being imposed <Col N="1188" /> by the person on the kind, place or hours of employment acceptable to him, any of which would unreasonably diminish his prospects of obtaining work.  The availability for employment of any claimant to unemployment benefit&mdash;whether or not the claimant be a married woman with a child&mdash;is a question to be determined by deciding officers and appeals officers, in the exercise of their statutory functions, through the interpretation and application of any or all of these broad criteria in the light of, and in relation to, the whole facts and evidence available in each particular case.</P>
    <P>It is not intended to make any change in the system of the hearing by appeals officers of appeals from persons who are dissatisfied with decisions of deciding officers on their claims under the Social Welfare Acts. I might draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that a person who has a claim to benefit disallowed by an appeals officer, the claim already having been refused by a deciding officer, has failed to satisfy either of two separate and independent determining authorities that he has a right to the benefit he is claiming.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>When were the original regulations formulated?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not agree that since these regulations were formulated there has been a transformation in our society in that nowadays, married women go into employment as a matter of course and that the fact that they have children does not hamper them in making themselves available for work?  At a time when we talk of the status of women, we find that there is discrimination against married women in regard to employment.  Is it not discriminatory that a woman who offers herself for work is disqualified because she has a child?  The decision of an appeals officer is immaterial in such a case.  Is it not desirable, therefore that in our modern society we <Col N="1189" /> should amend the existing legislation in this regard so as to ensure that if a woman presents a certificate to the effect that she cannot get a job, she will be entitled to unemployment benefit?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not table those questions for fun.  The issue is a very important one.  When an offer of employment is refused, an appeals officer is justified in refusing an application for unemployment benefit but is it not discriminatory that an application is refused solely on the basis of a woman having a child?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's supplementary involved many issues but there are two comments that I would make in regard to it.  There is no question of disqualification of a woman from receiving unemployment benefit solely because she has a child.  The decisions are reached by deciding officers and appeals officers who are absolutely independent of the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

      <P>A new book of pension orders addressed by the Department to the post office normally used by the pensioner named failed to arrive at that post office before the due date of the first pension order therein, 6th July, 1973.  This fact was notified to the Department, the post office confirming on Monday, 9th July, 1973, that the book had still not arrived.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>A person employed under a contract of service and earning £1,600 per annum is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.  The contributions payable in respect of him and the benefits for which he is covered depend on the class of employment.  For example, persons in industrial, commercial and services type employment pay the ordinary rate of contribution and are covered for all benefits under the Acts.  These benefits are unemployment and disability benefit, invalidity, widows', orphans', retirement and old age pensions, marriage, maternity, deserted wife's and treatment benefit, death grant and occupational injuries benefit. Persons in permanent and pensionable employment in the public sector such as civil servants, employees of local and public authorities and teachers, <i>et cetera</i>, pay special rates of contributions and are covered for widows' and orphans' pensions and occupational injuries benefits only.</P>
      <P>These existing contributions and benefits are flat rate only.  The proposed pay-related benefits scheme will provide a benefit related to pay to supplement the existing flat rate benefits payable during sickness and unemployment.  The additional contribution to finance this scheme will also be related to pay.  The collection of pay-related contributions and the payment of benefit will both commence at the beginning of April, 1974.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Statistics of the number of employers who fail to stamp insurance cards in any one insurance year are not compiled.  Defaulters are brought to notice in several ways throughout each year and most arrears are recovered by local action.  Those cases in which local action fails are reported to headquarters and only when the cases so reported reach certain stages are statistics compiled.  The records for the year ended 31st December, 1972 show the number of cases brought to these stages to be as follows:&mdash; (a) Referred to Chief State Solicitor for civil proceedings&mdash; 676; (b) Referred to Chief State Solicitor for summary proceedings&mdash; 300; (c) Claims made on receivers and liquidators&mdash;51; (d) Claims made on the Official Assignee&mdash;7; (e) Claims made on solicitors for deceased employers&mdash;27; (f) Cases in payment by instalments&mdash;130.</P>
      <P>In detecting employers who fail to stamp insurance cards the Department depends mainly on a system of regular inspections designed to ensure that most attention is paid to those employers most likely to default, but defaulters are also brought to notice through failure to surrender cards, through inspection of trade papers and through complaints by insured persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions governing this summer's cadetship competitions will differ from those which governed similar summer competitions in recent years in the following principal respects:</P>
      <P>(1)  The educational standard for Army cadetships was previously that of the matriculation of the National University of Ireland and the educational standard for cadetships in the Air Corps and Naval Service was that of the leaving certificate of the Department of Education.  Applicants in this summer's competitions for cadetships in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service will be eligible on educational grounds if they have either of the two standards;</P>
      <P>(2)  All Army cadets appointed as a result of summer competitions in recent years were required to undergo, as part of their training, a first year degree course at University College, Galway.  In the case of the Army cadets who will be appointed as a result of this summer's competition, only those with the matriculation standard will be required to attend university;</P>
      <P>(3)  While Irish will continue to be an essential subject for the purpose of eligibility on educational grounds under either of the standards I have mentioned, candidates for this summer's cadetship competitions will not be required to undergo an oral test in Irish as part of the competitions and no vacancies will be reserved for candidates specially qualified in Irish;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  The upper age limit for all cadetship competitions has, in recent years, been 20 years, with an extension of one year for those with certain service in the Defence Forces.  The upper age limit for this summer's Army cadetship competition is being raised to 21 years with an extension of one year for those with certain service in the Defence Forces.  This is being done so that those candidates <Col N="1210" /> who did not qualify in the oral test in Irish in the supplementary competition for Army cadetships held earlier this year will not be debarred, by reason of age, from admission to the summer competition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is entirely incorrect.  The situation is that if, at the moment, the Deputy had to undergo a leaving certificate examination from which he could purchase his matriculation he would be required to do an oral test in Irish.  The requirement, which in my view is quite incorrect, that one-third of the places were reserved for people with special qualifications in Irish, and that a further oral Irish test was necessary for admission to cadetship, is now being abandoned. It means that you have got to do your Irish as an ordinary subject. You have got to pass your leaving certificate or matriculation in Irish and, when you have done that, you are fit to be in the Irish Army.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">

      <P>Does this not mean that the Irish Army are now abandoning their traditional position as being one of the primary nurseries which we have had since the foundation of the State for the Irish language?

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view the supplementaries are all incorrect.  If a cadet succeeds in a competitive examination, which it really is, in getting a place as a cadet, and if that place does not entitle him to go to Galway University, he can be a cadet and he does not go to the university, but if he has got the university qualification he goes.  That is all that is to it.  The reservation of one-third of the places for people with special qualifications in Irish goes, as I promised it would go.</P>

      <P>I should like to inquire about that and I will address myself to it.  The reservation of one-third of the vacancies for people with special qualifications in Irish in my opinion was most unfair.  This requirement was introduced in 1957.  That is gone and the nine people who failed their oral Irish test when they were being interviewed for the Army during the spring examination will have a chance in the summer examination. For this one year I have extended the age-limit by one year so that they can get a second chance.  Nobody has been disqualified.  Those nine people have got their chance.  I promised to do it, and I have done it and I have no apologies to make.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence the reason why unmarried officers and men of the Defence Forces are not regarded as qualified for retirement gratuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>94.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he will examine the question of the payment of gratuities <Col N="1213" /> and retirement pay and pensions to single personnel of the permanent Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 and 94 together.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes do not provide for the payment of gratuities on retirement in addition to pension for single personnel of the Permanent Defence Force the reason being that, basically, single personnel receive the same rate of pension as married personnel even though the single rates of pay are lower than the married rates.</P>
      <P>I am, however, having the matter examined to see if there is any way in which gratuities in addition to pension can be provided for single personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasAnthonyKyne" hpid="Mr. Kyne Mr. Kyne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in Question No. 94, which has to do with pensions and gratuities on retirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The married rates of pay for officers of the Permanent Defence Force are higher than the single rates, but the married and single rates of retired pay are exactly the same for lieutenants and for captains and not very different for the other ranks up to colonel.  Therefore, the maximum retired pay of a single officer represents a much higher percentage of pay than that of a married officer, for example, 61 per cent in the case of a single captain as against 48 per cent in the case of a married captain.</P>
      <P>The foregoing arises from the pensions structure for Army officers, which is not a pay related one as in the case of other branches of the public service.  Basically the pension is the same whether an officer is married or single and a married officer gets a gratuity in addition&mdash;in effect a resettlement grant to enable him to set up home afresh on retirement.  If, therefore, single officers were to get gratuities, their pensions would have to be reduced relative to the unmarried rates of pay.  This question is at present under consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A single soldier receives the same basic pension as a married one, even <Col N="1214" /> though the latter's pay is higher. However, the married soldier receives an additional married pension plus a gratuity of a maximum of 31 weeks' pay.  A case could, possibly, be made for the payment of a gratuity to a single soldier on the same basis as that payable to a married soldier.  This could not, however, be dealt with without also dealing with the case of the single officer and the whole question will take some time to resolve.</P>
    <P>The matter is at present being examined in consultation with the military authorities.  If agreement is reached, it will be necessary to obtain the sanction of the Minister for Finance and to amend the Defence Forces (Pensions) Scheme.</P>

Surely the Minister will agree that a gratuity is paid in return for service rendered over a period, whether a man is single or married?</P>

Work on this scheme was commenced in September, 1969, and to date all the houses and five blocks, comprising 30 flats, have been completed and handed over to Dublin Corporation. Fifty-four flats are in course of construction. The date for the completion of this contract is October, 1973. The question of proceeding with the balance of the flats is under review by the corporation.</P>

I hope that the Dublin area, generally, will benefit substantially, also, from the Government's emergency supplementary programme of 10,000 houses which I announced recently.  Agreement in principle has already been reached with the city and county manager on areas where the planning of major schemes under this programme may be put in hands.

      <P>Over the past nine months Fóir Teoranta have maintained the underground mine at Ballingarry in working condition at a total cost of more than £114,000, an average cost of £3,000 a week, while the receiver to the collieries has tried to dispose of the mine as a going concern.  The <Col N="1234" /> receiver is now satisfied that there is no reasonable prospect of selling the underground mine and the board of Fóir Teoranta have decided, therefore, to discontinue the maintenance operation with effect from 27th July.</P>
      <P>I regret that there is no action that I can take in this matter.  In the past two years alone the State has provided more than £360,000 to keep the collieries open.  Even with further significant State investment there could be no assurance that the collieries would reach a viable position. In the circumstances, further State assistance cannot be justified and the only reasonable course is to discontinue maintenance work.  The only prospect for a resumption of mining at Ballingarry is on an open-cast basis and the decision to cease maintenance of the underground mine does not affect this prospect.</P>

      <P>I received representations from commercial concerns in Ballingarry.  The ability of the Minister for Finance to be involved in this is limited by the establishment of Fóir Teoranta.  Fóir Teoranta are a body empowered with certain statutory functions in this area with which I cannot interfere.  I know that all offers made were most earnestly considered.  I am aware of the importance to Ballingarry of the preservation of this industry, but Fóir Teoranta, who are the body with the statutory authority in this sphere, are satisfied that the continuance of this mine or of the <Col N="1235" /> steps necessary to maintain it in working condition would not be justified.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy will be grateful that, although Fóir Teoranta came to this conclusion three months ago, I succeeded in persuading them to keep the operations going in the hope that another three months might have produced some viable offer for the mine. Unfortunately, it was not forthcoming. In the circumstances, having regard to the fact that the board of Fóir Teoranta thought that the closure should have taken place about three months ago it was obviously not on to recommend the continuation of the operations any longer.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As Deputies are only too well aware their remuneration and the remuneration of Ministers and Parliamentary officers has remained unchanged since 1968.  Since 1968 other groups have had their pay increased on four or five occasions under the various pay rounds.  It is clear therefore that this Bill is long overdue.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand they are about to be distributed.  It is also true to say that increases in remuneration proposed for Members of the House are subject to more criticism, much of it ill-informed, than the increases for any other group in the country.  One reason for such criticism is that delay in making increases has necessitated fairly substantial increases in the long run to compensate for depreciation in money values.  One criticism which has been made in the past and which had the appearance of substance was that parliamentarians could vote themselves &ldquo;unjustified&rdquo; increases in pay.  Those who voiced this criticism argued that there should be some sort of independent body which would determine the appropriate remuneration for Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December, 1970, the Government of the day decided to ask the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector to examine and report on the levels of remuneration of members of the Government, Parliamentary Secretaries, Attorney General and Chairman and Deputy Chairman of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Eireann and allowances of Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The report of the review body was submitted to the Minister for Finance on 11th July, 1972.  It was published on 9th September, 1972.  As Members are aware, the review body made a detailed <Col N="1240" /> study of the work of parliamentarians and also examined jobs in the higher levels of the economy generally.  They recommended substantial increases in the pay of parliamentarians.</P>
    <P>On 27th October, 1972 the Government of the day announced that because of the existence of the National Pay agreements they felt it was necessary to ask the Employer/Labour Conference to advise in relation to the extent to which effect might be given to the review body's recommendations on the basis of and for the duration of the national agreements.</P>
    <P>The Employer/Labour Conference set up a special committee to examine and report to the Minister.  In its report, dated 22nd December, 1972, the special committee indicated the rates which would be appropriate having regard to the general increases under the 12th Round and the National Agreement, 1970.  This Government decided, as I stated on 20th June, that the new rates of remuneration should apply with effect from 1st July, 1973 &mdash;the date from which the increases in social welfare benefits announced in the budget were to be paid.  The rates proposed in the present Bill have been determined on the basis of the application to the existing rates of the increases that applied throughout the public sector under the 12th round and the national agreements.  In so far as office-holders are concerned, they are for the most part significantly below the rates recommended by the review body.  For example, Ministers will be paid £654 less than the review body recommended.</P>
    <P>I am personally satisfied that these rates are entirely justified and that, having regard to the prevailing national agreement climate, they represent the most appropriate revisions that could be made.  It should be remembered that a Deputy's job is unique in that he is at all times at the disposal of the public.  There can be no question of the job of a Deputy being done on a nine-to-five basis. &ldquo;Overtime&rdquo; does not arise.  He is expected to sacrifice his personal time for the public good.  He gets no allowance for secretarial services, even <Col N="1241" /> though he may have to write thousands of letters on behalf of his constituents. He has no entertainment allowance nor has he an expense allowance.  These expenses must be met from his parliamentary allowance.</P>
    <P>The arguments I have used in relation to Deputies apply with even greater force to members of the Government because of the commitments of office.  The continuity of their business or professional interests is broken.  The Minister's responsible job involves him in directing a Department, formulating policy on many aspects of national life, and explaining these policies to the Oireachtas and to the public.  Nowadays he may frequently have to travel abroad on official business.  There is no managerial or directive post which is more responsible and demanding. Nevertheless a Minister's salary, even as increased under this Bill, will still lag well behind the remuneration obtaining for a top management job in commerce, in industry, or in the top strata of the professions.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General is a Member of the Dáil.  Like Ministers, he has agreed to refrain from involvement in any other business or profession for the duration of his appointment. The Bill proposes therefore to bring his remuneration and pension into line with the remuneration and pension of Ministers.  The salary for an Attorney General who is not a Member of the Oireachtas is being increased in the same way as the other salaries and allowances covered by the Bill, that is to say, by the application to the existing rate of salary of the 12th round of the national agreements.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes that in future, increases in the allowances of Deputies and Senators and in the salaries of Parliamentary office-holders may be granted by way of Government order instead of Act of the Oireachtas as heretofore.  It will, however, be necessary for the Government to lay before the Dáil a draft of any such order, and if the Dáil disapproves of <Col N="1242" /> the draft order within 21 sitting days the order shall not be made.  In a situation where Members' remuneration is affected by national pay agreements it is desirable to minimise the delays which are inevitable between the decision to introduce legislation and the final passing of the legislation. There is, in my opinion, no good reason why increases in remuneration of Members of the Oireachtas should be subject to obstacles which are not placed in the way of any other section of the community.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact that the remuneration of Members of the Oireachtas has not been increased since 1968, that the increases now proposed are in line with the increases given to public servants generally under the 12th round and the national agreements, I think that it will be generally accepted by this House and outside this House, that the increases proposed in the Bill are entirely justified and I recommend the proposals in the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>When we were notified of the introduction of this Bill and were requested to give it a quick passage through the House, we were informed by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach that the Bill would contain no surprises.  It was on that basis we agreed to the proposal that all Stages might be taken quickly in succession.  As I indicated yesterday, it certainly contained surprises.  I refer to one as an omission and the other as an addition.</P>
      <P>The addition I refer to is the provision of a pension for the Attorney General.  Let me say at the outset that I think it is only fair that an Attorney General who gives up his practice in order to devote his full time to his job as Attorney General, having served the minimum of three years, is entitled to a pension.  I shared I am sure with a number of other Members of the House, who are members of the legal profession and particularly who are barristers, the difficult experience of trying to get back into practice after a period in office. I can assure the House it is no easy job to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1243" /> It is entirely fair that the pension provision be made available.  That is the addition.  There is a little jam on that addition in that hitherto an Attorney General, whether he practised or not, was given a lump sum on retirement irrespective of how long he served as Attorney General.  The lump sum amounted to 1½ times his yearly salary.  As a result of this Bill, not only will a pension be provided but a lump sum will also be provided. This point will be dealt with in more detail subsequently.</P>
    <P>The omission to which I referred is the fact that there is no provision for increasing the Opposition allowance. At this stage I am confining my remarks to that omission, first, in order to highlight it and, secondly, in speaking first I hope to give the Minister and the Government an opportunity to repair that omission&mdash;that is, if it was an accidental omission.  However, I am inclined to believe it was not an accidental omission; I think it was done deliberately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy would allow me to intervene in case there is any misunderstanding.  An Attorney General who will get a pension because he is full-time will not get a lump sum.  The lump sum would apply only if he is part-time but, as the present Attorney General is full-time, he will not get a lump sum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be the case but it should be provided for in legislation. The provision giving him a lump sum already is in legislation and is not repealed.  However, I am open to correction on that but we can expand on that later.  I have said the omission may have been accidental but I am inclined to believe it was not for the simple reason it was brought to the attention of the Government some weeks ago that if there was to be an increase in the salaries of Ministers, Deputies and Senators there should be an increase also in the Opposition allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to trace the history of these allowances since 1938 when the first Bill was introduced.  It was called the Ministerial and Parliamentary <Col N="1244" /> Offices Act.  It provided for payment of £800 for what was then described as the Second Party&mdash;the First Party being the Government Party&mdash;and £500 for the Third Party.  The next legislation dealing with the matter was in 1947 under the same title and it provided for an across-the-board 30 per cent increase in these allowances.</P>
    <P>Next there was the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Act, 1960; section 13 of that Act provided for an allowance of £4,500 for the Opposition.  If there were more than two parties in Opposition, it provided £3,000 for the largest party and £1,500 for the next.  That introduced the principle of what was described as &ldquo;qualified parties&rdquo;.  A qualified party is one that went forward for election as an organised party in the next general election and returned to Dáil Éireann at least seven members. As a result of that, there was provision for the distribution of the sum of £4,500 in certain detail which it is not necessary for me to discuss here.  The next Act in 1964 under the same title increased the allowance to £5,040 overall or, in the case of two parties, £3,600 for the larger party and £1,680 for the second party.  In the 1968 Act the allowance was increased dramatically to £15,000 overall or, in the event of there being more than one party in Opposition, £10,000 for the larger and £5,000 for the small party.</P>
    <P>This is the first Bill which has not contained a progressive and fair increase for the Opposition.  It is generally acknowledged that if Parliamentary democracy is to survive and work well there must be an efficient and effective Opposition.  We have no intention of being other than an efficient and effective Opposition but, given a fair allowance, we can become more efficient and more effective and, therefore, perhaps embarrass the Government to a greater extent.</P>
    <P>Be that as it may, there has been an injustice done here if this is a deliberate decision.  If it is a deliberate decision, I can only describe it as a petty piece of politicking.  The increase between 1964 and 1968 was three-fold.  That was in a period of <Col N="1245" /> four years when the inflationary trend besetting the world was not nearly as intense as now.  A longer period has elapsed and a more intense period of inflation has intervened between 1968 and 1973 and, consequently, there is no justification whatever for omitting to increase the Opposition allowance.</P>
    <P>As is well known, I am preparing to set up a service for the Opposition. It will be comprised entirely of voluntary people, people eminent in different aspects of life, professional, vocational and otherwise.  Although it will be completely voluntary, it will be necessary to service it with some form of paid Secretariat.  That kind of service and the ordinary expenses an Opposition must undertake can come only from the Opposition allowance. There is no other fund available except that we appeal publicly for funds.  As the House is aware, this form of appeal is confined to a political organisation rather than a parliamentary party as such, especially a party in Opposition.</P>
    <P>When the three-fold increase to £15,000 was made in 1968 it was done as a result of representations from the then Opposition who now form the Government.  We were magnanimous in our reaction to that approach and we considered we were treating the Opposition only as fairly as they deserved to be treated in the circumstances. Failure to give an increase, even after representations had been received, is treating the Opposition in a most unfair manner.</P>
    <P>If the argument is made that in Opposition Fine Gael had £10,000 and Labour £5,000 while we have £15,000 I would point out that in Opposition we have more Deputies than the combined strength of Fine Gael and Labour when in Opposition. In addition, we have to service more Deputies.</P>
    <P>Also, more services are required, mainly because of our accession to the EEC but also because of the acceleration of the rate of government and administration generally. Therefore, it is necessary for the Opposition to keep step with that rate of acceleration.  I understand that <Col N="1246" /> the overall question of secretarial and other services for Deputies may be submitted to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges but the question of the allowance payable to the Opposition is a different matter from that of assistance to Deputies.  It is a principle that has long been established and is separate from the kind of services with which Deputies might be provided.  Even if this suggestion were to be submitted to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges there is no excuse for not increasing the allowance now by a fair amount and let the Committee on Procedure and Privileges make a recommendation. Obviously, they cannot make a recommendation that would be less attractive to the Opposition than is the present provision, which is inadequate in the context of the devaluation of money.</P>
    <P>This is another example of the attitude of the Government when, on the second day of their sitting, they grabbed offices of this House.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle was appointed from the benches of the Government and this was followed by the appointment from the Government benches also of the Leas-Chathaoirleach of the Seanad.  I would say, without hesitation, that had Fianna Fáil ever been guilty of either of these two deeds the Press would have been loud in their condemnation of us; but, far from that being the case on this occasion, except for one mild rebuke by one paper, which was far from suspended suspicion, in relation to the Seanad appointment, nothing was said publicly. To add what is happening in the present instance to what happened on those other two occasions seems to indicate to us that the Government are acting in a very petty manner, that they are trying to hobble the Opposition.  However, we refuse to be hobbled and, regardless of whether we are given an increase, we will be an effective, efficient and, I might say, devastating Opposition in the long run.</P>
    <P>I shall not say more on the Bill at this stage.  My colleague, the former Minister for Finance, will deal in a more comprehensive way with the <Col N="1247" /> Minister's speech.  My reason for raising this one topic is, in the first instance, to highlight what the Government are doing and, secondly, to give the Minister an opportunity of repairing the omission which, if it is deliberate is disgraceful and petty.</P>

      <P>&mdash;for a revision of the allowance payable to what we might call the official Opposition. It is most unlikely that the Government would set out purposely to deprive the Leader of the Opposition in terms of £15,000.  If I thought that were the position, I would oppose this Bill and Deputy Lynch would have my full support because I recall a time when, under the leadership of the late William Norton, the Labour Party had a tiny allowance of about £2,000.  I recall that at that time the former financial secretary of the Administrative Council of the Labour Party endeavouring to operate an Opposition Party in terms of that amount of money.  I welcomed, as did the Leader of the Labour Party, the decision of Deputy Haughey in 1968 to increase the allowance to £5,000 in the case of the Labour Party and to £10,000 for Fine Gael.  Deputy Haughey had a particular and effective way of doing things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Lynch has pointed out that no fair or progressive allowance is being made in respect of the Opposition on this occasion.  His case has been made on a relativity basis.  I do not think this matter should become one between the Government and the Opposition of the day.  It is something that concerns all of us and I suggest to the Minister for Finance that it would be a useful exercise for him to review the allowance payable to Fianna Fáil in opposition.  Admittedly, it would have to be reviewed in the context of from mid-1968 to mid-1972 because the salaries we are discussing now were computed only in the context of mid-1972. We will forget about the budget of 1973, although, by some manner or <Col N="1248" /> means, it has become involved in this Bill.  However, I shall come to that later.  There is a reasonable case to be made in respect of the Opposition for an upward adjustment in their allowance based on a four years increase&mdash; roughly 30 per cent.  There has been an 80 per cent increase in the cost of living during that period.</P>

      <P>There are no kudos for anybody in this exercise. Each of them is subject to a certain amount of excessive political expediency. On this basis an increase of 30 per cent would be justified.  I see no reason why, in a budget of such magnitude, Deputy Lynch's request could not be acceded to.  This could be done on Committee or Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I would go a step further.  If I were Minister for Finance I would have no hesitation in sanctioning £20,000 or £25,000 for the Opposition but I would ask why should only the Opposition have an allowance to enable them to operate effectively when I, as a backbench Deputy of the Government, receive no allowance from the Minister.  I have no secretarial allowance or any other.  Since becoming a Government backbencher I have had a number of offers of other employment, but I have turned down these offers.  I know that Deputies on the Opposition side also have had such offers and that <Col N="1249" /> some have accepted them while others have not.  I suggest to the Minister that he might very easily provide an allowance to the political parties so as to enable their backbenchers to maintain some elementary, civilised and democratic secretarial facilities.</P>
    <P>It is embarrassing and undesirable in the public interest to have a situation where Deputy Lynch will receive, say, £20,000 or £25,000 and then the unfortunate Leader of the Opposition has to enter into a haggle with his senior advisers and his Front Bench to decide how this is to be spent while his backbenchers look on and say: &ldquo;Will we get a couple of typists out of this?&rdquo; or: &ldquo;How much will we allow the Leader of the Opposition to retain for himself?&rdquo; We had that kind of situation in the Labour Party when we were in Opposition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>But the leader has certain inevitable expenses as leader of a political party and the parliamentary party find themselves embarrassed about the expenditure of this money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see an allowance made payable to the leaders of the parties to enable them to provide for their backbench Deputies an elementary secretarial service.  It is quite appalling that Deputies, many of whom have to write 200, 300 or 500 letters a week, should have to do as I do, namely, get their wives, if they are able and willing, to spend up to 20 hours a week, apart from looking after their families, typing letters to be posted through the free postage service of this House.  I am in the rather amusing situation as Chief Whip of the Labour Party, of having a duplicator, <Col N="1250" /> paid for by the public service, a typewriter, paid for by the public service, a dictaphone machine allocated to the Labour Party, as indeed certain equipment has been allocated to the Fine Gael and the Fianna Fáil parties, but no typist.  I have no typist. I cannot afford to pay a typist.  It is a stupid situation into which we, as members of a very small party, have allowed ourselves to drift largely due to the fact that over the years allowances to Members have become a plaything of the political parties, each of them vying with the others not to incur public odium.  As a result we have a grossly ineffective service by Members of Parliament to their constituents.</P>
    <P>Deputies are elected to legislate.  Last night, when some Members on this side were carping excessively in relation to a particular Bill and perhaps thinking that the Opposition were merely opposing for the sake of opposing, Deputy Colley quite rightly pointed out that it is the function of the Opposition to go through a Bill and to finecomb each clause in it in the national interest.  We cannot undertake this kind of work without adequate financial and secretarial back-up facilities.  It is bad enough being crucified with the grossly inadequate accommodation in this House, with four and five Deputies jammed into a couple of hundred square feet.  The Minister should take full cognisance of the point made by Deputy Lynch and also pay an adequate amount to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to enable them to provide some secretarial services for their backbenchers.</P>
    <P>It is perhaps unknown to the public that because of the gross inadequacy of parliamentary allowances and secretarial back-up services, Deputies pay, out of their own allowances, to their own parties a certain amount of money each month.  In the Labour Party we pay £5 a month to our head office to get some kind of service to enable us to perform our functions as Deputies.  That comes from our Oireachtas allowances.  I gather that in the case of Fianna Fáil Deputies it is something like £10 a month. Ministers pay, too, and I am sure Fine Gael Deputies do likewise.  This <Col N="1251" /> is archaic, undesirable and unnecessary.</P>
    <P>As an unofficial shop steward of the Deputies of this House I would urge the Minister to have a very close look at the effective date of this Bill, which is the 1st July, 1973.  I would make the point strongly to my colleagues in Government that it is not enough that we adhere to the national agreement in relation to the banks, the public service and the Judiciary; we should also adhere to it in relation to our own salaries.  The date of application of this Bill is contrary to the national wage agreement.  It is also contrary to the clear-cut report made by the Employer/Labour Conference, a special committee of which examined the question in December and reported to the Minister on the proposed Dáil increases.  The Minister in his speech said:</P>
    <P>In its report dated 22nd December, 1972, the special committee indicated the rates which would be appropriate having regard to the general increases under the 12th round and the national agreement, 1970.</P>
    <P>That is rather a bald summary of what was in that report.  The report indicated also that, if the increases were given in the context of the agreement, we could have retrospective dates of application applied.  I have no doubt this was the clear intention behind that report.  I am not suggesting that we should have these increases back-dated to January, 1972, which would be in accordance with the national wage agreement&mdash;portion of it from January, 1972 and the second half from June, 1972.  I am not suggesting that.  I am suggesting that the Minister should seriously consider on Committee Stage applying it from, say, 1st January, 1973.  Deputies would forego the best part of 12 months' retrospection in relation to half of the increase, and six months in relation to the second half, in the national interest.  As a trade unionist and as a former trade union official, I do not see the logic of applying Oireachtas increases from the date of social welfare increases.  It is quite illogical.</P>
    <P>I have never heard it said in the <Col N="1252" /> history of this State that the date should be the date of social security increases.  If that were so we should have an increase next July, which presumably we will not get, and we should have had an increase last July, which presumably Deputy Colley at the time did not see fit to bring in. I fully support Deputy Colley's reference to the Employer/Labour Conference. I thought it was the correct decision at the time on the part of the former Government.  It was entirely correct that Deputy Colley should have taken that action and I do not think he should receive any retrospective criticism in that regard.  It was also wise on his part to defer the increase.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a recommendation to the Minister of a retrospective date of the 1st January, 1973 for Members of the 19th Dáil.  Quite understandably for the new Deputies elected to the 20th Dáil there is no logical reason why they should not get the particular allowance applicable from the date of their election.  I think they should get a fair hearing on that basis.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to raise has a bearing on what Deputy Lynch has said.  In Opposition, one has a hypersensitivity towards the Government of the day in terms of the Government trying to, what is commonly called, &ldquo;screw the Opposition&rdquo;. If it became public issue that the Government on this side lack in magnanimity and were merely trying to have a go at the Opposition for the sake of having a go, or trying to do them out of a couple of thousand pounds, or trying to bring the increases in from the 1st July merely to have a go at ministerial pensions which will be affected by it, it would be very bad for Parliament.</P>
    <P>There are more serious national issues involved than this kind of micky mouse politics.  I am aware that when it comes to our own pockets we are all inclined to be hypersensitive but when it comes to the pockets of the Government versus the Opposition we should not indulge in any sort of political horseplay or try to be petty <Col N="1253" /> about the application of these increases.</P>
    <P>I should like to make an entirely different point in relation to the allowances.  To my mind this is a matter which is of growing significance in public life.  I feel that there should be some means by which Dáil Deputies should declare their financial interests in public.  I am concerned that in Britain and America there is now a growing feeling that the members of Parliament should declare their business and other interests on a register of interests so that the public are aware that on any measure coming up before Dáil Éireann it can be said that a Deputy is not talking on behalf of a special group, or on behalf of a company or on behalf of a lobbyinterest in the community.</P>
    <P>I consider this to be extremely important in the context of our joining the EEC.  I have no doubt that there will be imported into this country a fair amount of the lobby pressure which goes on in the European Parliaments in relation to, for example, EEC regulations.  One might find the 26 Members of the EEC Regulations Committee of the Oireachtas in a lobby situation like the American Senate.  A company, very seriously affected by the EEC regulations, might attempt at national legislative level to influence the acceptance or otherwise of an EEC regulation.</P>
    <P>The situation could arise of Deputies being offered consultancies as British MPs were offered in the recent past or offered straight cash bribes as were offered, and are frequently offered, in American politics.  I do not think that we would have that kind of situation here.  I am concerned that many Deputies, on election to Dáil Éireann, subsequently develop business interests.  Quite a few of them become auctioneers, quite a few of them become estate agents and others develop their business interests in different ways.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly, in the context of Oireachtas allowances, that these interests should be known.  I feel that there should be a register of interests in which Deputies would declare their <Col N="1254" /> directorships, if they hold them, or declare their major company representative capacities, if they hold them.  On that basis public life in Ireland would retain the overall, I hesitate to use the word &ldquo;purity&rdquo;, integrity which, by and large, it has managed to maintain in the recent decades.  There has not been any occasion when Deputies were held up to that kind of public odium.  Therefore, a register of this type should be opened.</P>
    <P>I think that it is impossible to consider allowances for Members of this House without simultaneously considering it in the work situation of Members.  I have felt for a long time that the hours of Leinster House, the archaic, feudal, ridiculous system by which we assemble in this building to conduct our legislative work, are utterly out of date and outmoded. It should not be beyond the capacity of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to arrange that Deputies assemble on Tuesdays at 3 o'clock and work until 10 o'clock at night. On a Wednesday there is no reason why we should not assemble at 9 o'clock in the morning.  Why should we have to work until 10.30 at night? Let us assemble here at 9 o'clock in the morning and work until 5 o'clock. On Thursdays let us assemble at 9 o'clock in the morning and work until 5 o'clock.</P>
    <P>Such an arrangement would mean that Deputies would be in a position to meet constituents on Wednesday and Thursday evenings.  In my view these hours are more logical in terms of the operation of Dáil Éireann.  If there are to be special sessions we can arrange them also.</P>

      <P>Many Deputies live within a 50 mile radius of Dublin and a number of them go home each evening.  I think the idea of keeping the Deputies, and the media, here until 10.30 p.m. regularly is absolutely ridiculous.  It is the old throw back to the day when the barristers, having had a weary and heavy morning's work <Col N="1255" /> in the courts, and having collected their paltry stipend there, then descended on Leinster House and worked for a few hours in the afternoon and evening giving the country the benefit of their legal expertise.  We should get away from that feudal arrangement and organise the work of Dáil Éireann on a better basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Fair enough, I will take the Deputy's views as conclusive evidence in that regard.  Now we are faced with a situation where many Deputies will be acting on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the EEC Regulations Committee, the All-Party Committee on Irish Relations and the Committee on State-sponsored Bodies which I hope will be set up.  We could have in the near future five or six parliamentary committees established. A great deal of extra time will be required from Deputies to devote themselves to that particular innovation. On that basis alone the volume of work load to be imposed on Deputies will be very considerable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would make that point in relation to the salaries of Deputies and I would suggest a variation to the Minister from the point of view of secretarial allowances.  Should the Minister find it impossible to grant allowances to Deputy Lynch&mdash;Deputy Lynch has an allowance, but I think it should be substantially increased&mdash;to Deputy Cosgrave, the Taoiseach, for the purpose of providing secretarial facilities for his backbenchers and to Deputy Corish, Tánaiste and Minister for Health, for the purpose of providing secretarial facilities for his backbenchers, then the obvious solution is to provide secretarial allowances for Dáil Deputies.  The Minister would have to find some £600 per annum, which is the same figure as that in the Northern Ireland Assembly, and Deputies could then make their own arrangements. Indeed, £600 would not go very <Col N="1256" /> far really in providing secretarial facilities.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, £1,000 of the £3,400 is tax free.  May I ask the Minister if the tax free allowance will be proportionately increased <i>pro rata</i> with the increase in Deputies' salaries? I take it something in the region of £1,500 of the £3,400 will be tax free. Subsequent speakers might find this an interesting point on which to press the Minister.</P>
    <P>These ideas may not necessarily coincide with the views of my colleagues.  They are my views and, if the Cabinet finds itself unable to accept them, in the best traditions of a Government backbencher I shall have to support my colleagues.  I look for an increase but I have no intention in doing so of simultaneously making myself redundant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in introducing the Bill went into some detail about the history of increased allowances and salaries.  He referred to the report of the Devlin Commission.  He said it was received in July.  It was, I think, dated 11th July, 1972, and it was received some time after that date. There appears to be a certain amount of confusion and I want to spell out exactly what the position was.  As far as the then Government were concerned the existing situation at that time differed considerably from the situation that existed when the Devlin Commission was set up.  In the summer and autumn of 1972 there was a national agreement in existence and it appeared to us vital to the economy that that national agreement should be supported in every way possible.  On that basis, the then government referred the Devlin Report to the Employer/Labour Conference to advise on the extent to which the report conformed with the previous wage rounds and the national agreement.  The report of the Employer/Labour Conference showed that, in their view, the Devlin Report did not conform with the previous wage rounds and the national agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to stress that the report of the Employer/Labour Conference was received by me a few days before <Col N="1257" /> Christmas.  It was immediately published. As indicated by this Bill, any implementation of it required legislation. When the House next met the present Government took office and there was, therefore, no opportunity for me, or the Government of which I was a member, to implement the Employer/Labour Conference report.  The Minister for Finance, as on previous occasions, although corrected on the point, said that I, as Minister for Finance, should have implemented the Devlin Report.  The Minister for Lands answering questions here in the House for another Minister said the same thing.  Some of the backbenchers over there have also said the same thing and Deputy Barry Desmond said the same thing at the beginning of his speech today and, in support of Deputy Barry Desmond, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said: &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo;. In his speech on the budget Deputy Barry Desmond said that he agreed with the decision made by the previous Government and he said exactly the same thing today; in the same speech he contradicted himself.</P>

      <P>Maybe Deputy Desmond was having a go at us, but let us be clear that anybody who says the previous Government should have implemented the Devlin Report is saying that the previous Government should have ignored the national agreement and, in my view, should have acted irresponsibly.  Now Deputies cannot have it both ways.  Either one is in favour of national agreements, in which case Deputies would support the action taken by the previous Government, or one is not. If one is not in favour of what we did one must admit that the suggestion is that we should have ignored the national agreement, a proposition which I did not then and would not now accept and, indeed, neither would any of my colleagues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs cannot get off the hook in that way.  His &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo; meant that we should have ignored the national agreement and, when this is pointed out to him now, he tries to get off the hook by saying it should have been done earlier.  The fact of the matter is, and there is no getting out of this, it was referred to the Employer/ Labour Conference; there was a report from the Employer/Labour Conference which set out the terms in relation to parliamentarians and others which would be in conformity with the wage rounds and the national agreements. There were very specific recommendations and findings in that report.</P>
      <P>We have been at all times consistent in our support of the national agreements. It was on that basis that we referred the Devlin Report to the Employer/Labour Conference.  It was on that basis that we took the attitude we did in regard to the pay of bank employees, both when we were in Government and recently in Opposition when there was a Bill dealing with this matter before us.  That is the line we have consistently taken and intend to continue to take.  Unfortunately the present Government do not appear to be willing to take a consistent attitude in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true, of course, that the Employer/Labour Conference Report dealt with matters other than the pay and allowances of parliamentarians. <Col N="1259" /> It dealt also with the remuneration of judges and higher civil servants and, to a limited extent, it dealt with the situation of chief executives of State-sponsored bodies.  That report also presented certain complications. The Minister for Finance probably did, and certainly could have if he wanted to, find in the Department of Finance a memorandum for the Government prepared under my direction which was proposing to implement the Report of the Employer/ Labour Conference in full, in so far as that could be done.</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out, parliamentarians had not received any increase in their remuneration since 1968.  In that interval there has been of course very substantial inflation throughout the world.  There can be no question but that the revision of pay and allowances for parliamentarians is overdue.  There may be different views, and there are different views, on the correct level at which parliamentarians should be remunerated. I use the word &ldquo;parliamentarians&rdquo; as a shorthand to cover not only Deputies, but Senators, Parliamentary Secretaries, Ministers, the Taoiseach, the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach, and the Leas-Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  As the Minister pointed out in his speech, the Devlin Group, which included two members of the Labour Court, having gone into the matter in considerable detail, recommended figures which, in general, were substantially higher than those proposed in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Whatever view may have been expressed by the Devlin Group, or anybody else, it is our belief that the most important thing in this issue, in the interests of the national economy, is to abide by and support the national agreement.  That being so, we are anxious to ensure that the Employer/ Labour Conference Report should be adopted.  We believe that by doing this, not only will the national agreement be supported and adhered to, but it will be seen to be supported and adhered to.  It is important that the treatment which should be applied <Col N="1260" /> to the remuneration of parliamentarians should be seen to be dealt with in the same way, and under the same machinery, and on the same basis, as the remuneration of workers generally.</P>
    <P>We take our stand on the Report of the Employer/Labour Conference. There is no other ground on which one can stand and still claim to support the national agreements.  In this connection I think Deputy Desmond was somewhat illogical in the line he took in regard to retrospection.  There is a specific recommendation in the Employer/Labour Conference Report in regard to the dates at which differing levels of remuneration should be implemented.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's efforts and political expediency, but nevertheless I would suggest that there is more logic in the basis adopted by the Minister than that adopted by Deputy Desmond.  Either you stand on the Employer/Labour Conference or you do not.  We stand on it and the Government side must indicate in this Bill whether they stand on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of the Bill do not stand on the Employer/Labour Conference Report.  They depart from it significantly in relation to the date of implementation.  The report resulted from a detailed examination by trade union officials and employers' representatives who had been delegated to supervise the implementation of the national agreement, were skilled in that regard, had ample experience of implementing the national agreement in various sectors of the economy, and these men, having gone into this in very great <Col N="1261" /> detail, came out with specific recommendations by which wage rounds and the national agreement could be applied to Parliamentarians.</P>
    <P>The results were somewhat complicated in that there was a recommendation as to a certain level of remuneration on 1st January, 1972, and a different and higher level at a subsesequent date, higher again at a subsequent date, and then a final level as at 1st July of this year.  As I said, that was the result of a very detailed and skilful survey and endeavour to apply to Parliamentarians the same machinery, the same criteria, as were being applied to workers generally.  If you want to ensure in so far as the Government and Members of this House can, the support of this House and of all parliamentarians for the national agreement, it is essential that we should be seen to be standing four square behind the national agreement and the machinery set up by it, which includes the Employer/Labour Conference, which made this report which the Minister proposes to depart from in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that not to implement the Report of the Employer/Labour Conference, either by going above the recommendations or below them, is to fail to support the national agreement.  I think for the Government not to accept this report and apply it in full is creating a very dangerous precedent.  Imagine a situation in which an employer in the private sector refused to implement, or, putting it in more common parlance, welshed on a finding by the Employer/ Labour Conference.  If he did, is it not certain that he would have trouble on his hands and that it would have been quite right that he would, and that he would have got no sympathy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is dangerous for the Government to create a precedent of this kind and perhaps to have some unscrupulous employers pointing to the Government as their precedent for not honouring or implementing findings of the Employer/Labour Conference in their interpretation of the national wage agreement.  The Government <Col N="1262" /> are providing this precedent in a very dangerous way.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, the Employer/ Labour Conference applied not only to parliamentarians but also to the judiciary and higher civil servants. The Government have applied the report in full to the higher civil servants and to the judges, correctly in my opinion.  They have not, and do not propose in this Bill to do so, applied it in full to parliamentarians. The only reason we have received so far from the Government side for this discrimination is that parliamentarians should not receive an increase before social welfare recipients because parliamentarians are better shod.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Finance, who put forward this explanation&mdash;the only one we have had&mdash;meant this seriously, would he please explain to the House why it is that the Employer/Labour Conference Report should have been applied in full to judges and higher civil servants?  He cannot seriously contend that judges and higher civil servants are not better shod than social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>As far as we are concerned, the Minister must explain to the House why this discrimination against parliamentarians, why this failure to implement the report of the Employer/ Labour Conference, why this failure to support the national agreement? Unless the Minister can give us a convincing explanation for that, and he has not given one so far, we cannot support the breach of the national agreement, of the findings of the Employer/Labour Conference, which is involved in this Bill.  It may be the Minister may be able to furnish an explanation, which he has failed to do up to now.  We want to hear it.</P>

      <P>The position is quite clear for anyone who wants to support the national agreement.  You either stand by the report, whether you are in agreement with it or not, or you do not.  The Government have the opportunity in this Bill to make clear where they stand, and the final word of the Minister on this will determine where the Government stand and what attitude this party will adopt in relation to this Bill and the further stages of it. I want to point out that one ill-effect of the Government's failure to adhere to the Employer/Labour Conference proposals in full, especially in regard to the dates, is that there are former Deputies of this House and former Members of the other House some of whom lost their seats in the recent elections but some of whom retired voluntarily in the confident belief that having a report from the Employer/ Labour Conference&mdash;the body set up to monitor the national agreement, one which recommended levels of remuneration for Members of the Oireachtas&mdash;their pensions which, of course, are related to the remuneration they received when they left office, would be at a certain level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LukeBelton" hpid="Mr. L. Belton Mr. L. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Belton</NameTxt>

Deputies and Senators who lost their seats are seriously affected in this way in regard to their pensions, all because of the Government's proposal not to implement in full the Employer/ Labour Conference Report.</P>
      <P>There is another matter, apart from the level or the dates of implementation, which I think has always bedevilled the whole situation as regards remuneration of Members of the Oireachtas, one which Deputies on all sides regularly have been concerned with.  It is the situation which has arisen on a number of occasions whereby when it came to increasing remuneration a very long interval had elapsed since the previous one with the consequence that the level of the increase appeared to the man in the street to be enormously high because he did not have any regard to the date of the previous increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would think that the interjections from the Front Bench over there indicate the attitude of unthinking arrogance which we are getting.  It does not affect the approach I am making.  If Deputies and Ministers opposite would listen, I am about to make a constructive suggestion to ensure that this kind of problem will not arise in the future.  I would propose, on Committee Stage, to offer two amendments to this Bill.  The Minister might perhaps be prepared to accept the principle and perhaps have them drafted in a better fashion by his experts.  I should like to read them <Col N="1266" /> out now so that it would be possible for the Government side to give some consideration to them.  I will pass over copies in a moment.  The first amendment would be as follows:</P>
      <P>In section 4 to insert a new subsection as follows:</P>
      <P>( ) The allowance to be paid to each Member of Dáil Éireann and the allowance to be paid to each Member of Seanad Éireann shall be reviewed by the Government and a report by the Government of the outcome of such review shall be laid before Dáil Éireann at intervals not exceeding two years, commencing on the date of the passing of this Act.</P>
      <P>Another amendment is:</P>
      <P>To insert a new section after section 10, as follows:</P>
      <P>The respective annual sums payable pursuant to sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the Principal Act shall be reviewed by the Government and a report by the Government of the outcome of such review shall be laid before Dáil Éireann at intervals not exceeding two years commencing on the date of the passing of this Act.</P>
      <P>There may be objections from the drafting point of view but I would hope that the idea behind the amendments is clear, that is, that by inserting these amendments we could ensure that there was a regular review of the levels of remuneration of the various people with whom we are dealing in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible that having reviewed the levels of remuneration the Government of the day might decide that there should be no increase.  This is certainly possible.  I think that it is necessary to provide that there be a report laid before Dáil Éireann or the whole operation might amount to nothing at all.  I believe that the idea involved in this is worthwhile and does tackle a problem with which all of us on all sides of the House have been concerned in the past.  For that reason I urge the Minister to give consideration to the amendments.  If he could indicate his attitude when replying to this <Col N="1267" /> Stage it would be appreciated.  If he wished to adopt the idea and put in his own draft we would have no objection to that.</P>
    <P>In regard to the provisions which propose to provide a pension for the Attorney General, I want to say that, as the Leader of our party has indicated, we have no objection in principle to the idea of the payment of a pension to an Attorney General who devotes himself whole-time to the duties of Attorney General, apart from his membership, say, of Dáil Éireann but, as indicated by the Leader of this party, we do not think that such a pension should be payable in addition to the lump sum which already exists and the Minister did indicate in an interjection that it was not proposed to pay both.  Perhaps he would oblige us by spelling out how that situation is achieved.  I assume it is by virtue of a provision in previous legislation.  Perhaps the Minister will spell out for us how it is achieved.</P>
    <P>There is another objection that we see to the proposal in this Bill, that is, that as we read it, it is proposed to restrict the operation of this provision for pension to the present occupant of the position of Attorney General, Deputy Declan Costello.  I say that because it limits it to service commencing on or after 14th March, 1973.  I cannot say for certain whether or not some previous occupant or occupants of the position of Attorney General would qualify under these provisions for a pension but if they would it seems to me reasonable that providing they fulfil the conditions, they ought to qualify.  On the other hand, if there is no such person, then I do not see why in section 12 there should be this limitation of qualifying service to that commencing on or after 14th March, 1973.  Perhaps the Minister will explain to us the thinking behind that provision. In our view, the principle involved is that if anybody complies with the conditions laid down, that person, whenever he vacates the office, should be treated equally.</P>
    <P>I should like also to know on what figure the proposed pension for the Attorney General will be based.  In <Col N="1268" /> other words, would it be based on a salary of £7,213 or on a salary of £4,430?  In our view, the pension of the Attorney General should be based on the salary that he receives which is analogous to that paid to a Minister and, indeed, since the section which sets out the conditions for qualifying for this pension does visualise membership of Dáil Éireann by the Attorney General, that would not seem to present any great problem.</P>
    <P>There is also a matter in respect of which an explanation by the Minister would be appreciated.  It does appear &mdash;I am open to correction on this&mdash; that under the provisions of this Bill an Attorney General who is also a Member of Dáil Éireann would receive remuneration which would exceed that of an Attorney General who is not a Member of Dáil Éireann by £633.  Perhaps I am wrong in this, but this is how it appears.  If this is so, we would appreciate it if the Minister would explain to us the thinking behind it.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister if he would spell out the reasons for the provisions in section 13, clause (a).  I want to say, in regard to a statement by the Leader of this party earlier, that he was misinformed, I think, with regard to the level of the lump sum payable to the Attorney General. My understanding of it is&mdash;the Minister may correct this if I am wrong&mdash; that it amounts to one half-year's salary and three years' service is the minimum service required to qualify for it.</P>
    <P>The final point I wish to refer to is one which was referred to by the Leader of this party in relation to the Opposition allowance.  In that connection I want to say, arising out of something said by Deputy Barry Desmond, lest there be any misunderstanding, that in this party each of the Deputies pays a subscription to the party and out of that fund our typists are paid, not out of the Opposition allowance.  That, as least, is the position at present.</P>
    <P>We regard the non-provision in this Bill of proposals for increasing the Opposition allowance as potentially very dangerous and very deliberate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1269" /> We trust that is not so and that the Minister will be able to reassure us and the public.  However, as indicated by the Leader of this party, the Government were reminded of this some weeks ago.  Furthermore, anybody drafting this Bill would certainly have had before him the previous Acts dealing with remuneration of Parliamentarians and would have found there the provisions relating to the Opposition allowance.  So, on the face of it, it is difficult to believe that the omission from this Bill was accidental or an oversight.  We are, however, willing to listen to what the Minister has to say on this and if he is prepared to indicate that the Government are at this stage prepared to include in this Bill provision for a reasonable and adequate increase in the Opposition allowance then we certainly will be satisfied with that position.  If, however, the Minister is not prepared to do this, then we can only regard the attitude of the Government as being petty, as indicated by the Leader of this party; more than that, I would say as being dangerous and something that would want to be watched carefully.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Barry Desmond spoke on this topic, I think the attitude he displayed was the correct one, what one would expect from any person concerned with democracy no matter which side of the House he sat on.  I am not here just preaching.  We practised what I am now preaching when we were on that side of the House.  Therefore, we would like the Government to assure us and the country that they are as much concerned with the maintenance of democracy, which requires a reasonably effective Opposition, as we were when we were on that side of the House.  We want the Government to explain, if they do not propose to amend this Bill, why they propose not to do so, when on every previous occasion when there was a similar Bill before this House provision was made to make appropriate increases in the allowance of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>As the Leader of this party suggested, if this were to be the attitude of the Government, taken in conjunction <Col N="1270" /> with some of their previous actions to which he referred, then I think it would be time not just for this party but for everybody in this country who is concerned with democracy to watch out.  I have such faith in this party and in its strength that I have no doubt that, no matter what the Government do, we shall defeat them democratically.  However, there are people who have supported that Government over there and who are genuinely concerned with democracy. If such people were to believe that this Government intended deliberately to try to hobble the Opposition, to hobble them in a way that was never done when we were in Government, then those people might well, because of their concern for democracy, begin to take action and, when they got the opportunity, show where they stood in this matter.</P>
    <P>I am saying all that on a conditional basis.  It may be that the Government are prepared to indicate a different approach.  If so, we shall welcome it; if not, they will hear more from us about it.</P>

      <P>There are not quite so many on this side.  I am afraid I have to say the Opposition are showing more interest in this debate than Government Deputies.  I must apologise for the fact there was not the same enthusiastic attendance on this side as on that side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of salaries, I think we should all agree, and what is more important than that we should agree, is that the country should agree, on adequate salaries for Members of the Oireachtas.  There has been an unfortunate tendency to devalue and <Col N="1271" /> downgrade politicians on the grounds that individual politicians, of whom some people may have a particular knowledge, do not, in their view, merit a certain salary.  On these dubious grounds inadequate remuneration for politicians has been sustained in the past, and politicians have been unwilling to take the odium attached to ensuring they are adequately paid.</P>
    <P>It is right, in my opinion, that we should have, in this case, accepted the recommendations of the Employer/ Labour Conference.  Let us be clear, however, on what we are doing.  We are accepting that the antecedent salaries at all levels were correct and may be adjusted upward only by the amount of the increases payable in other sectors.  We are accepting that they were adequate already.  I personally do not believe that some of them were adequate previously, but I think it is right we should give the good example in this matter of accepting the Employer/Labour Conference recommendations as the only basis of not going beyond that.  It means that in some instances we are maintaining indefinitely and for the forseeable future the underpayment of politicians. This is unfortunate, but it is better we should give good example in this matter than that we should appear in any way to undermine or weaken the Employer/ Labour Conference recommendations or the prospects of a national wage agreement or continuing national wage agreements.</P>
    <P>The point should be made in particular here that what is called a Deputy's salary, £3,400-odd, is, in fact, a Deputy's salary and expenses.  It is a pity this is not more clearly understood. It might be better in the future if we expressed this salary in a more realistic form.  We know from the work of the review committee something about Deputies' expenses.  Admittedly, the evidence there is <i>ex-parte</i> evidence, and it may well be that Deputies, when asked to say what their expenses were, in some instances, would round them up rather than down.  Even allowing for that, it is evident that Deputies have significant out-of-pocket expenses which in any other trade or profession <Col N="1272" /> would warrant reimbursement of some kind by their employers.  Having read the review committee's report and knowing something from a practical point of view of the expenses incurred by Deputies, and having personal experience in urban areas and, more important, knowing of the much higher level of expenses that are normally incurred in rural areas, I would say the average expenses of a Deputy today are of the order of £1,000 a year.  This is validated by the fact that the Revenue Commissioners are prepared, as a matter of practice, to allow this as an expense allowance, and they do not allow anything unless they are damned sure it is justified.</P>
    <P>What we are proposing to do here is to pay Deputies £2,400 a year salary, and, on average, £1,000 a year expenses, which, in the case of some Deputies, particularly urban Deputies, may be a little more, and in the case of rural Deputies, may be somewhat less, than they actually incur; it is an average figure across the board.  The public should realise that that is what is involved, that as of this moment the actual salary of the average TD, after deducting the average out-of-pocket expenses, is no more than £1,500 a year, which is somewhat less than the average adult male industrial worker receives.</P>
    <P>I do not think that message has gone across loud and clear.  We should have the courage to state that as a fact.  Even now, with the adjustment made, the actual salary of the average TD, after paying his average out-of-pocket expenses, will be no more than about £2,400 a year, for work which, by any standard, is demanding, certainly as regards the time that it absorbs.  Very few people in this House ever get anywhere near a 40-hour week in their political activities. If, as many of them do because of the inadequacy of their salary, they carry on other activities, that is only achieved by adding to 40 or 50 hours of political work another 20 hours or so of work.  Many people on both sides of this House work 70 or 80 hours a week and are forced to do so by the situation in which they find themselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1273" /> On the point raised by the Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Colley in connection with the expenses of the Opposition, there may well be some misunderstanding here.  There will be no pettiness on this side of the House on this subject.  The present system of providing for the expenses of the Opposition is one which I personally do not think is satisfactory.  It needs to be reviewed.  We sought to review it when we were in Opposition.  We did not get much sympathetic treatment or enthusiasm from the Government of the day.  Perhaps we should have proceeded more vigorously, more openly and with more activity than we did.  The fact remains that we felt that the system was an unsatisfactory one I personally believe that the system should be reviewed.  It would have been a mistake to have accepted the present system and to have added so much on to it.</P>
    <P>I say that because it seems to me that a system under which theoretically we pay £15,000 to the Leader of the Opposition is quite unrealistic. Does anybody really believe that Deputy J. Lynch pockets £15,000 a year?  Of course, he does not.  That money is, in fact, going to help the Opposition party with their work, and not to Deputy J. Lynch personally.  I express a personal view and not the Government view and I feel I am entitled to do this, but I think that we should be thinking of a system under which the Leader of the Opposition should as a person have remuneration in his personal capacity.  Assistance to political parties should be given to the parties as such, whether they be the Government or the Opposition party. I personally believe that such assistance should be given.</P>
    <P>The present system is bad because it pretends to be something which it is not.  We pretend that we are paying the Leader of the Opposition this sum which would be enormous as a personal payment, but it is not that at all. It is assistance to a political party under this guise.  I personally believe we should look at this position again. The Government are not suggesting that they are unwilling to look at this. The Government are willing to look <Col N="1274" /> at the system but have left this matter to one side, and have concentrated very properly in this Bill on those matters covered by the Employer/Labour Conference recommendations.</P>
    <P>The question of the payment to the Leader of the Opposition was not covered by that conference.  This Bill should and must confine itself to the things covered by the Employer/ Labour Conference resolutions or recommendations, and the question of how we deal with the expenses of the political parties and the problems of Deputies in regard to the lack of research facilities and secretarial facilities should be discussed, and we should try to reach agreement on them.  I would be surprised to hear there was anybody in the Government who would be lacking in generosity in that respect.  I will not go beyond this.  I am sure this is a matter which the Minister for Finance will want to deal with when replying.</P>
    <P>There is another matter raised by the review committee.  This is the remuneration of the Whips, which is viewed with favour.  It is another matter which could be looked at in the context of the general reconsideration I am talking about.  We ought to have remuneration for the Leader of the Opposition.  There are problems for the Deputies because of inadequate secretarial assistance and the lack of research facilities for the Opposition. We know, having sat for years in Opposition, how difficult it was to get the resources to do the research properly and to do our job in Opposition. All these problems should be looked at sympathetically.</P>
    <P>On the question of retrospection, Deputy Colley was less than frank.  It was not just a matter of Parliamentary teasing on the part of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and myself who probed a little in order to get Deputy Colley to use the word &ldquo;retrospection&rdquo;. In his speech Deputy Colley talked around the subject all the time, but carefully avoided using the word &ldquo;retrospection&rdquo;.  He was trying to imply that the Employer/Labour Conference recommended retrospection and set out in precise terms what should be done in that respect.  Because <Col N="1275" /> they did not do so, he could not say that and in trying to imply that they did, he had to avoid the word &ldquo;retrospection&rdquo;.  We indulged in that good Parliamentary practice of flushing him out on the subject.</P>
    <P>When one reads the Employer/ Labour Conference document one cannot refer to their recommendations at all.  It speaks in hypothetical terms. On the question of Deputies' salaries it says that the present allowance of £2,500 for Deputies has not been varied since July, 1968, when it was fixed at that level by legislation.  It is stated that if the 12th round increase in line with that granted to the Public Service had been applied to Members of the Oireachtas then a Deputy's allowance, inclusive of that increase and the first phase of the national agreement for 1970, would have been £3,029 from 1st January, 1972.</P>
    <P>This document simply establishes the facts of what the allowances or salaries would have been at certain points if certain things had happened, but these things did not happen.  The Government had taken this document and used it as a basis to see what, in fact, a Deputy should have today on the basis of these calculations.  There is no mention of retrospection here at all. Deputy Colley may feel that retrospection is implied in what is said.  I do not feel there is any such clear implication at all.  The nature of the document is such that it effectively excludes that kind of implication of retrospection.</P>
    <P>If one wants to make a case for retrospection, that should be done on its own merits.  One will not get anywhere working from this document. When Deputy Colley says that we should adhere strictly to the Employer/ Labour Conference document we will take him at his word on that.  That means that the Deputies should be paid what they are due now.  The document refers to the present.  It refers to what, in fact, would be due at the present time and does not say anything should have been paid at any time or at any particular point in the past.  For us to go back and give retrospection when there is not any such recommendation would leave us open to the very kind <Col N="1276" /> of accusation which Deputy Colley is rightly sensible to&mdash;the accusation of going beyond the recommendations, and in some way prejudicing the wages round.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that a case for retrospection cannot be made.  There is a case for it.  There would be a danger, if we went for retrospection, of being accused of having in our own case gone beyond what is recommended by the document.  The case for retrospection could be sustained in the context of this document, but certainly it was not made explicit in the document, as Deputy Colley was seeking to convey.</P>
    <P>Let us be clear that the Government are not the employers of the gentlemen over there on the Opposition benches, although Deputy Colley spoke of the Government as the employer and of the Government not paying willing workers their due while we in this House are self-employed. We employ ourselves.  The Government felt that it would be improper for the Deputies in this House collectively by their vote and by their decision on this particular Bill to pay themselves in advance of the payments to the social welfare beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>It was felt that it would not be in the interests of politicians and of politics that we should appear to pay ourselves money in advance of those who most need it.  We felt it would be wrong to withhold such money from the other groups in the community such as judges, but that in our own case we should be seen to have hyper-clean hands and should not be in a position where it could be alleged against us that one of the first things we did in Government was to put to the House and to use our majority to secure that we would be paid money back for one or two years when, in fact, when it came to the social welfare beneficiaries all we could do was pay on the earliest possible date, which would be the 1st July of this year.  It was not in the interests of Irish politics that we should do that. It would have done no good to us in this House.  This is a Government of collective responsibility.  It would have <Col N="1277" /> done none of us much good if we had been seen to be paying ourselves large sums of back money running into hundreds, and even thousands of pounds in some instances, when we were saying we could not afford to pay the social welfare beneficiaries earlier than 1st July.</P>
    <P>That proposition is one which we can sustain.  I would appeal to the House to see this as a collective decision and not to fall into the trap which Deputy Colley seems to have fallen into of thinking of the Government as the employer and saying that the Government must, as a good employer, be prepared to pay the full amount and not to be seen to fall short of the Employer/Labour Conference recommendation, because this would give a bad example to other employers.  This is absurd.  The Government are not the employers of the Deputies.  We employ ourselves.  In so far as the decision of what we pay ourselves is concerned this is a collective decision in this House.  It is our decision collectively in this House. The decision taken in this regard is the right one in the interests of Irish politics.  I stand over that decision despite the fact that I, as much as anybody in this House, am the loser financially.  It is important for that to be understood.  Confusion was introduced by Deputy Colley in his approach to this matter and it should be cleared up.</P>
    <P>They are the points which I wanted to make.  Much thought was given to the Bill and it is one that can be commended to the House.  It has been a collective decision of this House that even though an independent review committee recommended, in a number of instances, salaries beyond what we are now paying ourselves we&mdash;all sides of the House agreed on this&mdash;were not prepared to pay even what this committee recommended we should pay ourselves unless it were fully validated by the Employer/Labour Conference, unless it could be shown as no more than the increases on the previous salaries, justified by the time-lag since they were previously increased.  I think we were right to adopt that approach. <Col N="1278" /> The people should realise that but they should also realise it does involve paying ourselves less than in fact the review committee recommended.  Their recommendations were, I think, in many cases soundly based and with good reason.  There is no danger in Ireland, with the state of public opinion as it is, of politicians overpaying themselves.  There is not only a danger but an actuality of underpaying ourselves in some respects.  It is better to have it that way, as long as it is not overdone to the point where the remuneration of politicians is so inadequate as to affect the quality of people entering politics.</P>
    <P>I do not think that is the case. In strictly adhering to the Employer/ Labour Conference document and what it says we are, in some respects, underpaying ourselves but not to an extent that is likely to be damaging. The fact that in recent years the salaries paid to Members of the Dáil have been better in terms of purchasing power than in the past has enabled some people who could not otherwise have entered politics to have done so. There are now in this House quite a number of people, on all benches, making a very real contribution and who could not have entered this House had the allowance of earlier years been maintained.  The fact that we have increased it has been worthwhile but it is right we should not go beyond that at this stage lest we in any way prejudice the national wage agreement which must be our first consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to make a few comments on this Bill.  The first reference of the previous speaker, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, was to the interest taken in it.  I prefer to see people taking an interest in a Bill like this rather than cowardly skulking in their rooms hoping it will go through quickly.  We must be prepared to face up to something like this and get away from the cowardice with which it has been approached in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the type of waffle the Minister has engaged in to cover up the shortcomings of this Bill, however much he tried to hang them around the necks of the old <Col N="1279" /> people and the social welfare recipients. This is the first time I have ever heard of there being any relevance between the dates of payment of these increases and other increases.  Why were the judges not paid from the same date as the social welfare recipients? Why are higher civil servants put in a category beyond the Parliamentarians?  If we are prepared to degrade ourselves we need not expect the people to place us in any higher category than that in which we are prepared to place ourselves.</P>
    <P>This is the Parliament of the country and it has a duty to do what it thinks is right without consultation or reference to anybody.  There was always a certain amount of fear and of political scoring on the question of remuneration.  I have a recollection of on one occasion meeting different Deputies going around the Lobby asking when the increases were to be given but the same Deputies voted against them when the matter was brought into the House.  This is what we have to face regarding remunerations for ourselves.  If we are not prepared to stand up and say what we think parliamentarians should be paid we need not expect anyone else to do it.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs said that the Government are not the employers.  Nobody said they were, but they are the people who must bring in and implement any changes there are in relation to remuneration. If they do not do it it will not be done and so far as that is concerned they are the employers.  There is no difference between them and other employers as it is what they do that counts.</P>
    <P>It is true that when the Devlin Review Body reported there was a good deal of eyebrow lifting with regard to the recommendations.  The report came in July, about a week before the Dáil adjourned.  It contained a very comprehensive review of many things and after a time, after the Government had studied it, they decided to publish it.  The reaction to it was as one would expect.  Congress pointed out that it would certainly endanger <Col N="1280" /> the prospects of the national agreement being honoured or any further agreement being brought in if the figures recommended by Devlin were to be implemented.</P>
    <P>We decided to submit it to the Employer/Labour Conference for their opinions and recommendations.  Those came in December and this Bill is based on them.  In so far as retrospective dates are concerned, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said there was no recommendation in regard to dates. There was no recommendation for anything.  They examined the Devlin Review Body Report and pointed out the extent to which it could be implemented without breaching the national agreement.  If the Government decided to base their drafting of this Bill and the provision for improved remuneration on their recommendation, as they adopted the amounts recommended, they were obliged in my opinion to pay the increases from the date mentioned. These dates were specifically set out.</P>
    <P>We had the silly suggestion in the Minister's speech that it was in order to synchronise with the payment of the social welfare benefits.  Nobody ever heard of that before.  It is a political device to justify an action taken. If they accepted the date recommended by the Devlin Report it would not benefit the present Government to the same extent as it would the Opposition. That is the obvious reason for the action of the Government and to make that doubly sure in regard to civil servants they go back and pay them in retrospect.  The word &ldquo;retrospection&rdquo; is not a dirty word there. Social welfare payments do not come into it as far as the judges are concerned. I remember on one occasion when we increased the judges' salaries we were lacerated by the Opposition for having the cheek to go so far as to pay increases to people who did not need them.  One does not need to look back on the report for this as one can remember when this took place.  It was not 100 years ago.</P>
    <P>The parliamentarians have now to take second place.  They have to play second fiddle to those other people. We put our own value on ourselves. There is a principle involved here.  I <Col N="1281" /> should prefer that the Bill were not introduced if Members of Parliament are not given the standing and recognition to which they are entitled. Nobody has yet tried to explain why there is this differential between one section of public servants and the elected representatives of the people. Nobody has tried to justify the downright discrimination in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The last speaker tried to point out that the Bill hardly went far enough, that we should ask the public not to be too hard on us.  Members of the House must take into consideration what the people are getting in remuneration in the Civil Service and in private industry.  Things have moved rapidly in recent years.  We should not be prepared to put ourselves second to anyone.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley was quite right when he said that if an employer finds himself in a position where he has to give retrospective pay to his employees, he can say that this was recommended in the Employer/Labour Conference report on remuneration to parliamentarians and the Government did not honour it.  He can say as this happened with the Government why should he give retrospective remuneration. Irrespective of what the Minister for Foreign Affairs may say, this was recommended in the report.</P>
    <P>I was closely associated with the recommendation to the Employer/ Labour Conference.  As Minister for Labour I had to keep my fingers crossed that nothing would go wrong at some stage to upset the national agreement or interfere with the preparation of a new agreement in order that the country would get back to a state of stability through the Employer/Labour Conference which was representative of the social partners in the country.</P>
    <P>When the Devlin Report was first issued, some people in the House asked why the Minister did not immediately implement it.  I think we acted in a correct manner when we submitted it to the Employer/Labour Conference.  We were acting in the best national interest in the rather delicate tightrope situation that exists <Col N="1282" /> when a national agreement is being negotiated and operated.  There were a number of people in this House who are not here now&mdash;they may have been defeated in the election or have left voluntarily&mdash;who had a right to share in the improved remuneration.</P>
    <P>The Government should have said they were not going to take any notice of the Employer/Labour Conference; they should have said they were going to go their own way.  Alternatively, when they applied the agreement they should have said that if what was recommended in an agreement was good enough for the workers it should have been suitable for parliamentarians. However, they have said that they will give the increase to civil servants and judges.  They are the important people; the parliamentarians do not matter and they can be paid the lower rate.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about the Opposition allowance.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs tried to put a new gloss on it when he said it was not right to give it to the Leader of the party, that it should be given to the party by way of better facilities to enable the Opposition to do their work in a more effective way.  The best way to achieve this is to give it to the Leader who knows what facilities are needed.  There is no need for a committee to examine what we require with regard to improved facilities.  When we were in Government, when increases were given in the Deputies' allowances we gave an increase in the Opposition allowance to the Leader of the party to use as he considered best.  I am sure he found it inadequate when it came to making provision for front bench Deputies in the secretarial and research work that was necessary.  There is no need for a committee to study this matter.  The Opposition are the best judges of how the money should be used without setting up a committee unless, as was implied in Deputy Desmond's speech, there will be an allowance for both sides of the House.</P>
    <P>Everyone must know that the front bench of an Opposition have enormous expenses in order to maintain a secretariat, to have research work carried out and to work efficiently.  The costs increase considerably each month.  I <Col N="1283" /> remember when the second Coalition Government left office, the former Deputy James Dillon made a scathing attack on us in the usual Opposition manner.  He gave some advice which is in the official record.  It was to the effect that the Government should increase their salaries.  He said he had been in Government for three years and the amount paid would not keep a schoolboy.  He told us not to be afraid of criticism, that if we waited until the country told us to do it it would never be done.  That was Deputy Dillon's contribution on the day he left office after three years and went into Opposition.</P>
    <P>If one waits until one is told what to do one will wait forever.  I remember when we asked people a few years ago to tighten their belts we accepted a 15 per cent reduction in our allowances for a long period.  I have yet to meet anyone who acknowledged we took that action or who said it was a worthwhile contribution that meant anything. This House cannot set itself up as the supreme governing body in the country with entitlement to make decisions in the belief that they know best.  If the Employer/Labour Conference recommendations are not to be implemented fully, it would be better that the Bill should never have been introduced.  Let us cut out all hypocrisy in this matter.  I know that every backbencher on the other side of the House also would wish for the full implementation of these recommendations.</P>
    <P>No doubt those Members of the House who came in only recently find themselves in the same position as we were all in when we came here first: that if a Deputy can retire to bed at night in the knowledge that he has not spent more than he has earned during the day, he is lucky.  Nobody expects public representatives to take a back seat so far as society is concerned.  The day has gone when a Deputy was reluctant to provide himself with a car because of the poor view that his constituents would take of such demonstration of wealth.  I remember a time when a Labour Party Deputy would be afraid, for the same reasons, to smoke a cigar in public.</P>

      <P>The proposal in this Bill to implement for the Judiciary and for civil servants provisions that are more advantageous than what we propose for ourselves is a sign that the times to which I have referred have not disappeared entirely.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the effort at explanation made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in this regard.  It would be much more preferable to provide periodically for modest increases rather than to have a long delay and then have to grant a big increase.  There was a time when our entire allowance was free from income tax but most people do not realise that approximately one-third of any £1 increase we might get will go for income tax.  From my allowance last month there was a deduction of £71 in respect of income tax, £10 for voluntary health insurance, £6.50 for pension purposes and I contributed £10 to party funds.  However, we cannot expect others to worry about our situation.  We are the people who make the laws and we should have the courage to do what is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this instance the Government have had an opportunity that no other Government have ever had.  They have had the recommendations of an independent review body.  These recommendations were not accepted by us and were sent to the Employer/ Labour Conference in order to ascertain to what extent they would conform with national pay agreements. However, the recommendations of the conference are not to be implemented. The Minister will need to explain to us why he is conforming with the recommendations of the Employer/ Labour Conference in one instance and not in another.  The Minister's colleague endeavoured to explain this matter a while ago by saying that the Employer/Labour Conference did not recommend these dates.  Neither did they recommend these amounts, but they told us what they considered would be in line with the various wage rounds.  The Minister has had two <Col N="1285" /> reports available to him.  As Deputy Lynch has said, we will not die of hunger, but that is not the attitude we should be adopting.  We should be enabled to be at least in the same position in society as most other people; but if we do not take steps to ensure this, nobody else will take such steps for us.</P>

      <P>I do not know what Deputies would think about that, but if it is the opinion of the Opposition that the Bill should be withdrawn, I am sure the Minister would consider seriously doing so.  In practice there were only two main points that might be described as being contentious. These were, first, Deputy Lynch's point that the Bill does not provide for an increased allowance for the Opposition and, secondly, Deputy Colley's point about what he described as a failure to implement the recommendations of the Employer/Labour Conference.  These two points are of very uneven weight. It seems to me that there is weight. in what Deputy Lynch said, that is to say, that there is a case for increasing the allowance to the Opposition on the same general scale as were the other increases envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure Deputies opposite and all Deputies that there was not present in the mind of the Government any such intention as was suspected by Members of the Opposition, any intention of discriminating against the Opposition or of persecuting them in some vindictive way.  The opinion was that, in implementing the Employer/ Labour Conference recommendations, we were doing something in regard to <Col N="1286" /> salaries and emoluments and that allowances, which were essentially a form of collective subsidised facilities, were a different matter.  It is not for me to anticipate in any way what the Minister for Finance may say about this but I am sure that when he is replying he will be seeking to satisfy whatever justice there is in the complaint made by the Leader of the Opposition and to show him that no such intention as he feared exists on our side.  The means by which that can be done are for the Minister to say.</P>
    <P>Of course, no Government in a genuine working democracy such as we have, have any interest whatever in, to put it at its lowest, collective discrimination against an Opposition because members of any Government know that they may find themselves in opposition.  This is a long-term affair.  It may well be that the parties who are on these benches now will in another 16 years or so find themselves over there.  I may not be here then.</P>

      <P>In some period of time.  The Deputy may estimate it one way, I in another.  In any case it is quite clear the previous Government did not, we agree in this case, discriminate against the Opposition collectively in that respect though perhaps towards the end they were a bit slow about some things.  Certainly, we would not wish to do so and we are not doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think also, when that comes to be considered, that Government backbenchers&mdash;again irrespective of whoever is in Government&mdash;have a case, too.  I have visited a certain number of parliaments and I do not know of any parliament in the civilised world where Members of Parliament are so miserably treated as our Members are whether in Government or in Opposition.  I think that is a matter to which the Minister for Finance will certainly turn his attention, because it is not in the interests of democracy, it is not in the interests of the people of this country, that <Col N="1287" /> their legislators should be on that footing. It is something that distinctly calls for correction.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Colley's point about what he calls the failure to implement the recommendations of the Employer/Labour Conference, I think here he had a real point but it was not about the recommendations of the Employer/Labour Conference, which are delphic and by no means require the reading which he produced from them.  His complaint was essentially what a working man would put in blunt language: &ldquo;What about the back money?&rdquo; If he had said so, and made a plain case for retrospection, there would have been something for the Minister for Finance to consider, and if the Minister for Finance was swayed by that argument I suppose most of us in this Chamber would enjoy the consequences quite stoically. The case was not so bluntly put.  It was all wrapped up by Deputy Colley in this language about implementing something said to be recommended by the Employer/Labour Conference which, in fact, does not transpire from the delphic language of that part of the recommendations that were read out to us.</P>
    <P>The matter which divides us is not very great and is really not proportionate even to the rather mild degree of acrimony which has developed in this debate and which I would hope to see subsiding towards a point of agreement, at least, on the basic principle of this Bill.  It is a difficult Bill to discuss but it revolves around some important principles and I do not know that we have really yet learned to manage.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs said just now that we in the Oireachtas are self-employed.  I think that was an admirable speech by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but I do not quite go along with that formula. It is not just a play on words.  I think this is important and essential to what we are discussing.  We are not self-employed but we have a very peculiar employer&mdash;a diffuse, intermittent employer, whose decisions are handed down to us only at fairly long intervals and whom we never quite succeed in meeting face to face in his entirety. <Col N="1288" /> The employer is the people in its dual aspect of the electorate and the taxpayers. Those are our employers and our judges.</P>
    <P>What we have is&mdash;and I think this is what the Minister meant when he referred to us as self-employed&mdash;the power to regulate our own terms of employment in a sense that perhaps no other body does have.  The Government did wisely in delegating that power, in handing it, in a sense, to another body &mdash;the Employer/Labour Conference. That was a wise and proper decision. I hope that in future it may be possible to associate our remuneration under some decision with the general remuneration of some other class of public servants so that we may not be put in this invidious position of repeatedly determining and being seen to determine, our own remuneration. The way we use that power we happen to have, which is thrust on us by the nature of things, does impose certain restrictions on us.</P>
    <P>There is, among a good many people in this country, a tendency to look cynically on the democratic process and on the parliamentary process in particular. That naturally tends to be increased whenever this kind of debate comes round.  It is within that framework that the Minister for Finance had to take his decision in relating the time when social welfare payments came into operation to the time when the increased remuneration for Members of the Oireachtas came into operation. He was right to take that into consideration, because this is a matter not only of the substantive justice of our decisions but how those decisions and our power to take such decisions about ourselves impinge on democratic process and on the reputation of democratic process.  These are more important matters than the quite important matter of the scale of our remuneration, which also has a part in democratic process.  If we were to reach a condition whereby our remuneration was fully adequate to everything we thought it ought to be and dated from whatever point we thought it ought to date from and so on, and if in the process of reaching that result, however just, we were to <Col N="1289" /> disillusion people generally and turn them against democratic process, then the price would not be worth paying. On the whole I think the Government have struck the right balance in the proposals before the House now, proposals that would enable the Legislature to go about its business in a reasonable way and, at the same time, would not irritate people unnecessarily and involve democracy in disrepute.</P>

      <P>I am not very concerned about the amount of money the Bill makes available to me or to other Deputies, but I am concerned about principles, particularly the principle of undermining the national agreement.  I am in full agreement with the Minister for Foreign Affairs who said that the Government or this House should not undermine that agreement in any way. The Minister for Finance went to great lengths to indicate his concern about the national agreement, about the special committee, about the Employer/Labour Conference.  The fact that he mentioned the Employer/ Labour Conference so many times in his speech is an indication that he wanted to accept a situation in which salary increases would be examined by a competent body and reported upon.  I might be prepared to accept this Bill if the Minister did not in any way refer to the Employer/Labour Conference or to the national agreement, if he had said: &ldquo;In the opinion of the Government this is what should be made available&rdquo; and had then given the reasons, but he went much further.  I feel that this piece of legislation must be examined in a critical way because, in my view, it is a breach of the national pay agreement.  I feel, just as Deputy FitzGerald, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, feels, that there is a case for retrospection and that it could be sustained in the context of the document he held up, the Employer/ Labour Conference document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has clearly indicated that, in his view after examining this document, there is a case for retrospection and that it could be sustained in the context of the document.  Earlier in the debate we had two Ministers making an <Col N="1290" /> effort to extract the word &ldquo;retrospection&rdquo; from Deputy Colley.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister for Foreign Affairs made these efforts.  The question of retrospection is an important one in the document that has been issued and in relation to the national agreement or any agreement.</P>
    <P>I wonder is this the thin edge of the wedge with the Government, if this type of legislation goes through, even though the Employer/Labour Conference has made a recommendation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be classified as such particularly on the basis that the Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated. That Minister stated that on the document it could be sustained that there was a case for retrospection. This goes much further afield. I wonder what is the anxiety of the Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs and Foreign Affairs?  Is it a question that if this legislation becomes law the Government have established a precedent, one which, as Deputy Colley indicated, could be taken up by other employers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Will other employers indicate that they are not prepared to pay retrospection where it had been awarded?  Or is it the case that in relation to Government employees, workers in the Post Office, in the Board of Works or in the military barracks, when an agreement is reached which involves retrospection, the Government will indicate that the Bill which went through the Houses of the Oireachtas prohibits them from paying retrospection or enables them to use a situation to eliminate such a payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel for workers in the Government services particularly when this line of thought is in the minds of some of the Ministers.  These Ministers went to no end of trouble to try to extract the word &ldquo;retrospection&rdquo;. <Col N="1291" /> They extracted it in many forms from different speakers but the Minister for Foreign Affairs clearly indicated that the case could be sustained in the context of a document issued by the Employer/Labour Conference.</P>
    <P>I should like to sound a note of warning to other workers in Government services.  I believe that they can be treated in the same way.  Where a valid agreement is reached the Government will fail to honour it on the basis of the existence of the type of legislation that is now going through this House.  There is a difference of opinion as to who are the employers.  As the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs stated, we have a peculiar employer.  I agree that if it is the Government we have a peculiar employer, whoever the employer is.</P>
    <P>It may well be that the personnel employed in the post office services, having read the Minister's comments in the course of this debate, may wonder if this is the thin end of the wedge to eliminate retrospective clauses.  Last week we discussed the Banks Bill, a Bill which was a desire of the Government to ensure that the national agreement was not violated.  I, and other people, feel that this is a violation of the national agreement and I will not stand for the violation of that agreement in any way.</P>
    <P>It is completely the reverse of the situation and the statements made in relation to the Banks Bill.  On that score it is difficult to understand the various speakers who have made their cases.  Deputy Barry Desmond, Deputy in or Deputy out of office, has a different view of Deputies' salaries.  This Deputy has indicated that he would support the Government today but when he was out of Dáil Éireann he was one of the most vocal against the decision to increase salaries.  We have a situation here where people say one thing inside the House and something completely different when they are outside.  Therefore, their word cannot be accepted in any way.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond was speaking for the purpose of the Press today and to please some people.</P>

      <P>Did the Deputy ever change his own mind about anything?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I often change my mind.  I change it quite often.  I have changed my mind about many people and, since this debate started, I changed my mind about many Members of this House.  I had a very high regard for a number of people on the other side of the House until they spoke on this Bill.  I feel that what they said on this occasion was purely for the consumption of a few.  The whole question of retrospection must be considered in relation to the situation that must evolve.  A change of Government should not in any way upset awards made for social welfare benefits or any other increases.  There should be continuity in these increases irrespective of what change takes place.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley has pointed out the situation that existed when he received the award, where it was sent and the publication of it.  We have very many people being victimised as a result of this particular piece of legislation.  I am concerned about Deputies who lost their seats or who did not go forward and who should have been entitled to increases which would have raised their pensions.  Many people who gave excellent service to the nation and served this House well over the years are being deprived of their rights as a result of the Government's present Bill.  Consideration should be given to these people.</P>
      <P>It has also been pointed out that the higher civil servants, and the judges, received their allowances.  Why should there be a difference in the awards given to them and the awards given to the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas?  Are these different type of people in dire want of some assistance?  It would appear that the Minister's reasoning was that these people were in need of assistance while Deputies, either here or gone, were not.  It is difficult to understand why on the one hand awards were given and on the other the awards were withheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will have to consider former Members of this House and the injustice that has been done to <Col N="1293" /> them.  I feel that while the Government are not concerned about people who have given long and exacting service to the nation somebody must voice their opinion in relation to these injustices.  I ask the Minister to review this situation on the basis that it is in conflict with the national agreement.  The Minister may indicate that it is not in conflict with the national agreement but there is no logic in that.  There is no logic in that because there is a clear indication in the Minister's brief&mdash;it occurs on five or six occasions&mdash;that there was a special desire on his part to ensure that the agreement would be maintained and that he had an absolute regard, which he really has not, for the Employer/Labour Conference.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that Ministers would receive a lesser amount than that recommended by the review body.  This is a clear indication of the Minister's lack of examination of the situation.  Deputies will be paid somewhat less.  The net amount is approximately £600 and not as would appear £900.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs argued there was no discrimination against the Opposition.  There is discrimination.  We have the penal clause in section 12 under which the service of a person in the office of Attorney General during a particular period, which commenced on or prior to 14th March, 1973, will not be regarded as pensionable for the purpose of section 14 of the Act.  This looks very like an effort to rob certain people of their entitlement.  What is good enough for one should be good enough for all.  I doubt if this Bill was drawn up by the Parliamentary Draftsman.  It was probably drawn up in the Law Library or some place like that.</P>
    <P>Another discriminatory clause is that in relation to the Opposition. We all know that parliamentary work has increased considerably with our accession to the EEC.  We have to adapt ourselves to ever-changing conditions. We require a vast amount of information and a proper organisation service to keep delegates up to date.  There is a considerable strain on <Col N="1294" /> the resources available at the moment and the amount specified in this Bill falls far short of what is required to service an effective Opposition.  The Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Jack Lynch, pointed out that this Opposition intends to be a most effective Opposition.  We need resources to maintain a desirable level of opposition.  If it is the intention of the Government to weaken the Opposition and frustrate the Opposition so that ineffective members of the Government will not be tackled by the Opposition in the way in which they should be tackled, then this penal clause and this discrimination will have the desired effect.</P>
    <P>I served on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and I know the statements and the cases made by members of both the Government parties at that Committee when they were ordinary Deputies.  They pointed out that there was additional parliamentary work and a great amount of research and study was necessary as a result of our accession to the EEC and they said the ordinary Deputy was feeling the pinch.  Fine Gael suggested there should be proper research services available, in addition to everything else, and they indicated that the amount of money available to the Opposition at the time was so small that the Opposition was not effectively serviced at any level.  That argument is even more valid today than it was when it was first made. Resources are more urgently required today.</P>
    <P>There is a breach of the national pay agreement and the Minister should have advanced a valid reason at least other than the one he gave for the implementation date.  He has a duty to reconsider the whole situation.  I doubt if members of the Labour Party and clear thinking people anywhere could support this Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to debarring a person who held a particular office during a particular period commencing on or after 14th March, 1973, if there was no one entitled to consideration, then there was no need to insert this clause. It has been inserted however and I am sure all the necessary research <Col N="1295" /> was done.  As I said, I doubt if the Parliamentary Draftsman, unless specifically instructed to that effect, would have formulated this type of clause.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond's attitude is understandable. He welcomed the Bill. I do not think he meant it because he was as concerned about other factors as other Members of the House.  I hope he will examine it further in relation to the breach of the national pay agreement.  I do not think this House should give effect to legislation which might in any way undermine the national pay agreement.  As Deputy Lynch and Deputy Colley have clearly indicated, this party are fully behind the full implementation of the national pay agreement and we want to ensure that no legislation undermines it in any way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>We are deciding on salaries and allowances for legislators. I hasten to disagree with the Minister for Foreign Affairs who said that we are self-employed.  In fact, we are servants of the public.  We should realise this and not take unto ourselves the right to vote salaries for ourselves.  We should not take up the time of this House in discussing whether we should get salary increases.  We should be discussing more important issues.  For many years I have held the view that, once a salary for legislators is decided upon, it should be linked to some grade in the Civil Service, or it should have a built-in cost of living factor which would give automatic increases in line with the cost of living.</P>
      <P>The public look on these increases as massive.  Somebody said to me last night that this was the second increase we got in a year.  This was mentioned some months ago and many members of the public thought we got an increase. It received widespread publicity. It is surprising the number of people who do not delve into it fully and who think we got two increases in the past year.  I should like to ensure that this does not come before the House again even by way of Government order.  I am opposed to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1296" /> The other point at issue here is the question of increased allowances for the parties.  I would very much favour an increased allowance for the Opposition. I maintain that a Government are as good as the Opposition party. If the Opposition have not got proper allowances for research back-up we will not have effective government.  I would be in favour of doubling the allowances for the Opposition party to ensure that they can be an effective Opposition.</P>
    <P>Since I came into this House I have realised that a Deputy who has to try to do his own research with no facilities cannot be effective.  I remember in 1965 one of the officials of the House looking aghast when I said that a Deputy should have an office and a secretarial service.  He said that revolutionary ideas like that would not find favour in this House.  I wonder why not.  Only in June was I given space in an office in this House.  I had to fight to get some space and a chair and the loan of a table to do my work.  A proper secretarial service should be provided as of right by the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>I was in the Bonn Parliament and I saw what was provided for the German Deputies.  I was astonished.  A newspaper should carry out a study and show exactly what is provided for legislators in European Parliaments as compared with the Irish Parliament. Before I was a Deputy I remember phoning and asking for Deputy Noel Browne's secretary.  I assumed automatically that he must have a secretary and I said: &ldquo;Put me through to his office and his secretary&rdquo;.  People assume that we have an office and a secretary.  We should start thinking seriously about this.  If the Government are as progressive as they maintain they are, they should look at this matter and not say that the pattern of the past must be maintained.  It must not be maintained.  If Deputies are to provide a proper service for their constituencies and for the country, and make contributions to debates in the House, we must have proper services.</P>
    <P>I deplore the fact that the first £1,000 is tax free.  In the mind of the public Deputies get this by some surreptitious method.  In the public mind Deputies <Col N="1297" /> get everything tax free, and beer and everything in the House is subsidised and tax free.  Whether we laugh at this or not, it is in the public mind.  The Minister should seriously consider abolishing this tax free allowance.  Our salaries should be taxed fully and we should have proper expense allowances and a secretarial service provided by the Civil Service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it but the public do not.  If we continue to provide for this by order as is envisaged in section 11, the same problem will arise again.  The Government will be deciding this and the newspapers will say we are giving ourselves larger salaries again.  Some means must be devised to put an end to this once and for all.  I do not think we should adopt the attitude that it is not politically right to talk about increased salaries or allowances for Deputies.  Conscious of the fact that an election was imminent Deputy Colley was prepared to put this on the long finger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could understand it was an unpopular measure to bring in and he did not want to do it.  Very few Governments have the courage to come in and do it.  Unless the Minister for Finance now is prepared to link these allowances either to some grade in the Civil Service or to a built-in cost of living factor we will have the same again.  We will have the backbenchers saying: &ldquo;When is there to be an increase?&rdquo;<Col N="1298" /> That is what I hear around the House.  The question arises about an allowance for the Opposition and this in turn raises the question of what happens in regard to Deputies Blaney and Sheridan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dr. John O'Connell, yes.  I think there should be some means of providing a proper research department here for everyone. It should not be confined to one party or the other.  Ministers have this service&mdash;they have their research facilities and expert advisers&mdash;and I do not see why every Deputy should not have access to adequate facilities for research.  We are all legislators, we all make a valuable contribution and we should all have these services provided for us.  It should not be confined to Ministers alone.</P>
      <P>The other point I want to make is in relation to something said to me by a man who has taken up a senior position in a local authority.  He said he would be interested in becoming a Member of Dáil Éireann, where he could contribute usefully to the debates, if the salary were adequate.  He said he could not live on the present salary available to Deputies.  He is getting £5,000 a year as a local authority employee and he said he could not live and raise a family on what is being given to Dáil Deputies.  He would like to become an elected representative but he would not seriously consider it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>He could make a very useful contribution here; so could a lot of other people in the community but they are deterred by the salaries available to Deputies. This should be borne in mind by us. I heard today about the appointment of an information officer, a Press officer, for the European Parliament. A salary of £9,000 a year was mentioned. We should bear this in mind when we are talking about what a legislator is worth.  We ourselves have <Col N="1299" /> debased our position by our approach to this, by thinking that it is not politically wise to proceed in terms of proper salaries for the work we do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the situation of the Opposition seeking to &ldquo;up&rdquo; what the Government are offering rather unusual from my fairly considerable experience during the years when the Government of the day were usually very chary about making any move to raise these allowances because of the almost certain taking advantage of that situation by the then Opposition. They would be glad to get the increased allowances but they would come into the House and kick up a row that it should not be done and point to all the people who were much worse off and were not being attended to by the Government.</P>
      <P>Today I see a reversal of roles as we have known them on a few occasions in the past.  I am intrigued as to what the outcome of this debate will be.  Around the House this evening, since the Second Reading commenced, I was asked by a fellow Deputy what I thought about this, whether I would vote against it or support it, and without waiting for a reply I was told that if there was to be any division on this the Minister for Finance would withdraw it.  I do not know how well based that suggestion is but certainly if there is any shred of truth in this alleged attitude I would say it is a sad reflection on the Government.  It would incline me to the belief that it would be better if this matter had not been brought before the House at all&mdash;that it should have been left in abeyance as the Devlin Report in this connection was left in abeyance for some considerable time.  The Devlin recommendations were not acted on and various explanations for this have been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether one is inclined to accept the explanations is a matter for one's own judgment.  When the Devlin Report was further examined and reported on, and again not acted on, perhaps again the explanation is evident, that it did not come through until last December and that there was not much opportunity to do anything <Col N="1300" /> about it.  At the same time, I have no doubt that the Government at that time at any of their various Cabinet meetings between December and the dissolution of the Dáil could have made a public declaration of their intent.  They did not do this.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is, as Deputy O'Connell has just said, that the then Government were rather chary about deciding publicly what they intended to do about the revised edition of Devlin as handed down to them in December, knowing in the back of their minds, or perhaps even in the forefront of their minds, that an election was not far away.  This, in my estimation, is not a bad reason for being rather reticent about making a decision on it at that time.  I have not a doubt in the world that had the decision been declared at that time by the then Government, and events following as they did&mdash;the general election&mdash;it would have been part and parcel of the platform of the now National Coalition to decry the proposals.</P>
    <P>These explanations, as I have said, are as one takes them and as one works them out for oneself.  I do not think they are very important at this time except that the delay in implementing any of the recommendations has brought about a situation wherein the time since the last revision is now approximately five years and in these times of very rapid inflation and high rising living costs there seems to be too long a gap between one revision and the next.</P>
    <P>Thinking on those lines, one naturally has to ask himself whether the basis as agreed in 1968 was a proper basis and a fair one.  Perhaps at the time we felt it was and perhaps it is, but I cannot help going back a considerable time beyond that period and recalling the arguments made in my early years in this House&mdash;if not publicly at least privately or semiprivately&mdash;that the best people were attracted to this House not by the amount they were paid for their services to it but by their wish to give those services to the public.  I must say that 20 years ago I was rather cynical about that approach and I continued to be cynical for a number of years <Col N="1301" /> afterwards until the time arrived when the allowances arranged here by agreement in the Dáil had come up to a reasonably decent standard.  Mainly the argument had been changed around in the years from the early fifties to the sixties, that we would get the people best suited to the House and the people who had most to give only if we were prepared to give the kind of reward that such people by their ability could command in other walks of life.  I felt that this was a fairly good argument and an argument that sounded better than the one I had been fed on for quite a number of years after I came into the House, which is as far back as 1948.  In those days the allowance was £624 a year.  The allowance was not taxable but I suppose there would not be anything to tax.  The allowance was talked about in those days to the same extent as the proposed allowance of £3,400 will be talked about today. It was talked about by the public in the same sort of terms as they will apply to the figure announced by the Minister and proposed in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There was no postage allowance in those days.  A Deputy paid his own postage.  The standing joke was that if you did not write any letters you got more for being here than did those who did write letters.</P>
    <P>The position has changed to some extent.  A Deputy whose constituency is not within local call distance can make trunk calls to a particular number in his constituency free of charge. That concession is restricted to one specific number.  Those who come from distant and scattered constituencies realise that this concession is nothing like what would be needed for a Deputy to keep in touch with his constituency while he is in Dublin.  A Deputy should not be restricted to one particular number.  He should be allowed to make trunk calls to any number in his constituency.</P>
    <P>These things are part of the developing trend in allowances for Members of the Dáil.  Over the years a subsistence allowance has been granted in respect of expenses necessarily incurred in this city during Dáil sessions.</P>
    <P>I am not at all sure that we are <Col N="1302" /> dealing with the most important aspect for Deputies in dealing with the allowances. For quite a long time I have had the conviction that the question of pensions for the families, the widows and dependants of Members of the House is of far greater importance than the immediate day to day value of the allowances.  I would much prefer that the allowance should remain as it was up to 1st July and that the money proposed to be devoted to increasing the allowances would be directed towards pensions for the dependants, children and widows of Members of the House.</P>
    <P>There is a very unusual situation in regard to Deputies' pensions.  When a Deputy retires or is defeated&mdash;it happens ultimately in one way or the other&mdash;his pension is tied to the allowance obtaining at the time of his departure from the House.  I cannot understand the attitude to Parliamentary allowances of many Members of the House, not only in the Opposition benches but in the Government benches in particular who over the past 16 years, while Fianna Fáil were in office, made such a song and dance, and rightly so, about parity of pensions and pensions being related to today's costs and who acclaimed the upgrading of pensions for various public servants.  Why the two attitudes? Why, on the one hand, the attitude towards the Public Service and the support for the upgrading of Public Service pensions and parity for State pensioners and, on the other hand, the ignoring of the same principle in so far as Members of the Dáil are concerned?</P>
    <P>I repeat that I would much prefer that any money now proposed to be given by way of increase in allowances would be directed towards improving the position of those who have served in the House, either during our time or before it and giving them pensions related to the allowances obtaining in the House as of now rather than to those operating when these people retired from the House.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that the Minister should give very serious consideration to the dependants, the families, the widows of Members of the House who <Col N="1303" /> have given many years in its service. If this did not meet with the fullest approval of the House, it certainly would meet with the approval of those who are trying to subsist on what is being dispended to them on foot of pensions earned by their late breadwinners.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of choice of direction in which the money involved might be expended, I am not sure that the proposed increases are fully justified.  In my earliest years here the argument was made that if you held out sufficient money you might attract the wrong type rather than the right type.  I did not agree with that argument then.  In the interim we have switched to the other direction.  If we proceed to increase the allowances to a point at which they are more attractive than the allowances have been in the past, we will attract the wrong type again, if we attracted them in the past, which I doubt.  I do not think it is true to say that you will not get the right people or the best people unless they can get as much by way of Parliamentary allowances and perks of one kind and another as they can command outside.  I do not think that is the way it can be measured.  I do not think any allowance could be measured against the time the public representative has to give and the manner of life involved for a Deputy as a result of his being in this House. You cannot equate the two things. One cannot be measured against the other in terms of so much a day, so much an hour, so much a week, so much a year.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider whether the scales we are aiming at now and the pattern being set <i>vis-à-vis</i> other scales are worthwhile, are necessary or good, or whether they will improve the membership of this House. I doubt it, not just now, for I have doubted it for some considerable time back.  Since the increase to £2,500 I have often wondered whether the £2,500 was the attraction or whether this House was an attraction for its own sake and for the sake of the contribution Members could make here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1304" /> That is something very difficult to measure.  I am inclined to believe that the allowances could well be left as they are and that the pensions of Members should be examined thoroughly and perhaps improved considerably.  I think it is fairly well accepted by all of us that, even if we depart from this House, through defeats at elections or through other circumstances, and even if we ourselves have not fared well over the years in this House by way of allowances, we need not worry as long as the dependants we may leave behind are reasonably cared for, but they are not reasonably provided for in any of the enactments we have passed here over the years.  It might be better to make improvements in that direction rather than increase the allowances, which may or may not help to attract into this House people of better calibre than they may have attracted up to now.  In the days when the allowances were quite niggardly or, one might say scandalously low, we had a calibre of men we do not have here today.  Without reflecting on any individual Deputy, I would say that, in my humble estimation and recollection, the men who were here then were in no way inferior to those we have now, but were superior.  In those days there were no perks like free postage and phone calls; nor was there any subsistence allowance, and the travelling allowance did not provide adequate transport for them in those days.</P>
    <P>The last speaker said the amount given to Deputies does not compare favourably even with what is being received by employees in the public service, and I quite agree.  Deputy O'Connell instanced the case of a very able man who would like to be a Deputy and, perhaps he has a lot to contribute to the House&mdash;but who could not consider it because the amount he was receiving in his present employment was so much above what he would possibly get here.  I am inclined to agree with the suggestion from the Opposition benches that he should be left where he is if that is what motivates him.  The worth of a Deputy or Senator cannot be evaluated in hourly or weekly rates.  While recognising <Col N="1305" /> the desirability of giving a fair recompense for the services rendered by public representatives, we must not make the allowance too high lest we attract those whose sole concern is the allowance for its own sake and who, in many instances, would not get anything like it in any other walk of life, rather than attract the people who want to be Members of this House because it is here things can be done or at least attempted to be done, if not brought to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>There has also been mention of allowances for the Opposition.  I agree with Deputy O'Connell that good Government must have a good Opposition.  Any faults this Government may find with the last Government can be truly brought to their own door.  If we had bad Government in the recent past we had worse Opposition.  I have said this when in Government as well as since leaving Government.  I am between the two at the moment, and I say now with no less belief and no less emphasis that a Government is only as good as its Opposition.  We have been suffering noticeably from bad Opposition for the past 12 or 13 years.</P>
    <P>If additional allowances to the Opposition can help&mdash;and perhaps they can&mdash;to provide better research facilities for them, which is very necessary if we are to contribute to discussions and debate knowingly and fully all the matters that are brought before this House by Ministers who are fully briefed in all those things, I would agree with Deputy O'Connell that this is something worthy of consideration.</P>
    <P>The same Deputy was good enough to mention the two Independents in the House, that is Deputy Joe Sheridan and myself.  If he had not, I would have done so anyhow for the simple reason that if the Opposition find it difficult to compete with the members of the Government as a result of not having the research staff necessary to inform them properly, then what chance is there for a member of a small party or an Independent in this House?  When we are elected here we are all equal; at least that is the concept during <Col N="1306" /> the elections, although during the life of any Government it is not the practice.  Therefore, Deputies who are members of small parties or on their own as Independents do not count for anything except right here in the Chamber where they are given equal rights with everybody else in the House in so far as contributions&mdash; when they contribute and when they are called&mdash;are concerned.  This is the only place from one election to the next where the very small groups of Independents have any equality whatever.  They have no back-up. They have no research facilities.  They do not and cannot have any allowance to provide these facilities.  In so far as the secretarial assistance necessary for their constituency work is concerned, the lack of numbers makes it much more difficult and much more costly for each of them, than where the party is large and where there are many contributing and matters can be organised on a much more attractive basis.</P>
    <P>I am not making any plea for any allowance in this regard, but some thought is necessary about the back-up which should be provided, not through funding of the parties but rather as a right of Deputies.  This may well have to come, even if it has to come through the aegis of the Civil Service in some manner or other.  The Minister should have this in mind.  It would be of great value not only to the larger parties but particularly to the smaller parties and to the isolated Independents who are not even acquainted of what is intended by way of business from one hour to the next unless they happen to be present personally when a decision is made on a day like today.</P>
    <P>I merely instance this, not as a carping point but as a mere statement of fact.  For personal reasons, I could not be here yesterday.  I had some questions on the Order Paper.  I telephoned the House and asked to have them postponed until today.  I travelled 180 miles to be here in time for Question Time.  I arrived at 2.45 p.m. and found that Question Time had started at 1.30 p.m.  I was told that the parties had agreed at some hour this morning that questions <Col N="1307" /> should start at 1.30 p.m.  It is not just good enough that the standard practice can be so readily changed merely to accommodate a situation which, apparently, was due to lack of business or lack of people to go on with business today.  Apparently, the fact that even one Deputy should be left without any knowledge of what was proposed to be done was ignored. That happened against a pattern which has been set for many years.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter so that some thought may be given to such changes of arrangements in the future in so far as Independents are concerned. There should be some method whereby they are at least informed as soon as the Whips of the major parties have agreed on a particular Order of Business or order of procedure.  At least some attempt should be made to inform the Deputies who do not belong to any of the parties and who have no say in the matter and are totally ignorant of the arrangements arrived at which may concern them very much.  Matters may be of great concern to them or to their constituents or constituencies.  Probably this matter could be rectified.  We do not want an up-to-the-minute service, but something could be done about the position of the Independents in order to keep them informed about what is happening in the House.</P>
    <P>I am sure that if the vote of a Deputy who happens to be an Independent was needed by the Opposition or by the Government to carry the day for one or the other there would be no problem in regard to contacting either one or both of us, whether it was the middle of the day or the middle of the night.  I am asking for some consideration in regard to the general ordering of procedure here, recognising fully that the Government and the main Opposition party will determine business as they themselves think fit.  It should not be forgotten at any stage that no Deputy, whether he is a Member of the front bench of the Government or of the Opposition, or a backbencher of either of the major groups in this House, has any prior right over any other Deputy, even an Independent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> We are all here by virtue of the votes at the last election, or at any election.  We are all here according to that vote, and according to our being declared elected.  I am not aware in any way of any law or any part of our Constitution where the right is diminished merely because of the fact that we do not belong to one power group or the other.  The right is the right of membership of this House and even if convention over the years seems to have eroded the rights of individuals or small groups this should be looked at again.  I do not think it is correct that once a Deputy is in here, unless he belongs to one side or the other, he does not have any say whatever, nor is he informed about what the House intend to proceed to do.  We are all elected by our constituents.</P>
    <P>If, as seems likely by the Government's offering here and the Opposition's bid to improve the offer, that somewhere along the line there will be increases, I would suggest to the Minister that we reconsider what has now emerged in this Bill, that is, that in future we adopt the procedure of discussing the matter and enacting it by way of an order and not by legislation. I do not think that an order would suffice.  The legislative procedure is not a bad one.  Even if it would be handier to do such business by order and even if the matter might get less publicity if done by order, and less misunderstanding as a result of some of the publicity which is so unclear, as somebody has said already, that it will appear to the public in many cases as if this was the second big increase in the last 12 months, whereas it has been the same one which has been bandied around for a considerable time, the legislative procedure is better than procedure by order.  Unless we find a completely new system of operation we should not abandon what we now do in open debate here and substitute the placing of an order before the House which, if not rejected within 21 days, comes into effect.  There is a sort of &ldquo;back-door&rdquo; way of doing a job like this.  If we are to have recourse to the House at all, let us have it in the manner in which we now have it rather than in this other left-handed type of manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1309" /> If there is to be an increase, and if the basis of that increase is justified &mdash;which I am sure it is because I have no doubt that the Minister feels it is fully justified&mdash;can anybody enlighten me how it comes that the amount which has been recommended and passed for the judiciary and for the higher civil servants, after deliberation both by Devlin and by the conference, seems to be correct while the proposals in regard to the Members of this House are incorrect? If it is justified, why is it not being paid from the date originally proposed? If it is not justified in the case of Deputies, Senators and Members of the Oireachtas generally, is there any justification why there should be retrospection to January, 1972, for two categories who were included in the overall considerations together with Members of this House?  An explanation is certainly called for there. Indeed, there is reason to doubt the wisdom of the Minister and the Government who can find that all of what is proposed for the judiciary is correct in the proposals put before them, and also for the higher civil servants, but is wrong so far as the Members of the House of the Oireachtas are concerned.  It would be interesting to know how this was arrived at.  I do not for a moment take the reason that was originally given, which has been given again today, that 1st July is the date because it cannot be given to Members of this House before the social welfare increases are given to the social welfare classes.  I do not think that even impresses the social welfare classes and certainly it does not get very far through so far as Members of this House on all sides are concerned.  It is not an argument.  It never was a reason and the sooner a proper reason as to why this present position came about is given by the Minister the better for all concerned.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the unusual situation of the Government coming in and putting their heads on the block and the Opposition coming and saying there should be more.  This is certainly a milestone in the history of the House because it has always been the other way around.  The Government <Col N="1310" /> propose and the Opposition oppose and decry the Government for giving anything.  At the same time they are very willing to support the taking of it when it comes to the actual take.  This unusual situation has perhaps been explained by the attitude of the Front Bench spokesman on the Opposition side who are all for the national pay agreement being maintained in all its aspects.  I suppose there is a certain amount of good reasoning in their paralleling the refusal of the Government to face up to the full terms of the recommendation with the refusal of an employer outside to do likewise when an award is made to his employees.  It sounds good sense and I am sure it was intended as good sense, but when listening to it one wonders if it is merely used as good argument.</P>
    <P>The House is entitled to a very full explanation from the Minister why he differentiated between the judiciary, the higher civil servants and the Members of this House in his departure from the recommendations handed down to him.  We would also like to hear from him his own and the Government's&mdash;I suppose he has to talk for the Government when he is talking in the House as Minister for Finance&mdash;mind whether the allowances proposed to be paid are too high, too low or just right.  Perhaps consideration should be given to retaining at a lower level the allowances in this House than that which might be obtained in something parallel&mdash; it is very hard to parallel what a Member of this House does outside &mdash;outside this House.  The Government should try and establish, if they can, the level at which the Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas would be compensated for their work on behalf of the public by their membership of either House.  At the same time, however, they should keep in mind that if Members of the Oireachtas were to be compensated to the fullest degree for the time they give this would &ldquo;raise the ante&rdquo; to such a degree that undoubtedly the attraction to those who might not be the best material for this House would increase.  I believe the correct level is somewhere in between but it is a level <Col N="1311" /> at which we could arrive only after very careful consideration.</P>
    <P>I feel our remuneration is high enough at the moment.  After many years of near beggary for Members of this House, as it was in the early years after the House came into being &mdash;of course, this was the extreme on the other side&mdash;we should be very careful we do not err on the other end and go to too high a figure.  I believe somewhere between the two, the high and the low, the ideal and proper figure lies.  There is no yardstick we can properly use and there is no parallel we can draw from outside to give us a clear guide as there might be in other occupations.  It requires a great deal of thought. Before the matter is finally decided, perhaps thought could be given to my suggestion that the moneys saved by not proceeding with this offer at the moment could best be applied to the benefit of the pensions of Members of both Houses, their widows and their dependants, and that we consider also the question of providing proper research and backup facilities through the Civil Service for the Members of the Opposition so that they might contribute more to the workings of this House and the good Government of this country.  I feel this would be the best that we might do in the circumstances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition that the Government have deliberately set about doing an injustice to the Opposition is an unworthy and untrue allegation and I believe he knows that the allegation he made today had no foundation.  The only approach which Deputy Lynch made to the Government was an informal conversation which he had with the Taoiseach sometime ago at which the Taoiseach indicated his willingness to look at the question of the payment of an allowance to the Opposition.  This is a question which needs very careful examination.  I believe that practice of allocating a sum of £15,000 to one party only in this House has no justification today. What is important is that Members of <Col N="1312" /> this House receive what Deputy Blaney calls a backup service, research facilities and secretarial facilities to enable them to carry out their parliamentary duties and obligations to their constituents.</P>
      <P>The right and the obligation of Members to render that service lies on all Members of this House, irrespective of whether they are on the Opposition benches or on the Government benches. If you take the office holders away from the Government side of the House you are still left with, I think, 51 Members of the House on the Government side who, like the Opposition Deputies, are without secretarial services, without research facilities and without most of the amenities which are necessary to provide a proper service to their constituents. In a large number of other parliaments grants are made available to Deputies for the provision of secretarial services.  The Members are aware that the proposed Assembly in the North of Ireland, which will not have a fraction of the duties to perform which Members of this House have, will receive not merely an allowance as Members of the Assembly but will also receive a secretarial allowance. Quite obviously the appropriate body to consider this matter in the future would be the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I was a member of that Committee for some time and I am aware that Members of all parties on that Committee reached agreement about the kind of facilities which ought to be made available.  Approaches were made to a number of my predecessors in relation to these matters but we did not receive very much response.</P>
      <P>If there is a general consensus across the House&mdash;and this appears to be the case&mdash;that these facilities should be improved, so far as I am concerned Deputies will find a real willingness to provide these better services. This is an area within which we can discuss the better allowances that should be made available to ordinary Members who are not office-holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, we accept it would be appropriate to have an allowance for the Leader of the Opposition and also for the Opposition Whip.  This is a <Col N="1313" /> matter that was touched on during the last Dáil by the committee which was set up on a motion by the Labour Party.  The immense burden of work that falls on Whips and assistant Whips was recognised by the committee.  They serve a useful purpose; in fact, they are essential for the smooth working of the parliamentary system. Even though Deputies occasionally may find themselves at the awkward end of their decisions, I think even Deputy Blaney will accept that without the Whips and their delegated authority and their right to make decisions the parliamentary system would be less efficient than it is.  I hope I will not be charged with disrespect to the House when I say it is far from efficient at the present time.</P>
    <P>I give this assurance in public that the Government will enter into immediate and meaningful discussions with the Opposition and if legislation is necessary to provide the funds and give effect to better services there will be no reluctance on our part to provide the necessary legislation and machinery.  If we do that we will be doing a good day's work for Parliament and it might be possible for Oppositions to be more efficient than has been the case in the past.  I accept that Oppositions have not been efficient but this has been largely due to the fact that government has become so complicated and the multitude of ideas that must be processed in the House are so overwhelming that members of the Opposition are finding it impossible to do the necessary study.  I think Members are under greater pressure now at constituency level than when Deputy Blaney first entered the House or even when Members entered ten years ago. It is true to say that most Members did more thinking before they entered the House.  Once a person becomes a Member he finds it increasingly difficult to withdraw from the pressures of everyday business and do the necessary thinking that legislators should do.</P>
    <P>I hope that the charge which was made of unwillingness on our part to assist the Opposition and ordinary <Col N="1314" /> Members will be withdrawn.  It has no justification; in fact, the reverse is the case.  We believe this will take some little time to study, but not very long.  We may have some time to study the matter during the recess. I sensed from the indignation&mdash; genuine or professed&mdash;of some Members, voiced here and elsewhere, that there would have been immense annoyance if we had postponed the introduction and passage of this Bill pending a re-assessment of the services and the financial assistance which should be given to parties to enable them to discharge their business more efficiently.</P>

      <P>What I am undertaking is to enter into an immediate discussion with the Opposition to see if we can arrive at an agreement as to the basis of providing remuneration to groups of Deputies in the House to enable them more effectively to discharge their duties.  I accept that a larger subsistence would have to go to the Opposition than to ordinary Members on the Government side because the Government have office-holders and a secretariat. However, the 51 Members on the Government side&mdash;this applies to any Government&mdash;are entitled to the same kind of facilities as ordinary members of the Opposition.  It cannot be denied that if we are to have assistance towards the cost of working democracy it must apply all around and not merely on one side of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no reluctance on our part to enter into these discussions but at the moment I do not know what is in the minds of the Members opposite.  Some parliaments operate a system of giving a grant to parties related to the number of votes the parties received in the previous general election.  It might be of interest to Members to know that if parties in this House received 1p for every first preference vote obtained by them in the last election the sums would be as follows: Fianna Fáil would receive £6,245, Fine Gael £4,737, and the Labour Party £1,846. There could be a multiple of that, to give a higher or lower figure as the case may be, but this is a formula that is quite frequently used in parliaments abroad.  I am not saying this will be the basis of any agreement but it is something that should be looked at.</P>
      <P>There were charges made that the Government were dishonouring some obligation when they did not give retrospection.  Let us look clearly at the record.  Neither Devlin nor the Employer/Labour Conference recommended retrospection in respect of allowances paid to office-holders or Members of the Dáil or Seanad. There was no obligation though Deputy Colley and others would have us believe there was some moral obligation even if it was not written down. If the moral obligation was there, let us see how Deputy Colley proposed to honour it when he was Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If he had that sense of moral obligation one would have thought it reasonable that he should have provided the money to meet it in the Estimates.  However, when I entered the Department of Finance I found that not one penny was provided in the Estimates to meet this increase either for the current year or for any back period.  If there was an obligation to have retrospective payment, I ask Deputies opposite to what date should it apply?  It is not in Devlin or in the report of the Employer/ <Col N="1316" /> Labour Conference.  This clearly indicates there was no specific obligation but we were led to believe today and in the course of the budget debate that there was a moral obligation.</P>
    <P>If there was a moral obligation and if the same date as applied to judges and senior civil servants was to be used, the cost would be £430,000 but this money was not supplied by Deputy Colley.  Any Deputies or Senators who may be aggrieved about the matter should look to Deputy Colley because he had the opportunity to fulfil the moral obligation he sensed he had. On this side of the House we do not believe there is either a legal or a moral obligation; our view is that if the allowances were not increased according as salaries and allowances were increased elsewhere, the blame lies on the then Government for lacking the moral courage to take the necessary steps to increase the allowances.</P>
    <P>We do not propose to lack moral courage now or in future.  In this Bill we are providing that in future increases can be given by way of a Government order that will be laid before the House.  Any Member disagreeing with that order will have an opportunity of tabling a motion to have it rescinded.  It is our intention that in the event of further national pay agreements, as they are entered into they will be implemented so far as allowances to Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas are concerned.  That is the proper thing to do to avoid the atmosphere of unsavoury envy which has developed on every occasion in my memory when the allowances of Ministers and Deputies have been increased. Invariably this envy has been engendered because of the delays in giving increases that were modest by any standard or by any comparison with outside remuneration.  The only way of avoiding that unnecessary envy is to provide machinery that will enable the Government to take the necessary steps if and when there will be national agreements or recognised improvements in remuneration generally.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley was suggesting, as an <Col N="1317" /> earnest of his readiness to provide the increases, that there was a draft memorandum for consideration by the Government prepared during his term of office.  What is interesting is that, while a draft was prepared, it remained a draft, and that was not the only draft I found in the Department of Finance; there were many others that were not dealt with.  However, when we come to deal with these from time to time, no doubt Deputy Colley will claim that they were his idea and his work.  All Departments of State are full of nonacted upon drafts and they would have remained as drafts but for the fact that there is in power a Government who are prepared to make decisions and act accordingly.</P>
    <P>What did Deputy Colley do in this regard?  On the draft there is an interesting little note which says &ldquo;the Minister will be unable to deal with the matter before leaving office&rdquo;.  That was dated 12th March, but the Minister had the draft from January.  On 13th March the previous Government met for the last time.  Did they consider then doing something to make amends to the Deputies on whose behalf they have shed tears today?  No, that was not on the agenda.  The Government had not time to consider it, but on that same day they found time to make an order increasing the remuneration of the President and providing that, thereafter, entertainment at Aras an Uachtaráin would be charged not against the presidential Vote but against the Miscellaneous Expenses Vote of the Department of Finance where they could be concealed.  There was no time then, we are told, to deal with the matter now before us, the matter on which we are spending hours today because of the profane indignation of Fianna Fáil regarding the injustice that is being done to ordinary Members of this House.  Therefore, I consider that I am justified in saying that those who are annoyed in this regard ought to look for payment to those who are responsible.</P>
    <P>I wish to deal with a number of matters of detail that were raised in the debate.  One of these is in relation to section 12, that section which deals with the Office of the Attorney <Col N="1318" /> General.  The reason why the 14th March, 1973, was chosen as the threshold for the new provision was that we are aware that during the past 25 years every Attorney General reserved to himself the right to engage in private practice.  Most of them did that.  If we find that there was somebody who did not engage in private practice and who was not required, as a condition of his employment, to abandon private practice, the matter can be looked at again, but, so far as we know, the only former Attorney General who would get benefit if we were to amend the section in the way suggested is the man who held that office in the 1920's. Since 1938 every Attorney General has enjoyed a gratuity on ceasing to hold office&mdash;not a gratuity of one and a half times his salary, as Deputy Lynch suggested, but one that was equal to half his salary at the time of ceasing to be employed as Attorney General.  Of course, that would be the global salary of the Attorney General and not the ministerial salary as distinct from a Deputy's salary.</P>
    <P>The present Attorney General is full-time and we are satisfied that we should not in future have Attorney Generals who are part-time.  The whole legal and legislative field is so immense and the responsibilities of the office are so great that they require the full attention of the holder of the office.  It is true that many lawyers could earn at the Bar what would be far in excess of what is paid to any holder of the office of Attorney General.  But, as Deputy Blaney pointed out, there are satisfactions in holding office which are greater than monetary reward and there will always be people from all walks of life who are prepared to make monetary sacrifices in order to serve their country.</P>
    <P>The present Attorney General is and, I hope, all future holders of that office will be full-time and on that account we are providing that he may get in respect of that portion of his Attorney General's salary which is not his Dáil salary, a ministerial pension, as it were, related to that sum. If he were a Member of the Dáil he would be entitled to a pension in <Col N="1319" /> respect of his Dáil service.  That is a different matter and would have no effect on the pension payable to him as a result of his having held the office of Attorney General.</P>

Perhaps now that they have experienced the difficulties of being in opposition they will realise how unfair they were to the Opposition during their years of secure tenure of office in Government.  They were unfair, denying to the Opposition many facilities which are made available in practically every other Parliament in Europe.  Ordinary Members <Col N="1320" /> of the House were treated by Fianna Fáil as if they did not count and were denied many facilities and services that had been made available elsewhere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>All these matters can be looked at and it will be found that this Government will be much more helpful to the Opposition than they ever were to us while they were in office.  Deputy Colley suggested that the Bill might be amended by inserting a provision to the effect that the remuneration paid to office holders and to Members of the Dáil might be renewed by the Government once in every two years and that the review should be placed before the Dáil.  I understand his intention is to ensure that we do not have this long delay again in adjustment of remuneration. We can all agree on that; but I do not think the way suggested by the Deputy is the way to ensure that the adjustment takes place.  There could be a situation, such as arose in respect of the Devlin Report, which was launched in December, 1970, but which is only coming to fruition now. It is much better to provide, as we are providing in the Bill, and as I think Deputy Colley had intended when he was Minister&mdash;whenever he got around to doing it&mdash;that the increases may be made by order and if and when adjustments take place on a nationally-agreed level elsewhere then the necessary order can be made. I think that is the appropriate thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> Devlin suggested a rate of remuneration which in respect of Members of this House and its office holders was higher than the Employer/Labour Conference gave and at least some of that was a reflection of their view that the scales were not commensurate with the responsibilities of Members. I believe we are entering a period where the responsibilities, which are great, will multiply and where the opportunity to discharge those responsibilities will be greater, because we, as a Government, will see that facilities are made available to enable Members to discharge their responsibility to their constituents and to the nation.  On that account I expect the work load to increase even more but I hope the outcome, too, will be far better because it will be more efficient and more productive.  It may be necessary to have another look at the scale of responsibility and not merely the rate of remuneration.  I think that can be done but I do not think there is any point in writing into a Bill a rather nebulous review formula which would contain no undertaking that recommendations would ever be implemented in a new proposal or in new legislation.</P>
    <P>I trust, therefore, that the House without more ado will approve of this Bill which is, unfortunately, a belated effort to make amends for the long delays that have taken place in the adjustment of remuneration of Members of this House and of the other House.  The fact that there has been such delay is every reason why we should now proceed without further delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill itself contains the necessary machinery to do something much more effective.  We are providing a facility whereby the Government can increase the remuneration and I have indicated that it would be our intention to increase the remuneration whenever a national wage agreement would indicate that there was a nationally accepted formula for so doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I may not agree with it but I think I understand the Minister's position.  I understood the Minister to say that in his view the report of the Employer/Labour Conference was not clear as to the date from which increases of remuneration for parliamentarians should be commenced. If the Minister was satisfied that it was clear, would he then feel an obligation to apply increases in remuneration to parliamentarians from that clear date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we have made our interpretation of this report which we believe is the correct one.  We have indicated our reasons why we are making this payable from the 1st July, 1973.  While some people have said that it is unacceptable to them that we are making these increases payable from the same date as the increases for social welfare beneficiaries, we consider that a worthy reason if only to remind all Members of this House, and particularly those opposite who so frequently forget it, that the social welfare recipients are our employers just as much as everybody else and we would not be justified in giving ourselves an increase from a date before they got it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May we take it then, that if the Employer-Labour Conference were to clarify to the Minister's satisfaction precisely what it meant, the Minister would not accept that date?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Why the difference of approach&mdash;purely out of curiosity and nothing else&mdash;in regard to dates for the judiciary and higher civil servants as against Members of the House and will we have an opportunity before long of discussing the much more important matter of Deputies' pensions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>All other employees of the State have had their increases paid to them from the earlier date. We did not consider it would be appropriate to make a decision denying increases to senior civil servants and judges from the same date.  We can make decisions affecting ourselves, deny ourselves money, if we so wish. That is our affair.  We think it would be wrong to apply the same discipline to others, particularly when people in not dissimilar relationships to the institutions of the State received their pay increases from the earlier date.</P>
      <P>On the question of pensions, they come to be dealt with not by way of legislation but by way of resolution in the House.  I am not unsympathetic to the idea of making some move towards parity of pensions but Members should realise that the pension fund is operating in a state of gross deficit at the moment notwithstanding the subventions which have been given to it and any increase in pensions will have to be paid for entirely out of the Exchequer.  One of the principal reasons why the pension fund operates in deficit is because alone among all parliaments that I have yet had an opportunity to study, and that is about 20 parliaments, this one pays pensions to ex-Members irrespective of age.  In Europe there is only one other parliament that pays pensions before 50 and most of them pay it at 55 years and upwards.  That is something we will have to have a look at.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have always held the view that Deputy Blaney expressed here today that the pension scheme should be related to widows and dependants.  I <Col N="1324" /> was a reluctant participant in the pension scheme from the very beginning because originally it did not provide for widows and dependants at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">

      <P>I cannot accept that this Bill does other than give effect to the increases recommended by the Employer/Labour Conference.  We cannot accept that there is anything in this Bill in the nature of a surprise. It does what it was indicated it was to do.  The Leader of the Opposition has indicated that he wishes to have this Bill postponed in order to put down amendments.  We are agreeable to that, although originally the Bill was to be taken today. However, having regard to the viewpoint which they hold, and with which we do not agree, we have agreed to this Bill going over to next week.  I understand from the Leader of the Opposition that it is still agreed that the House will adjourn next Friday-week so it does not appear that there is any matter now in dispute.</P>

      <P>I do not want to carry on this argument across the floor of the House but I want to put on record what I know to be the case. On two occasions prior to the introduction of this Bill it was conveyed to the Government that we hoped <Col N="1330" /> suitable provision would be made for the Opposition allowance to be increased. When the Bill ultimately appeared such provision was not made. When the Bill was published that was the first time we had the opportunity of ascertaining whether or not it did contain such a provision.  It is suggested that the Bill sets out to do no more than what the Minister said it would do.  But the Minister cannot deny that he has departed from precedent established in four successive Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices Acts by omitting any provision for an increase in the Opposition allowance.  Having said that, I am quite prepared to accommodate the Government in the termination of the programme within a reasonable time, and I hope within the time limit already set, next week-end.</P>
      <P>A suggestion has been made to me now that we order this Bill for tomorrow. Tomorrow's business may not be very long anyhow.  The Whips can discuss immediately what we can do about taking it either tomorrow or on Tuesday, on the basis that we will be permitted to submit amendments at short notice.  That might accommodate all sides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter of principle which I brought to the attention of the Minister, the right of a doctor to prescribe what he considers is in the patient's interest.  This medical card holder was an old lady living alone and suffering from cancer of the gullet.  She was not able to swallow solid foods.  I felt obliged to prescribe a food or nutritional substance which is a medicinal product and which I thought should be prescribed to keep this patient alive.  I was told by the health board that this could not be done.  I challenge the right of an official of the Department to question my right to prescribe that product, when I feel it is in particular circumstances a drug or medicinal product and not a food.  I explained to the Minister on a number of occasions the reasons why I have the right to prescribe this product.</P>
      <P>I have heard over and over again exhortations to doctors to keep patients out of hospital.  Where possible patients should not be admitted to hospital if they can be treated at home.  Had I admitted this patient to a hospital for treatment with this product it would have cost the State from £56 to £112 per week.  I asked the Minister, the Department, and the health board, if I could prescribe the same product and keep the patient at home at a cost of 75p and I was told I could not.  That is ludicrous in the extreme. It shows the way the system works in the Department.  They cannot see the logic of it.  It makes fools of us and will discourage me from doing anything to help reduce the cost of hospitalisation for patients.  As I said, the cost of this food would be 75p per week.  This would not be an abnormal burden on the Exchequer but it would have meant a lot to this particular patient.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question in the mind of the <Col N="1332" /> Department and, indeed, in the mind of the Minister is whether this is a food or a medicine.  To me that is a very relative point.  In certain circumstances a food is a medicine.  This particular food is a mineral and nutritional supplement.  I cannot accept the argument that this is a food when foods are allowed for certain other medical conditions, one of which is PKU or phenylketonuria, where a special food diet is allowed under the medical health services.  The Minister cannot say that there is no precedent for this because there is this specific condition to which I referred, phenylketonuria, the food is used to keep the patient alive, and this is permitted under the Health Act.</P>
    <P>In this case it was necessary to keep the patient alive and I felt justified in prescribing it and I am annoyed that I was not allowed to do so.  The Minister is upholding this stupid regulation. What makes this more ludicrous is that there are two other products of equal caloric value, of almost equal nutritional value, and of equal value as a protein, which I could have prescribed but for the fact that they nauseated the patient and she could not tolerate them.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that there is a danger of abuse.  To me that is an insult.  I accept absolute responsibility when writing prescriptions.  If the Minister checks with the health boards he will see that I could never be accused of over-visiting, or of having too many consultations or making any charges on the health boards for anything I prescribe or dispense for medical card patients.  He could never make that charge. Because of this I feel doubly annoyed&mdash;because the Minister said that there is a danger of it being abused.</P>
    <P>The people to whom this product could be given are people in a bad state of malnutrition.  It was given to supplement their food, it was given to people who suffered from a bad lack of protein which in itself is a deficiency and a disease, <i>per se</i>.  It is a specific condition requiring specific treatment. This is the condition for which I <Col N="1333" /> attempted to prescribe this product. The Minister has said it is a matter for home assistance.  I bow to no one in regard to my prescribing rights, my evaluation and assessment of a patient's needs and I do not think I should be forced to bring this to a home assistance officer to get him to make a decision.  I consider it very wrong and I will never abide by that stupid, ludicrous ruling.  I do not think I should have to bring this case to a home assistance officer to know whether he would decide if this product should be used for the patient.</P>

      <P>It makes the whole thing ludicrous and, as I have said, it is an insult to my intelligence; it is an insult to my experience and qualifications that I should have to do this.  I will not delay the House on this matter.  I reluctantly brought it up because of the unsatisfactory nature of the reply and the unwillingness to have the matter investigated as a matter of urgency.  As I have said, that patient of mine will never need it again, no matter what decision the Minister makes in this case.</P>
      <P>However, unfortunately it arises often in cases of old people and I think we are being small-minded if we think people might abuse it.  This product would give old age pensioners a protein supplement.  It is for the benefit of old age pensioners who are medical card holders.  It costs between £56 and £112 per week to keep such a patient in hospital for treatment of the same condition.  It makes a laughing stock of the regulations and of the Minister's decision and I should like to know now what the Minister and his officials will do in the light of this.  I would ask the Minister whether I should bother to keep patients out of hospital when I meet situations like this, or should I just disregard the whole thing and admit them to hospital at £112 per week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief. Years ago I remember reading one of those intellectual articles by the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in which he stated that one of <Col N="1334" /> the characteristics of this country which would probably die a sudden death was our sympathy for people&mdash;that sympathy would probably die with increasing provision for under-priviledged people, people in bad health, people in bad social and economic circumstances.  When I read that I was perturbed because if there was one aspect of life in this country which I had hoped would live and survive it was that of sympathy with the sick, with people in difficulties of one kind or another, whether through their own fault or outside their fault, whether for reasons for which they could be exculpated or for reasons in which they were culpable.</P>
      <P>When Deputy O'Connell made his case about a person who was suffering from what he called terminal cancer, &ldquo;terminal&rdquo; being a shocking word as far as we who are concerned with the living are concerned, I thought this was the case of &ldquo;Bumbledom&rdquo; at its worst, officialdom applying rules and regulations to the detriment of persons who will not be long in this life.  A person with a medical card apparently cannot take solid food.  A certain substitute for solid food was prescribed by a qualified medical practitioner who happens also to be a Member of this House.  I am sure he is not taking this case up other than as something between himself and his patient.  This was not allowed under the regulations. I think there is enough humanity in the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary to waive the rules and to accede to the request by Deputy O'Connell.</P>

      <P>I do not say it would be abused by any doctor because I do not think any doctor would behave in that way. Neither do I deny any doctor the right to prescribe.  Deputy O'Connell has the qualifications, he knows the law as far as medicines are concerned and he and other doctors, in my view, should be allowed to prescribe in accordance with the laws.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no disagreement on this matter with Deputies O'Connell and Wilson.  I am not one to quote the law and stick to it rigidly, but under the 1970 Health Act, section 59, only drugs and medicines can be prescribed.  It is not possible for me to have a product like that referred to by the Deputy prescribed as a drug or a medicine because all the evidence I have is to the effect that it is not <Col N="1336" /> a drug or a medicine.  It is a food. The practice up to this, as far as I know, has been that if a doctor recommends this particular product it can be made available through the health boards, through home assistance officers or through public health nurses.</P>
      <P>I know people regard it as a stigma to have to go to home assistance officers, although we must appreciate the importance in the community of home assistance officers.  I said this is a food and I made some inquiries.  I sent some of my officials to make investigations in order to make it abundantly clear to me that the reply which I was giving to Deputy O'Connell, in private and in public, would be in accordance with the information that was given.  This product is described on the packet as a milk-based balanced food.  In the advertisements it is described as a meal in a cup.  No matter what it is, it is available through the health boards and recently the Eastern Health Board made a special financial allocation to ensure that this product would be made available to people such as those described by Deputy O'Connell.</P>
      <P>In the Eastern Health Board public health nurses visit such persons as have been mentioned and if it is decided by the doctor or if it is the opinion of the public health nurse that this product should be given and it is the only one that could be consumed and digested then it is freely given.  Many cases which might heretofore be referred to assistance officers will be covered now without reference to head office.</P>
      <P>I understand the concern of Deputy Dr. O'Connell and the concern of Deputy Wilson.  I also have a deep concern for people like this but I do not want to be, and I will not be, put in a position where it is inferred that I have been responsible for suffering or anything else as far as any person is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So, therefore, where the doctor is of opinion that this product or similar products are absolutely necessary to a <Col N="1337" /> patient I give this guarantee as far as all the health boards are concerned because I will see the CEOs next week about it to give them strict instructions that where this is recommended by a doctor it will be made freely and quickly available.  That is as much as I can do within the law, but if I think <Col N="1338" /> there is occasion to change the Act of 1970 to provide for what is suggested here I will have no hesitation in doing that.</P>
