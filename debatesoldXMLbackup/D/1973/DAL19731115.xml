      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;  In accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, the Bill proposes to fix the total number of members of Dáil Éireann and to revise the Dáil constituencies in order to take account of the increase in population and of the changes in the distribution of population recorded by the census taken in April, 1971.  As the House is aware, the census showed that the population of the State had increased by 3.3 per cent since the previous census in 1966.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill contains a summary of the provisions of the Bill and, in particular, of the provisions of the Schedule which sets out the description of the proposed new constituencies. In order to facilitate the House in considering these provisions, maps illustrating the new constituencies have been prepared by the Ordnance Survey and are available for inspection in the Oireachtas Library.  I have also arranged to have copies of smaller scale maps circulated <Col N="1984" /> to each member of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>At the outset, I would like to refer briefly to a number of matters on which I am satisfied that there is general agreement.  In the first place there is the question of the necessity for a revision of constituencies at this stage having regard to the fact that the last revision took place in 1969.  The Constitution places on the Oireachtas an obligation to revise the constituencies at least once in every 12 years.  It also provides that the ratio between the number of members to be elected at any time for each constituency and the population of each constituency shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country.  It appears to be generally accepted that these provisions mean that it is not sufficient to have equality of representation at the time of the 12-yearly review, and this equality must, as far as practicable, exist at all times and that a revision of constituencies must take place whenever a completed census shows a significant change in the distribution of population.  This was the view of successive Fianna Fáil governments and before going out of office the last Fianna Fáil government were, in fact, preparing a constituency revision.  My predecessor announced this in the Dáil on 16th November, 1972, and the former Taoiseach also referred to impending legislation on this subject on 26th October.  In bringing forward a constituency revision Bill at this stage, therefore, we are continuing a process already started by the previous Government and there can, therefore, be no disagreement on this point.</P>
    <P>Next, there is the question of what constitutes equality of representation, in other words what variation from the national average population/Deputy ratio may be regarded as permissible. The courts have not laid down precise limits on this and until they do it is possible to hold different opinions on it.  Fianna Fáil governments took the view from their reading of the constitutional provisions and of the court decisions in the early 1960s that the maximum permissible variation was 1,000 above or below the national average and these limits were adhered to in the 1961 and 1969 revisions.  In <Col N="1985" /> order to obviate any possibility of having the new constituencies challenged in the courts, the Government decided that we would also adhere to these limits for the purpose of drawing up the present proposals.</P>
    <P>Another matter on which I am sure there will be general agreement is the question of the total membership of the Dáil.  Section 2 of the Bill provides that the total number of Members after the next dissolution will be 148. This is an increase of four over present representation and is the maximum number permissible under the Constitution.  As the House is aware, it has been the practice at previous revisions to provide for the maximum number of Dáil Deputies by having a population/Deputy ratio as close as possible to the minimum of 20,000 persons laid down by the Constitution.  It will also be recalled that the Dáil Committee on the Constitution which reported in 1967 considered that the upper limit of 30,000 persons per Deputy specified by the Constitution had lost its significance and that a range of 20,500 to 17,500 would be more realistic.  My own view is that it is very important to have the maximum possible number of Deputies, particularly since the House must now deal not only with the full range of domestic policy and legislation, but also with developments in the European Communities.</P>
    <P>Sections 3 and 4 of the Bill provide for the specification of the new constituencies and for the number of Members to be elected in respect of each.  The remaining sections contain the usual consequential provisions about the return of the outgoing Ceann Comhairle without a contest and for the necessary rearrangement of the headings of the register of electors and alterations of polling schemes, where these are affected by the revision.</P>
    <P>The real meat of the Bill is, of course, contained in the Schedule which sets out the descriptions of the new constituencies.  Apart from the requirement in relation to equality of representation, the only stipulation laid down by the Constitution is that <Col N="1986" /> no constituency may return less than three Members.  In theory, therefore, the Oireachtas could decide to have three seat, four seat, ten seat or 20 seat constituencies or could make the whole State a single constituency.  It is clear, however, that there is general satisfaction with the present size of constituency which varies from three to five seats and that there is no desire to return to the larger type of constituency which we had in the early days of the State.  For this reason the present pattern of representation in three seat, four seat and five seat constituencies is being continued.</P>
    <P>Again, the Oireachtas could decide to wipe the map clean and draw up new constituencies without any regard to the existing situation.  This is neither very practicable nor desirable, and any revision of constituencies must take account not only of the constitutional requirements but also of the size and shapes of existing constituencies, of local administrative boundaries and of physical features. It is particularly desirable that the historic county boundaries should be preserved as far as possible and that natural communities should not be divided between different constituencies. In practice, these considerations may be incompatible with one another in certain cases and in such cases a choice must be made.</P>
    <P>It must also be borne in mind that there are four additional seats to be allocated and that in 27 of the existing constituencies the population/ Deputy ratio is outside the permitted limits.  Fairly widespread departures from the existing scheme of constituencies were, therefore, inevitable. Even when account is taken of those factors which effectively limit the range of options available, there are still very many ways in which the constituencies could be revised.  It has been said that if each Deputy were given the job of drawing up the constituencies we would end up with 144 entirely different schemes.</P>
    <P>It fell to my lot as Minister for Local Government to draw up proposals for new constituencies and to submit them for the approval of the <Col N="1987" /> House.  In drawing up the proposals my objective was first of all to ensure fair and reasonable representation for the people of every area.  This is what the Constitution requires.  Secondly as I have already stated, I endeavoured as far as possible to avoid breaching existing administrative boundaries and tried to ensure that natural communities were not split, unnecessarily, between different constituencies.  I hope I have succeeded in these objectives and that the proposals will find general acceptance in this House and in the country at large.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government who introduced this Bill should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves.  It is the most shameful piece of gerrymandering that has been carried out in any part of the country at any time.  In my view, the words of the Minister are an expression of extreme hypocrisy.  He stated:</P>
      <P>... I endeavoured as far as possible to avoid breaching existing administrative boundaries and tried to ensure that natural communities were not split, unnecessarily, between different constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite clear to anyone who has taken time to study the Bill that no attempt whatever was made to take heed of the existing administrative boundaries.  The House and the country are fully aware that this Bill is a deliberate, ruthless gerrymander of the constituencies.  It is a gerrymander because the Government have sought to obtain maximum party advantage for the Coalition parties and have done their utmost to cause as much damage as possible to Fianna Fáil.  The Coalition promise before the election that they were going to be a government of reform is now clearly seen as false.  All the fine-sounding phrases, the high ideals expounded by Coalition speakers and written into their policy documents and their 14-point plan, is now seen to have been nothing but a facade. The great electoral hoodwink that took place on 28th February has been maintained to a certain degree since <Col N="1988" /> by the subtle use of the great propaganda machine.</P>
    <P>When the Government were elected we were led to believe they would immediately devote all their attention to devising legislation that would introduce major reforms in the social and economic structure of the country.  We were promised legislation aimed at humanising society.  It was put across that the Coalition could do things in a better, a more fair and more humane way than Fianna Fáil. There was a promise that consultation, co-operation and more open government would be the order of the day; all of these were praiseworthy objectives and Fianna Fáil subscribed to them.</P>
    <P>What has happened since 14th March?  Instead of the diligent application by Ministers to the task of reform legislation, we know their first move was the creation of a massive propaganda machine.  Indeed, one could say they tried to devise the nearest thing they could get to the Nazi propaganda machine established by Hitler.  If I may go so far as to say, they sought the nearest thing they could find to Hitler's Dr. Goebbels in putting Dr. Conor Cruise-O'Brien in charge of this machine&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They have been selling the message that the Coalition do no wrong.  All the faults are being covered up and the people are allowed to see and read only what the Government deem favourable.  That is the position into which we are moving and <Col N="1989" /> it is only fair now, after seven months of this Government, to take a look at the results of their labours on reforming legislation.  The only piece of legislation introduced since March 14th is this measure designed to cement the Coalition parties in power for a very, very long time.  This is the first major piece of legislation we have from the present Government.  The Government who promised reform have revised the constituencies in such a way that they themselves will gain the advantage.  The Long Title of the Bill reads as follows:</P>
      <P>An act to provide for the number of Members of Dáil Éireann and for the revision of constituencies and to amend the law relating to the election of such Members.</P>
      <P>Anyone who looks at the work carried out and the legislation introduced since March, who is any way <i>au fait</i> with political affairs and with statements made by the previous Government and the work of Ministers in that Government, cannot but honestly admit that most of the legislation introduced since March was legislation prepared by the previous Administration.</P>

      <P>Not at all.  Let us come to the Bill now and let us examine it to see if the fair and just minds of the Coalition Government, as they promised, have been applied to it.  We must, first of all, consider the attitude of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties prior to their assuming office.  In Opposition, both the Fine Gael and the Labour Party spokesmen stated that constituency revision should be carried out only by a commission constituted of independent persons.  If I may confirm that that, in fact, was their attitude, I will quote from volume 237 of column 1263 of the Official Report where the then Labour Deputy, Deputy Treacy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to make any reference to you, Sir.  The spokesman for the Labour Party at that time and for quite a while, as the Minister well knows, now occupies the Chair.  It is very inconvenient when the Chair will not allow me to quote what was said then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is flouting the ruling of the Chair and deliberately seeking to involve the Chair in debate.  I must ask him to desist from any further reference to the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point is made.  It was clearly expounded by both the Labour and Fine Gael Parties that revision of this kind should not be carried out by the Government.  I and the people at large are now entitled to ask whether or not the Fine Gael and Labour Party spokesmen at that time were sincere in the views they expressed. If they were genuine and sincere then in demanding that such revision should be carried out only by a commission, a commission, they suggested, presided over by an independent person, we are now entitled to ask why, when they assumed Office, they did not carry out this method of revising constituencies.  It is quite fair to question their sincerity then or their sincerity now.  On both scores their sincerity <Col N="1991" /> cannot stand.  Shortly after his appointment the Minister was interviewed by an interviewer from Radio Telefís Éireann and, if my memory serves me correctly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will know when I repeat what was said whether or not it is true.  He was asked if, now that he is Minister for Local Government responsible for the revision of constituencies, he will avail of this opportunity to revise the constituencies to the advantage of his own party and the Minister's reply is quite clear: he certainly would not. He would make only such alterations as were necessary to the existing constituencies in order to comply with the requirements of the Constitution and the changes in the distribution of population as were evidenced from the 1971 Census.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

      <P>It is in the Bill in front of the Deputy, but he does not recognise it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is roughly what the Minister said.  When one looks at the Bill now one sees immediately that the words of the Minister then are not borne out by the actions of the Minister since.  It would not have taken so long to revise the constituencies if the Minister were to do as he promised.  It is common knowledge in this House and common knowledge throughout the country through the media&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy did not like the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that quite an amount of hugger-muggering and secret meetings went on between the Minister and the Fine Gael and the Labour Parties and between individual Deputies in each of those parties trying to ensure that they were satisfied with the way in which the <Col N="1992" /> Minister was doing the revision.  They, and they alone, and nobody else outside of those two parties, were consulted.</P>
      <P>The Minister on numerous occasions when questioned as to how he would tackle the revision of constituencies expressed as his personal view, his personal wish and his personal determination, that county boundaries should be restored as far as practicable. We see from the Bill that this is not what has happened.  I should like now to quote from Volume 237, column 1817 of the Official Report. The Minister, speaking here in Opposition on that occasion said:</P>
      <P>... I do not care what any Member of the House says.  I have a personal view on this.  I believe that county boundaries are important just as I believe that the national boundary is important and I would not agree that somebody who lives in County Meath would be happy being attached to another county ...</P>
      <P>Later on in the same column Deputy Tully said:</P>
      <P>I do not agree, therefore, that county boundaries should be sundered. The Minister has a sin to answer for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister on that occasion had a sin to answer for in the view of Deputy Tully then Deputy Tully himself has a much larger sin to answer for in view of his own actions when charged with responsibility for revising the constituencies.  It is quite clear that there has been a blatant attempt to gain party advantage on the part of the Coalition parties, but in particular to the advantage of the Labour Party.  Of course the revision has been carried out by a Labour Minister. When one looks at the new boundaries laid down one cannot find any logical explanation for the manner in which they have been drawn.  They follow no pattern in relation to size in the different areas and many of the accepted norms have been thrown out the window.  The small constituency in rural areas was the norm for the very obvious reason that it covered a much <Col N="1993" /> larger area and had topographical features which made it that much more difficult for constituents to get in touch with their Deputies.</P>
    <P>In rural constituencies, long journeys are involved in nearly all cases. To suit the constituents it has been accepted that smaller constituencies generally are more suitable.  It seems fairly obvious that that should be so and that in the more densely populated areas such as Dublin city one should go for larger constituencies because constituents live quite close together and would not have to travel very far to make contact with their elected representative.  No matter what part of the constituency he lived in it would be a very short journey.  For that reason it was accepted by most people that it was only right, as far as possible, to go for the larger constituencies in densely populated areas and to go for smaller constituencies in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Another immediate reaction on looking at this Bill is in regard to the national average.  The national average is 20,123 and the interpretation of the court ruling has been that a Minister is deemed to be operating in a constitutional manner if he stays within a limit of 1,000 over that figure or 1,000 under that figure.  It was always accepted that one could rightly go below that national average in drawing up constituencies in rural areas and that one should exceed it in the more densely populated areas.  There has been a complete reversal of that trend in the drawing up of the constituencies contained in the schedule to this Bill and there is no logical, reasonable explanation for it.  It cannot be justified on any grounds.  It is unfair from a Government that promised to be fair, it is unjust from a Government that promised justice, that it should take more persons in rural Ireland&mdash; I am thinking of the west of Ireland in particular&mdash;to elect a Deputy than in Dublin city.</P>
    <P>It is very clear on an initial examination of this Bill that a very cruel blow has been suffered by the west of Ireland at the hands of the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <Col N="1994" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The area of Donegal, Clare and Connacht has been reduced from 30 seats to 28 seats.  There is a direct loss of two seats to that part of Ireland.  Of course the west of Ireland is now getting used to second-class treatment from this Government.  From the very first day that the Taoiseach announced his Cabinet it was clear that the west of Ireland was the forgotten land.  He did not choose to have at the Cabinet table any Deputy elected by the people of the west of Ireland.  The message has gone home very clearly to the people in the west that they cannot look to this Government for help or for special consideration for the very special problems they have in that part of Ireland.  The neglect has been seen in the operations of various Departments and can be dealt with at Estimate time.  Of course the Minister never told the House that the area Donegal to Clare, plus Connacht, leaving in the Athlone urban west area, which had been included in it, had sufficient population to retain 30 Deputies and still remain within the constitutional limits as defined by the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in his speech, set what he considers some of the background to the scene, the guidelines that were laid down and the position obtaining after the census.  The Constitution, of course, has laid down quite clearly the position in regard to the selection of the number of Deputies and the courts have interpreted the ratio there shall be between the number of Deputies and the population.  The Minister had the High Court decision and the Supreme Court judgments before him and these have been accepted and recognition is given in the Minister's speech to the necessity to take into consideration, when redrawing constituencies, the existing constituencies.  He spoke about the size and the shapes of existing constituencies as being a factor that must be taken into consideration.  The House knows that the High Court ruled that the 1959 revision was unconstitutional, but that it suggested that a deviation of 1,000 persons would be acceptable. <Col N="1995" /> The 1961 revision was referred to the Supreme Court and was found to be constitutional, but that revision did not contain any deviation greater than 1,000.  It is important that the House should remember that although the Minister is quoting the figure of 1,000 over or under the national average the Supreme Court on that occasion declined to indicate what variations on the national average would be regarded as permissible.  It is important to remember that, although I accept that it has been the practice to accept a variation of 1,000.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the census figures in Volume 1 of the report of the 1971 Census of Population, one immediately recognises that there were two options open to the Minister. He could have retained the existing number of seats, 144, or he could have gone for the maximum, 148, which the increased population figures would allow.  As it had been the practice to go for the maximum figure, he has done that.  It is no harm to speculate as to what would have happened if the Minister had not chosen to increase the number of seats by four.  The Dublin area, that is Dublin City and County, including Dún Laoghaire, if the Minister had decided not to increase the number of seats, would have got at least two more Deputies, the west would have lost one Deputy and the other regions would have been able to retain the existing representation, but the second seat would have had to be found somewhere; there would have to be an adjustment in those other constituencies.</P>
    <P>The Minister elected to go for 148 seats and in so doing he was obliged to give a minimum of three extra Deputies to the Dublin area.  On the figures published in the Census the west could retain its existing representation: the population there would be sufficient but all the constituencies in the area would require alterations. The other regions could retain existing representation and the fourth seat could be added to any of them.  That was more or less the position as the Minister found it when he took up <Col N="1996" /> office.  Later, we shall see what the Minister, in fact, did.</P>
    <P>The 1971 Census, Volume 1, published in July, 1972, gives the total population of the country as 2,978,248. In going for the higher number of seats, 148, there would be a national average per Deputy of 20,123.  Accepting the norm now of 1,000 up or down the minimum number with which one could elect a Deputy would be 19,123 and the maximum number, 21,123. The position as the Minister found it was that there were 30 seats in the west, 40 seats in Munster, excluding Clare; 17 seats in South Leinster, 19 in North Leinster and 38 in the Dublin area.  In referring to South Leinster and North Leinster I am referring to the areas as defined by the Minister in his explanatory memorandum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, there is a bit of Ulster, naturally.  Various options were open to the Minister and these should be put on record.  On the basis of a Dáil membership of 144&mdash;this option was still available to the Minister&mdash; a number of constituencies could have retained their existing representation although many of them would have been affected by the position in neighbouring constituencies.  There would not have been any great need to have changed the following constituencies &mdash;and the Minister did say he was taking heed of existing constituencies as he found them before he introduced this Bill and these are still existing constituencies until the Bill is passed and until there is a general election &mdash; Carlow/Kilkenny, Clare, Cork City North West, Cork City South East, Mid-Cork, North-East Cork, South-West Cork, North-East Donegal, Dublin North West, Dublin South Central, West Galway, East Limerick, Monaghan, Sligo/Leitrim and Wexford.  These 15 constituencies could have retained existing representation. The others would have been either too small and require topping-up or too large and population would have had to be ceded to neighbouring constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister chose to go for 148 <Col N="1997" /> seats and the following constituencies could then have retained their existing representation although again some would have been affected by the position in neighbouring constituencies. Generally speaking, 21 constituencies need not have been altered or substantially altered, and would require only very minor adjustment: Carlow/Kilkenny, Cavan, Clare, Mid-Cork, North-East Cork, South-West Cork, North-East Donegal, Dublin South Central, Dublin South West, West Galway, North Kerry, Laois/Offaly, East Limerick, West Limerick, Longford/ Westmeath, Monaghan, Roscommon/ Leitrim, Sligo/Leitrim, North Tipperary, South Tipperary and Wexford. This will be a long, slow Bill; the Minister should not be in any hurry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in no hurry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>All those constituencies could have retained their existing representation. Some of the others would have been too small and others too large and would require alteration. That generally is the position as the Minister found it.  Take the western area, which is the one the Minister has taken first in the Explanatory Memorandum. The population in the west following that census was 578,039.  The number of Deputies was 30.  If one were to retain the 30 seats the average per Deputy would be 19,267, which the Minister will accept is above the constitutional minimum.  I am including the west urban area in Athlone with Connacht, Clare and Donegal, because these are in the constituencies as they existed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the basis of 148 Members, five of those constituencies would be too small. The five were Clare-South Galway, Donegal/Leitrim, North East Galway, East Mayo, West Mayo.  The remainder would have had sufficient spare population. Between them there was sufficient population to elect 30 Deputies. Of course, changes would have been required between the different constituencies as they existed, but the area as an entity had sufficient population to elect 30 Deputies.  But the Coalition Government decided that the representation in the west should be reduced from 30 to 28 despite the fact that it is <Col N="1998" /> constitutionally allowable to create 30 seats in that area, as it has at present.</P>
    <P>The population of the Munster area is 806,994 and the number of Deputies was 40.  On the basis of 148 Members the Constitution would allow a maximum of 42 or a minimum of 39.  The Minister has chosen to retain the representation in Munster at 40 whereas he could have increased it to 42 and remain within the constitutional limits.  On the basis of 148 Members one of the constituencies in Munster, South Kerry, would have been too small to retain three seats, but could easily have been topped up by transfers.  Each of the Cork city constituencies would be in excess of the number required to retain three seats but it would not have been a very difficult job for the Minister to have had that excess taken up in an adjoining constituency within the County of Cork.</P>
    <P>In the south-east area the population was 345,444.  The number of Deputies was 17.  The average would be 20,320.  Within the constitutional limits, on the basis of 148 Members, that would allow a maximum of 18 and a minimum of 17.  As it was the south-east the Minister decided he would opt for the minimum and allocated only 17 Deputies to that area, which comprises the Carlow-Kilkenny, Laois-Offaly, Wexford and Wicklow areas.</P>
    <P>When one comes to the Dublin area one sees that the total population there was 852,219.  The existing number of Deputies is 38.  The average per Deputy would be 22,427, which would have been above the maximum allowable under the Constitution, but which would have allowed for a maximum number of Deputies of 44 or a minimum number of Deputies of 41.  That is the range within which the Minister would have been within the constitutional requirements.</P>
    <P>The North Leinster population was given at 395,552 and the number of Deputies was 19.  The average per Deputy would be 20,819.  The Minister could have retained the number of Deputies at 19 as it was within the <Col N="1999" /> allowable limits, but the Minister chose to add an extra seat in this area, which includes the existing constituencies of Cavan, Kildare, Longford-Westmeath, Louth, Monaghan and Meath, where, of course, the Minister has a seat.  Why the bonus in that area and why deprive the western area of two seats&mdash;a question which the Minister will be asked to answer on numerous occasions over the next few months.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said in his introductory statement, the House does accept that a revision is necessary at this time.  We in the Opposition recognise the legal framework within which the Minister must operate.  I have already referred to it.  We accept that in order to comply with the legal requirements and the interpretations of the Constitution handed down to us by our courts it is necessary to revise the constituencies.  There is agreement on that.  The Minister was right in assuming that there would be. Where there is not agreement is with regard to the Minister's assertion that he has tried as far as possible to retain the county boundaries.  He implied in a number of sentiments that he expressed that he had tried to restore them.  That would be regarded as commendable but, on looking at the Bill, I wonder was the Minister sincere or does he believe that the Bill is so complicated that nobody will take a proper look at it and decide whether or not he has made any attempt to retain the county boundaries.</P>
    <P>It is all right to make statements, but the Bill is now published and the Minister's handiwork is available to anybody who wants to examine it.  The Bill cannot be altered unless amendments are introduced and accepted by the House.  I am afraid the sentiments expressed by the Minister have been exposed to the naked light of day and the people can make their own judgment as to whether or not the Minister made any attempt to retain the county boundaries.</P>

      <P>There are 42 constituencies drawn up by the Minister, 14 of which are in County Dublin. Mid-County Dublin includes part of Wicklow; South County Dublin includes part of Wicklow and West County Dublin includes part of Kildare.  So, even in the Dublin area the Minister has crossed county boundaries, Wicklow twice and Kildare once.</P>
      <P>The Minister has allocated four constituencies to Cork.  To mid-Cork he has added part of South Kerry.  So, apart from the 14 constituencies in County Dublin where he has crossed county boundaries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Longford-Westmeath&mdash;two counties together&mdash;is also breaching his principle.  In Louth there is the administrative county of Louth and part of Monaghan again a breaching of county boundaries.  In East Mayo there is the administrative county of Mayo except that part of the constituency of West Mayo and part of Roscommon.  Need I continue to show that in most cases there are breached county boundaries? The Minister is not honest in claiming <Col N="2002" /> anything else.  Why not be honest and admit it?</P>
      <P>In the Minister's own constituency of Meath there is the administrative county of Meath; plus the parts of the administrative county of Kildare, named in the Schedule.  In Roscommon-Leitrim there is the administrative county of Roscommon, except the part which is comprised in the constituency of East Mayo.  The Minister also adds the administrative county of Leitrim, except the part thereof which is comprised in the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim. It is getting more complicated now.</P>
      <P>In the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, there is the administrative county of Sligo; and in the administrative county of Donegal the district electoral divisions which are given in the Schedule including the urban district of Bundoran, which is well into Donegal; and, in the administrative county of Leitrim, various rural districts and electoral divisions there.</P>
      <P>In Wexford there is the administrative county of Wexford, except that part which is comprised in the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny.  In Wicklow there is the administrative county of Wicklow, except the parts which are comprised in the constituencies of Mid-County Dublin and South County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is evident from the above that county boundaries have been crisscrossed. I submit that it is misleading to make the claim that any serious attempt was made to comply with the county boundaries.  The worst examples of this breaching of county boundaries has been where Cavan and Monaghan were removed as separate entities and put together; putting Clare into Galway, Roscommon into Mayo, Kildare into Meath, Kildare into Dublin, Wicklow into Dublin and Monaghan into Louth.  Where in this Schedule do we find the fulfilment of the many promises made by numerous Fine Gael spokesmen in this House and outside it to restore the county of Leitrim as a separate electoral entity?  No attempt whatsoever. It is interesting to see the statements issued by spokesmen in relation to <Col N="2003" /> Leitrim when crocodile tears were being shed.  First, I should like to quote from a report which appeared in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> on the 1st December, 1968 of a Labour Party convention held in Ennis and presided over by Deputy B. Desmond:</P>
    <P>Grave dissatisfaction was expressed by delegates at the mutilation of Clare under the new Electoral Act and it was agreed to stage public demonstrations against the &ldquo;butchering&rdquo; of the constituency. It was also decided to ask the Parliamentary Labour Party to table an amendment to the Bill asking that Clare be allowed to retain its four seats in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Now Deputy B. Desmond's colleague introduces a revision of the Constituencies Bill and completely ignores the motion passed by the Labour Party at their convention in Ennis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to quote from the Official Report, vol. 237, col. 1247, when tears were being shed for Leitrim.  Deputy Fitzpatrick <i>(Cavan)</i>, now Minister for Lands said:</P>
      <P>... and Leitrim, in pursuance of the terrible warning by the Taoiseach in Drumshanbo and the Minister here in this House, had to be driven off the political map...</P>
      <P>He spoke about persons presiding at the wake of Leitrim, at the obliteration of Leitrim from the political map.  These sentiments were meant to convey the impression to the people of Leitrim that if he or his party were given the opportunity they would restore Leitrim as an electoral entity. As we can see from this Bill, no attempt has been made by the Coalition Government to restore the position in Leitrim.  I could probably find other occasions where crocodile tears were shed for Leitrim by Coalition spokesmen.  I had intended quoting from a speech made by the present Ceann Comhairle when he was in Opposition but was ruled out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2004" /> It should be obvious, even to the most impartial observer, that no attempt was made to restore each county as a unit.  If the constituencies have not been restored to their county units, if there is no pattern in the manner in which the revision has been carried out, if the accepted norms in relation to the application of the national average have been reversed, if the trend in relation to smaller constituencies in rural areas has been reversed, we are entitled to ask why these changes have taken place.  These broad principles have been generally applied and accepted.  It is obvious that the changes were made for one reason and one reason only, that is, for party advantage.  Would the Minister admit that the changes made in the Bill have been for the purpose of gaining advantage for the Labour and Fine Gael parties.</P>

      <P>I see.  I want to quote onto the record an article written by Deputy Garret FitzGerald, who is now Minister for Foreign Affairs in this Coalition Government, in which he expounds in detail on the techniques he believes can be employed to gerrymander constituencies in the Republic. He says in this article which was printed in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 12th November, 1972:</P>
      <P>For fifty years, Unionist control of local government in Northern Ireland was extended far beyond the areas where Unionists secured a majority of votes.  This was done by gerrymandering&mdash;by rigging constituency boundaries in such a way as to convert a minority of votes into a majority of seats</P>
      <P>One of the main targets of the Civil Rights Campaign was a reform of the electoral system that would eliminate this practice and ensure a just and equitable drawing of constituency boundaries.  This demand was&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2005" /> There is a misprint there: &ldquo;conceded&rdquo; is left out, I take it.</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;local authority electoral boundaries have since been redrawn by a Boundaries Commissioner, Mr. F.A.L. Harrison, Q.C.  His adjudication is universally accepted as fair, and only minor changes in this proposed scheme have been proposed by any party.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs says:</P>
    <P>No one can fairly say that this electoral reform is not needed here, for the flagrant abuse of the power of a government majority to determine constituency boundaries in a manner designed to give the government party a share of seats disproportionate to its votes has been a striking feature of the political system in the Republic ...</P>
    <P>He said:</P>
    <P>If we were serious about creating in the Republic conditions that would encourage a decent Northern Protestant to look towards a prospect of eventual re-unification, we should, of course, have implemented all relevant Northern Ireland reforms here&mdash;and especially the electoral reform to abolish gerrymandering, which Northerners know all too well could be used against them in a united Ireland, as it was used for so long in Northern Ireland to deprive the minority there of its just representation in parliament or in local authorities.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs goes on:</P>
    <P>Nothing has, in fact, been done to change our corrupt system of constituency manipulation ...</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has been seven months in Government and he has done nothing to change what he considers to be a corrupt system of constituency manipulation. Instead, he sat at the Government table which approved this Bill which has been brought before the House and which, in his very own words, <Col N="2006" /> has been drawn up under a corrupt system.</P>
    <P>Since he is Minister for Foreign Affairs, and in view of the sentiments he has expressed in relation to what he deems to be the genuine fears of the Northern Protestant because of the continuation of this system of drawing up constituencies in the Republic, he should have raised his voice and he should not have been a party to this constituency manipulation gerrymander Bill.  His words for this Bill are that it is a corrupt constituency manipulation Bill.  That is the description given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  He is the Minister most concerned with affairs relating to our relationship with the 6-county area, the community there and the community down here, and he is charged by the Taoiseach with working towards achieving re-unification on behalf of the community. He holds the appropriate and the responsible portfolio.  Yet he made no attempt to influence a change and he is not on record anywhere as condemning this corrupt constituency manipulation Bill which has been brought in here by his colleagues.</P>
    <P>He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>... no Northern Protestant in his senses would commit himself to re-unification with a Tammany Hall State such as we have preserved here ...</P>
    <P>Later on in the article, in explaining how he feels gerrymandering is possible under the system of constituency revision or manipulation which is carried out here, he says:</P>
    <P>What is important, what in fact determined the choice of party in power in defiance of the wishes of the electorate in 1969, is the selection by the ruling party of the sizes of constituencies in different parts of the country where it has different shares of the popular vote.</P>
    <P>He goes on to show how that can be done.  Of course, the Minister for Local Government paid lip-service in his introductory statement to the fact that he had considered the existing constituencies and that they should be interfered with as little as possible. <Col N="2007" /> He paid very little heed to the existing constituencies.  He paid most heed to the philosophy of the Minister for Foreign Affairs that anybody who is charged with drawing up a revision of the constituencies should decide the size of the constituencies in order to gain the maximum party advantage and that the selective placing of different sized constituencies is the way gerrymandering can be carried out.</P>

The firm belief of the Coalition Parties in bringing this Bill before the House is that they can increase substantially the number of seats they will obtain at the first general election held after this revision, if this Bill goes through, and that the manner in which they can achieve that substantial increase is the careful siting of the different sized constituencies. That is the view expressed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in his article.  It is known generally to be the view of the Coalition Parties and it is now known to be a fact that this is what they have done.</P>
      <P>When one looks at the structure of the constituencies, one sees there are six five-seaters, ten four-seaters and 26 three-seaters.  If the revision had been carried out in a fair manner, there should have been a logical pattern in the manner in which the different size constituencies were laid out.  One would have expected a pattern of larger constituencies in the densely populated areas and smaller constituencies in sparsely populated areas but that pattern is not evident.  The only consideration has been how best to divide the constituencies to gain advantage for the Coalition parties, and in particular for the Labour Party as it was a Labour Minister who carried out the revision.  County Donegal is now to elect five Deputies although formerly it had six.  However, by careful manipulation, that area and other parts of the west have been reduced by two&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The five-seat constituency in Donegal covers an area of 1,169,319 acres.  If the Minister ever travelled in that part of the country, he will be aware of the topographical features, of the great difficulty in travelling from one part of Donegal to another because of the mountains, the lakes and various other physical features.  Much of the journeying in the Donegal area can be tortuous and exceptionally long.  Donegal Deputies who will speak on this Stage and on Committee Stage can go into this matter in greater detail but it is obvious that there is no logic in creating a five-seat constituency in Donegal, in creating a situation where a Deputy elected in Ballyshannon will have to travel to the upper end of the county&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would advise the Parliamentary Secretary to keep his cool because the Chair will give him an opportunity to speak on this Bill if he honestly thinks he can defend it.  There is a vast area involved, practically 1.2 million acres, but Donegal will get only five seats.  I am trying to show there is no logical pattern in this revision.  In the Ballyfermot constituency it is proposed to have three seats and the same number of seats in the Dublin Rathmines West constituency.  This area has an acreage of less than 9,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is well known that it takes more votes in a rural area to elect a Deputy than in a city area.  If there was logic in having a five-seater in Cork city, why not five-seaters in Dublin city?  The argument put forward for having smaller constituencies in Dublin cannot stand when one considers Cork; neither can the argument for having five-seaters in Cork be taken seriously when one considers what has been done in Dublin. <Col N="2010" /> If there is logic in having three-seaters in Dublin, there is no logic in having five-seaters in Cork.  The latter area had two three-seat constituencies, similar to what the Minister is trying to do in Dublin.  The people will not be fooled into thinking that this is a straightforward, honest endeavour, with no attempt to gain party advantage. It is so clear the Minister may regret later having attempted this revision in such a blatant way.  The public are fair-minded and are capable of seeing what is happening. If they see that fair play is not being given&mdash;I submit it is not because there is no pattern in the manner in which constituencies have been laid out&mdash;they will question it and make up their own minds.  They will give the Minister and his party their answer when they get an opportunity at the next election.  As the Minister well knows, the public will have more than this one excuse to vote against the Coalition parties; they will have hundreds of other excuses as is evident from the way the country has been sliding backwards in the last few months.</P>
      <P>Can the Minister state why he put a five seater in mid-Cork, a good rural area, and why he put two three-seaters in Mayo, another good rural area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the kind of glib answer we will get, I do not think the Minister expects anyone to believe him.  The constituency of west Galway has traditionally been a three-seater but he has chosen to increase it to four.  We all recall that in 1968 the Labour Party in Clare, led by Deputy Desmond, were shedding tears because Clare did not have a four-seat constituency.  Perhaps at that time the Labour Party thought there <Col N="2011" /> was some advantage to them in having a four-seater in Clare.  Obviously, things have changed and the Minister's party may now think they would have a better chance of picking up an extra seat if west Galway were made a four-seater.  We have this extraordinary lumping of a substantial part of Clare into west Galway.  I have not the exact number of persons being transferred from Clare to west Galway but I expect to have this data when we come to Committee Stage. However, I think it is in the region of 12,000 persons.  I do not know if the Minister has the figure available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The other alternative would be to lump 18,000 persons into Clare.  The Deputy should be able to count.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have needed only 7,000 or 8,000 to top up the figure to the national average.  What the Minister has done is to create a constituency that extends from Inishbofin on the north Connemara coast, through Galway city, around Galway Bay and beyond Lahinch to Hagg's Head, a journey of more than 120 miles.  There is nothing logical in what has been done.  The sentiments expressed about people living in areas and having similar interests have been completely false.  The community in that part of Clare do not travel to Galway.  Their market town is in the direction of Ennis&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This revision will be very hard to justify and the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary will hear a lot about it before the Bill goes through.  Political consideration was the only criterion in the Minister's mind when he drew up this Bill.  He has been seeking only an advantage for the Coalition.  Any person studying this in order to understand it must accept that fact.  One cannot but deem all the sentiments and views expressed by Coalition, Fine Gael and Labour spokesmen in the past in relation to the revision of constituencies <Col N="2012" /> as false.  They implied that had they been the people revising the constituencies then they would not be revised in the way in which they are set out in this Bill.  That was the impression given in numerous speeches which are all recorded in the Official Report.  The Official Report is full of statements supporting that argument and demonstrating the dismay at what they deemed were attempts to revise constituencies at that time to suit party political advantage.  They were the paragons of virtue but, as their Taoiseach said, their hands are now &ldquo;on the loot&rdquo; and they are obviously going to manipulate the loot whatever way they can to suit their own best advantage.</P>
      <P>Examples of this manipulation can be found in what has been done in Dublin.  The proposed revision is North County Dublin, three seats, population 59,514; Dublin/Cabra, three seats, population 59,314; Dublin/Clontarf, three seats, population 58,592; Dublin North-Central, three seats, population 58,357; Dublin South-East, three seats, population 57,875, making a total of 15 seats for a population of 293,652 persons.  Compare that with the following constituencies in the West; Sligo-Leitrim, three seats, population 63,030; Roscommon-Leitrim, three seats, population 63,358; East Galway, four seats, population 83,176; Donegal, five seats, population 105,509, making a total of 15 seats for a population of 315,073 persons.  In the Dublin area mentioned there is a total of 15 seats for 293,652 persons; in the western area mentioned there is a total of 315,073 for 15 seats.  There is a difference of 21,421 persons.  To elect 15 TDs in the five constituencies in Dublin you need 21,421 fewer people than it takes to elect a similar number of TDs in the Western constituencies I named.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note the difference is well above the national average&mdash;it is a quite sizeable difference&mdash;of 21,421.  There are enough people there to elect another TD in that area despite the fact that there are also other constituencies in the Western area which one could add on to that and show that, in fact, the <Col N="2013" /> West should have had two seats, could have had two seats, but has been denied two seats by the Minister and his Government.  The people in the West will revolt against this stab in the back.  Not alone has the dagger been thrust in by the Coalition in depriving the West of any representation at Cabinet level but the dagger is now being twisted in the backs of the people in depriving them unnecessarily in this revision of two seats.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This shameless political manipulation clearly indicates that the exercise is a political one for the purpose of gaining political advantage in whatever way the Minister thinks he can best gain it.  The Minister gives 43 seats in the Dublin area.  The average number of persons per Deputy for these 43 seats works out at 20,142.  The Minister had options open to him and the House should be told what the options were. I have given the options in relation to the West and it is only fair now to give them in relation to the Dublin area as set out in the supplementary memorandum.  The Minister could have given 45 seats which would have given an average of 19,247.  He could have given 44 seats with an average of 19,684.  He could have given 43 seats with an average of 20,142.  He could have given 42 seats with an average of 20,621.  He could have given 41 seats with an average of 21,124 which most people, I think, would have considered nearer to the wishes of the people and, bearing everything in mind, fairer and more just.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has striven to give 43 seats for an average population of 20,142 whereas in the area west of the Shannon he has given 28 seats and those 28 seats work out at an average of 20,509 per Deputy.  Why, in the name of God, a Minister paying lip service here and in Brussels and Strasbourg to the undeveloped areas should himself take steps to deprive these undeveloped areas of representation in the Dáil, something which it needs very <Col N="2014" /> badly, is something that beats me.  Why he should decide it would take more people in the West to elect a TD than it does in Dublin does not make sense to me or to anybody else in that part of the country.</P>
    <P>I would like to put it on record that in the 1971 census the population of Clare was given as 75,008, of Donegal as 108,344, of Connacht as 390,902 of the Athlone West urban area as 3,785, making a total of 578,039.  If one were to elect 30 Deputies in that area the average would be 19,267, well above the minimum allowed by the Constitution and by the Courts in their interpretation of the Constitution and in the guidelines they set down which, as we have already agreed, would have meant a minimum of 19,123 persons for the creation of a seat.  The western area would have been in excess of that minimum figure and still have had 30 Deputies, but the Minister has chosen to neglect the west, reduced its representation, weakened its voice and turned his back completely on that area, an area in which it is so much more difficult to make a living and, because of topographical difficulties and travel problems, to make progress and develop, and generally life is just that much harder for those living west of the Shannon.</P>

      <P>We will have a look at it again.  Multiply 20,142 by 43 and we will know who is right.  I was speaking about the west.  Perhaps that is why the Minister was trying to distract me.  I was making the point that it would have been possible to allocate 30 Deputies to that area and still remain above the minimum allowable according to the interpretation of the Constitution given by the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be naïve of me to suggest that there were any considerations other than the political ones in the Minister's mind when drawing up the constituencies.  I do not think anyone will believe him if he says anything else.  It would be much better to say it out than to claim otherwise.  Let us look at Cavan/Monaghan.  He expects that the Fianna Fáil Party will hold only three out of the five and he hopes they will lose a seat to Fine Gael.  He has made Clare a three-seater. He fears that in a four-seat <Col N="2016" /> constituency Fianna Fáil might get the third seat and if Fianna Fáil did not get it he knows Fine Gael would get it.  He does not seem to have much hope that the Labour Party would get it.  He thinks they might have a better chance by putting a lump of Clare in with Galway where they had a stronger candidate running on the last occasion with half a quota.</P>
    <P>When one looks at what the Minister has done in Cork City and compares it with what he has done in Dublin one can see what was in the Minister's mind.  Part of the old Cork constituency on the south side of the Lee, which is all urban and, in fact, includes some prominent public buildings in the city, including the university, has now been transferred from that urban constituency to a large rural constituency which stretches to the boundaries of County Limerick, creating a mammoth constituency of mid-Cork, a five-seater. There were obvious political reasons behind this.  The Minister was aware that in the existing Cork constituency Fianna Fáil returned four Deputies, Fine Gael returned two and the Labour Party were nowhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It was gerrymandered to achieve that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a poor show when the Minister has to manipulate these constituencies to try to create a seat for the waning fortunes of the Labour Party in Cork city.  He has made it a five-seater in the hope that Labour might scrape in in the fifth seat.  That is the reason behind it and let nobody deny it, least of all the Minister.</P>
      <P>The creation of a five-seat constituency in Donegal is expected to have more or less the same effect.  The Fianna Fáil Party in the existing constituency elected three.  Deputy Blaney was elected as an Independent and it is hoped that with the reduction in the number of seats from six to five Fianna Fáil or Deputy Blaney might lose a seat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention in the Minister's mind in dealing with Dublin is clear. It has been done solely to benefit the <Col N="2017" /> Labour Party.  The best of luck to the Minister if he was able to put it across on the Fine Gael Party that they should accept three-seat constituencies. He has created 13 three-seat constituencies in Dublin in the belief that they will divide evenly between the three political parties.  That would give an end result of Fianna Fáil 13, Fine Gael 13, Labour 13.  If the Fine Gael element in the Coalition Government had put their foot down and insisted on five-seat constituencies in the Dublin area and extended it a bit to include another one, making eight five-seat constituencies, the result would more than likely have been Fianna Fáil 16, Fine Gael 16, Labour 8.  That would have meant a gain of three for Fianna Fáil, a gain of three for Fine Gael and a loss of five for the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister certainly did not agree to that.  The Minister had his day, won his point, put it across on the Coalition that they should accept three-seat constituencies in Dublin.  All the marginal constituencies in Dublin are being created for the benefit of the Labour Party and could give them 13 Deputies if they managed to muster the vote adequately in each constituency.  That is what the Minister is working for but if he had done it the way Fine Gael should have done it, by making eight five-seaters, his Party would have ended up with only eight.</P>

      <P>In Cork, too, he put it across on the Fine Gael Party.  If he had created a four-seater in Cork and ceded the other parts of it to the neighbouring constituencies Fine Gael would have benefited.  The probable result would have been Fianna Fáil 2, Fine Gael 2, Labour nowhere.  The Fine Gael Party, in agreeing to a five seat constituency, are more than likely conceding a seat to the Labour Party.  The best of luck to the Minister if he was <Col N="2018" /> able to get that through the Coalition Government and the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party.

Much was said about the need for a constituency commission.  I heard the Minister say on the radio the other night that perhaps he would agree with it.

      <P>One would not need a very high IQ to understand the Minister's motives in refusing the commission and bringing in the Bill. However, I have shown that there is no logical explanation for the manner in which this Bill was drafted other than the one overriding factor which is a clear attempt on the part of the Coalition to gain as much political advantage as they can from judicious location of the various constituencies and various sizes of constituencies.  I have shown that the west could have retained 30 seats, but was not given them by the Coalition.  I have shown that the constituency of Clare which needed only a small number to warrant the fourth seat was made a three-seater and that 12,000 or so persons from Clare/South Galway have been pushed into Galway to create a four-seater <Col N="2020" /> in West Galway in the hope of picking up a Labour seat.  The lack of any trend regarding the size of constituencies is obvious, but the most despicable aspect of the Bill is that it requires more persons in the western constituencies I have mentioned to elect a Deputy than it does in the Dublin constituencies.  I gave an example of that.  That is most unfair and the Minister will regret it.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a ruthless exercise on the Minister's part.  I suppose he relished his task; he may feel he has done a good job for the Coalition, but in the gamble he has taken in the creation of marginal constituencies, three-seaters in the Dublin area, the revulsion of the people may react against him and the outcome may not be exactly as the Minister hoped and planned when drawing up these new constituencies.  It is quite on the cards that a swing of 3 per cent or 4 per cent away from the Coalition parties could give the Fianna Fáil Party two out of every one of those three seats.</P>

      <P>That is what Fianna Fáil will be working for.  If this Bill goes through we shall look for the people's support to show up the hypocrisy in the sentiments expressed in the past by Coalition spokesmen, indicating they were paragons of virtue, and to show that the time spent by the Government since they came into office over seven months ago has been very little use to the community and that the promises of reform in legislation, a more humane approach to legislation and the holding out of hopes for an improved standard and quality of life have been ignored. When power was attained their greedy hands began dividing the constituencies and the carve-up is designed to produce the maximum benefit for the Coalition.  But the revulsion of the people may show a different result when the votes are counted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall begin by conceding immediately the truth of part of Deputy Molloy's closing <Col N="2021" /> words.  This Bill, when enacted, will in no way guarantee the continuation in office of this Government.  It cannot do so.  I agree that a revulsion of feeling in an election which the Government had to face at a time of unpopularity would not only put it out but put it out decisively.  I do not know whether the Opposition at that time would be the Fianna Fáil Party as it now is or some other kind of party or combination of parties, but I concede the possibility exists.  If the Deputy said anything of importance with which we would not quarrel it is that this Bill will not, and cannot stitch the Coalition into power if the people do not want them.</P>
      <P>I want to remind the House that this is the first time in the history of the State since the first Electoral Act of 1923 that the revision of constituency boundaries has been in any hands other than those of Fianna Fáil.  There could be no question of gerrymandering in 1923: the party structural system had not emerged in quite the same shape.  Certainly the civil war division was there, but the knowledge of local tendencies was by no means as sophisticated as it is now. There could be no sophisticated carve-up then.  Every other constituency revision up to now was carried out by a Fianna Fáil Government.  I think there was one in 1935, one immediately after the war, one which misfired in 1959 when the High Court declared it repugnant to the Constitution, a mending of hands in 1961 and Mr. Boland's last effort to cement his own party in power in 1969.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy's heart is bleeding for the very minute differences&mdash;and they are minute because they are all well within any kind of tolerance&mdash; between the number of people behind each Deputy as between one part of the country and another.  Apart from the fact that this revision is based, as it must constitutionally be based, on the 1971 census, Deputy Molloy knows perfectly well that there are some parts of the west of Ireland in which the decline in the population is continuous.  So, in fact, if one were talking, not about the 1971 census, <Col N="2022" /> but about the situation today, one would find that the number of people actually standing behind Deputy Molloy himself once this Bill becomes law and if he is re-elected will be, in fact, smaller and substantially smaller than the number of people standing behind any Dublin Deputy.  I realise that this is not strictly relevant because the law requires the Government to take heed, not of what is going to happen at the time of the election but of the population as it was at the last preceding census. Nonetheless, I think Deputy Molloy's tears will be the more easily dried if it can be pointed out to him and if it can be brought home to him that whatever may have happened in 1971 or whatever calculation was made based on those figures, by the time the next election comes around, even if that is tomorrow, he will find himself, if he is re-elected, representing far fewer people than the average represented by any Dublin Deputy.</P>
    <P>Before I pass from the electoral history of the past, I want to add this: if the Fianna Fáil party in Opposition now find themselves for the first time since the Civil War facing a constituency revision being carried out by a Government other than themselves they have only themselves to thank.  Deputy Molloy was good enough to give the House the actual date on which the census returns for 1971 were published.  They were made public in July, 1972.  From that moment on, in my contention&mdash;there is no question of contention about the first leg of this&mdash;the then Government could have and, in my contention, ought to have carried out a constituency revision.</P>
    <P>There is no such thing as an open and shut case in law of any kind and I am not purporting to dogmatise to the House but my opinion, in which I am by no means alone, is that to hold a general election in disregard of the published results of the 1971 census was outside the terms of the Constitution. That is not to say that this House is now an illegel assembly because there is no cure for it.  No court in the world would turn the whole of society on its head by declaring an assembly unlawful.  Nevertheless I have <Col N="2023" /> to express the opinion, as I did then, that to hold a general election once the 1971 census results were out, showing as they did show a shift of population and growth of population at certain points, was not lawful having regard to the Constitution.  So that Fianna Fáil have themselves to thank not only for their neglect but also for their defiance of the Constitution if they now find themselves being faced by a constituency revision carried out through a Government other than one composed of their own party.</P>
    <P>A wide variety of options is open to any Minister for Local Government or any Government in regard to the number of constituencies or the number of seats in a constituency and Deputy Molloy knows that as well as everybody else in the House.  He was speaking over the last couple of hours about various options which might have been open to the Minister, but which the Minister had chosen to neglect. One of these options was a large number of five-seat constituencies into which he thought Dublin might have been divided.  We know that the greater the number of Deputies in a constituency the more proportionally representative the end picture will be. That is certain.  There is no possibility of argument about it.  But, it does not work out like that and has not worked out like that in the past that a five-seat constituency has always produced a neat division between the two or, at most, three parties.  In saying this I am not purporting to speak personally for the Minister with whom I have never consulted on the principle behind his Bill.  It has been the experience often enough that a five-seat constituency and, certainly, bigger ones than that, tended to bring in at the tail not necessarily a member of one of the large parties, but an independent. While independents have exactly the same rights as anybody else inside or outside the Dáil, once inside the Dáil, as anyone will admit, they tend to complicate calculations either from the point of view of the Government or from the point of view of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>I admit, a complicated calculation <Col N="2024" /> is no reason for depressing the chances of an independent man to get elected but a system which, as it were, virtually invites the election of a large number of independents to a Dáil which is run both by law and by convenience on the supposition of party discipline on both sides is one which a Minister is justified in rejecting. I know there are large questions of political philosophy involved here and I realise that in saying that I am open to the charge of trying to sacrifice the pure democratic principle to convenience, but a balance has to be drawn somewhere and while I would not be necessarily opposed to a five-seat scheme I can see strong arguments against it and I believe that although we may not hear them from the other side of the House Deputies who are on the other side of the House will know what these arguments are and will share them.  I will not mention the name of the Deputy, but I spoke last night to a Fianna Fáil Deputy who thoroughly agreed about this in regard to large constituencies, certainly in Dublin and perhaps anywhere in the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy made some play of the contrast of convenience as between a country Deputy with a large area to service and a city Deputy who could process his constituency on foot or on a bicycle in a quarter of an hour.  I do not want to dismiss that argument altogether.  There is part of Donegal, which is a big county, with a heavily indented coastline and he regretted that the Minister proposed to make it a five-seat constituency spread over one million acres.  It was a five-seat constituency at one stage and even a seven- or eight-seat constituency far back.  I do not think it was divided into two&mdash;I speak subject to correction&mdash;until Mr. Boland divided it and before that the previous Fianna Fáil revisionists had been happy to leave it in that condition.  I do not know why.  Perhaps it suited them. Perhaps it merely seemed convenient to treat the county as a unit.  That is the fact.  If it is now being made a single constituency that is what it was in the past.  It was only in the last session that it returned Deputies <Col N="2025" /> from two separate constituencies.  I am open to correction on that.  Perhaps it was so for two sessions but, certainly, Donegal for a long time was a single constituency.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from that, although I do not want to make little of Deputy Molloy's argument here, I can see, of course, that it is a nuisance in a sense to be looking for votes from people who live scattered over one million acres but the reality is, as Deputies who have been here much longer than I have know, that a Deputy in a large area tends to have what he thinks of as his own area and there are some constituencies in which Deputies of all parties would bite the hands of their colleagues if they were found trotting into their area to anything more than a dance.  That does not entirely invalidate the force of what Deputy Molloy was saying but it seems to me to reduce it considerably.  If there were 20-seat constituencies and if Deputy Molloy were returned as a member for one of them he would stick very largely to his own corner of it and he would be right to do so and would be doing what most Deputies effectively do.  I am willing to be contradicted on this.</P>
    <P>In a place like Carlow-Kilkenny you will find Carlow Deputies sticking to the Carlow end and the Kilkenny Deputies to the Kilkenny end.  Even in the city the same is true.  If there are two colleagues from the same party in a city constituency you will find&mdash;I have anyway noticed or believe I have noticed&mdash;a rough division of geographical responsibility between them. So that I do not attach too much importance to this argument which the Opposition spokesman on local government addressed to the House a while ago.  When Mr. Boland revised the constituencies in 1969 he deprived the west of three seats.  The present Minister proposes to deprive the west of two seats.  The obligation on Mr. Boland was of exactly the same character as that on Deputy Tully, the Minister for Local Government. We are bleating about the loss of two seats in face of the necessity which the law imposes to have an even spread of representation.  The Deputy's former <Col N="2026" /> colleague took three seats from the same area.  This seems a feeble approach and one which will not make much impression even in the west.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Members who make appeals about the west tend to wish the rest of us to believe that the people in the west are simple.  They are not a bit simple.  The average inhabitant of Galway, Mayo or Roscommon will see the sense of this.  He will know that one border is enough.  He would share with me the point of view that this distinction or boundary which appears to exist in the minds of politicians when they discuss the difference between Dublin and the rest of the country is not valid.  If the people wish to come and live in Dublin, if when they arrive there they have children who grow up and get the vote, let them be represented there.  About two-thirds of the existing population in Dublin are from parents who were not born in Dublin. To go back another generation, the proportion of the Dublin population which cannot show a Dublin pedigree is colossal.  A very large number of people living here&mdash;and all one has to do is to be a Dublin Deputy going around during election time and knocking on doors to know&mdash;are not Dublin people.  You meet people from all parts of the country.  You can talk to them about mutual friends from north, south, east and west.  They still retain a loyalty to their own counties although Dublin has full associations for them. It serves to break down this idiotic, imaginary barrier between Dublin and the rest of the country.  I repudiate this.</P>
    <P>It is idiotic for a spokesman like Deputy Molloy to be whinging about Dublin getting seats and the west not. This is a small country with a small population.  I freely admit that the bigger a city the more services it attracts and a scattered population may be neglected and will not have the same concentration of services.  That is the same everywhere in the world.  If the population of the west has been declining since the Famine it is part of a process which I will not be so vulgar as to lay at the door of Fianna Fáil.  It may be largely their fault that this has happened but I do not subscribe <Col N="2027" /> to that view.  It will not be stopped by putting extra Deputies into the west.  I hope it will stop and that this Government or a future Government will effectively stop the population decline in the west.  It will not be done by putting a &ldquo;complaints&rdquo; man with the title of TD into Ballisodare or Tulsk.  The fact is that if you were to say to a man forced to leave the west because of economic circumstances that the Government were trying to save him by giving him an extra Deputy he would laugh at you and rightly so.  He would say: &ldquo;What good is that to me?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not go along with the talk about the west of Ireland.  The Minister is now doing a less severe job than Mr. Boland did when he deprived the west of seats but he has to do it. So far as the complaints about Dublin are concerned if the people choose to live here in great numbers, that is where they must be represented.</P>
    <P>Dublin is too big.  It is over-blown. We do not want a capital city of this size.  There is no need for it.  We can see from the traffic snarls, the grandiose plans for flyovers and underground railways which are the latest thing, that it is too ludicrous a size for a Republic with a population of only three million.  That is the end result of a long trend for which I would not necessarily assign the blame to the Opposition.  If Governments have any function in planning or control over large-scale developments in the area under their charge, surely the discouragement of urban growth, the encouragement of decentralisation would be one of these things.  If Dublin is a gigantic anonymous ball, and if the people flocking here are housed in what can only be termed concrete jungles they must be represented here.  We must look around to see where the fault lies for this overgrowth&mdash;and I freely admit it is an overgrowth.  I do not think this Government will carry much blame for that, if the blame is ever assigned. A man living in a concrete jungle has a much less agreeable life than the man living along the coastline.  He has problems to contend with which the <Col N="2028" /> man in the country has not.  I cannot see why the man in the country should be less productive of problems than the man in the city.</P>
    <P>The <i>Roscommon Herald</i> on 9th November produced an editorial article called &ldquo;Bully for Tully.&rdquo; It was a very severe piece of journalism in which the editor says that just as he was harsh on Mr. Boland in 1969 for taking seats from the west, he will be harsh on Mr. Tully for doing the same thing. He also said that the Connacht counties had fared badly in the carve-up.  I can understand the exasperation of a western journalist if he feels that a trick is being played on him or that he is being in some way robbed.  He is not being robbed. The only possible way that the editor of the <i>Roscommon Herald</i> could have been made happy would have been if the people in '68 had passed the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  If the people had passed Mr. Boland's amendment whereby a tolerance of a fairly large scale would have been permissible the <i>Roscommon Herald</i> would have had nothing to complain about because it would have been open to the Minister, had he wished it, to leave in the west and areas of declining population more Deputies than he has.  The people voted it down and the people of Roscommon were one of the constituencies which voted it down most firmly.</P>
    <P>Only four constituencies in the country said &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to Mr. Boland's proposal which was backed by the Fianna Fáil party and their powerful propaganda machine.  The constituencies were West Galway, the two Donegal constituencies and Clare. This county from which this editorial comes thundering up to Mr. Tully's table voted down the only possible way in which a favour could have been given to the people in the west of Ireland at the expense of those in Dublin.  That is one of the reasons why I say that they are made out by their political and journalistic representatives as being more stupid than they are.  The average inhabitant of Roscommon or any other western county knows perfectly well that he <Col N="2029" /> is not entitled to political advantage at the expense of the man living in Tallaght or Ballymun.  I can only imagine the contempt with which he must receive the complaints like those we have heard from Deputy Molloy about how he was &ldquo;done in the eye&rdquo;. Another couple of Deputies would not make much difference to his situation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy spoke of gerrymandering as though no distribution of constituencies to suit the then Government had been carried out on the last occasion.  I have no wish to become involved in a sparring match at this stage, but I expect we will have plenty of time for that later in the long debate that the Deputy has promised us.  There is no point in indulging in a foolish exchange of abuse as to what Mr. Boland did or did not do, but I will give the House some figures to illustrate what was the net result of his activities in respect of the Dublin four-seat constituencies that he planted in 1969.</P>
    <P>In 1973, this was the situation in the constituencies of Dublin Central, Dublin North Central, Dublin North East, Dublin North West, Dublin South Central and Dublin South West &mdash;I have omitted Dublin South East because it was a three-seater: Fianna Fáil won 85,534 first preference votes, while the figure for Fine Gael was 56,986 and Labour got 51,317 votes. With their vote, Fianna Fáil returned 12 Deputies, Fine Gael returned seven and the Labour Party returned five.  If one were to break down these figures into terms of cost per seat, as any schoolboy might be asked to do, it would be seen that the cost per seat to Fianna Fáil was 7,128 votes, the cost to Fine Gael was 8,141 votes per seat and the Labour Party got their seats at a cost of 10,261 votes each.</P>
    <P>If one averages the Fine Gael and Labour vote, as we are entitled to do in 1973 because the parties were recommending transfers to each other, it would be found that the Coalition's 12 seats were bought at a cost of 9,025 votes each as against 7,028 votes each for Fianna Fáil.  In other words, the result of Mr. <Col N="2030" /> Boland's activity was to give cheap seats to Fianna Fáil.  That is how it was intended to be and I say that without rancour.  Deputy Molloy said that there were various ways in which the Minister might have held on to the existing plan.  Would the Minister not need to have a hole in his head to hold on to that plan?  Would a baby be prepared to do so?  Leaving aside the question of trying to get advantage for oneself, would not any Minister for Local Government charged with a revision such as this, at least try to undo the damage that was done by the 1969 revision.</P>

      <P>The situation in relation to Cork is a special one because one would expect a good Fianna Fáil vote there by reason of the fact that the Leader of the Opposition comes from the constituency.  In Cork in 1973 Fianna Fáil won four seats for which they paid 7,591 votes each. Fine Gael won two seats at a cost of 8,071 votes each while the Labour Party did not succeed in returning anybody to the Dáil although they succeeded in winning 4,715 first preference votes.  The Minister for Local Government is not St. Francis of Assisi and it would be asking a superhuman virtue on his part to permit that situation to continue.  Deputy Molloy did not come clean in much of what he said.  I have not discussed with the Minister his plans for constituency revision.</P>

      <P>Should Deputy Molloy's request be heeded, the Minister would have to throw away much more than half the Labour quota in Cork, a half quota which, with a Fine Gael surplus, would result in a full quota.  Perhaps by mentioning parties in this detailed manner I am going outside the conventions of the debate, but it would be foolish to expect the Minister to do as the Deputy suggests particularly since Cork city, like Donegal, was previously a unit.</P>
      <P>I remember in my early days in politics going to Cork to work for the now Deputy Liam Burke in the by-election that was won by Deputy Seán French.  That election was won by Deputy French in a Cork city constituency of five seats in the days when Deputy Boland was riding high and when the arrogant language of Fianna Fáil Ministers could not be borne.  It was in those days that people flocked into Fine Gael and Labour because they could not bear to listen to the abusive way in which Fianna Fáil Ministers spoke.  One would hear such remarks from the Fianna Fáil people in Cork as &ldquo;We are going in with three, we will come out with four&rdquo;.  I know there is a certain amount of boastful talk on all sides, but never to the extent one finds among Fianna Fáil people. There were no complaints from Deputy Molloy in regard to Cork being a five-seat constituency then, but, of course, there was a Labour vote there and that vote could not be allowed materialise into a seat so Cork was divided by Mr. Boland into two three-seaters.</P>

      <P>In the 1969 election Fianna Fáil won 113,000 odd votes in the constituencies of North East Galway, West Galway, Clare-South Galway, East Mayo, West Mayo, Clare, Roscommon-Leitrim and Sligo-Leitrim, Fine Gael won 87,000 odd votes while the Labour Party's poll was about 12,000.  That meant that in the Province of Connacht, plus Clare, Fianna Fáil were paying only 7,560 votes per seat.  In other words they were getting their seat for little more than the quota in the average constituency in the country while Fine Gael were paying nearly 10,000 votes per seat and Labour did not win any seat.  If the Fine Gael and Labour vote were totalled, but I admit that this is a questionable exercise in relation to 1969 because the parties were not operating then on a single platform, there is a combined Fine Gael and Labour vote of more than 100,000 which means that these two parties were paying more than 11,000 votes per seat as against 7,560 votes per seat won by Fianna Fáil.  How could the Minister be expected to maintain that situation?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to try and put across to the House what is going to happen in the proposed redistribution in the west about which the Deputy feels so badly.  To do this legitimately I will take the 1973 General Election figures as static.  That may not be permissible but I am supposing that they will be <Col N="2033" /> repeated.  In the four new constituencies of Clare, Clare-South-Galway, North-East Galway and West Galway there was, this year, a total Fianna Fáil vote of 61,000 odd.  Fine Gael had more than 36,000 and Labour more than 5,000.  The Fine Gael and Labour vote together was nearly 42,000.</P>
      <P>An amateur armchair political observer might tot up the likely events in those four constituencies and he would say that this is a first-class carve-up because it will end up with two Fianna Fáil and one Fine Gael in Clare and in the other three of these constituencies involving Galway it will be two all.  Such an observer might say that it will leave Fianna Fáil, who in 1973 were very much stronger than the other two put together, with six seats and the rest with five, a Fianna Fáil majority of one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJLalor" hpid="Mr. Lalor Mr. Lalor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not giving any game away.  If that result takes place Fianna Fáil will be buying these seats very dearly.  They will be paying just over 10,000 votes per seat if that result takes place while Fine Gael and/or Labour will be paying only 8,370 votes per seat.  That supposes that the national revulsion that Deputy Molloy predicted does not actually come off.  If that revulsion comes off and if in one of the Galway constituencies there is a heavy swing against the Government it is not impossible, and the Deputies opposite may know this&mdash;I hope it will not happen and I am confident in so far as one can go without being complacent that it will not happen but it has happened before&mdash;in a four-seat constituency that Fianna Fáil will win three out of the four seats.  This happened in the Cumann na nGaedheal days before Fianna Fáil found that the oath was only an empty formula when Cumann na nGaedheal won three out of four on that kind of proportion.  It could happen again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that happens in these four constituencies which are so close to Deputy Molloy, geographically and otherwise, it will revolutionise the situation because Fianna Fáil will then be able to <Col N="2034" /> produce seven Fianna Fáil seats as against four Fine Gael seats.  It will reverse the price of the seats.  If Fianna Fáil were to win one seat more in those four constituencies than might be predicted on the back of an envelope by an armchair observer they will be buying their seats again far cheaper than the Coalition.  They will be buying their seats for only 8,700 odd votes and the Coalition will be paying over 10,400 per seat.</P>
    <P>I freely confess that if the thing were to work out according to the first hypothesis it was time for a change and it is high time that change was there.  Fianna Fáil would be asked to put their hand a bit deeper into the vote pocket to buy a seat.  But if the national revulsion that Deputy Molloy foresees takes place and if there is a swing against the Government in one of the big Galway constituencies the position will be quite different and it will work out that Fianna Fáil will be again at the advantageous end. Indeed, I am amazed at the moderation of the Minister for Local Government in allowing that possibility to remain even so much on the cards as it is.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a number of other comments about Deputy Molloy's contribution.  I am aware that since the Deputy has already spoken on the Second Stage he cannot speak again but he has plenty of Deputies in his party who can speak for him.  I want to challenge Deputy Molloy to tell us what he proposed and had planned to do had his Government not gone out of office on the 28th February last.  When I hear that from him I will be a bit more impressed with all the whinging and whining about the Bill at present before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not making any accusation about Deputy Molloy having taken away the files.  There was no need for him to have taken away the files and for all I know the former Minister knows what he intended to do.  Because I do not know what Deputy Molloy intended I challenge him to tell us <Col N="2035" /> because he must have notes or ideas in his mind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy thought it might have been wrong for the Minister to go as high as 148 seats which is the maximum permissible having regard to the growth in population.  That implies a population of 2,960,000 plus.  Deputy Molloy thought it was open to the Minister, as indeed it was, to stay below that figure even though he conceded that every Government who were ever in charge of revisions, and that means the Fianna Fáil Governments, always got the maximum number of seats out of the country that they could consistent with the Constitution.  Not alone was his own argument demolished out of his mouth within the space of the same five minutes, but I should like to remind him of a sensible thing the present leader of the Opposition said in an interview when he was Taoiseach. The present leader of the Opposition said there were problems in running an administration with a small Dáil.  I seem to remember that he said that if there was a Dáil of 145 or 150 Deputies it would be split down the middle under a proportional system and the Government would be able to command 75 seats which is what he succeeded in getting with only 45 per cent of the vote in 1969, thanks to that rock of integrity, as he described him, Mr. Boland.</P>
    <P>This point was a good one on Deputy Lynch's part.  In a Government of only 75 Deputies a large number of these Deputies could be too busy, or too preoccupied in other matters or for reasons of health, and, consequently, would be difficult material from which to form an administration. In other words no matter how small a country is there has to be a minimum number from which a Government can be drawn.  People often lightheadedly write to the papers suggesting 50 or 60 fewer Deputies and point out that the Constitution permits us to reduce the numbers to 100 but I would not go along with that argument.  I believe Deputy Lynch is right.  Within reason it is an advantage to have a large Parliament and it is a disadvantage to have a small one for the reasons he <Col N="2036" /> gave.  On that ground, as well as on the ground which Deputy Molloy mentioned, namely, that in the Minister's behaviour he was only adhering to existing practice, Deputy Molloy's complaint about the number of 148 having been opted for rather than 147 or 146 must fall to the ground.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by reading another line or two from the editorial in the <i>Roscommon Herald,</i> and reading it with approval.  It states that the Government should not set too much store on the Minister's dexterity with the knife&mdash;I will let that piece of rhetoric go without comment&mdash;and that the people will decide who will be in Government.  The <i>Roscommon Herald</i> are entirely right about it.  The people will decide who will be in Government.  It is not within the Minister's power to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>I was upset the other day to find that an experienced commentator had calculated that, on the basis of this constituencies revision, after the next election the Coalition would have 83 seats and Fianna Fáil would have only 63, I think he said.  I will have an even £1 with him that that will not happen.  I hope with confidence that the Government will have a favourable record to present to the people when the next election comes around, and I hope and believe that the people will return them to office.  I do not believe that this Government will find themselves enjoying a majority of that size no matter what the Minister does, no matter what happens one way or the other.  Even if Fianna Fáil were to fall to bits I do not believe a Government in this country would be given a majority of that size by the people under the system we have got.</P>
    <P>Frightening the people by talking about 83 seats is rubbish.  No Government here have ever seen a majority of that size.  Offhand, I think the biggest majority here was that won by Mr. de Valera in 1957 when he had about 78 seats.  There has never been a bigger majority than that and I will be very surprised if there ever is a bigger majority than that.  There were more big constituencies then.  The reason it will not happen is not that the Government will not deserve support, <Col N="2037" /> but that it is just not in the nature of the people, no matter how the constituencies are distributed, to give that kind of mandate to any Government.  I endorse what the <i>Roscommon Herald</i> said, that the people have the final say and will have the final say no matter what the Minister does, and must do, in order to correct the situation delivered to him by his predecessor but one.  The people will have the last word and will exercise it.</P>
    <P>When this Government are returned at the next election, as I hope they will be, they certainly will not have an open cheque-sized majority of the kind I heard predicted recently.  We will have to work for a working majority.  I believe and hope we will get it.  That kind of talk is misdirected and I do not think there is any ground for a mechanical calculation which assigns 83 seats to the Government leaving a gap of 20 between them and the Opposition.  I do not see that happening and I do not see it happening the other way round either.  The people are on top and they showed that this year when, in spite of Mr. Boland's 1969 Bill, they decided to change their Government.  That is their privilege and it will remain their privilege as long as this Government have any control over the course of our democracy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to the Minister I must say that any Minister charged with drafting a Bill such as this faces great difficulty.  Perhaps the Minister had more difficulty than Mr. Boland had some years ago.  The Minister had to satisfy two parties forming the Government and I am sure that was a difficult task.  The Minister will be criticised, and rightly so, for some of the provisions in the Bill but there is a bigger area of criticism of the Minister and the Government.  They did not hand over the drafting and the preparation of the Bill to an independent body as they promised and urged when they were in Opposition.  Whether another body would have done a better or a worse job we will never know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that the Government did <Col N="2038" /> not keep their promise to establish an outside body or tribunal has done some damage to democracy.  The people now see that the Government were not sincere in their protestations when they were in Opposition, when they said that Fianna Fáil should have handed this issue over to an outside body.  In all democratic countries today people are becoming more cynical about big parties.  We have seen this in Britain recently when two amazing victories were won by representatives of very small parties.  It is the duty of this House to ensure that the people have faith in the Establishment irrespective of whether it is Fine Gael/Labour or Fianna Fáil.  In this Bill rather than trying to ensure that the National Coalition would obtain more seats than the Fianna Fáil Opposition, they should have tried to lay down the basis for a proper system which would be a sounding board for national thinking so that, having thought about the issues, the people could then vote as they saw fit and return a party or parties to Government to rule the country in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>I criticise the Government on this major point.  They have broken faith with the people.  Before the election, and many years before that, they criticised the Fianna Fáil Government on this point.  They accused Mr. Boland of gerrymandering every constituency to ensure that Fianna Fáil would obtain an overall majority.  We heard the Parliamentary Secretary proving to himself this morning that you cannot gerrymander.  If it is impossible for the Minister to gerrymander today it was impossible for the previous Ministers to gerrymander.</P>
    <P>During the discussions on the PR issue when he was holding forth on why he opposed the single seat system Deputy Fitzpatrick, now Minister for Lands, said that under PR you could not gerrymander.  Therefore the criticisms of Mr. Boland were all wrong according to Deputy Kelly this morning and the Minister for Lands but Mr. Boland had to suffer the slings and arrows of the then Opposition who accused him of gerrymandering the whole country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2039" /> In this part of the country we have no religious ghettoes.  We do not approach electoral changes on any sectarian lines.  I suggest that you can gerrymander in this way: by numbers, by the number of seats in any one area.  A classic example of this is Dublin city with 13 three-seat constituencies and only one four-seater, Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown, which happens to be the area represented by the Taoiseach among others.  I wonder why the Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown boundaries are socrosanct and must not be touched and why it must continue as a four-member constituency. Is it because it is the Taoiseach's area?  Is it because if it were reduced to three seats some heads might roll&mdash; perhaps even a prominent head?  I am not suggesting the Taoiseach would lose his seat, but I say Fianna Fáil, at least, would maintain their present representation and either the Fine Gael or Labour Deputies would lose.  Consequently, Dún Laoghaire is regarded as sacrosanct and must not be touched.</P>
    <P>Let us compare the situation in Cork city, an area represented by a former Taoiseach.  This is a forward-looking and rapidly growing city but a large slice of that constituency has been put into a rural area and Cork city loses one seat.  This is a blatant piece of gerrymandering.  The exercise in Dún Laoghaire is to ensure that the Taoiseach is returned, in addition to a Fine Gael and a Labour Deputy and, of course, a Fianna Fáil Deputy, but the practice has been reversed in Cork to ensure a seat for the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>There are cynics who say this will not work and that Fianna Fáil may do well out of this change.  If that happens it will be despite the Minister's measure.  Cork, the second city in the country, has been singled out for the Minister's scalpel.  Young people are anxious to regard politicians as dedicated people, but here they see the Government carrying out a blatant piece of gerrymandering.  This Government promised they would not alter the constituencies, but would <Col N="2040" /> hand the matter over to an independent body, let this House discuss the proposals submitted and either adopt or reject them.  This would be a high form of democracy but it has not been done.  Instead, they are doing exactly the same thing of which they accused previous Governments, even though previous Governments never promised to deviate from allowing the Government of the day to re-draft the constituencies in the interests of the people generally.</P>

      <P>I am not worried but I am concerned about the matter.  If the Minister had made the Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown constituency a three-seater the message would have been that here was a Minister who was treating all constituencies alike despite the fact that this was the Taoiseach's constituency.  It may be that Deputy Kelly was right in his forecast of what may happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His argument was that, no matter what boundaries you have, it is the people who will speak and they will return whomsoever they want to return. He gave some figures of the cost to the Fine Gael and Labour <Col N="2043" /> Parties in votes in the last general election.  In my constituency of South-East Dublin, Fine Gael got two seats with a little over 11,000 votes and Fianna Fáil got one seat with something over 10,000 votes.  That was under the Act that the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Boland as he was, brought in, the Act that was so very one-sided and such a model of gerrymandering.  The point the Parliamentary Secretary forgot was that the parties now in Government had two parties running as a coalition. Now, when it suits, they refer to the National Coalition and, when it does not suit, they refer to the Fine Gael and Labour Parties.</P>
    <P>It may well be that there will be a change in public opinion and the National Coalition may well contest the next election as two separate parties without any tie-up or any unified influence in relation to the transfer of votes.  That, of course, is something the Minister cannot influence all that deeply.  However, what he could have done&mdash;he missed his opportunity&mdash;was to ensure the continuation of the National Coalition. Cynical people will ask: &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The point I am stressing is the fact that the Minister has broken faith with the people and not alone will the Government side suffer but the democratic set-up here will suffer. Once people become cynical and lose their faith in democracy the time may well come when they will not even bother to vote and those in government will be able to do what they like with their constituency Bill and any other legislation they wish to introduce. If the Minister wants to convince people that he is trying to bring in a fair measure and one which will ensure the safety of our democratic institutions, then he must withdraw this Bill, have another look at it and come forward once more with a Bill which will carry out his promise here that, as far as possible, boundaries should be sacrosanct.</P>
    <P>In this Bill boundaries are stretched to their very limits.  For what purpose? Is it to give the people a better opportunity of ensuring that those they return <Col N="2044" /> here are the best people and represent majority thinking in the particular area or is it just a cynical exercise designed to ensure by some means that fewer Fianna Fáil Deputies will be elected and more National Coalition? This should not be the motive behind such legislation because in time we will disappear from the scene and, when we do we hope to have it said that, when we were here, we did things fairly and tried to ensure that people would not be given a hotchpotch Bill with some ulterior motive behind it, but rather a system of electoral reform designed to ensure that the voice of the people is heard in the most effective way.</P>

      <P>I will not disagree with the Minister as to his sentiments.  I think he is very honest in lots of ways. I am sure the Minister chuckled at times at some of the proposals and I sympathise with him to some extent because he has to satisfy two parties and it is hard enough to satisfy one.</P>

      <P>I satisfied the Opposition because most of the Opposition said that they were satisfied with the Bill.  Many of the Deputies on the Deputy's side of the House said they were delighted with it.  That is the extraordinary thing.  Of course, there are contrary fellows who are never satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>

      <P>This is our whole approach to this Bill.  I could suggest many amendments, but I really think the Bill should be withdrawn and reexamined by the outside tribunal or body Deputies advocated, at times almost violently, when they were in Opposition.  The constitutional barrier has not been examined too deeply by <Col N="2045" /> the Government and there is still time to do what I suggest now.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary said he did not see the Bill until it was published. I think that the Parliamentary Secretary is a member of the Government.</P>

      <P>I am not satisfied that the Parliamentary Secretary is satisfied. He spoke about a great many things except the Bill this morning and that puts doubt in our minds that the Government gave to this very important Bill the consideration it deserves.

      <P>No.  I can tell the Deputy exactly what I said.  I said if Fianna Fáil persisted in doing what the Minister for Local Government was then doing we, as soon as we got in, would have to change it&mdash;that is on the record&mdash;and subsequently a commission might be considered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is neither fair nor honest.  He is a bit discomfited at being reminded of the promises that were made.  We will go on reminding him because this is a deep breach of faith with the people. It probably helped the Government parties to be elected in the last election. I do not know if it was included in the 14 points, but I suggest it was probably as worthless as the 14 points have proved to be and all we can do, therefore, is await the day when we can tackle it and bring in a really honest, effective and democratic measure.  The Minister may think some people are satisfied with the Bill.  I am sure there are people who are satisfied in a superficial kind of way; they are satisfied because the Government have superior numbers and they will steamroll the Bill through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is one side of the picture.  Remember retribution may well come, not necessarily in the Government losing seats or Fianna Fáil losing seats but because people will lose faith in the promises of a Government being broken on such a fundamental issue. Therefore, they will wonder whether democracy is worth supporting, whether a democratic assembly like this is worth supporting when we cannot accept the word of the Government of the day.  Before they became the Government they protested in this House and elsewhere at what they <Col N="2047" /> alleged was a gerrymandering effort by the Fianna Fáil Government and promised that when they would get in they would change all that, that they would not leave it to the mere politicians, that they would take it to more learned men who would look into their hearts and see what the people wanted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil in their time did things that were far more damaging to the Constitution and to constitutional methods than what I am suggesting now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the Bill introduced by the Minister.  I do not believe he is very proud of his work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness to the Minister I do not believe that.  The Minister has done a bad day's work, perhaps, not for the Coalition but for the whole basis of our democracy. There are many countries even in Europe today where people have not got the right to vote.  That right was taken away from them by extreme elements in their society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Moore is going a bit far.  We have been here since 1922 and Deputy Moore cannot tell the Labour Party anything about democracy.  We believed in it all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be democratic and allow me to continue? Democracy is a frail thing which must be safeguarded all the time.  Its greatest safeguard is the ballot box and any measure which would tend to diminish the importance of the ballot box is not a good measure.  I suggest that this Bill is tarnishing the democratic image and anything that does that must be opposed in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the intention of the Opposition to criticise this Bill and to make suggestions for its improvement in the hope that the Government will listen to them.  Whether they listen or not <Col N="2048" /> we have a duty to go on saying these things, to show the people what we believe is wrong in this Bill, and there are many things wrong, but to try to do it in a balanced way.  As I said, no Minister could possibly produce a Bill which would please everybody but the Minister has told us how sacrosanct county boundaries are.  He has told us that this is a Bill to improve on existing legislation.  Since he has breached the county boundaries and has failed to improve on existing legislation, he should not blame us if we become cynical and even bitter.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be entirely acrimonious. Between now and the next Stage the Minister should have a look at the Bill and examine what we say and then come forward with his own amendments to try to improve this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>You could not improve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is being arrogant now.  Any Bill can be improved on.  Any Minister can be improved on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot improve on it anyway.  I think it is great.  Fantastic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister believes that it is a sick joke but I do not think he does.  There was a man named Covey who said that if one keeps on saying a thing one believes it.  If the Minister keeps saying: &ldquo;This is a good Bill&rdquo; he may well believe it but we will not believe it and the people will not believe it.  It is a dangerous point in a man's life when he starts convincing himself in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies of the present assembly may lose their seats because of the new electoral areas.  While this is regrettable for the individuals concerned, it is not the big point.  The main thing is that the people who are elected should represent the thinking of the people.  In Dublin there are 13 three-seat constituencies proposed. It is hoped that the parties will come out with 13 seats each.  That may be a good exercise if you are being a bit <Col N="2049" /> soft in politics but we must remember that two of the three parties are members of the Coalition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>What is wrong with that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a great deal wrong with that if the Minister has drawn up the constituencies to ensure that.  The whole idea is to ensure that in a three-seat constituency you get two Fine Gael men and a Labour man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

I said I hope I will never see the day when an Opposition party becomes part of the establishment at such conniving to ensure that the parties would have one seat each.  It may be that there are people outside the three main parties who have ambitions to enter this House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy asked to have it withdrawn and I would say the same thing.  We are not being acrimonious.  We are trying to be helpful.  If we liked the Bill and where selfish we would not criticise it but we see the weakness in it and we see how it could be improved.  Therefore, we propose that you withdraw the Bill, appoint an outside body and let them redraft the Bill.  We could not blame the Minister then; he could always say: &ldquo;You appointed the outside body.&rdquo;  It would be the same as in the case of price control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said he was independent.  Is he independent Labour or official Labour?  I could make another suggestion, but I shall not.  At this stage the Bill has been under discussion for about four hours and it is early in the proceedings.  The Minister has an excellent chance of going to the Government&mdash;and this time he could include the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy Kelly&mdash;and let them have another look at it.  I always enjoy the Parliamentary Secretary's speeches. They remind me of when I was at school listening to a good lecture.  I do not know whether it serves the purpose here or not.  The Minister might well tell us why he has to divide Dublin into three-seaters while in other places he has five-seaters.  He even mentioned that he could make the whole country one area.  That would not be very practicable and we do not criticise the Minister on that score, but he should have some common pattern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil did not introduce a common pattern.  They did some of the most ridiculous things.  I have all the files and the Deputy can look at them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister wants to spend time going through files he is welcome but I could not join him. The point is that the Minister's attitude was that he would not adopt the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party in drafting a Bill on their own.  That was not good enough.  An outside body would do this.  One must make a good case for doing it or not doing it.  The Minister has made a good case.  In fact, he has convinced me if I was ever to be convinced, that an outside body could not do any worse; I do not know whether they could do better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could still accept Deputy Molloy's proposal. I am sure we would all accept the findings of the court and the Minister would, at least, have removed the <Col N="2052" /> doubt and suspicion in the minds of the people that he played very cleverly with this Bill.  Despite his protestations of disinterestedness as regards who is elected, nobody believes that.  We think in this measure the Minister has gone as far as he could to ensure the return of the Government. People may say: &ldquo;What is wrong with that?&rdquo;  Perhaps there is nothing wrong with it if you accept that you may have been a bit cynical in that manoeuvre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be more cynical if, five minutes after it was discovered that the Coalition had won the election, the leader of the former Government was prepared to concede that a committee was the best way to deal with the matter.  Now it is going to be the effective policy of Fianna Fáil.  You are making yourselves silly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  In my earlier days in this House before the last election I listened to what the Opposition said and I thought that perhaps some of them were sincere and that, perhaps, what they suggested was the proper course.  Picture my disappointment now when I find the Government are not doing what they said they would do.  They are going to do things in their way as they did before and carry on&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>You admit that you are not going to change, and that you will carry on in the tradition of not appointing an external body to adjudicate on the redrafting of the constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have tried to meet the Minister very fairly and to point out the weaknesses we see in the Bill.  We are not convinced that the Minister is doing his best for the country by putting 13 three-seaters and one-four seater in the Dublin area, or that he is serving the national purpose by breaching <Col N="2053" /> county boundaries and by emphasising the fact that Dublin is to have three-seater constituencies while down in Cork, which is also an urban area, he is best serving the national purpose by carving a huge piece out of the city and putting it into the county, in Mid-Cork.  This does not stand examination.</P>
    <P>Should one wonder what is the reason behind this?  Is it that the people in Cork city are less urban than those in Dublin city?  That cannot be accepted.  I suggest, therefore, that what the Minister's critics are saying is true, that he is trying to carve out a seat for a Labour Deputy in Cork and the only way he can do this is by twisting the boundaries, hoping in this way to achieve his ambition.  Should the Minister succeed in that I think it would be a Pyrrhic victory because the people would see that while, perhaps, the manoeuvre had succeeded they could make sure in future elections it would not succeed.  I shall have more to say on this matter on the next Stage.  I look forward to seeing a changed attitude on the Minister's part when he will realise that what we suggest is not in the interests of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or the Labour Parties, but that it is in the national interest that this Bill be redrafted.  He should again examine the records of those in the present Government who loudly and almost violently advocated that this operation would be better done by an outside body.  In all earnestness I suggest that the Minister take home the Bill this afternoon and examine it.</P>

      <P>The Minister must be joking.  It would be unfair of us to agree to that because our duty is to ensure that the people's wishes are met and we hold the Minister to his promises in the hope that we will have a new Electoral (Amendment) Bill that will be as perfect as we can make it.  We put our entire resources at the disposal of the Minister.  Our advice is given in the best interests of the <Col N="2054" /> country.  We appeal to the Minister to ask himself why the west is being deprived to a great degree of representation.</P>
      <P>As a Dubliner I will protest against the representation the Minister is allocating to the Dublin city area. The figure for the deviation from the national average in Dublin South-East is plus 800 and the figure in west Galway is minus 542.  Dublin and Galway are fairly well separated.  I ask the Minister to examine the thinking behind this.  Why should the Dublin area, which I represent, be given a bonus of 800 while west Galway is given a minus figure?</P>

      <P>This shows the thinking behind the Bill.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach referred to the Dublin representation.  Because of economic and historic factors, Dublin <Col N="2055" /> has a large population.  We should bend over backwards to ensure that we do not become a completely urbanised society and that the people will not be represented by an undue number of urban Deputies.  The Minister still has time to re-examine the matter and to ensure that the Bill is, in his own words, as perfect as possible. There is a long session ahead before the debate on the Bill is concluded.  I look forward to the next Stage when we can have the Minister's observations on the suggestions we have made to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceEDockrell" hpid="Mr. M.E. Dockrell Mr. M.E. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  Although there has been criticism from the opposite benches this is a sincere effort on the part of the Coalition Government to deal with the question of constituencies and their representation in the light of the statutory obligations and the obligations laid down by the courts.  The Minister has been very careful to point out that in arriving at the figures referred to in the Bill with regard to the various constituencies he has been anxious to avoid giving grounds to have a case brought before the courts.</P>
      <P>All of us in the House are bound by what the courts rule.  It is very difficult for any Government to meet exactly the requirements within the very narrow limits of tolerance allowed. That is one of the difficulties that we have.</P>
      <P>I did not hear Deputy Moore's argument about Dublin and Galway.  The western seaboard has sent very many people to the House down through the years who have shed lustre on our proceedings. I do not know how anybody could contend that this Government have been in any way severe in regard to the representation for the west.  On the contrary, as the Minister will point out later, the exact opposite is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The city of Dublin has a very large share of the population of this island. Naturally, that fact must be recognised in the legislation.  The people of Dublin must be, are and always have been represented in the House to the fullest extent that is possible.  I have represented a Dublin constituency for <Col N="2056" /> over 30 years.  When I came into the House in 1943 the constituency which honoured me by electing me then was a seven-member constituency.  It stretched from Chapelizod on the extreme west to the harbour mouth. I am not sure if the Pigeon House fort came into my constituency or not, but the constituency did extend to it.  On the other side, the constituency was bound by the canal.  It ran between the Liffey and the canal.  That constituency was represented by seven Members.  Then there came a change. The constituency was reduced. Inchicore was taken away and the constituency went only as far as the traffic lights at Kilmainham and Mountbrown.  The whole of Inchicore was cut off and the constituency became a five-member constituency.</P>
    <P>As you know, the constituency is now a four-member constituency.  On the south side, where it used to take in parts of Ringsend it does not do so now.  A fairly large spread containing a large number of people was added. On the north side of the Liffey the constituency went as far as the canal and included the area at the back of Mountjoy Jail and from there almost to Charlemount House.  It was a very unwieldy, awkward constituency.</P>
    <P>The House may not realise that Dublin is divided roughly into two sections&mdash;north and south of the Liffey.  It is rather dangerous to try to mix the two sections.  When I say &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; I do not mean that the people from the north and south do not get on, they do, but the people from the north side seldom cross the Liffey to the south and <i>vice versa</i>.  I am very glad that my constituency has gone back to the old situation. Dublin South Central now lies where it did historically, between Kilmainham and the south side of the docks. That is a proposed three-member constituency.  Taking everything into consideration that is as fair a way as possible of dividing that portion of the city.  It is not generally realised that all constituencies fit into each other like a jigsaw puzzle.  If one constituency is altered the other contiguous constituencies must also be altered, and then the other constituencies they touch must be changed as well.  That <Col N="2057" /> has been done fairly in the case of Dublin South Central.</P>
    <P>I do not like three-member constituencies under proportional representation. The pure theory of proportional representation presupposes and demands that a constituency should be as large as possible and therefore five- and seven-member constituencies gain a truer picture of the wishes of the voters than do three-member constituencies.  There is a drawback to the very large member constituencies which follow in theory the pure exercise of proportional representation. They tend to lead to splinter representation. &ldquo;Splinter representation,&rdquo; while it follows accurately the theory of proportional representation, often means that practical government becomes much more difficult. What we are concerned with here is to produce a method which will ensure the good despatch of Government in accordance with the democratic wishes.  While I shed a furtive tear for the large-member constituencies, I realise that the finest flowering of proportional representation might have the result of bringing the Government to a standstill.  None of us wants to see that done.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government, when in office, did not pay much attention to five-member or seven-member constituencies; in fact, they did away with them as far as possible.  In three-member constituencies certain small elements of the population are being disfranchised.  Perhaps &ldquo;disfranchised&rdquo; is not the correct term because the people have the vote as they always did, but it is not now possible for a comparatively small group of people to get a member to represent their views elected in a three-member constituency.  It is obvious, especially in the city of Dublin, that in most of the three-member constituencies there will very likely be a Fianna Fáil, a Fine Gael and a Labour representative. In the three-member constituency I represent, that will probably be the result of the next election, whenever it may be.  Of course there may be swings but the marginal swings which occur in the normal way in politics do not appear in the same way in proportional <Col N="2058" /> representation.  One sees in England a very slight variation in the way in which the people vote as between Conservative and Labour.  This can result in an enormous swing of votes.  The House of Commons can change overnight from a huge majority for one party to a majority for the opposite party, caused by something like a 5 per cent swing. That of course is impossible in a country which acts under proportional representation.  It is good that we are saved the enormous swings.</P>
    <P>The Irish electorate have a clear understanding of politics and could probably withstand the shocks that are experienced across the water by reason of violent changes.  However, it suits us better to have a more gradual system of change.  As I have been careful to point out, the three-seat constituency does not follow the purist's theory of PR but, nevertheless, in such constituencies there is a big element of the best use of PR.  For instance, there is a greater degree of representation of the underdog while at the same time complete fragmentation is avoided whereas this could occur where there is very large representation.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the reason why France was plagued for so many years by unstable governments was that the use of PR there led inevitably to a multiplicity of parties. There was another school of political theory which said that the real reason for that state of affairs in France in the 1930s was because of the government not having to face a general election on being defeated in the House.  I would be inclined to go along with the school of thought which said that their constituencies were too large because that situation must have led to fragmentation.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I welcome this Bill from the point of view of the PR theory.  It is retaining this system that has become so important to the Irish people. I shall not dwell on our history during this debate but it is because of our history that we take opposite viewpoints on many subjects, including political theory but PR helps to bring <Col N="2059" /> the different parties together in the same way as the horseshoe-shaped arrangement of this Chamber results in a blending together of the parties. Of course the philosophical theory of both sides of the House is basically the same.</P>
    <P>The proposal before us would result in 148 representatives being returned to this House.  From time to time we have heard people say that it is not necessary to have as many as the present 144 Deputies but I would not agree with that.  We are aware that in other countries there may be only one representative for as many as 50,000 people but that sort of situation in this country would lead to a breakdown of the whole business.  We must remember that of the 144 Members of this House more than 20 are Minister and Parliamentary Secretaries. So far as the Opposition party are concerned they must have shadow ministers who must be prepared to acquaint themselves with the specialised work on which they are the spokesmen. Now that we are in the EEC we need to have people to attend at the various deliberations on the Continent. These men and women are lost to us and their work must be undertaken by those of us who remain at home.  We shoulder willingly this extra work but it is becoming difficult to handle the amount entailed now and this is likely to increase in the future.  A total of 144 Deputies is dangerously low when those factors are taken into consideration.  I am glad to see 148 Deputies will now represent the full complement of this House.  In fact, from the point of view of having sufficient people here to consider Government matters, to consider the running of the country which is their business, it is a good move.</P>

      <P>Future plans for the airport contain provision for the extension of the passenger facilities.

      <P>I am informed by the ESB that every effort is being made to share available power as fairly as possible amongst all customers on a rota basis and to give the best available advance notice to each customer of the times he is at risk of interruption of supply.  Such a rota involves an extensive switching arrangement throughout the country. Each switch controls supply to a large number of customers.  It is not possible in the vast majority of cases to maintain supply to individual customers unless all other customers controlled by the same switch are also to have supply available to them.  For this reason, it is necessary strictly to limit the number of categories of customer to be exempted from supply interruption.</P>

      <P>I will take up with the ESB the matter raised by the Deputy.  In my opinion the ESB have been very good in the past few weeks in this crisis.  They have endeavoured to facilitate people as much as possible.  There are many factors outside their control.  Obviously to the person who is making a case his case seems genuine but the ESB cannot create an excessive number of exempted categories or eventually it would end up with everybody having a supply and then everybody would be without a supply as a natural follow on.  I am hopeful the talks going on at the moment will result in a settlement but if not I will take up with the ESB the point made by the Deputy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as entrance to the Training Colleges and the award of Regional Technical College and other Department scholarships are concerned it would clearly be inequitable to give double credits for a single subject since these awards <Col N="2074" /> are made on a competitive basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the award of a higher education grant depends on the achievement of four honours at higher level papers in the leaving certificate.  In respect of higher mathematics, my predecessor made available higher education grants on foot of higher mathematics and two other subjects and I agree with his decision.  I did the same in relation to Irish and two other subjects.  In so far as that is an incentive it can be regarded as such; in so far as mathematics honours is an incentive, that is also the case.  I cannot make it any clearer than that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not making any allegation.  I am simply clarifying the position as I understand it from the Minister and, apparently, I have clarified it correctly.  Does it follow that the incentive the Minister talks about does not apply in any of the other cases mentioned here with regard to regional technical colleges and so on?  Is it the case that the only incentive is in relation to higher education grants which are of limited <Col N="2076" /> application, related to income and other matters?  Is this correct?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. However, may I explain to the Deputy that higher education grants are available on an open basis?  There is no restriction of numbers.  Entry to the training colleges and regional technical colleges are on a competitive basis.  As I said in reply to Deputy Tunney, it would be inequitable to do other than I have done.  In so far as higher education grants are an open competition, the incentive in there.  I never said anything in my statement of 5th April in relation to regional technical colleges or entry to training colleges.  Only those who wish to misrepresent my position have brought in this extra dimension in the matter in order to reduce the attractiveness of the incentive which I have offered in place of compulsion.  As the Minister for Education, I challenge any Member of the Opposition party to substantiate the allegations made on 8th September by Deputy Tunney and by the President of the Gaelic League.</P>

      <Col N="2077" /> that as an incentive to pupils to study Irish in an intensive manner and to a high standard, Irish at the higher level will be regarded from 1973 onwards as two subjects for higher education grants purposes. This concession already applies in the case of higher level Mathematics in view of the range and complexity of the subject.  It is not the intention that the concession of two subject equivalence should apply to both Irish and Mathematics in the case of any individual pupil.</P>

      <P>The statement I made on 5th April was as follows:</P>
      <P>I have also under active consideration the possibility of introducing into the post-primary curriculum a course of Irish studies which, while comprehending Irish language and literature, will not have a restrictive linguistic orientation and will encompass such matters as social history and traditions, as well as the evaluation and appreciation of the various cultures which have gone into the making of modern Ireland.  Such a course, I consider, could be of value to all students but particularly to those with little aptitude for language learning.</P>
      <P>I was personally responsible for putting to the officials of my Department at the time the idea that we should investigate the possibilities, as I put it here, of introducing this subject into the curriculum.  Deputy Tunney, in the course of the Education debate here, tried to give the impression, to use his own favourite phrase, that I had already decided on this.  I was only three weeks a Minister at this time and I never gave the impression that I had already thought out fully the subject &ldquo;Irish Studies&rdquo; and I quoted the actual statement made on 5th April, which put matters beyond doubt.</P>

I had available to me information going back as far as 1957 when people, such as the present Archbishop of Tuam, advocated this very thing.  This subject was already being taught in the National College of Physical Education, or one of the colleges, in Limerick. It was not a totally new idea but the suggestion that it should be put on the post-primary course was new and it emanated from me and I am now in process of consultation with the people involved.</P>

When they seem to have the door open to achieve this, and it seems to be a matter of <Col N="2082" /> just pushing the door, those in authority become very reluctant and the result is we are left short in every sense of the word and our latest effort in looking for additional accommodation as a last resort is an effort to try to get something done.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education if he will consider increasing substantially the annual maintenance grants for primary schools in view of the difficulties experienced by school managers in raising money to supplement the present grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount provided in the current financial year for <Col N="2083" /> the heating, cleaning and painting of national schools represents an increase of £99,600 over that made available in 1972-73.  The question whether it may be possible to allow further improvements in the rates of these grants in the forthcoming financial year will be considered in connection with the preparation of the Estimates for that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister tell me on what basis those grants are allocated?  Is it a percentage of the total expenditure by the manager, is it on the average number on the roll, or is it on the number of rooms in the school?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Circular 12/73 deals with this matter.  It is a notice to managers.  The grants are based on the number of classrooms and this deals with special amounts of money for external painting and internal painting respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be more equitable to give a percentage of the total expenditure each year by the manager?  I know the painting grants are paid only every so many years, but I am talking about the annual maintenance grants for heating and cleaning and paying labour.  We all know the cost of materials and the cost of labour has gone up.  I have a case in the city of Dublin where the manager is getting £900 and spending £4,500.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The rules for national schools provide that a school manager is responsible for making arrangements for the collection of such funds locally in supplement of the State grant as will ensure that school premises will be adequately heated and cleaned and kept in a proper condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the manager should not <Col N="2084" /> have to collect £4,500 every year from poor people and only get a grant of £900.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that managers of national schools would like if the State could increase its grant in respect of national schools, but if I were to meet the requests which are before me now I would have to increase the grant five-fold, which is not something I can do readily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he has yet decided what is to be done by way of providing adequate facilities for technical education in Buncrana, County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of facilities for technical education in Buncrana, County Donegal, is being considered in the context of the future development of secondary education in the centre.  I am not yet in a position to give a decision in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Minister is fully aware of the extreme difficulties and the lack of facilities and accommodation that have existed in Buncrana for a considerable time. Is he aware that a contract was negotiated at one stage and was before the Department for sanction?  We got that far and yet today we have not got one bit further.  The difficulties are diabolical and no help has been forthcoming from the Department of Education in regard to technical education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that there are two secondary schools in Buncrana, one managed by the County Donegal Vocational Education Committee and the other by the Sisters of Mercy.  As in Ballyshannon and as in so many other areas, it is not a lack of appreciation of the difficulties by the Department that is causing the delay but the difficulty of arranging suitable school accommodation for the numbers of pupils in these particular centres.  At the moment the number of pupils in <Col N="2085" /> the Bundoran secondary vocational school is 134 and I could not recommend in respect of that school that it should be rebuilt.  I am taking steps to see if we can find some solution for the problems of Buncrana.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that this is the sort of criterion that has been used by his Department to consolidate their own view at a given time?  Is he aware that it would be impossible to have more than 134 pupils in the existing premises?  Is he also aware that, since the date in 1965 when the contract documents were sent to the Department for sanction to build a new school at Ballyshannon, the adjoining secondary school was completely planned and built and is now in operation?  How was there sanction for one and not for the other?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not feel called upon to justify that particular decision.  All I can say is that we have provided mobile accommodation&mdash;two classrooms and toilets&mdash;in the vocational school this year.  The problem is that both schools are seeking metalwork facilities and the total enrolment of the catchment area would not justify the duplication of these facilities. I would suggest that perhaps the solution here would be to bring representatives of both schools to meet me and to thrash out the whole problem and I am issuing an invitation to them to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I thank the Minister for that invitation which our vocational education committee will be very glad to accept and I am sure the secondary people will as well? Would he bear in mind that the situation as now seen in the Department should not be taken at its face value? He should go back a little bit.  The inclusion of metalwork in a convent school side by side with a vocational school is surely a strange departure, to say the least of it.</P>

      <P>The present social insurance system provides flat-rate benefits to meet the seven contingencies which interrupt earning capacity and are recognised in international <Col N="2088" /> conventions as requiring to be covered by income maintenance services in a social security system.  These are sickness, invalidity, maternity, unemployment, death of breadwinner, occupational injuries and disease and old age.</P>
      <P>Apart from the regular improvements in the rates of payment of the various benefits, the possibility of improving the system in other ways is constantly under review.</P>
      <P>A new scheme of pay-related benefit to supplement the flat-rate benefits payable during short-term unemployment or incapacity for work will be brought into operation from the beginning of April, 1974, and, at the same time, the social insurance system will be extended to cover all employees. This is in line with the policy of moving towards a comprehensive social security system covering all citizens. In furtherance of that policy, other ways of improving the system, including the possibility of extending social insurance to the self-employed, are under examination.  At this stage, however, I cannot say when further improvements are likely to be made.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Chair, I should like to make a statement.  This morning in the course of Deputy Molloy's speech there was an interruption by me on the average population for Deputies in certain areas.  I stated in good faith from information I got that the average population for Deputies in Dublin was 20,840.  I should like to correct that: I am now informed that the correct figure is 20,142.  It is only fair to put that on the record.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.E. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are fascinating asides going on and the future of the party opposite is being accurately prognosticated by the Deputy on my left.  These interesting asides and prognostications reveal the shape of things to come for the Opposition.  They are on their way out.</P>
      <P>Before Question Time I had been referring to the increase in the number of Deputies from 144 to 148.  I hope that this will not be regarded as an unnecessary extravagance or anything like that because the increase is very small.  If the four extra Deputies represent their constituencies, as I am sure they will, in a proper manner that will more than outweigh the trifling extra cost represented by their allowances and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stress this point about the number <Col N="2094" /> of Deputies because I have often thought that we suffered badly from lack of Deputies and that the State business suffered because there simply were not enough of us to go round.  I have seen our representation compared with that in other larger countries.  It takes 20,000 citizens to elect a Member here while across the water the figure is probably 80,000. If we were to adopt the higher ratio of people per Deputy that is adopted in big countries there would be only about 30 Members here.  If that were the case it would be manifestly impossible to run the country properly, from the democratic point of view and to give utterance to the various points of view which exist and to watch the Government of the day, as is the business of Parliament.  In fact, we need more Members than we have.</P>
    <P>While I do not suggest that this is the moment to go for much bigger representation I believe that having regard to the complexity of government and the multiplicity of items which come before us it will be realised eventually that even 148 Members are not sufficient to man the various offices and to carry on the business of Parliament, particularly in view of the altered conditions that now obtain since we have become a Member of the EEC.  I believe that by the time the next revision of constituencies comes around there will be a serious movement in the country to have much bigger representation in the Dáil in view of the difficulties and complexity of government and as government enters more and more into the life of every citizen.  I nearly said &ldquo;into their pockets.&rdquo;  It certainly is taking an increasing share from them in the form of taxation which hits every section of the population.</P>
    <P>That bigger and wider view of government means that of necessity a greater burden is thrown on to Deputies.  At the moment we are stretched a bit too thin on the ground. Taking into account the number of Deputies who are away in Strasbourg, who are attending meetings, doing very important business, very few are left to man the various Committees of the House.  As a matter of fact, I <Col N="2095" /> should be at a committee meeting at this moment, but one cannot be in two places at the same time.</P>
    <P>These are the sort of problems which will come increasingly before the House.  This is a matter that the whole House would have to consider and in which the country would have to acquiesce.  The tendency will be for the House to grow larger so that the best interests of Ireland can be served and Parliamentary business can be discussed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and the way in which the Minister has introduced it. He has been very fairminded about it and has been most helpful in the reception of criticism and proposals for alterations.  What he and the Government want to do is to ensure that the constituencies are workable and conform to geographic requirements and to the wishes of the people.  I referred briefly to the constituency which I, with others, represent. Although I personally regret leaving many friends on the north side of the Liffey, I think the revision makes the constituency more workable.  Where there is a natural division, as there is in Dublin, caused by the Liffey, it should be taken into account in drawing up the electoral area.  I know there has been the same care for other geographical boundaries in the drafting of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There are considerations other than the numerical one of population. The law lays down what we must do in this matter but sometimes it can lead to geographical absurdity.  For instance a Member may have to cross a mountain in order to get from one part of his constituency to another.  The Minister has endeavoured, to the best of his ability, to have regard to these considerations.</P>
    <P>I noted with interest what the Minister said in regard to the constituencies. The maximum constituency is five-member and there are very few of those.  Of course, they do allow for greater flexibility in providing for proportional representation.  We must bear in mind that while it is admirable to give the fullest rein to what I may call the purist theories of proportional <Col N="2096" /> representation, they do not always act in the greatest national interest.  This situation is a fair way of compromising between very big constituencies and a complete negation of proportional representation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and applaud the Minister for the manner in which he brought it in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Minister will be as susceptible to proposals from this side of the House.  I do not think our representations will receive the same degree of acceptance as the proposals which emanated from Deputies on the Government benches. Deputy Dockrell mentioned that he found it hard to be in two places at once.  I agree with him, but it will be necessary for some Deputies to be able to do this if they are to represent some of the constituencies as proposed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a first examination of the Bill there would not appear to be any consistent pattern.  But when one goes into detail it emerges that the political consideration of the National Coalition is the main factor.  The Minister quite blandly asserts that this is not so.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister spilt the beans.  I congratulate him for this speech because he laid it before the House that the one factor above all others which influenced the thinking behind this Bill was political expediency.  I have great sympathy for him.  He was, to my mind, in a dilemma as he tried to justify with figures the ravages done by the Minister in the name of this Bill.  It was pitiful and pathetic to hear him trying to justify the deliberate dropping of representation in western areas.  Deputy Molloy showed conclusively that the western areas, by that I mean the province of Connacht, Clare and Donegal, should <Col N="2097" /> have retained the representation by 30 Deputies, regardless of their political affiliations.  One might say that this Bill is akin to the wandering minstrel in &ldquo;The Mikado&rdquo;, a thing of shreds and patches.  I remember the outcry which was raised when the county of Leitrim was divided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us consider the county of Roscommon.  Under this Bill I have a particular interest in part of this county thanks to the Minister's surgery&mdash;maybe &ldquo;surgery&rdquo; is too strong a word&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy not like the Roscommon people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Roscommon is like Gaul of old&mdash;divided into three parts. I remember the promises and declarations made in the case of Leitrim that if Fine Gael were in power they would put Leitrim back as an entity.  Alas, promises were made to be forgotten. Maybe the Labour blood which was added to the National Coalition diluted the blood of the Fine Gael Party because Leitrim is still divided. The Minister could quite easily have put Leitrim and Roscommon together and had a four-seat constituency.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach made valiant efforts to say that the Minister could not have done otherwise than to reduce the western representation.  He also said, if my memory serves me right, that the Minister would have been in defiance of the Constitution if he had done this.  It should be placed on record that the Minister would not have been in defiance of the Constitution if he had kept the representation.  Deputy Molloy quoted figures.  It will do no <Col N="2098" /> harm if another western Deputy, such as myself, were to say that if the Minister had retained the 30 Deputies, that the average, even excluding Athlone West Urban, would have been 19,141.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, also, was very anxious to assure the House that the people of the west are not simple and that they will see the reason for the Bill, that they will realise it was introduced as a result of previous court decisions which left the Minister with no option but to reduce their representations.  I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that the people of the west are not simple and that they will realise the principle behind the Bill&mdash;the dropping of two of their Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes a total of five when the three dropped last time are taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not interested in what happened then.  The people will realise that their representation is being reduced in the interest of political expediency and in the Government's hope that the two seats lost will be Fianna Fáil ones.  In introducing the Second Stage today the Minister told us that his objective in drawing up his proposals was, first, to ensure fair and reasonable representation for the people of every area and, secondly, that, as he had stated already, he was endeavouring in so far as possible&mdash;he covered himself nicely by the use of that phrase &mdash;to avoid breaching existing administrative boundaries and was endeavouring to ensure that natural communities were not split unnecessarily among different constituencies.  In regard to my own constituency I am one Fianna Fáil Deputy who is not very happy with the Minister's proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be an odd man out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I have certain reservations in regard to the division of this constituency of East Mayo where the average population per Member is minus 851 while in West Mayo the figure is minus 20.  I will leave it to the Minister to explain his proposals for my constituency.  It has been seen <Col N="2099" /> fit to remove from the northern end of East Mayo a number of areas, some of which could have been left as they were without in any way violating consitutional requirements. We will do our best to disappoint the advisers to the Minister in so far as this constituency is concerned in that we will hold two seats there.  Anybody examining the map of the constituency will see that it is shaped like a bottle&mdash;round at one end and has a narrow funnel, a funnel that is approximately seven miles wide.  A publication which did not take the side of Fianna Fáil in the last general election&mdash;<i>The Western People</i>&mdash;has not expressed satisfaction with the division of the constituency.  They say there has been a sacrifice in so far as not only is an effort being made to take a considerable amount of support from me but that a Senator who was a Taoiseach's nominee is being sacrificed.</P>
      <P>Since the National Coalition assumed office the most consistent theme of their reign has been the complete change over from their principles as expounded while they were in opposition. Deputies Molloy and Moore dealt this morning with that turnabout, especially in respect of Fine Gael who, some years ago, sought leave to introduce a Bill for the purpose of setting up a commission to deal with the question of constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that their one interest now is self-interest, that their priorities are those which are in their own interest.  However, that would be much more palatable if it were stated openly although it was inferred this morning by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach.  Deputies must be aware that this Bill is a compromise one in that, on the one hand, the Minister had to satisfy two parties and on the other, he had to satisfy individual Deputies in those two parties.  It is common knowledge that originally the divide in Mayo was to have been between north and south, but as this would not be suitable to one of their Deputies, if not two, <Col N="2100" /> urgent representations were made to the Minister not to go ahead with that proposal.  One fails to see the the logic of three-seat constituencies in Dublin city and a five-seater in Cork, unless it is for the sole purpose of party advantage.  There can be no other logical explanation.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Dockrell explaining the difference between the north of the Liffey and the south of the Liffey and stating how glad he was that his constituency would now be south of the Liffey.  In the next breath he stated that some Deputies might have to cross mountains.  I suppose the new bridge across the Liffey will help Deputy Dockrell also.</P>
    <P>At another stage I propose to show the Minister that in relation to my own area he could have left a considerable amount of the areas he has taken from East Mayo without, in any way, violating the constitutional requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>In the few years I have been in this House I do not recall ever noticing so much interest in a Bill before it was introduced as the Bill which we are now discussing on the Second Stage.  For the past six months in the corridors of the House, and elsewhere, the main topic of discussion has been the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1973.  One would have imagined that the Minister for Local Government, who had charge of making that revision, a charge which he has to carry out under the Constitution, had the power to draw the constituencies in such a manner that after the next general election we would arrive back with 148 National Coalition Deputies and not a single Fianna Fáil representative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was in the minds of some people.  They felt the Minister for Local Government could go to that extreme.  The Bill he has presented was a feat in so far as it has been fair to everybody.  The Minister has had a most unenviable task and I do not think any man would have met the situation better than he has done.  I am, therefore, at a loss to know what all the fuss is about now.  Let us pass the Bill quickly and get on with the more important work which will face <Col N="2101" /> the House and the nation in the months to come.</P>
    <P>I know well that those words will fall on deaf ears and that this will drag on to such an extent that the country will be sick and tired listening and hearing of constituency revisions.  When the end of the day comes, and the Bill is finally passed, nobody will know what it was all about until election time comes.</P>
    <P>As for the accusation of gerrymandering, I should like to state that in my opinion there is no such a thing as gerrymandering constituencies.  It just cannot be done. The former Minister for Local Government did as good a job at that, or made as good an attempt at it, as any man who ever occupied the position and yet, under his very Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In my constituency we have seen a movement of the population at every revision.  For years we were part of Carlow-Kilkenny.  At the next revision we took in a slice of Meath and a slice of Westmeath and at the last revision we gave a slice to the constituency of Meath.  On this occasion, probably because of our proximity to the city of Dublin, and because our housing programme is under such pressure from Dublin to cater for a rise in population, we have to sacrifice a large slice of our county to Dublin and to Meath.</P>
      <P>One area that is going into the West Dublin Constituency, Leixlip, is a newly built-up area inhabited by people working in the city.  Most of these are city-orientated and, to my mind, it is to their advantage to be there.  We are losing the town of Maynooth, a university town, and the same thing applies there.  As soon as the Minister receives the plans and gives his sanction for the extension of the services the town of Celbridge will expand at such a rate that the same situation will prevail and it will be another dormitory town.  The division there has been fair to the newcomers but to the oldtimers it will be a change they will not like.  As their representative I regret that they have to leave the constituency.  That is one of the hazards in a constituency revision. It cannot be avoided.  I am convinced that they will be represented excellently by the Deputies they will elect in that new constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Kildare will then continue to be a three-seater.  For those of us who represent it at the moment it will be more compact and it will be easier to keep in touch with the people.  In the smaller constituencies, while the population is still there, it will be easier to keep in touch with them. Therefore the Minister was absolutely right in increasing the number of three-seat constituencies.  It is amazing to think that in all the years the population in Laois-Offaly has never <Col N="2103" /> varied.  It reminds me of the advertising jargon on the radio in the morning: Like so-and-so's flour it never varies.  This constituency has always retained its five seats.  Carlow-Kilkenny also has five seats.  If all the constituencies had remained the same the Minister would have had no problem. In trying to make the changes I am certain he was aware that he would not please everybody.  That was not possible.  He has done a reasonable job.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the setting up of a commission to redraw the constituencies.  On a previous occasion some of my learned colleagues introduced a Bill to that effect. With all due respect to them, to the media and all others who advocate that, I feel it would be a wasted exercise. Having completed their task the commission would have to submit their recommendations to the Dáil and, no matter which side was in power, somebody would not agree and it would eventually come back to the politicians to settle it themselves.  Unless you give a commission absolute power to redraw the constituencies with no further reference back to the Dáil it will be a wasted exercise and a complete failure.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to section 7 which provides:</P>
    <P>(1)  Where a polling district existing at the passing of this Act is not wholly situate within one of the constituencies specified in the Schedule to this Act, the appropriate officer, after consultation with the returning officer for the constituency concerned, shall, with respect to the part of the polling district situate in a constituency so specified&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  join it or parts of it with any adjoining polling district or districts ....</P>
    <P>That is extremely unfair to the people in that polling district.  All too often the Irish people are called parochial but, when it comes to election time, parochialism is very noticeable.  If a polling district is divided at election time people may find that one side of the road is in a particular polling <Col N="2104" /> district all of which voted in X at the last election.  They now find that they have to go to one constituency on one side of the road to vote and another constituency on the other side of the road to vote.  I would ask the Minister to have another look at that and see if it would be possible to leave the entire polling district in a particular constituency, whether it is being moved from one constituency to another, or being left as it is in the existing constituency.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>This is an increase of four over present representation and is the maximum number permissible under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Does that mean that if the population goes up to 10 million between now and the next census, we cannot have more than 148 Deputies?  This gives food for thought and it should be looked into before it arises.  With God's help and the help of the National Coalition Government the population will reach that figure.  We should not wait until it does to make the necessary change.  I thank the Minister and I congratulate him on the job he has done.  I hope the Bill will be received favourably by the House and as quickly passed as possible.</P>

      <P>Like the previous speaker I believe it is not very easy to gerrymander the constituencies.  It has been alleged that this was done by a previous Minister for Local Government.  An analysis of the two elections which took place in 1969 and 1973 to my mind proves more or less conclusively that gerrymandering cannot be carried out as easily as some people suggest.</P>
      <P>Taking the constituency of Waterford, Fianna Fáil got two seats in 1969 and one in 1973.  In Laois/Offaly, Fianna Fáil got three seats in 1969 and two in 1973.  There was a change in Longford-Westmeath.  In 1969, Roscommon-Leitrim and Sligo-Leitrim gave Fianna Fáil two seats and one in 1973.  Both Monaghan and Cavan gave two seats to Fine Gael in 1969 and one to Fianna Fáil.  They changed that representation in 1973. The same thing obtained in the two Mayo constituencies and a further example is the constituency of Kildare.  Taking the overall picture I am not prepared to accept that gerrymandering can be carried out as easily as some people outside the House suggest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I see it&mdash;and I have expressed this view before&mdash;much depends on the people and how they react at the time of an election to the various political parties and to the Government. What I see happening is this: the interest is more in the particular Deputies than in their parties.  So far as possible Deputies look after their own interests, I understand, by making representations to the Minister.  I have never done that.  They hope that with luck the accumulation of their interests will be to the advantage of the political party to which they belong. Perhaps it works in some cases and does not in others.  I have the impression that the Minister if given the choice would have preferred somebody else to draft this Bill.  In the past he has expressed views completely contradictory to what he is proposing <Col N="2106" /> now.  However, I realise he must carry out the duties of his office and must do what is expected of him.</P>
    <P>I live in the north-west of the country.  There are four counties&mdash; Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo and Roscommon&mdash;near my area.  An analysis of the figures shows that if the Minister wished he could have given an extra seat in that area.  At the moment we have only 11 seats and I suggest we could have been given an extra one without any great imposition on tolerance. The figure we have been given for Donegal is 105,509, for Sligo-Leitrim it is 63,030, for Roscommon-Leitrim 63,358, giving a total of 213,897. Had the Minister decided to give us 12 seats on the basis of that number of votes, the average would be 19,326, which would be 797 below the national average.  This is not extraordinary because the constituency of Meath, which the Minister represents, and Louth have the following figures: Louth is 851 below the national average and Meath is 885 below the national average.</P>
    <P>An injustice is being done to my part of the country.  The areas are quite considerable, the population is falling, the constituencies are difficult to work and they impose considerable strain on Deputies.  A readjustment of the area, by giving an extra seat, would facilitate Members.  This would not guarantee any of the two major parties the extra seat.  The Sligo-Leitrim-Roscommon area is one of the most independent areas in the country.  During the years, my native county has proved this: they elected Count Plunket, they elected Sinn Féin Deputies, in the 1920s they gave a huge majority to Fine Gael which was changed to Fianna Fáil in the 1930s. My county elected Clann na Talmhan representatives in the 1940s, they elected a Clann na Poblachta Deputy in the 1950s, then changed back to Clann na Talmhan, to Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and back to Fine Gael. No other constituency has this pattern with this large floating vote.  It would be difficult for an Independent Deputy to propose an amendment to change this situation but we may try to do so.</P>
    <P>The matter of the division of <Col N="2107" /> Leitrim arises here.  In the past there has been much comment on this. Every county likes to remain on its own but unfortunately Leitrim and Roscommon have been subjected to partition during the years.  This affected Roscommon for a much longer period than Leitrim because part of that county went into Longford-Westmeath in the 1930s.  After the last electoral Bill, part of Roscommon went to South Galway and part to North Galway.  It is unfortunate that the amendment to the Constitution with regard to single constituencies was rejected by the people. Leitrim is still divided even though promises were made in the past that when the occasion would arise that county would be one constituency.</P>
    <P>My constituency is from 110 to 120 miles from one end to the other and this makes it difficult for Deputies.  It is not easy to see how we can change it now, but we will give some thought to the matter and perhaps we may put down an amendment.  I hope the Minister will give us sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <P>The Minister was forced by law to bring in this Bill and I would remind the House that it was Fianna Fáil who drafted the Constitution. The Minister had no alternative. Fianna Fáil should make up their minds about this Bill.  Some speakers talk about gerrymandering, while Deputy Moore has said it was impossible to please everyone.  I agree with the view expressed by Deputy Moore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The former Minister for local Government spoke about millions of acres of land.  What counts today&mdash;people or land?  He also spoke about the distances Deputies would have to cover. During the election campaign he covered much of the land when travelling by helicopter.  It is easy to knock a Bill, but Fianna Fáil have not offered any constructive criticism.  This continual carping is merely wasting the time of the House.  One Member from North Mayo admitted that this was his swan-song.  They talk about fewer Deputies representing the West.  This is the greatest indictment that could be made against Fianna Fáil.  The population <Col N="2108" /> has been falling in the West.  What alternative had the Minister?  Was he to go out into the Atlantic Ocean to see if he could get voters there?  A great deal of time is being wasted on this.</P>

He asks now why Clare is being brought in but he did not ask why Clare was brought in on the last occasion. It is not right for a man to blow hot and cold.  There is too much of that here.</P>
      <P>This Bill is not concerned with acres of land.  It is concerned with people. One may have to cover a great many acres to get to the people, but it is the people who count in this instance.  I congratulate the Minister on doing a good job.  There is a great deal of comanche country coming into my area and that is why Deputy Molloy rubbed his hands and said: &ldquo;I'm all right, Jack&rdquo;.  We will get a share of these too because they were knocking on my door for years.  In the High Court when a certain individual was questioning me hard and thought he had me cornered I turned the tables on him.  I produced letters out of my pocket and I said: &ldquo;People are already coming to me and if you, my lord, would like to read these letters, I have the proof here&rdquo;.  A great percentage of them to the present day are not knocking on my door but they are on the telephone.  It might be no harm for Deputy Molloy to know that. His &ldquo;I'm all right, Jack&rdquo; attitude is O.K., he is quite happy about the whole thing.  The time of the House is being wasted.  The Minister has done a good job.  He has not altogether pleased me but he could have displeased me more.  No matter what he does he will not please everybody.  The man above could not do that.  The Minister should not try to please everybody.</P>

      <P>Sligo and Leitrim could have been added together to form a four-seat constituency of 68,765 people.  Leitrim-Roscommon could have been a four-seater with 81,879 of a population.  When he was asked why he had taken seats away from the West, he said there should be even one less seat there and implied it was his generosity that was giving the West 28 seats instead of 27. In fact, with the population in the West at present there should be 29 seats.  We heard from Deputy Malone and we have learned from official documents that the increase in the number of representatives in the Oireachtas is as a result of an increase in the population.  Apparently all the increase in seats will be in Dublin, in the east of the country, where the Taoiseach's Ministers are all located, except for two.  Not one Minister is from west of the Shannon.  When he selected his Ministers I heard him say he was blessed with brains.  He had all kinds of doctors, Wise Men from the East, the Melchiors, Caspars and Balthasars, and these are the people obviously responsible for trying to justify an increase in Dublin and a decrease in the West of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clare is a West of Ireland constituency. It will have three seats.  It has a population of 20,910, the fourth highest number per T.D., whereas in Dublin South-East you have 19,292. In the Minister's constituency in Meath you have 19,238.  This constituency is adjacent to Dublin and, if I may say so, it is well represented by one of the wisest men of the east, the Minister himself.  If the increase in Dublin is justified by the increase in population, why is it not justified in County Clare where there has also <Col N="2110" /> been an increase in the population? The population at the moment is approximately 75,500 which would justify four seats working on the proportions on which the Minister has worked in County Meath and that would keep the county intact as a constituency. The Minister has made Clare a three-seat constituency and has taken roughly 13,000 people in Clare and added them to 65,300 people in West Galway where the population justifies only three seats.</P>
    <P>There is possibly an underlying motive there.  It has been suggested by the Press that the Minister is considering a seat for one of his own party and more luck to him.  I would ask him is he ignoring his own party in County Clare.  I am not trying to tell him or any of the members of the Labour Party how they should run their own business but up to some few years ago there was always a Labour representative in County Clare.  If he declared Clare a four-seat constituency his own party would put up a good fight for the fourth seat there. I mean that.  I am offering the suggestion in a friendly way in friendly rivalry.  The proposed new constituency of West Galway, for Deputy Coogan's information, stretches from the borders of Mayo down to almost the town of Ennis in Clare and as far as Ennistymon in West Clare.  You have every possible problem in that proposed constituency for any representative. You have mountains, as you know, in Connemara.  You have some good land.  There is the city of Galway with the problems of a city, there are a couple of small towns, there is the Gaeltacht, there are the islands.  There are the problems of fishing, forestry, land drainage, the various educational problems concerning double honours for Irish in Connemara and Aran.</P>

There will be 20,910 people per representative in the new County Clare constituency.  A big wedge of the western end of the existing Clare constituency has been added to West Galway.  A figure of 20,910 in a western constituency, the fourth highest.

I think there should be <Col N="2114" /> an amendment of the Constitution so that some percentage should be allowed to a Deputy in the West of Ireland and that he should represent about half or two-thirds of the number of people that a Dublin Deputy must represent.  I think that would be fair.  The constituency I represented previously was many times bigger than County Dublin.  In the constituency to which I may go now with Deputy Coogan we shall have more problems.  If I do go there I shall make a small bet that the Minister's nominee will not get the fourth seat there.</P>
