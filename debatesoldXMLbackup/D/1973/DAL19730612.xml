      <P>I understand that the National Prices Commission are arranging to have a study of auctioneers' fees carried out by a consultant, but that, as yet, no similar arrangement has been made by the Commission in relation to solicitors' fees.  In accordance with the provisions of the Prices and Charges (Notification of Increases) Order, 1973, auctioneers or solicitors may not increase their fees without giving one month's advance notice to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am considering the setting up of a National Consumer Advisory Council to represent consumers generally.  One of the matters <Col N="132" /> on which I would hope to have the advice of this Council is the means by which the Government can encourage the activities of voluntary bodies in the field of consumer protection including price surveillance.  Until I have received the Council's advice, I shall take no decision on what these means should be.</P>

    <P>As I have already indicated in a reply to a Question on 9th May, 1973. I have put in train an examination of the present system of price control to see what improvements or alterations <Col N="133" /> may be desirable and feasible.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>We were led to believe by the Minister and by the Government as a whole that they had positive plans to deal with this price increase structure.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer has already been given to the Deputy.  As a former Minister, he knows the problems involved.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter cannot be treated as lightly as this by the Minister even though he is speaking on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  Is the Minister aware that recent price increases mentioned by the Minister have reached up to 60 per cent over and above the then existing price?  I refer, for example, to the price of tinned foods.  Is that the kind of price increase the Minister is going to allow without any stricter price controls being introduced as was promised by the Coalition?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy refers to the Merchandise Marks (Prepacked <Col N="135" /> Goods) (Marking and Quantities) Order, 1973, which was made on 29th January, 1973, and was due to come into effect on 1st October, 1973, I proposed to amend the order so as to defer its operative date to 1st February, 1974, and to relieve a few items of the obligation to be packed in prescribed sizes.  Over 100 representations were received before and after the making of the order, and while they are too varied to summarise they may be said to fall into two categories: a general plea for the postponement of the making of the order until such time as the shape of future EEC directives on the subject becomes evident, and particular proposals related to technical or practical difficulties arising in the case of particular products.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking a specific supplementary question but apparently I am not being allowed to.  I am asking the Minister why he decided to defer the making of this order, and why he deliberately postponed it in view of the fact that there is no such public demand for this order.  As Minister for Industry and Commerce I was criticised for not making it sooner.  Now we have the new Minister postponing it at the request of specific vested interests whom it does not suit, and the Minister is giving way to those people.</P>

The continuance of the mill's operation since the receiver's appointment has been possible only because of the provision of assistance from my Department to make good the operating losses involved.  As to the second part of the question, a number of proposals have been put to the IDA in relation to the future use of the mill premises and plant.  One of these relates to the provision of a new industry on which I understand negotiations are continuing. At this stage I do not think it would be proper for me to comment further on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the present prospects of the motor assembly industry in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.  I have had representations from the trade unions and both managements regarding a recent <Col N="138" /> development which would affect motor assembly in two Dublin concerns.  The position in this case is that the motor vehicle manufacturer involved recently announced their intention to set up near Dublin a new plant to manufacture motor vehicle components. In the discussions which took place last year with the Department of Industry and Commerce and the Industrial Development Authority the manufacturing firm concerned sought an assurance that, in consequence of their setting up a component plant here, they would be released from the requirement to maintain their level of assembly as a condition for the granting of facilities for the importation of fully built-up vehicles.  They were informed by my predecessor that he agreed in principle that as soon as production commenced in the component plant the firm concerned would be released from the requirement to maintain their level of Irish assembly and would be permitted to import in a fully built-up condition the motor vehicles in question; that the Irish Government were especially concerned to ensure that the transition from motor vehicle assembly to the manufacture of components should be achieved in an orderly manner and with the minimum possible dislocation of existing employment; that it was, therefore, the Government's earnest desire to ensure that, in the transition, the volume of total employment should at least be maintained; that the phasing out of motor vehicle assembly should be so arranged that the workers who would be displaced should, if they so wished and were suitable, be given reasonable opportunity of getting employment in the component manufacturing plant; and that, to this end, the firm would co-operate fully in their re-training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The manufacturer also sought an assurance that in the event of either or both of their assembler-distributors terminating their contracts before production in the new plant commenced and ceasing to carry out assembly they would be allowed to import fully built-up vehicles.  They were informed by my predecessor that he agreed in principle that if either or both of the <Col N="139" /> existing assembler-distributors, by their own wish, terminated their present contract before production commenced in the new plant and ceased to carry out assembly of the vehicles in question he would then allow the firm to import fully built-up vehicles to maintain continuity of delivery to the dealer organisations, it being understood that in that event also any workers who would be displaced should, if they so wished and were suitable, be given reasonable opportunity of getting employment in the component manufacturing plant and that, to this end, the firm would co-operate fully in their re-training.</P>
    <P>I should add that my only meeting with representatives of the firm concerned took place immediately preceding their announcement.  At that meeting while I recognised the need, in the circumstances of our membership of the EEC, to sort out the general position of motor assembly here, I stressed the very great importance I attached to ensuring that the process be carried out with a strict regard for the balance of interests involved.  As regards the firm's particular proposal, I indicated that I would expect the phasing out operation to proceed on the basis of humane considerations both as regards re-employment where possible and reasonable treatment otherwise.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the special scheme negotiated for the motor assembly industry in 1967, the retention of which up to 1985 with some modifications was agreed in the negotiations for EEC membership, was to provide ample time for the firms in the industry to prepare themselves for ultimate free trade conditions.  It was envisaged that at least some of the assembly firms would find it possible, by rationalising production if necessary, to ensure their long-term future in assembly. In this connection I very much welcome recent statements by two of the larger assembly firms that they will continue in assembly on a long-term basis. On the other hand, it was visualised that not all assembly firms might find it possible to continue in that line and the arrangements contemplated that <Col N="140" /> any such firm which maintained employment by diversifying into suitable alternative manufacturing could be granted facilities for the continued importation of fully built-up vehicles.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy is aware, undertakings <Col N="146" /> have been given to the company named in the first question that lease of State minerals in a number of townlands included in a prospecting licence held by them will be granted.

    <P>The validity of a Minerals Acquisition Order in respect of certain minerals in the area is still the subject of litigation.

      <P>Under the terms of the State mining leases governing the working of base metals, royalties accruing from the working of such minerals in 1972 will not fall due for payment until mid 1973.  The total receipts under the Minerals Development Acts in respect of minerals other than petroleum for the year ended 31st December, 1972, from fees and royalties, including royalties from the working of State-owned base metals in the year 1971, amounted to £125,933.

I do not propose to extend this provision in order that apprentices who are in receipt of pay might be included as dependent children.</P>

      <P>Grants to sports organisations since the inception of the scheme were usually announced in late March or April.  The relevant dates of announcement were 26th March, 1970, 10th April, 1971 and 8th April, 1972.  This year, however, the grants were announced by my predecessor on 10th March.</P>
      <P>Due to the established date of announcement, these grants can only be spent by sports and youth organisations in the subsequent financial year. The grants announced on 10th March are for use by the organisations in the year 1973-74.  However, I should point out that as a result of procedure which I inherited the grants made to sports organisaions for use in one financial year have been made out of the Departmental allocation for the previous year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As I mentioned on Wednesday last, the utopia we were promised in February had become by the end of May the &ldquo;Ryanland&rdquo; of reality&mdash;the reality of increased taxation, of a severe and harsh budget on the ordinary working people and on the middle income group.  The hurler on the ditch in the month of February is now the participant who is not giving the performance we were led to expect.  To say it is a disappointing performance is to put it mildly.  The evils of price increases are still with us&mdash;increases that seemed so easy to curb and control in February.</P>
      <P>When they were in Opposition some of the present Ministers had ready-made solutions to these problems. Some of their supporters toured the country and said that price increases would be controlled and that VAT would be removed from food. I have already gone into detail on the effect of the removal of VAT from food and its addition to essential household items.</P>
      <P>Now it does not appear so easy to control these increases.  It is interesting to recall a comment of the Minister for Finance which was published in the Press on 26th February, when he stated that prices were a matter within their control about which the Government had done nothing.  Of course, he was referring to the Government who were in office prior to 26th February.  However, when introducing his budget in May the Minister for Finance stated:</P>
      <P>I must stress that these increases in food prices are entirely outside the direct control of the Government.</P>

      <P>Mr. R. Ryan made a statement on 26th February that prices were within the control of the Government but, when presenting the budget to the House in his capacity as Minister for Finance, he stated:</P>
      <P>I must stress that these increases in food prices are entirely outside the direct control of the Government.</P>
      <P>It was an amazing turn-about in a few short months.  Is it any wonder the people have no confidence in the Government?  Is it any wonder that on 30th May the people voted as they did, when the Government had nailed their policies to the election of a particular candidate in that election? Surely the result reflects the attitude of the people to the Government.  I referred previously to the increases announced immediately after the Presidential Election on 1st June.  In the public Press there was issued a long list of food price increases.  I hope that with a by-election pending in Monaghan a similar situation will not arise, where another long list of price increases will be published a few days after the election.  I hope this will not happen when new increases are necessary, and I believe there are some in the pipeline at the moment.  I should not like the people to lose confidence at such an early stage, although it looks from recent events they are rapidly losing confidence in the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister in his reply to consider the effect of the increases <Col N="178" /> on essential household items. We have heard a lot about the removal of VAT from food next September. However, it will be a non-event, it will not have any effect on the household budget because the price of food will have increased so much in the meantime. However, the major blow for the people is that every other essential item will be increased in price. Last Wednesday I was challenged by Deputy Reynolds when I referred to estate duties.  They have been called death duties or estate duties and Deputy Desmond had a nice term for them when he referred to the transmission of property.  Deputy Reynolds challenged me to produce speeches in which promises were made regarding estate duties.  I would refer him to the public Press of 24th February.  On that date there was a report about this matter and there was reference to a meeting between what was described as representatives of the Coalition grouping, Deputies Tully, FitzGerald and Keating who are now Ministers, and the present Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education, Deputy Bruton.  These men met the IFA delegation and they promised that, if elected, 92 per cent of farms would be free of estate duty.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Finance in his reply to state if 92 per cent of farms are now free of estate duty as a result of this promise.  If he can say that is so, it is fine.  If he cannot, it is obvious that a promise has been made by a group of people on behalf of the present Government which has not been honoured.  It is interesting to note that the Minister for Finance himself was not present on that occasion but that, of course, does not relieve him of responsibility.  It makes one think that perhaps the Minister for Finance at that time was expecting he would not be in his present job but that he might be in foreign fields and that my namesake would be dealing with Finance.  Be that as it may, a commitment was made by those people and I should like to hear the Minister for Finance replying to this point.</P>
    <P>I was interrupted in my speech last <Col N="179" /> Wednesday to be told it was not a question of estate duty being abolished but replaced.  That statement in the public Press on the date I mentioned is very clear.  It does not mean that 92 per cent of farms would be free of income tax.</P>
    <P>On page 34 of his budget brief the Minister referred to the simplification of the income tax code.  He dealt at length with this.  I hope that when he undertakes this simplification he will consider suggestions I made last week regarding some tax concessions.  There are personal allowances, earned income relief and other items such as allowances in respect of essential transport for particular types of workers.  I am asking the Minister to keep these in mind when he comes to review the system in order to give some incentive to workers, the ordinary people of the country, so that they will not feel the Government are forever trying to load them with continued taxation.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to another aspect in regard to income tax.  It is an evil system that taxes a man on a pension which he has merited by years of continuous service, whether it be to a local authority as a roadworker or to CIE or some other public authority, or indeed to a private employer.  Such a man is lucky enough to receive a small pension on retirement and he also qualifies for an old age pension. To my mind it is pathetic to see the small pensions of such a person aggregated and assessed for income tax, even though the person may be 70 or even 80 years of age.  I do not expect the taxation of pensions to be eliminated completely when a person reaches a certain age but I think the Minister agrees with me that the present situation is unfair and should be reviewed. Those old people&mdash;most of them have sons and daughters who are now giving service to the State&mdash;merited the pensions they have and for which they paid in social welfare contributions.  I am sure the Minister finds the system difficult to explain and I have no doubt his sympathies are with such <Col N="180" /> people.  It is another matter he should think about when he comes to simplify the tax code.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond dealt with taxing the farming community and he said that Fianna Fáil should not make political capital out of this.  I am not sure whether Deputy Desmond was conditioning the House and the country generally for what may be contemplated by the Government or whether he was expressing his own views, which may be in conflict with those of some members of the present present Government.  At any rate, I thought it strange that Deputy Desmond should have gone to such lengths to explain why he thought Fianna Fáil should not take certain actions or go in a certain direction if a decision were taken in regard to taxation of the farming community.  I should like to hear some of his rural colleagues giving their views.  Some of them sat quietly behind him and I hope they will express their views before this debate is concluded.</P>
    <P>This gives one the impression that Deputy Dowling was not far wrong when he said we may have a minibudget before the end of the year. Indeed, because of the way prices are going we are having a little budget weekly.  I am a bit concerned that differences may be growing within the present Coalition even at this early stage&mdash;that differences are growing between the two parties.  This is the impression I got when I heard Deputy Desmond's comments on taxation of farmers.</P>
    <P>I was pleased with the Ballybunion announcement of the Minister for Labour in regard to a National Economic Council.  This could prove of immense benefit in the future because it could guide the country on the proper road industrially and economically.  It was interesting, therefore, to read a comment by the Minister for Finance in the Sunday newspaper stating that he did not agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear it.  I can take it, therefore, that the Minister is in favour of this National Economic Council.  There was a comment in a newspaper before the general election.  It was reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 21st February:</P>
      <P>Mr. Richie Ryan described the present Cabinet as being a group of mediocre nonentities.</P>
      <P>I thought that was an unkind comment by the Minister.  I have not seen any innovation produced in this budget which would merit the Minister a place in the political hall of fame.  No exceptional talents were displayed.  There were no brilliant new ideas and there were no sweeping changes.  I am afraid that, unless there is an improvement in his performance in the future, the Minister will sink into oblivion and become a nonentity</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a moment.  The Deputy was a hit late coming in and obviously he missed something.  He was probably in foreign parts last week.  At this stage I am concerned about the Minister's own situation.  I am pointing out that in the public Press he described the Cabinet on 21st February as a group of mediocre nonentities, but his performance in this budget as Minister for Finance was not very exciting.  I would hope that, with the simplification of the taxation I mentioned, we could look forward to some move being made to help the people who are suffering under our income tax system at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. O'Brien Mr. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on this budget of <Col N="182" /> social reform.  It did not get the reception I hoped it would get because this is the type of budget the people expected, a budget of social reform.  They accepted it in that way.  One has to examine it right through to see the benefits which will accrue to the less well-off members of our society.  The budget was intended to cater for the social welfare recipients who are the victims of the gross inflation that has taken place over the past number of years.</P>
      <P>Today a widow with five children is in receipt of slightly over £13.  From 1st July that will go up to £17.35.  To me that is a step in the right direction. That is what I would expect from a Government with a social conscience and that is what we are getting.  There is an increase of £1 for all our social welfare recipients and the children's allowances have been raised substantially. The Opposition have been crying and saying that quite a number of people will not receive these benefits. That is ludicrous to say the least of it. Nine out of ten will get this very substantial increase.</P>
      <P>The figure was static for far too long. I have always held the view that children's allowances should be reviewed regularly.  This would help to stabilise wages.  By giving better children's allowances you stem the need for greater pay increases.  Some people in the Opposition said that £2,500 was a total limit.  Of course that is not correct. It can go as high as £3,000 quite easily.  If somebody is purchasing a house and has a loan of £4,500 at 9 per cent his interest is in the order of a little over £400.  With insurance and superannuation this represents a net income of £3.000.  A person earning £3,000 cannot be described as being in need, despite the spiralling increases.  We did not give children's allowances right across the board: we did not think it was right to do so.  We took it back by way of taxation over a certain figure which can reach £3,000 per annum. That is a substantial figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now we come to prices and inflation. The increased social benefits which have been given in this budget will help the trade union movement to curb the wage demands of their members.  This <Col N="183" /> will have a big effect on the next national wage agreement.  On the question of prices and inflation, nobody has been more responsible than the trade union movement.  They settled for wage agreements year after year, despite inflation and despite the erosion of their members' incomes.  They held fast to their agreements and those agreements went a long way towards helping our economy.  I look forward to increased social welfare benefits having a big bearing on wage and salary negotiations.</P>
    <P>A member of the Opposition mentioned something about a wage freeze. These are scare tactics.  The Opposition are bereft of ideas as to how they can knock this excellent budget.  They introduce the element of scare for the worker who has benefited in a big way from this budget.  When they talk about a wage freeze they are talking nonsense. It has not been mentioned and will not be mentioned.  We believe in free negotiation and this is an important part of the negotiation structure.</P>
    <P>Some speakers suggested that when 5 per cent is taken off something the price goes up.  That is what I heard over the last few weeks&mdash;removing VAT from food will have no effect as from 1st September; it will mean nothing.  The Opposition are trying to justify their own position.  They introduced VAT against great opposition from us.  They would not take our advice.  They insisted on going ahead blindly, taking advice from higher civil servants and ignoring common sense. When you tax food you tax something we all require.  The people who spend most on food are the poor.  Old age pensioners spend approximately 60 per cent of their income on food.  They benefit.  The rich do not.  It does not make much difference to the rich, but every shilling matters to the old age pensioner, to the widow, and to the needy.  These people will benefit in a real way as a result of the removal of value-added tax.</P>
    <P>It is the intention of this Government to stabilise the cost of living and to make increases given in wages and salaries meaningful increases.  Opposition Deputies talked about the hardships <Col N="184" /> imposed because football boots and hurleys would be subject to value-added tax.  It is really rather comical. One Opposition Deputy complained that value-added tax would be removed from all medicines but would not be removed from brandy.  I do not know what sort of doctor I have, but I know he would never prescribe brandy for me.  He might, in fact, tell me not to drink it and I would promptly tell him I could not afford it anyway.  As I say, some of the arguments advanced by Oposition Deputies were really rather funny but, at the same time, we should not have to listen to this kind of nonsense in a deliberative assembly like this.  Not one constructive proposal was put forward by the Opposition.  They contented themselves with lamenting the increase in cigarettes and the addition of one new penny on the pint.  I am well aware that people do not object to paying an additional penny on the pint when they know that, by their doing so, their aged neighbour will benefit.</P>
    <P>Another tactic employed by Opposition Deputies is their effort to split the community by arguing that there is nothing in this budget for the middle income group.  They are, of course, quite wrong in this.  I presume Deputies could be classified as middle income group.  What the budget means to me is a reduction of over £20 per year in rates and an increase of £8 per month in children's allowances.  That is a meaningful increase in income.  The only people the budget does not help are the rich.  I presume these are the people Opposition Deputies really have in mind.  They are their friends.  They have not been helped.  Our concern as a Government is to look after the less well off.  We have been charged with government and we will govern for those most in need so long as we retain the confidence of the people.  I hope we will always have their confidence.</P>
    <P>The easement in rates is an advantage to both the middle income group and to those paying local authority rents.  Right across the board there is a meaningful reduction.  Great play was made about the office blocks. These will have to pay additional stamp duty; the duty has been increased <Col N="185" /> from 10 per cent to 15 per cent. The developers are not getting off, as Opposition Deputies would like people to believe.  They have tried to argue that we are the friends of the developers of office blocks.  We are not against office block development, but the developers must pay their share in the same way as everyone else in the community and we intend to extract that share from them.</P>
    <P>This budget is an expansionist budget and in the months ahead we will see the benefits that will accrue from it.  Additional finance is being injected into local authority housing. That will mean an expansionist programme. Local authorities will be able to plan ahead.  The trouble up to now was that sites were not developed because of neglect.  There was neglect in this regard on the part of the last Government where housing was concerned. As a member of a local authority I know the vast waiting list there is in Dublin.  There are 4,000 or 5,000 people waiting for houses.  Lack of housing has led to broken marriages. This is an aspect which should be investigated.  A father and mother with one child, living in a rat-infested room and with no proper sanitation, will not be housed by the local authority. This sort of situation has continued for far too long.  The injection of an extra 26 per cent into housing as compared with last year will enable the target of 25,000 houses a year to be achieved.  It will not, of course, stop at 25,000; the demand is there and the demand will have to be met.  I have no doubt that it will be met.</P>
    <P>I am glad the ceiling for SDA loans has been raised to £2,000.  I should like it raised a little higher, but this is a step in the right direction.  It is a dear indication of the intention of the Government again with regard to housing.  These figures should be reviewed periodically.  For too long ceilings have remained static.  That is true of social welfare as well as housing.  Even though wages and salaries were increasing no effort was made to raise ceilings <i>pro rata.</i></P>
    <P>The raising of the loan to £4,500 <Col N="186" /> will be a big incentive in inducing people to purchase their own homes.  It was quite impossible for the majority of those interested to find the necessary £1,200 by way of deposit.  Houses were costing in the region of £5,000 and this threw large numbers on to the local authority housing list.  These people were anxious to house themselves but because of the shortsighted policy of the last Government they could not do so.  This Government have now raised the loan to £4,500.  I have no doubt this will be very beneficial in encouraging more people to buy their own homes and removing from the waiting list of local authorities people who would prefer not to be on the list.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is tackling the problem of derelict sites.  All over Dublin there are derelict sites.  The speculative builder is biding his time until he can acquire a land block and planning permission for office development, for offices which will ultimately be sold at a vast profit or let at a very high rental.  It is time this kind of practice was Stopped.  Going around Dublin one would wonder sometimes if we were in process of a major war because of all the derelict sites.</P>
    <P>The local authority should be given greater control and CPOs should be initiated and completed in a far shorter time.  Some of our laws are Victorian and restrictive and as a result the local authority must hasten slowly to a CPO.  This allows slick developers to move in behind our backs for the kill. Where houses are sold in areas zoned for residential and office development it means they are sold for office development. Housing cannot compete with office development.  There was the case in an area zoned as residential of an individual who had poltical influence. The value of his house went from about £25,000 to something like £80,000 because he got planning permission for office development in an area zoned as residential.  That was a scandal.  It gives a clear indication of what happens. If a house is valued at £20,000 or £25,000 and the owner gets, say. £70,000 for it, I would like to see him taxed into the ground.  I believe that is <Col N="187" /> the only way to beat this kind of thing. One side of the road may be zoned as residential and the other side zoned for office development and there is a huge difference in value.  The Minister should tax this sort of profit and the money got from that tax should be put back into housing development.  It could be used for acquiring land banks and for land developments so that we will always have a stock of developed land and if the need arises for more houses quickly they can be provided.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about death duties and how we reneged and did not do our duty.  Of course we did.  As the Minister said, they will be replaced with something else.  In the budget the Minister made a big improvement. Total relief from death duty was given to over 25 per cent of people previously liable.  I cannot see why the Opposition are complaining.  I suspect they are complaining because we are fulfilling our promises.  This we intend to do.  We put forward a 14-point plan.  We intend to go far beyond that but that is the very minimum that we intend to do.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies on the other side treated our tax relief for the working wife very lightly.  They were long enough on this side and they did nothing about it so it ill behoves them to look across and smile.  A husband and wife are treated for tax purposes in the same way as single persons now and that is a real improvement.  The married woman felt sore about her position as regards tax for many years.</P>
    <P>We had a lot of talk about the £35 million.  We had a charade here last week by a Deputy.  It reminded me of the three card trick.  He is not here at present but he can read the report. There was £35 million certainly.  This is shown in the Book of Estimates as the Deputy said.  Of this, £6 million was paid back to the EEC for our commitments in the EEC, leaving £29 million.  That £29 million is there. There is no doubt about that, but there was also a deficit of £49 million, the highest deficit this State has ever known.  The £29 million is there but subtract it from the £49 million and you still have a deficit of £20 <Col N="188" /> million.  We did not hear this from the far side.  They talked as if this £29 million was a bonanza which we had, with which to do whatever we wished. Of course that is not true.  What we had was a deficit of £20 million and when you consider the social welfare benefits we introduced you will realise the great budget it was, a budget of social reform.  It is necessary that this point should be brought home so that people may realise why certain taxes had to be levied.  No Government likes to increase taxes, it is not a pleasant task, but we decided they should go on items we considered the public could bear.  We increased the tax on drink.  As far as I can see if you convert a lounge bar and increase your prices by 10 per cent you double your clientele.  The moral of the story is that the more you charge the more you seem to get.  The Minister should bear that in mind.</P>

      <P>I am not.  We increased the tax on cigarettes by 3p. a packet.  I see nothing wrong with that when one considers how the money is being spent and also that there is a notice on the packet that smoking may be a health hazard. Apart from the fact that cigarettes are a health hazard they are a luxury.  They are not as important as food, not as important as giving the old age pensioner an additional £1, giving the widow with five children an additional £4.50 a week.  We want to try to build up a Christian society, a society of concern for people for whom lobbying is not easy&mdash;for example, the aged, the widows, the deserted wives and the unmarried mothers.  It is important that the Government show their concern for these groups.  Major groups are at an advantage so far as lobbying is concerned. Indeed, the Minister met many such groups in the weeks preceding the budget, but one wonders whether he met any delegations on behalf of these small groups to which I have referred.  However, it was to these latter groups that the benefits were given and that is what makes this budget a good one; but, as I said <Col N="189" /> earlier, it was undersold.  However, when the people realise that these benefits were given despite a deficit of £49 million and, throwing in another £29 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the question of housing, there is a saving to house purchasers by way of stamp duty relief. Because of this relief a person buying a house for, say, £7,000 and which had been occupied already, could avail of a saving of £110.  This is an incentive to people to purchase their own homes.  This stamp duty was one of the reasons why people were buying new houses and its removal will tend to encourage people to purchase houses that have been lived in already.</P>
      <P>The whole area of conveyance and auctioneering should be reviewed.  With houses being so dear now, auctioneers command large fees for what I would regard as a very small service.  Their fee should be graduated and I do not think a responsible auctioneer would refute this.</P>

      <P>I merely mentioned it in relation to housing, which is an aspect of the budget.  I look forward to the setting up of a regional development fund by the end of December of this year.  This fund will be very important in relation to the future development of this country.  There must be an entirely new attitude towards decentralisation.  In devising an EEC regional policy for Ireland, it is important that we get first consideration, <Col N="191" /> particularly in respect of the western seaboard.  We must ensure that there are sufficient incentives to encourage industrial development in the West.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note the wise decision of the corporation in turning down proposals for an oil refinery in Dublin Bay.  Development of this kind would be more appropriate to remote areas as it would be ludicrous to have an oil refinery close to a densely populated city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing this budget, the Government fulfilled their pre-election promises and it is important that a new Government be seen to do that.  I am very happy to be associated with the Government responsible for the current budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 16 years since I have spoken from these benches, and I feel like a neophyte. However, I am comforted by the fact that this is also the first budget in 16 years introduced by a Fine Gael Minister for Finance.  I hope that my remarks will not add unduly to the repetition which you and the Ceann Comhairle have had to endure over the past three weeks but that instead I shall add a little anyway to the gravamen of the debate.</P>
      <P>I think it right to point out, first of all, the general background against which the Government took office a few months ago.  Their reputations were burnished, first, by the mutual admiration of the members of the two component parties for each other in their new-found coalition; secondly, by the undisguised euphoria of the vast majority of the editors of the newspapers throughout the country, daily and weekly, who support the coalition parties.  Then there is the goodwill of the members of the retiring Government, the goodwill articulated by the Leader of the Opposition and also articulated by me in an interview to RTE on the day of the formation of the new Government in March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="192" /> I said then, and I repeat now, that it is not our desire that this Government should fail to continue the social and economic progress of recent years; nor is it our desire that this Government should emulate the failure of the previous Coalition Government from 1954 to 1957.  I continue to hope that this Government will maintain the progress at every level which had characterised, in particular, the more recent years under Fianna Fáil Government ending a few months ago.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that one must consider the provisions of the budget introduced by the Minister for Finance a few weeks ago and ask whether and to what extent the legitimate expectations of the people have been realised by what the new Government have done as exemplified in their budgetary provisions.  From some points of view the Minister deserves congratulation, and I would be the last to refuse to offer that congratulation to him in respect of those aspects of his budget which ought to be praised.  I welcome the social welfare provisions and within those the new provisions for deserted wives, unmarried mothers, and so on, which add a new dimension to the aids being given by this House to the underprivileged members of our community.</P>
    <P>Some disappointment has been expressed by leading members of Fianna Fáil, that, having regard to inflation and, in particular, to the amount of money at the Minister's disposal, the social welfare increases were less generous than might have been justified or expected.  I think this is at least partially justified and that it is clear that, if the statements made by Deputy Haughey in his contribution a couple of weeks ago are correct, namely, that the Minister had £189 million additional taxation on which to draw, the additional provision under social welfare represents too small a proportion of this increase.  Having regard to the other factors, particularly the level of increased taxation imposed in the budget, there is, indeed, some justification for the viewpoint that the social welfare increases might have been increased considerably more.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="193" /> Another aspect which rather puzzled me was, and continues to be, the situation in regard to death duties, and I propose to go somewhat further than any of the other speakers whose contributions I have read in regard to this matter, because I am convinced that it was the vital issue and in the province of Leinster swung the election in favour of the Coalition and against Fianna Fáil.  When the previous speaker passes over the question of estate duties and the Coalition's undertaking in regard to them, it is just a bit too facile, because the issue itself is far too vital.  I take it in this regard that everyone will agree that a party in Government does not like to be put out except on a justifiable basis.  I propose to show in what I say that we as a Government were put out on the estate duty issue and that we were unjustly and harshly treated in the process, and I shall not confine that unjust and harsh treatment to the members or spokesmen of the National Coalition.</P>
    <P>For many months prior to the election spokesmen on behalf of the Irish Farmers' Association had toured the country attacking the Fianna Fáil Government on this matter of estate duties.  I listened to Mr. T.J. Maher and others on the radio one evening shortly before the news mounting a savage attack on us on this very issue. I was and I continue to be satisfied that this was basically an unjust attack. It unjustifiably built into the minds of the farming community a fear of a continuation of Fianna Fáil rule because of the possible impact of estate duty on them.  For the moment, therefore, I will deal with that duty and the attitude of Mr. Maher and the Irish Farmers' Association to that issue.</P>
    <P>This attitude was vital to the decision thousands of people in the Midland counties made in the general election. Fianna Fáil either lost seats or failed to gain where they might have been expected to do so in these counties. The record proves that consistently over recent years Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance progressively eased the burden of estate duty.  Practising solicitors, like the Minister for Finance <Col N="194" /> know that it is not so many years ago when the total value of an estate liable for estate duty was only a couple of thousand pounds.  When Deputy Haughey was Minister for Finance he, and I, had discussions about the advisability, or otherwise, of removing estate duties altogether.  We did not decide in principle to do so but we did decide&mdash;I do not mean Deputy Haughey and myself but the Government of which we were members&mdash;to make very substantial changes in favour of the farming community on this issue.</P>
    <P>We continued over the years to ameliorate the provisions in regard to estate duty.  Because of our entry into the EEC and the success of our policies the value of land began to increase at a rate which nobody had anticipated.  We were, therefore, in the position that, because of the success of our policy and the success of our advice to the Irish people to join the EEC, the value of land had increased to a completely unprecedented level. We were, in effect, being attacked because of that and because, by reason of that increase, the estate duty net was beginning to gather in thousands of people who would have otherwise escaped.</P>
    <P>It was against this background that the then Taoiseach asked Mr. Maher, and representatives of the IFA, to meet him and discuss this very important matter.  We pointed out that, even within the farming community, there was not agreement on the basic issue. We pointed out that there was strong feeling within Macra na Feirme that the continuance of estate duty in some forms represented an incentive to the older farmers to release their farms at a reasonable age and thus enable the younger farmers who are members of that splendid organisation to get ahead with constructive planning of their farming activities and their farming future.</P>
    <P>We pointed out that we had never been averse to the idea of ameliorating the burden of death duties and that, as a gatherer of tax, we did not regard estate duties as essential to our plans. We gave an unqualified undertaking that we would re-examine all aspects <Col N="195" /> of estate duties with a view to removing all possible grievances and, if it was thought right and proper to do so, to remove estate duty altogether.</P>
    <P>Again, I should like to refer to what Deputy Haughey said in his contribution, namely that the Government have done the right thing now.  This is a very complex matter and it is one in which the public, and those of us in politics and otherwise interested, are entitled to, and do have, very conflicting views.  So far as the political aspect is concerned the Coalition spokesmen carried out a campaign which was described by the Leader of the Opposition as immoral.  Deputy Lynch does not use words lightly and when he used the word &ldquo;immoral&rdquo; about the Coalition campaign he meant to use it.  I repeat it.  The Coalition found themselves on the horns of a most awful dilemma.  They would either have to go back on a discreditable promise they should never have made or do the right thing by keeping their word.</P>
    <P>It was a terrible dilemma and it would, in my opinion, have been better if in some of the other dilemmas in which they found themselves they had taken the same course. Mr. Maher wrote in <i>The Sunday Press</i> of May 27th concerning this matter and I quote:</P>
    <P>Commitments solemnly given by the Coalition Parties before the last general election clearly influenced the outcome of the election.  Firstly, I would draw your attention to the promise of the then proposed Coalition Government, if elected, to abolish estate duty.  There is dismay among the farming community that this promise has so far not been honoured and while we have been promised a White Paper on taxation, there is no indication as to when it will be published or when estate duty will be removed. These commitments solemnly given by the Coalition Parties before the election clearly influenced the outcome of same.  Many farm family holdings will be at risk should the present owners happen to die in the <Col N="196" /> interim period.  The alterations in legislation proposed by the Minister for Finance in his budget speech will do little to alleviate the burden of estate duty on family farm buildings.  Furthermore, it is difficult to reconcile recent decisions of your Government, like the removal of subsidies on potassic fertilisers <i>et cetera.</i></P>
    <P>I accept that what Mr. Maher has said is honestly stated but I think that he played a creditable part in the election campaign itself because, instead of refusing to make estate duties, their abolition or otherwise, an election issue as yet untaken to the then Taoiseach, he continued to frighten the farming community.  He frightened enough of them to change the Government from Fianna Fáil to the National Coalition.  Therefore, I do not think on this issue that either the Government's spokesmen or the spokesman of the IFA have anything to be proud of, even though Mr. Maher now realises that his confidence in the Coalition promises was misplaced.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister for Finance has not honoured that silly promise because this issue is not amenable to immediate decision and action. Therefore, by definition, it should not have been the subject of the type of propaganda that emanated from Coalition spokesmen prior to 28th February.  My own view remains that estate duty should be abolished completely. In my view the argument of Macra na Feirme and other representatives who say the presence of estate duty is an incentive to older people is not well founded although I admit in this area I am entitled only to my own view.  It is my belief that the people of the generation who are now passing away, those of 70 years and upwards, are too near to the struggle for the land to be willing to part with it on account of the threat of estate duty or any other threat. Directives from the EEC or changes in the tax structure will not change them; it will take the passage of time and a greater appreciation of the utility of the land as against the possession of land for the necessary <Col N="197" /> change of heart in the farming community.</P>
    <P>This is not something on which one can be dogmatic.  The wisest course for the Minister for Finance is to get together intelligent, competent people, publish a White Paper and, having publicly discussed the matter, finally come to a mature decision.  I can assure the Minister he will get every help from our side of the House in coming to the right decision on this matter.  In the meantime, it seems incomprehensible that he should double the legacy and succession duties although I will not go into this matter in detail.  It seems to reflect a very odd attitude by the Government and, although I cannot know for certain, I suspect the Minister for Finance does not agree with it.</P>
    <P>Apart from being an election promise, the imposition of VAT on food was opposed by the then Opposition when the matter was first mentioned and I do not accuse the Minister or anyone on the benches behind him of being inconsistent in this matter. From the beginning, members of the present Government parties argued that VAT should be removed from food items although we strongly disagreed with that and continue to do so.  I regret we are now in the situation of re-fighting a battle that was fought and won and fought again 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>Older Members of the House will recall the removal by Fianna Fáil of food subsidies and the consequent bitter battle that took place.  The public, as well as Members of the House, will remember that ultimately the removal of food subsidies led to the rejection of Fianna Fáil by the electorate in 1954 and the formation of the second Coalition Government. The subsequent three years were to give the public the opportunity of realising that Seán Lemass was right and that there was no basic justification for food subsidies as against other items.  The public realised it led to unexplainable imbalances in the administration of the country as well as of the household.  When the public realised that Seán Lemass and Fianna Fáil were right, they returned us to office in 1957.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="198" /> I am not suggesting that the public will reject the Government on this issue.  I am only saying the Government are wrong to implement their promise to the electorate to remove VAT from food.  There is no sense or logic in it; it will lead to all kinds of complications for the purchaser, the retailer and for the wholesaler, not to mention all the other people Who will be involved in the consequential changes that will be necessary.  Everyone realises that by the time VAT is removed from food the housewife will not benefit, but this is a surface argument and is not really just because between now and September the Minister can only influence the trend of food prices to a limited extent.  We must be fair about such matters.</P>
    <P>The principle of removing VAT from food was fought by the electorate on two occasions 20 years ago and it is sad that we are back at the same situation in 1973.  There is no justification whoever for meddling about with VAT in this fashion.  I would horrify the House if I were to paint the picture of the unfortunate retailer having to cope with another set of forms, distinguishing between one item and another, when after a great struggle he has just mastered the old set of forms which at least had the merit of having the same amount of tax across the board.  That is a slight over-simplification but the House will get the point I am making.  How is the retailer to work out his tax return?  What kind of form will be devised to enable him to do so?  How many civil servants will be employed in drafting the form? How many people will go into a state of semi-dementia trying to decipher the forms?  How many inspectors will have to be employed to go around to see that people retailing food are not selling things in tins marked &ldquo;food&rdquo; when they turn out to be nails or something?</P>
    <P>The whole thing is ludicrous from any aspect at which one looks at it. From an administrative point of view it has caused shock to retailers and wholesalers.  It has resulted in the Minister being able, while keeping his promise to remove VAT from food, to extract a couple of million pounds <Col N="199" /> more from VAT on other items. Deputy Brugha detailed exactly how this will be done and it is not necessary for me to repeat what he said. However, I commend what he said because he articulated clearly what the Minister for Finance had done in this Budget by extracting more money from the public in VAT.</P>
    <P>If I do not misinterpret what Deputy Brugha said, the burden of it is that the unfortunate housewife at the end of her week's shopping, not through any increases in prices that have taken place but through the effects of this budget, will be worse off, not better off, by the time she has paid for the shoes for one of her children, or for the piece of kitchen equipment she has to buy to replace worn out equipment.  She has not just to feed her children but to keep the household going at the same time.</P>
    <P>That is the truth of it.  It is as simple as that.  It shows just how irrelevant to budgetary policy was the implementation of the promise in regard to VAT on food.  I appreciate that, having found himself on the horns of a dilemma, the Minister, or the Government, could not dishonour all the promises even though to do so might very well have been the right thing to do.</P>
    <P>So much has been said about the allegation of the Minister for Finance in regard to the £29 million that I hesitate to repeat it, but it was mentioned again this afternoon by another Fine Gael Deputy, Fergus O'Brien. There is one thing I can say for sure, and I speak from personal knowledge of the Minister for Finance in various capacities.  It is that he is entitled to be regarded at this stage of his career as a man of integrity and ability.  He has proved that as a politician and as a lawyer.  I take it, therefore, that when he comes into the House he cannot say something which is demonstrably wrong.  A man of ability would not say something about us which we could quite clearly demonstrate to have no foundation.  It would be silly of him to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> It has been abundantly proved by spokesmen on this side of the House in the course of the past few weeks that there is no foundation whatever for the allegation that the Fianna Fáil Government ran away with £29 million and I look forward to the Minister for Finance being able to clarify his words when he is replying to the debate.</P>
    <P>What I will say about it is that the 1972-73 budget turned out only 1 per cent off target.  That is as near as anybody can get in budgetary matters. Therefore, there is demonstrably no substance in the allegation that the Fianna Fáil Government ran away with or misused any moneys of any kind under any heading, whether it be the £29 million EEC fund or any other fund.  On the contrary, we handed over to the present Government as a result of the success of the 1972-73 and other budgets an economy in which there had been a satisfactory if not an excellent rate of growth, in which as a result of this growth 6,000 fewer people were unemployed, in which there is no real balance of payments problem, in which the general outlook for further development was excellent, a situation that is admitted by all neutral observers and by all fairminded people, on this side of the House or on the other.  Therefore, we do not take seriously the suggestion that the Minister for Finance meant to say we ran away with funds.</P>
    <P>There are only one or two other matters with which I should like to deal. One of them is a continuation of a point made by Deputy Desmond in the course of his speech last week in regard to the extraordinary decision of the Government on the pay of Members of the Oireachtas.  At column 2290, Volume 265, Deputy Desmond is reported:</P>
    <P>I have not received any justifiable reason for the setting aside of the clear-cut recommendations of the Devlin Review Body and for the setting aside of the recommendations of the National Employer Labour Conference.</P>
    <P>On 3rd February, 1971, the Fianna Fáil Party referred the pay levels of <Col N="201" /> certain civil servants, local authority members, members of health boards, the Judiciary, the Government and Deputies to the Devlin Review Body. This had to be done because all the groups referred to are outside the scope of the national conciliation and arbitration.</P>
    <P>He then mentioned the evidence he had given on behalf of the Labour Party before that body and he continued:</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the report in September, 1972, the Fianna Fáil Party decided to refer the whole lot again to the National Employer Labour Conference.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley's decision was wise. One could have taken the bull by the horns and implemented the Devlin report, but I think the Deputy was correct in sending the recommendations off to the National Employer/ Labour Conference.  I saw the wisdom in this, because that body is composed of an equal number of employers and trade union representatives.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Desmond in what he said.  Being a political supporter of the Minister for Finance, it may have been difficult for him to raise the question at all.  He was right to do so.  Later on in the course of his remarks he said:</P>
    <P>Technically one could argue that from January, 1972&mdash;but certainly from July, 1972&mdash;one was entitled to a proportion of the increase.</P>
    <P>That is the increase suggested by the two bodies.  He went on:</P>
    <P>It is quite indefensible that July, 1973, should have been decided upon.  I say this with due respect to my colleagues in Government.  I know there is an element of chagrin in the Fianna Fáil party. It is difficult to work up any sympathy with Deputy Colley who shilly-shallied about it and got a terrible kick up the transom&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;not that again&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;finding himself out of office having failed to bring about the increase in time.</P>
    <P>I merely wish to add that the suggestion <Col N="202" /> that Deputy Colley shilly-shallied about this matter is not justified. In that connection may I quote from what Deputy Colley said, as reported at Volume 265, column 1317 of the Official Report, in the course of his remarks following the Minister's Financial Statement on Budget Day?  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Because it was your bill and you refused to pay for it.  We are not going to pay for the money you are now saying you should have paid.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley said:</P>
    <P>It simply is not good enough for the Minister for Finance of all people to say that.  One of the new Deputies behind him said something like it recently.  I do not blame him.  The Minister for Finance knows the circumstances. Just for the record, I am going to give them to him.  The report of the special committee arrived on my desk a few days before Christmas and was issued publicly. Legislation is necessary to implement it.  The Dáil did not meet from that date until after the election, when the Minister was over there.  So, would the Minister please acknowledge that it was not possible for me or my colleagues to implement these findings while we were in Government?</P>
    <P>What Deputy Colley said in this regard is conclusive and does not admit of any debate.  The findings of the National Employer/Labour Conference arrived on his desk, as it arrived on the desks of members of the Government, a few days before Christmas, after the Dáil had risen&mdash; a Dáil which was never again to meet.</P>
    <P>I think it is agreed now&mdash;and we had agreed on it in Government&mdash; that in future changes in the emoluments of Members of the Oireachtas should be effected by means of regulation, thereby obviating the necessity for introducing a fresh Bill and having it passed through both Houses of the Oireachtas each time any alteration is made in the salaries of Members of the Houses.  I understand that the Minister for Finance and his <Col N="203" /> colleagues accept that this is a more desirable procedure.  We certainly had made a decision along those lines before leaving office.</P>
    <P>Had that situation obtained, of course, we could have implemented the findings, and could then have been accused of shilly-shallying had we not done so.  In the light of the fact that legislation continues to be required, it is not fair that that accusation should be made by Deputy Ryan, of all people, and reiterated by Deputy Desmond three weeks afterwards. There simply was no shilly-shallying by the then Minister or his colleagues in regard to this matter.  We were powerless to do anything except, perhaps, to persuade the Taoiseach not to call the general election.  That is his prerogative and not ours.  It would add a new dimension in silliness if I were to suggest that.  In any event, I hope the situation will never arise again.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, I hope the wishes expressed by Deputy Desmond from the Government benches, and reiterated by many other Members of the House&mdash;not necessarily in the House, but certainly in the corridors of the House&mdash;will be noted by the Minister and his colleagues.  As Deputy Desmond rightly said, the decision was unfair and unjustifiable; unfair not merely to present Members of the House but to former colleagues of ours who retired or were defeated at the last general election and, in the case of those who retired, who did so in the belief that at least their pensions would be geared to a retrospectively increased salary.</P>
    <P>It appears that differentiation is being made between the Judiciary and the higher civil servants, on the one hand, and Members of this House on the other.  Glory be to shades of Deputy James Dillon, who argued so forcefully here many years ago that, of course, there should be a distinction between Members of this House and any other group of people.  There was justification for his point of view but there is certainly no justification for the point of view that now the Judiciary, higher civil servants, Members of this House, members of the Government, <Col N="204" /> are all in one general category and are put for public examination before the Devlin Committee and the Employer Labour Conference.  That the Minister for Finance should downgrade the Members of this House <i>visà-vis</i> higher civil servants and members of the Judiciary, is quite indefensible.</P>
    <P>If he has done so he must forthwith proceed to remove that stigma from the Members of this House&mdash;a stigma which should never have been placed on us by any Minister in this or any other Government.  Since, in fact, judges and higher civil servants are getting an increase from an earlier date than 1st July, 1973, the Minister for Finance should do the decent thing, the only justifiable thing, that is, to regard his colleagues in the House at least as on a par with any other members of the community.  If, like modem soccer, it is work rate that is the important consideration, Members of this House are entitled to regard themselves as at least the equal of any of the other grades mentioned.</P>
    <P>I have spoken a great deal longer than I intended.  In conclusion, I hope the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Finance, will use the time between now and the introduction of his next budget to better social and economic purpose than the Government as a whole used the few months they had prior to the introduction of this year's budget.  It has disappointed most sections of the community.  It has disappointed industry.  It has grievously hurt the middle income group and, on reflection, it has disappointed at least some social welfare groups while, at the same time, it has, perhaps, been overkind to some people within that category.  One does not expect the Minister or the Government to develop a clearcut philosophy in such a short time but it is my hope that in the next budget this Government will have worked out a clearcut social, political and economic philosophy as distinct from putting together a mixture of <i>ad hoc</i> decisions rather like a child trying to put a picture together out of a pot of paste and bits of variegated or coloured paper.</P>

I would also hope that we would return to the same basic system as operated during our time and I am quite certain that the principle which was, as I say, thought out 20 years ago has remained unchanged and we are right in this matter and the present Government are wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the capital budget of £308 million and, in particular, to the £51 million for industrial development, an increase of £9 million this year for such development.  This is a very praiseworthy effort to ensure that everything possible will be done to bring industry, large and small, to the cities and bigger towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned mainly with the future prospects of industrial development in North Tipperary.  North Tipperary is part of the mid-western region <Col N="206" /> comprising Clare, Limerick and North Tipperary.  The primary industrial location for that region is the Shannon Free Airport development area.  Some months ago a five-year plan was produced for the region covering the years 1973 to 1977, inclusive, which envisaged a job commitment or opportunity for 6,600 persons.  To my constituency out of that figure, a paltry 600 jobs were allotted.  Comparatively speaking, North Tipperary is a wealthy constituency. However, when one examines in detail the grants for the year 1971-72 under the different headings of new industrial grants, small industrial grants, adaptation grants and re-equipment grants, the total for the region was £15,500,000.  Of that sum North Tipperary received only £500,000. Basically, the grant structure is unfair and inequitable as far as North Tipperary is concerned.</P>
    <P>It is a three-tiered structure; one set of grants are available for the Shannon Free Airport area, another set for County Clare and the remainder of the region must be satisfied with third priority.  I agree that in the past 20 years it was necessary to give higher grants west of the Shannon to ensure industry would be located in areas which were fast losing their population. North Tipperary is on the wrong side of the Shannon and we accepted that.  However, I believe we must now take a fresh look at this underdeveloped area because in that 20 years not one new industry has been established in North Tipperary.  The mining outside Nenagh is giving tremendous employment and I hope it has a long future before it.  No Government can take any kudos for the success of this venture because no grants were given to the Canadians who came in to operate the mines; they assayed the area, saw there was valuable ore in it and invested £14 million or £15 million in it.  There are 600 workers involved and, when one takes into consideration their wives and families, there are about 3,000 people in all making a living out of this development.</P>
    <P>When one analyses the job allocation as outlined by SFADCO over the year 1973-1974 there is a definite indication <Col N="207" /> that neither SFADCO nor the Industrial Development Authority are interested in North Tipperary.  Some day this mine will run down and we should now be planning to ensure that, when this happens, there will be other job opportunities available for the displaced workers.  I sincerely hope this will not happen in my lifetime, but SFADCO should be very conscious now of the needs of my constituency and, in particular, of the needs of my home town of Nenagh.</P>
    <P>North Tipperary does not figure very strongly in a recent report on the mid-western development region in which industrial development is outlined. Thurles, for example, has a traditional textile expertise and I believe Thurles should have a strong claim to an industry. I trust the powers that be will ensure that such an industry is allocated to Thurles.  Thurles is crying out for an industry.  There is no mention of my own home town but I know every effort is being made to ensure that a factory site will be available there.  I have always emphasised the fact that industry should be located elsewhere than in our cities and larger towns.  Small towns should be allocated industries.  These towns are trying to create an environment becoming their area but, without help from the central authority, they are fighting a losing battle.  I refer in particular to places like Newport, Borrisokane and Cloughjordan. My appeal to the Department of Industry and Commerce would be that the service industries which are so essential to the major consortia now evolving in Ireland should be kept outside of Dublin.  Such small industries would be of great benefit to areas such as I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the powers that be that someone somewhere in the immediate future should make some decision in regard to the coal miners' future in Ballingarry.  This area has had coalmines for 35 or 40 years.  There are still 20 years in the industry.  Rather than having the people waiting and wondering I would ask that the people concerned should make their decision and let these people know what is going to happen.</P>

      <P>At this stage it must be obvious to the Government that the budget which was introduced by the Minister for Finance on May the 16th was anything but a good budget.  In spite of the best efforts of the Government speakers to dress it up and present it as a neat package with a little in it for everybody the message must have got back to the Government by now that the people are anything but happy with what has been presented to them.  When one considers the sound state of the economy resulting from the good housekeeping done by Fianna Fáil over the years, and also the £30 million which has been saved because of our joining the EEC, it is little wonder that the general public expected a really good budget.  Coupled with this we had the many promises made during the general election campaign by the parties now forming the National Coalition Government.  The general public could not be blamed for believing that the Government would honour those promises but in spite of the firm commitments entered into in the pre-election period by the parties who over the years claimed so many virtues they have failed miserably to honour those commitments in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recall, as do tens of thousands of people all over the country who witnessed it, the Press conference given by Fine Gael and Labour before the last general election in which the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tully, stated categorically that the Coalition Government would reduce the age for old age pensions to 65 and abolish the means test in the first year of office. This same statement was repeated over and over by Fine Gael and Labour spokesmen all over the country and succeeded, I am sure, in getting votes for their candidates.  They also told us they would abolish death duties, remove VAT from food, introduce strict price control immediately, declare a housing emergency and immediately remove health charges from the rates. They have reneged completely on death duties.  Instead of abolishing them, as promised, they are introducing a White Paper.  It now appears that this is a very complicated matter but before the election there was no <Col N="209" /> trouble at all in getting rid of it.  Provision is made in the budget for the removal of VAT from food from September 1st but the Minister has also decided to increase the rate of VAT from 5.26 per cent to 6.75 per cent on other goods such as clothing and footwear, alcoholic liquor, tobacco, petrol, fuel and electricity.  By the time we reach 1st September food prices will have gone up so high that the removal of VAT will make no significant difference. Then there are the increases I have mentioned on clothes and footwear. Since the Government came into power I have seen no attempt to introduce the promised price control.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, during the course of questions in this House, said he was examining the system but that is a long way from the promised strict price control; on the contrary, the House will recall the announcement in the national newspapers the day after the Presidential Election when substantial increases were allowed on certain essential foodstuffs.  I cannot help thinking that announcement was deliberately held over until after the Presidential Election in order to save the Government further embarrassment. We ail know that declaring a housing emergency will not produce one more house but even that declaration has not been made by the Government.  In fact, since the Coalition Government took office building society loans have become practically unobtainable.</P>
    <P>The Government have been obsessed by the notion of conveying the impression that what has been done in this budget was, in their own words, a total transformation, that they were leaving behind the bad years, years of lack of social awareness. Down through the years successive Fianna Fáil Governments have shown concern for the poor and under-privileged.  In successive budgets they have increased the rates of pension, they have introduced new schemes such as holiday pay, wet time pay, free travel and free light for the old age pensioners, the prescribed relatives allowance which we extended <Col N="210" /> last year to cover the male relative and many other schemes from which the old and infirm have benefited.  I cannot recall hearing of any new social welfare scheme in this budget, in spite of the fact that the Government are supposed to be overloaded with brains and talent.  Of course they increased all benefits by approximately £1 all around but when you consider the favourable state of the economy which the Government inherited from Fianna Fáil, and also the £30 million saved on agricultural marketing supports by reason of our joining the EEC, on terms negotiated by Fianna Fáil and bitterly opposed by one of the parties that now form the Government, the £1 increase given was little enough indeed.</P>
    <P>In connection with those social benefits I have mentioned there is one group which I would like to plead for with the Minister for Finance, that is the people in receipt of disabled persons maintenance allowance. I know a number of these people&mdash;I am sure the Minister does too&mdash;who are not allowed any benefit for their dependants.  They are given an allowance by the health boards but there is nothing for their dependants.  I fail to understand why the dependants of recipients of disabled persons maintenance allowance cannot get those benefits just as the dependants of recipients of unemployment assistance, disability benefit and every other benefit do.  I think they should be entitled to it and I would ask the Minister to consider that point.</P>
    <P>In order to pay for the increases in social welfare benefits, the Minister saw fit to impose penal taxation on all the old reliables.  Cigarettes are to be increased by 3p. per packet of 20, spirits by 3p per glass and beer by 1p per pint, plus VAT.  There is a huge increase in taxation on private motor cars and a new charge on first registration of a motor vehicle or a motor cycle.  There is also to be an increase in the rate of tax on agricultural tractors.  Driving licence fees are to be increased as will transport charges.  Telephone calls and rentals will cost more as will postage stamps, too.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="211" /> During this debate one Fine Gael Deputy referred to the Government as being the Government of the young because, he said, they have increased children's allowances.  How can they claim to be the Government of the young when they have done nothing in the budget to help young people?  They have done nothing to ease the burden of taxation on young workers who are taxed on earnings of more than £8 per week.  If these people live away from home they will probably be paying from £7 to £8 per week now for board and lodging because of the increased costs of food.  If they must commute to and from work, their transport charges will cost more.  The result of all this is that it will be impossible for any young person to save money to go towards the purchase of a new home and it is the aspiration of most young people to have their own home at some stage.  Surely the Government should have assisted these young people whose support they claim to have.  No doubt the Government's failure in this regard will be brought home to them in the months and the years ahead.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of any real concern for social justice in this budget and this indicates a very bad start on the part of the Government in managing the economy of the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister for Finance on the introduction of his first budget.  The Minister has been accused by various speakers from the Opposition benches of not honouring our pre-election promises. These accusations are unwarranted. This budget was introduced within ten weeks of the present Government taking office.  It amuses me to hear the criticism that is being levelled at us by Fianna Fáil, a party that were in Government for 16 consecutive years but who did very little during that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the promises that were made in the Coalition's 14-point plan that was put before the electorate <Col N="212" /> have been honoured already.  Indeed, it has been said to me that the Government are moving too fast.  Surely that is a good sign.  The previous Government did not move at all during their 16 years in office.</P>
    <P>However, now that they are in opposition they are making much noise about estate duties.  In our 14-point plan it was promised that estate duties would be removed and in this budget the Minister has taken the necessary steps in that direction.  At page 30 of his statement he tells us that before taking up office the Government undertook to abolish estate duty and to replace it with a new form of taxation.  The Minister has gone a long way in this budget towards the abolition of these duties but surely nobody could expect that any government, in introducing a budget only ten weeks after taking office, would abolish estate duties entirely.  The Minister has promised a White Paper in this regard and I have no doubt that in the long-term estate duties will be abolished entirely but no member of the Coalition Government promised at any time that they would be removed completely immediately on the Government coming to power.</P>
    <P>The increases given to social welfare recipients are greater than any that have ever been given before. Personally, I do not consider the round figure of £1 to be an adequate increase but, then, Rome was not built in a day and we cannot do everything that we would wish to do at once.  There will be further budgets and the Opposition realise that any promises that were made on behalf of the National Coalition in our 14-point programme during the election campaign will be honoured during our term of office.</P>
    <P>In regard to social welfare benefits it has been said from the Opposition benches that the middle income group come badly out of this budget.  There is a misunderstanding here that should be cleared up.  Some people believe, or else some of our Opposition Members would like them to believe, that under the children's allowances provisions, certain people <Col N="213" /> are going to lose.  In the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 10th June there was a statement issued by the Department of Finance under the heading New Children's Allowances and Income Tax. It states :</P>
    <P>The vast majority of families will benefit fully when the new system begins in July.  They will get the increased children's allowances and will not pay any extra tax as a result.</P>
    <P>There will be a small group of higher income people who will not benefit, but it should be made perfectly clear that that particular group will not lose out regarding children's allowances.  They will draw the children's allowance at the new rate and pay back the increase in income tax, but it is only on the increase that they will pay.  In other words, nobody will have to forfeit the original children's allowance of which they have been in receipt.  Surely this is fair, because the people who will benefit are the people in the lower income group. This budget was designed for that purpose and I am glad to be able to congratulate the Minister on introducing a budget which benefits the poorer sections of our community. Those are the people who need help, the people who are getting these benefits under social welfare, increased children's allowances, and so on, the people who have no pressure groups to act for them.  Surely these silent people, as I might describe them, are the people whom any Government in this country should first think of and help.  This being the first budget by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ryan, it is a step in the right direction in the benefits he has given.</P>
    <P>Criticisms have been made of increased taxation on tobacco, spirits and beer.  I was sitting in those Opposition benches for over 11 years and I remember a previous Minister for Finance, the late Dr. Ryan, speaking on the turnover tax when it was introduced by the Fianna Fáil Government. I got the impression at that time that this turnover tax would do away with what I called at the time, in speaking from the Opposition benches, the old type of taxation, taxation of <Col N="214" /> the hardy annuals, tobacco, spirits, and so on.  That never happened, although I have seen many budgets introduced here, and I do not think anybody who likes a pint or a glass or half glass of spirits would begrudge paying the extra few pence in taxation once he knows it is going to help the most needy in our community.</P>
    <P>Again in our 14-point programme we undertook to remove value-added tax from foodstuffs.  This is another promise that has been honoured in the budget, and the Minister for Finance has announced that this tax will be removed from 1st September next. Again, the criticism has been levelled from the Opposition that this will not have any effect due to increases in prices.  I admit, and I know that the week before last there were increases in prices, but let us be honest with ourselves, increases must come.  Everybody in this House is aware that even had Fianna Fáil been in power these increases would have taken place.</P>

      <P>There is no need for Deputy Crowley to nod his head as if these increases would not have taken place if his party were in power.  There were many increases while his party were in power and no reliefs were given.  Reliefs have been given in this budget.  These increases would have taken place irrespective of who was Minister for Finance or Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the reduction in rates.  Everybody in this House is aware of what the increase in the rates would have been this year had this Government not honoured their promise to remove the health charges from the rates.  The relief on the rates has been misconstrued by the Opposition.  All that has worried the Opposition is that the health charge was not removed immediately. No such promise was made by any of the National Coalition candidates. An undertaking was given to remove <Col N="215" /> the health charges over a period of four years.  This will be done and nobody need have any worries but that during our term of office these charges will be removed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the Minister to his statement on value-added tax.  A list of items has been given to which the concession has not been extended. These items include alcoholic drinks, sweets, chocolates, ice cream, confectionery and soft drinks and the Minister stated that he had decided to extend the concession to include oral medicines.  I take it that oral medicines refer to those taken off a spoon or other liquid medicines or drugs.  I take it that this does not include medicines or drugs taken by injection.  I should like the Minister to clarify this matter when replying.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">

    <Speaker pid="DesmondGoverney" hpid="Mr. Governey Mr. Governey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Governey</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been brought to my notice and I have been informed that there may be difficulty with regard to keeping records for the chemists but I should like clarification on the matter from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated by members of the Opposition that there was nothing in the budget for young couples intending to get married.  I should like to remind the Deputies that there are a number of incentives, perhaps they are not shown very clearly, but they are in the budget.  The Minister for Local Government recently raised the income limit for those who are seeking local authority loans for new houses.  At a recent meeting of Carlow County Council at which I was attending the increased allocations made by the Minister for Local Government to the various councils were announced. <Col N="216" /> The increase in respect of Carlow was substantial and, in fact, the increases throughout the country were substantial.</P>
    <P>To my mind, and I make no apology for this statement, this is a very wellframed budget.  It is a start on the road by the National Coalition Government and the Minister for Finance to channel moneys available in the right direction.  This start has clearly shown that the National Coalition's first concern is for those I have described as the &ldquo;silent community&rdquo; who have no pressure groups to act for them and have carried on over the years on a meagre allowance.  I should like to see the increases doubled.  With the money available to him the Minister has done good work.  I hope that in future budgets he will be able to continue on the same lines to help the most needy, always bearing in mind the problems and difficulties of all the people.</P>
    <P>People will be asked to make some sacrifices, perhaps to curtail their drinking and smoking, but I am sure they realise they are helping the needy. Nobody will begrudge making sacrifices when he knows the money is being well spent.  The budget was framed to help the less well off and to bring the country under the National Coalition Government in a straight line towards a just society for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to wish the Minister well in his office.  For a number of years we have been political antagonists but the Opposition recognise that the Minister is a man of tremendous ability and a politician second to none.  I hope he has a successful, although not too long, sojourn as Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said he did not need to emphasise the major difficulties in making forecasts of tax revenue growth, especially in an inflationary situation.  However, the budget is an obvious factor in maintaining and increasing the current rate of inflation and we must treat the Minister's statement with a certain amount of scepticism.  The huge amount of Government expenditure, higher than ever in absolute terms and in the ratio to the GNP, must be a potential prime <Col N="217" /> cause in defeating other efforts to stem inflation.  The Minister knows that inflation is bound to continue.  He may not want to know at what rate it will continue but he has a vested interest in seeing that it continues or otherwise his revenue expectations will be deflated.</P>
    <P>Listening to Deputy Governey, it is interesting to note how two interpretations of the budget can differ so radically. Deputy Governey seemed to think it was a good budget for the middle income group and for the less well off people.  Possibly it depends on which side of the House one sits in considering this matter, but in my opinion the budget hits at the middle class section and also at the vast majority of the working class.  We welcome the social welfare and other benefits that have been given but we realise that the working man will be liable for more taxation and that there will be more calls on his pay packet. What the Government have done is somewhat reminiscent of the kind of three card trick played at fairs.  By its nature it will give rise to demands for pay increases and it will make it difficult to negotiate a national pay agreement.</P>
    <P>The Minister is trying to face in two directions at the same time; on the one hand he wants inflation and, on the other hand, he says he wants to contain it.  The budget is an indication that he favours inflation because it is the main source of tax revenue but, of course, the Minister is obliged to produce the other face for the housewives and trade unions to try to convince them that he is fighting energetically and vigorously to contain inflation.  He has told us he is satisfied that this year's estimate of revenue is realistically based and was arrived at after careful analysis of the trend of tax revenue buoyancy in recent years.  This is an admission that taxpayers will have to pay everincreasing amounts to satisfy spendthrift notions of the Government.</P>
    <P>I do not say the Government are not disposed to help the lesser well-off hut I think they are anxious to get their hands on money and, when they <Col N="218" /> have done that, to throw away that money.  Buoyancy of revenue has been described as the tax skimmed off wage and salary increases.  This is a euphemism for what in effect is an illusionist trick: now you see your pay increase, now you do not see it. The pay increase will not be of any use because it will be eaten up in price increases and taxation.  I know it is difficult to contain price increases.  It is not possible to produce a magic wand, to wave it and say that is the end of the matter.  I am appalled at the rate of price increases allowed in the past week.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said there was an examination of each individual tax head in the light of macro-economic projections for the year.  I am just an ordinary rural Deputy with a good idea of what taxation means and what it costs the ordinary worker.  I do not understand what that load of gobbledygook means.  Perhaps the Minister will explain it in his reply.  My feeling is that he will refer back to it when things are going wrong and say he was right all the time.  I can interpret that only as some cover-up for something.</P>
    <P>I am sure of one thing.  The buoyancy of revenue will certainly not be handed back to those who contributed to it because if it were it would show that the Minister had some faith in his own words and it would have the twin effect of damping down inflation and cooling excessive wage demands.  We all realise the Minister and the Government will have a very difficult problem in trying to negotiate a national wage agreement and I do not think this staggering budget is a cause for self-satisfaction or glorification. Government expenditure has hit a record level.  I think that the Minister would have been much better thanked if he had endeavoured to ensure the retention of the present value of money instead of having money incomes rising but real benefits contracting.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his budget has played his part in making this crazy situation crazier.  Having said that and having said that I realise some of the difficulties the Minister has in attacking <Col N="219" /> the problems confronting him, I was particularly taken by the part of his speech referring to tax evasion.  I hope he is not paying only lip service to this very laudable cause because it is a worthwhile ideal which should be pursued strenuously.  I am sure that from the Minister's experience as a member of a professional body and as one who has had numerous contacts with other professional bodies, he must be aware that large scale evasion of tax is practised.  This is openly acknowledged and is openly resented by those who cannot hope to pay less than their correct liability.</P>
    <P>All of us from time to time are aware of the number of professional people who seem to be able to evade the income tax net.  Of course, it must be stated that large numbers of doctors, dentists, and so on, undoubtedly declare their true incomes, but, unfortunately, there are many who do not.  I am not sure of the percentage. Most important of all, there is a firm conviction in the public mind that nearly all professional people are getting away with or are avoiding paying income tax.  Therefore, if the Minister did nothing more in his term of office than to put all taxpayers on an even footing he will have done a very good job.</P>
    <P>I would point out that, while justice must be done in this respect, it must also be seen to be done and this brings us to the kernel of the thingstaffing in the Department to manage this operation.  There should be no penny-pinching in the recruitment of adequate staff to pursue this aim.  The criterion should not be the percentage cost of collection because if that is to be the criterion failure will inevitably result.  The only way to manage this operation is to recruit an adequate staff and to judge results by the net cost, not the percentage cost.</P>
    <P>If justice is done and seen to be done in this matter the man who suffers the burdens of PAYE will have the justifiable satisfaction of knowing that his tax burden is no greater than that of his professional counterparts, and even if he considers that burden to be excessive he will not feel the <Col N="220" /> same sense of resentment because he will know everybody is carrying his fair share of the burden.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope the Minister is serious in saying he will attempt to defeat the tax dodger.  For far too long those people, to use a rural phrase, have had a field day, unfortunately, at the expense of those who have had to contribute their due share.  Up to now the efforts to catch up with tax dodgers have been feeble and the general public have not taken seriously attempts by the Revenue Commissioners to catch up with them.</P>
    <P>The Minister has available to him a tremendous number of trained personnel, highly qualified men, and I do not think he should hesitate to utilise the vast reservoir of talent in the Department to concoct some scheme to catch up with tax dodgers.  It is common knowledge that most of the tax avoidance schemes recently in use here have been imported from the UK.  Irish experts in this field do not have to think up any new schemes of avoiding tax.  All they have to do is look to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer and see which loopholes he is plugging in his budget.  They know that these loopholes will not be plugged here until the following year.  Therefore the Minister for Finance here should pay close attention to the loopholes being plugged by the Chancellor of the Exchequer so that similar action will be taken here immediately.  The whole aim of the Minister for Finance should be to ensure that tax avoidance is at the minimum. I would also suggest that the Minister should be prepared to bring in a Bill to amend the law as it stands at any time when the House is in session, and not just wait for the Finance Bill to do that.  I am confident that most Deputies who have given the matter any thought would support him.</P>
    <P>We know that operating in this country there are a number of competent and reputable accountancy firms. They give an excellent tax service to their clients.  Their clients also hear stories of &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; firms who have the reputation of being able to get their clients out of paying any tax whatsoever.  This puts these honourable <Col N="221" /> and, indeed, reputable firms in a most invidious position.  The least that can be said about it is that it puts them in a very difficult position.  I think the House will agree that it is wrong that these firms should find themselves in that position.  A further follow-up is that new clients who hear of the reputation of the &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; accountancy firms naturally gravitate towards the wise boys.  This is a situation which should not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>We must advert as well to the misuse and, at times, the flagrant misapplication, of benefits arising from legislation passed some years ago, legislation, I would add, which was passed with the very best intentions.  Indeed, it was passed to encourage more harmonisation and more trade between Great Britain and Ireland.  I do not think there is any doubt but that this concept was admirable, but steps were not taken to prevent abuses.  Not only has there been downright fraud at times in this situation, but nowadays even some of our own most respected financial institutions are getting in on the act, not to mind foreign finance institutions which have capitalised on our benevolence without contributing in any way to the welfare of this nation.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the function of Dáil Éireann is merely to pass legislation. We have a right and, indeed, an obligation to bring before the House any abuses we see of the legislation we pass.  We cannot abrogate our responsibilities by adopting the attitude that we have done our part and now it is up to the Civil Service or some other public body to do theirs.  I do not think we can be quite satisfied that we have fulfilled our function by relying on the Committee of Public Accounts which does a very good job within a very limited sphere.  That committee is a very useful parliamentary institution but it may not have been used in the past to the best possible advantage to ensure that there was no misuse of the legislation we passed here.</P>
    <P>The time has come when the laws on the Statute Book must be reviewed in the light of their performance and utility.  While generous tax allowances and fillips are given for specific purposes, inquiries should be made at <Col N="222" /> regular intervals so that Deputies can be made aware of the most recent results and, indeed whether there are any weaknesses or deficiencies in some of the laws.</P>
    <P>The export reliefs are a subsidy on exports.  This subsidy could not be given direct because of the obligations imposed on us by international trade treaties, so we threw the burden on the Revenue Commissioners.  This section was not geared to undertake a job of this kind.  We have suffered because of that fact.  A very thorough investigation should be conducted into the whole question of the allocation of grants and of these tax incentives.  A number of these tax reliefs probably have not very long to run but, even at this late stage, something might be salvaged.  They should be examined carefully to see if they could be plugged and to ensure that there are no loopholes in them.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I made a suggestion in this House&mdash;and other Deputies agreed with me&mdash;that a memorandum explaining the intentions of the legislators should be circulated.  I can well understand that there may be practical and legal difficulties in the way of such a procedure.  Nevertheless, the Minister for Finance is on record as saying that it is now advisable to review tax legislation and to overhaul the system to make it more comprehensive and comprehensible. The fact is that no matter what changes are made the legal format will remain the same.  In that condition, Acts will still be totally incomprehensible to the man in the street.</P>
    <P>If the parliamentary draftsmen cannot put proposals in straight, simple and understandable language, there must be a clear case for adding to their work, or getting in somebody else who can do it, making it quite clear exactly what the legislators had in mind and what they wanted to achieve, while, at the same time, keeping the general public informed and helping them to get to grips with laws which cause money to be extracted from them.  It is absolutely vital that our laws should be clear and unambiguous, so that in most cases the man in the street can understand what we are trying to get at <Col N="223" /> and trying to achieve.  Allied to the type of problem I have been discussing, is the fact that most taxpayers, particularly those who come within the Pay-As-You-Earn group, have a vague if undefined feeling that, if they knew more about the tax law as it is enforced, they would be able to get away with paying less.  In many cases that feeling is justified and they would, if they were aware of their rights, be paying less.</P>
    <P>The legal axiom is that ignorance of the law is no excuse.  That may be valid were it applied to civil or criminal matters.  I do not think it should be extended to apply to matters of a revenue nature.  My suggestion to counteract that, to some degree, would be that we should launch a publicity campaign to educate the public.  This could be done at reasonably little expense in a question and answer advertisement in the newspapers. This could subsequently be issued in booklet form.  The trade union groups should arrange for lectures to their officials who, in turn, could go along and tell people what was involved for them.  An intelligent use of radio programmes is also to be recommended.  It is high time people knew the basis on which part of their pay is deducted from them.  The ideal situation would be that in which every man and woman could calculate his or her own tax liability without difficulty. This ideal may never be realised but it is an ideal we should strive after. Even if these proposals are not acceptable, they may at least provoke some discussion somewhere and, perhaps, someone will come up with a solution to the problem.  In America the tax authorities told their clients to make their own assessments and they will check the assessments to ensure they are correct.  That might be a little too Utopian, but one can visualise the potential tremendous saving in manpower as a result of such a system.</P>
    <P>This budget was a big disappointment to many people.  We expected a great deal.  We were led to expect that we were going to get the goods delivered to us.  Deputy O'Brien said that the National Coalition did not do <Col N="224" /> a proper selling job on the budget.  If the budget was good enough it would have sold itself and no one would have to do any selling job on it.  The result of the Presidential election can certainly be taken as a reflection of what the ordinary man-in-the-street thought of the budget; he gave his answer in no uncertain terms.  You cannot have an imposition of penal taxation, such as that imposed by the Minister for Finance in this budget, and not expect to have an adverse reaction.  No one likes taxation, but everybody agrees it has to be imposed. Had the people been shown clearly how this vast amount of money collected by way of taxation was going to be spent and had they clearly seen it would be properly utilised they would not have objected to the budget.  Of course, this was a Fine Gael budget, not a National Coalition budget.  Not alone was it a Fine Gael budget, it was a conservative Fine Gael budget.</P>
    <P>We did not hear anything about a tax on wealth, a theme very well explored by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce.  We did not hear anything about the 5 per cent or 10 per cent submerged population.  We did not hear anything about bringing minimum wages up to a reasonable level.  Obviously, the socialist or Labour Party members of the Government did not have any say in the budget at all.  Anyone who knows anything about politics knows this was a Fine Gael budget.  Some of the workers who were misguided enough to vote for Labour in the last election recognised that and clearly showed their recognition in the Presidential election; they cast their votes against the National Coalition.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to tell the Coalition Government how they should operate but they will certainly not operate for very long if they continue to introduce this type of budget or introduce legislation bearing the same hallmark as this budget.  It is time the Government made a clear statement about their attitude to public ownership. Are we going to have a situation in which firms which might be prepared to set up industries here are <Col N="225" /> scared away because of the tenor of speeches made before the 1969 and, again, before the 1973 election by members of the Labour Party? It is time the National Coalition Government came out in the open and made a categorical statement with regard to their attitude to public ownership. There can be no shilly-shallying about this because&mdash;there is no doubt about it&mdash;there are people who might consider setting up industries here who are now having second thoughts.  It is very important, therefore, that a definite statement should be made.</P>
    <P>I believe some of the vast revenue collected should be devoted to helping the amalgamation and rationalisation of the creamery industry.  Rationalisation will be vital if we are to survive in free EEC conditions.  In West Cork we have already started rationalisation. Rationalisation should be going on throughout the whole country and funds must be made available for this purpose.</P>
    <P>The rates policy of this National Coalition Government has been a disaster. I cannot understand how men of reputedly high intelligence and brain power can make such gigantic errors.  Perhaps they are not errors. Perhaps this is the definite policy of a Fine Gael Government coming through, a policy which ensures that the better off are least affected by any increase in taxation and, at the same time, gain the maximum relief. One reaches the stage at which one wonders whether budgets are relevant any longer.  Will we see a time in this Parliament when we will not have any budgets? I should not like to see that day.  Budgets provide an opportunity for reviewing the national economy and making projections for the future, no matter how Utopian some of those projections may be.</P>
    <P>I am positive of one thing.  Unless this Government make a determined effort to stop the spiralling of prices we will have very serious difficulties. I know some of the decisions they will have to take will not be popular; they will meet with a lot of adverse propaganda and publicity as a result of them but they should be taken <Col N="226" /> and taken firmly and strongly.  Indeed, new methods and new institutions or committees or councils should be set up to ensure that we do not have the dramatic rise in prices&mdash;that is an under-statement&mdash;that we have had in the past couple of months.  Any money involved in any one of these committees would be money wellspent if it contained price increases.</P>
    <P>In the next couple of months we will see the real problem of the nation when we are trying to negotiate a national wage agreement.  How can we, in all honesty, expect the trade unions to agree to a reasonable national pay agreement if no sooner than that agreement is made it is irrelevant in relation to the price increases that have taken place when they were negotiating the agreement?</P>
    <P>It is very important for all of us on every side of the House to give every help towards curbing price increases. If we achieve nothing else this year except that we will have done a very good job indeed for the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to wish the Minister for Finance well in his position.  He has a very difficult task. I listened to Deputy Governey speaking today and he seemed to be making excuses for the budget.  He was explaining that the Government were only a short period in office and that because of this we should overlook this budget and look forward to a budget 12 months from now.  Perhaps he did not spell it out as clearly as I have done but this seemed to be his line.  Perhaps in the normal course with a government only a short time in office this excuse would be acceptable to the House and to the people at large but we must remember the circumstances in which the National Coalition succeeded in getting into office.  They succeeded in getting into office by promises, promises they made to the electorate with a view to winning votes in the general election.  Now the public are disappointed that the promises are not being implemented.  Instead of that we have excuses being made about the length of time they have been in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="227" /> It has been said, too, that prices would rise regardless of what government were in office.  Of course, this is true.  One can say with certainty that there is no expanding economy anywhere in the world in which prices are not rising but the National Coalition candidates prior to the election deliberately created the impression that we had high prices because we had a Fianna Fáil government. They made prices an issue during the election campaign.  We have seen what has happened since the election.  While I said that prices would rise regardless of what government were in office I know that Fianna Fáil would have made a genuine effort to control prices and that they would have had a fair measure of success.</P>
    <P>Government speakers have said that a bad job was done on the selling of the budget to the public, especially with regard to the increases in social welfare benefits.  This year was the year that was looked forward to as the one in which we were to have a tremendous expansion in the social welfare services because of our entry into the EEC.  This was the argument put forward in the referendum last May during the campaign on our entry into the EEC.  It was said that because we would have a saving of £30 million we would be able to give greater increases than ever before to social welfare recipients. We had committed ourselves to that. The social welfare recipients have been disappointed with the amount of increase they are to get.  In the normal course of events they would not be disappointed but with the huge price increases that have taken place the benefit of what they are to get has been taken from them.  It will be taken up by the increased price of one commodity, say, meat.</P>
    <P>The budget is a disappointment, too, in that it goes a long way towards creating a new poor because it hits the working classes very hard.  There is no relief from income tax such as was given last year by Deputy Colley when he was Minister for Finance.  A substantial number of people were taken <Col N="228" /> out of the tax net then.  There is no such relief in this budget so, in this direction, too, it is a disappointment. The people had been expecting a wonderful and imaginative budget because the impression had been created that the National Coalition Government had the brains to introduce imagination into a budget.  However, there is no sign of imagination in this budget.  For instance, there have been no concessions comparable to those given in the past by Fianna Fáil to old age pensioners&mdash;free travel and electricity. There has been no relief given in respect of income tax.</P>
    <P>In this context I had expected that some such relief would be given to those who must travel long distances to their places of employment.  This matter is very important in terms of the development of industry in rural Ireland, especially in the west.  We must do everything possible to provide employment in rural Ireland but the establishing of industries throughout the country will involve workers in travelling long distances to and from work.  Unfortunately, the Ballingarry collieries in my constituency were closed and the result was that the people who worked there must now travel more than 40 miles to the Silvermines. This is a great hardship for those people and I am disappointed that there is no relief for such people in this budget.</P>
    <P>Not only is there no relief in respect of travel to and from work but the cost of such travel is being increased greatly.  The rate of VAT on motor cars is to be increased, as will the cost of petrol, tyres and road tax.  In addition, there is a new charge of a £5 registration fee in respect of a new car.</P>
    <P>Speakers from the Government benches have reminded us that the promise to remove VAT from foodstuffs is being honoured.  However, it was promised also that this tax would not be put on essential items and that only luxury goods would be affected. Can anybody argue that a car that is being used to transport people to and from work is a luxury item? It is a necessity in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="229" /> Deputy Governey mentioned the increases in children's allowances.  Here, again, the Minister could have done better by trying to be selective.  It does not make sense that a man with a net income of £2,499 qualifies for children's allowances even if he has only one, two or three children, while a man with a net income of £5,100 regardless of whether he may have as many as 14 children, does not qualify for the increases being granted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy saying that somebody with an income of £5,000 should benefit from the increases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone with an income of £2,501.  This is not a realistic situation and it is very unfair especially when one realises that that person might be employed by somebody who is outside the income tax net and would be drawing children's allowances in full, regardless of income, and there are many such people in this country.  Therefore, this provision is hitting the middle class person and is going a long way towards creating the new poor to which I have referred already, the people who are carrying the load all the time and a load that is becoming increasingly heavier. These people have a right to cry halt at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of prices was an issue in the general election campaign. Many National Coalition candidates visited such places as supermarkets and told housewives that Fianna Fáil were responsible for the high cost of foodstuffs and they promised that if they got into office food prices would be reduced.  We know that these tactics were successful and that votes were won on the basis of that promise but the people realise now that they were fooled.  As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach said on television when the National Coalition candidate in the Presidential Election was conceding defeat, this is a painful situation for the Government. Deputy Kelly was being honest and I pay him a tribute for that but the Government got themselves into this situation and they are likely to have many more painful situations.  The <Col N="230" /> public will avail of the next opportunity that is afforded to them of indicating by their votes that they resent being fooled on any occasion.</P>
    <P>To return again to the question of VAT and the promise that only luxury goods would be subjected to an increased rate, I wonder how the Minister can explain the imposition of VAT on sporting goods.  Surely such items are not in the luxury bracket especially at a time when we should be making every effort to encourage sports so that our young people might have a worthwhile way of spending their leisure time.  There are many organisations throughout the country which are giving very valuable help in this regard but they have been very disappointed by the Government's action.  They are disappointed, too, that there is to be a reduction in the amount granted to sporting organisations especially in respect of recreation centres.  I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider his proposals in this regard in view of the importance of sporting facilities to our youth.</P>
    <P>I regret to note, also, that rates will continue to be paid on community halls because these premises are very important both in rural and in urban areas.  I had a question down to the Minister for Local Government on this matter last week and I was disappointed with the reply I received. I would look upon rates on a community hall or on a sports centre as a tax on local initiative, because usually those centres are provided by local people supplying voluntary labour, by local people collecting finance for such a project.  It is very sad to see that the Government who should be giving that encouragement are discouraging them by increasing taxation on what they put into those halls by way of facilities and by not derating those halls.</P>
    <P>The point was made that the 25 per cent reduction in rates right across the board will be a help to such centres.  I agree it will be a help, but they are being put on a par with big business premises, with speculators who amass huge incomes from luxury flats, and so forth.  It is not right or <Col N="231" /> proper to class sports centres and community halls with this type of operation.  The Government should have another look at this, especially in view of the fact that we, on this side of the House, had also taken a stand in regard to rates, that we had come to the conclusion that rates were an unfair system of taxation, unfair in the sense that they do not take into account the ability of the person to pay.  We decided to take steps to eliminate rates gradually, but the difference between what we intended to do and what the National Coalition Government have done is that we were starting to eliminate rates from the property of those who are feeling the pinch most, the less well-off sections of the community. We had derated agricultural holdings completely up to a valuation of £20 and on a sliding scale up to £33.  We had taken the social welfare people out of the rates net as well.  We had then committed ourselves to derating private houses completely.  This would have been a tremendous help, but while what the Coalition have done in reducing rates by 25 per cent across the board is of little help to the less well-off sections of the community, it is of great benefit to big business. We do not go along with this, and I should like to see it changed.  That is why I am again appealing for the derating of community halls and sports centres throughout the country.</P>
    <P>While the increase in tax on drink and tobacco cannot be criticised too much, those on small incomes will find they cannot afford these luxuries, if you like to call them that, although they are luxuries people are entitled to have if they so wish.  People in old age, especially, are entitled to their pint of stout or to smoke their pipe. While they get some small increase in their old age pension, with the huge increase in prices, this is eroded long before they get it.  Therefore, I would like to think that these people will not be denied these luxuries in the evening of their lives.</P>
    <P>It was said here by some Government speakers that this was a budget for the young people.  If by young people they mean children, then it certainly <Col N="232" /> is not so, because the tax has been increased on sweets, soft drinks and ice cream.  If they need football boots or a hurley or any other sports item, the tax on it has been increased. Therefore, the budget is no help to those young people.  If it is intended as a help to young people starting out in married life, settling down and building a home for themselves, it cannot be argued that there is any advantage in it for them.  The cost of going to and from work has increased for them. There is no relief in their income tax. It is made hard for them to save for a house which they would wish to provide for themselves.  Then this budget increased the tax on building materials for a house for which they would have tried to save.  If they get over the problem of building the house, even with the increased loan, they will find that the tax has increased on the furniture, on the kitchen utensils and so on.  For practically everything that goes into that house they will have to pay more due to this budget.  Therefore, it is no help whatsoever to those people.</P>
    <P>Our tourist industry will certainly be affected by the increased prices.  With the steep increase in prices that has taken place here there is no longer the same incentive for people to come to Ireland on holidays.  This is regrettable, and I suggest that the Government must take steps to control rising prices. This budget does nothing in that way. It is adding to our inflation and, in fact, increasing it at an alarming rate, something which is causing concern to the people of the country.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that I do not agree with the 25 per cent rates reduction right across the board.  It is estimated that this will cost £9 million but it is extraordinary that the estimates of the regional health boards have been cut by roughly the same amount.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>By the former Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. Fahey Mr. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>These cuts to the regional health boards will affect the ordinary person requiring medical services. On the other hand, it will give relief in rates in a very big way to the big business people.  This is entirely wrong.  Deputy Crowley was correct <Col N="233" /> when he stated that this budget had all the signs of being a Fine Gael budget and not that of a National Coalition Government.  This has been borne out by the fact that we have had very few Labour speakers during this debate.  It is quite obvious that it is a Fine Gael budget because, in typical Fine Gael fashion, it looks after the well-off sections of the community to the disadvantage of the less well-off, particularly the working class people.</P>
      <P>It is no wonder that we had the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy FitzGerald, stating on television on the night the National Coalition presidential candidate had conceded defeat that they were disappointed with the number of votes their candidate received from the working class people of the country.  It is no wonder they were disappointed, but they do not have to go very far to look for the answers.  They should know by now that they cannot fool the people in this way.  They should also realise that the people analyse all legislation passed in this House and, above all, that they will analyse a budget to see what is in it for them.  The people had no difficulty in seeing that there was nothing in this budget for them.</P>
      <P>For this reason I can understand the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach, Deputy Kelly, to whom I paid tribute earlier for being honest and outspoken, on television&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when he said that this was a painful situation for the National Coalition Government.  Unless the Government is going to change its tactics and look after the people of this country, there will be many painful situations for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the £30 million saving on our agricultural exports. I am disappointed that the bulk of this did not go back to the farming community.  Because the saving was there the farmers expected that they would get a fair amount of this £30 million.  It would be wise for the Government, <Col N="234" /> in the interest of the economy of the country, to do this because farming is starved for finance. This need for investment in agriculture has been accelerated during the last 12 months.  Because of our entry into the EEC and the fact that the markets within the Community pay high prices, stock prices in this country have increased enormously.</P>
    <P>This does not mean that the farmer has any greater income than he had in the previous year.  It means that his capital needs are much greater. The need to invest is greater if the farmer is to take full advantage of the markets which are available to him now and if he is to exploit them to the full.  I suggest to the Minister for Finance and to the Government that a decision should be reached as soon as possible on the subsidising of the rate of interest which farmers have to pay on money borrowed.  The rate of interest which the farmers are paying at present is too high for the return that farmers get on borrowed money.  Every encouragment should be given to farmers to borrow and, for this reason, it is essential that this decision should be taken as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The farmers are very disappointed with the budget and, particularly, with regard to the promise made to them that death duties would be abolished. This was made a very big issue in the general election campaign and, I have no doubt, it played a big part in securing votes for the National Coalition candidates.  The farmers feel that they were misled on this issue.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that in the budget last year, and the previous year, the Minister for Finance gave concessions with regard to death duties. Following that, because of our decision to enter the EEC, the value of land and stock increased enormously and this resulted in many more farmers being brought within the death duty bracket. Because of this they had a right to be alarmed.  They asked to meet the then Taoiseach, Deputy J. Lynch, to discuss this matter.  Deputy Lynch realised that they were alarmed and he promised to have a look at the position with regard to death duties and how they could be <Col N="235" /> eased and perhaps abolished completely.</P>
    <P>The National Coalition candidates played on the fear of the farmers at that time in regard to death duties. Now the election is over but the estate duties have not been abolished as was promised.  Some easement has taken place and this is something I welcome because I feel that estate duties are very harsh especially when applied within the immediate family.  While the value of farm land and stock has increased enormously over the past 12 months this does not mean that the farmer has any more in his pocket.  It is only when he puts his assets on the market and sells that the increased value brings in more money to him.</P>
    <P>Not alone did the farmers think death duties would be abolished, they were also given the impression the measure would be retrospective and, as a consequence, many former supporters of Fianna Fáil voted for the National Coalition Government.  The Government must know the tide is running against them now and that the public have lost confidence in them.  They have nobody to blame but themselves because they won the General Election by fooling the people.  It is time they got down to do some solid work for the people.</P>
    <P>I endeavoured by way of question here to raise the matter of the huge tax increase on cut-down lorries, land rovers and jeeps but I was not allowed to do so.  There has been a 20-fold increase here from £2.50 to £50.  This type of vehicle is used extensively by farmers as a runabout, allowing them to use tractors and other heavy vehicles for other work.  The use of runabouts is important in reducing costs to farmers, thus allowing them to be competitive in the EEC.  The action taken by the Government was wrong.  I should like to know if there has been any demand from any section to increase the tax on the vehicles I have mentioned.  This tax has been imposed at a time when subsidies are being removed from manures, such as the £6 subsidy per ton on potash.  I suggest the Government take a close look at this matter <Col N="236" /> because if our farmers cannot compete in the EEC it will be bad for the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Governey tried to make excuses for the budget and he told us to look forward to the next budget.  I doubt if the National Coalition Government will be in power long enough to bring in another budget, but if they are in power I hope they will make a better job of the next budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>One fails to understand why Fianna Fáil speakers have displayed such ignorance of their own performance in the past.  Most of the present Fianna Fáil Party were not Members of this House during the 1940s and 1950s.  I can remember clearly the late Dr. O'Higgins and the former Taoiseach, Mr. Costello, putting down a motion asking the House to give an increase of what was then 2s 6d per week to the old age pensioners, the equivalent of 12 ½p today.</P>
      <P>At that time Fianna Fáil made it clear they would not do it and they showed their contempt and disregard for the old people by going into the division lobby and voting against granting an increase of 12½p.  This happened in 1947.  It is regrettable that many of the Fianna Fáil Deputies who have contributed to this debate did not do some homework regarding Fianna Fáil policy over a long period with regard to tackling the great problem of the elimination of poverty from our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget is the first and most practical step taken since the foundation of the State towards the elimination of poverty.  There may be evidence of high living standards and of considerable spending in this country but no one can deny that there is a vast amount of concealed poverty.  This is widespread among lonely people, among people with large families, disabled persons, those incapable of working, old age pensioners, widows, orphans, the blind and the sick.  For the first time a Government have taken a practical step to aid those unable to help themselves, who have been loud in their appeals to Fianna Fáil for the last 16 years to improve their living standards. <Col N="237" /> However, Fianna Fáil turned a blind eye and a deaf ear to their appeals.  Fianna Fáil did nothing by way of social welfare or other benefits to help those who could not help themselves.  All that Fianna Fáil spokesmen and Ministers could give them was despair and depression.</P>
    <P>This budget, the subject of severe criticisms by Fianna Fáil, is the first breakthrough for the poor of the country and even the most brazen Fianna Fáil supporter must admit that there are vast numbers of poor people who have been put to the pin of their collar to eke out an existence despite the many election promises of Fianna Fáil over the years.  Nothing was done, with the result that according to statistics, which we have no reason to doubt, 687,000 people in this country were living on incomes on or below the breadline.  That is the result of 16 years of Fianna Fáil Government and it is something for which they should hang their heads in shame at their mismanagement and at the disgraceful manner in which they faced their responsibility to eliminate poverty from our society.</P>
    <P>The utterances against this budget expressed by Fianna Fáil Deputies have been prompted by envy and jealousy that they did not do what the Minister for Finance has done this year.  When there was a motion in the House prior to the 1948 election Fianna Fáil refused to recognise the rights of old people.  Indeed, they displayed public contempt for the circumstances in which old people lived. Now they find it very hard to accept the practical steps taken towards bringing our social welfare payments nearer to those obtaining in Northern Ireland and elsewhere.  This gap in our social welfare payments was used to advantage by Fianna Fáil who said we could never hope to reach the standards in the UK or the North unless we had the resources of the British Empire behind us.</P>
    <P>This budget presents the first instalment to close that gap.  None of the Fianna Fáil speakers has yet told us what their priorities are, whether the rich are still their first priority, <Col N="238" /> whether they will first care for the well-to-do and the carefree or whether they would now follow the example of the Minister for Finance this year in helping the poor in our community so that hope and better living standards can be given to the 687,000 people living on incomes which could barely keep sufficient food on their tables for seven days a week.</P>
    <P>This Government have their priorities right.  Their first care is to look after the sections of our community in most need who can now feel at least that they are getting a reasonable share of the nation's wealth.  If there was an iota of sincerity in the Fianna Fáil speakers they would extend compliments and greetings to the Minister for Finance for his determination and courage in trying to solve this problem, the removal of poverty from our society.</P>
    <P>Listening to Fianna Fáil speakers one would imagine the present Government have been in office as long as Fianna Fáil were.  The last speaker said the first budget of the Government may be their last.  I hope I will be excused if I attempt a prophecy.  To dispel any doubts in the minds of Fianna Fáil supporters in the House and in the country, I prophecy the possibility of a National Coalition Government for many long decades. The Coalition Government have been in office for only three months and, in that short time, they have introduced many beneficial measures for the people.  They would need to be in office for the full lifetime of the present Parliament before they could undo the damage to the economy perpetrated by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Now that we have got rid of Fianna Fáil we have got rid of them for a long time and not alone can we look forward to good Government but we can rely on honest Government, a Government honest in the discharge of their duties and honest in getting their priorities right.  That is exactly what they did when they increased old age pensions and improved children's allowances.  Is it not only right that, if there were to be substantial increases in children's allowances, <Col N="239" /> those increases should be given to the poorer families, to families with low incomes?  Would Fianna Fáil like to have seen the Minister giving money to wealthy people at the expense of working-class people with large families, not only in this city but in rural Ireland?  I would not subscribe to that.</P>
    <P>The manner in which it was done reflects understanding, reflects a social conscience, and reflects justice on the part of the Government.  When they had money to spend on improving children's allowances it was devoted to the families of low wage earners and to families whose income was considered insufficient.  I fail to understand the social conscience of the Fianna Fáil Party in relation to that section of the budget.  When I hear them speak about the £30 million which it was alleged would be saved on agricultural subsidies I have to charge them with this.</P>
    <P>A few moments ago Deputy Fahey said he was sorry that some of the £30 million was not devoted to agriculture. Deputy Brennan, when he was Minister for Social Welfare, wanted all the £30 million spent on social welfare. Both Deputy Brennan and Deputy Fahey knew that they had already entered into commitments for it.  During the election campaign they told the people that there would be vast improvements in social welfare payments as a result of that £30 million. They used that as a means of getting votes.  When the election was over they knew they could say commitments had already been entered into and that, due to a policy of inflation, the £30 million had been eaten up.</P>
    <P>In the same way, the former Taoiseach. Deputy Lynch, said he had a plan and that he was going to do something about death duties.  If he had a plan he kept it to himself.  Nobody else knew anything about it.  In the same way, when the Minister for Education abolished a compulsory pass in Irish for the leaving certificate, the former Minister, Deputy Faulkner, said he was going to do the same thing but did not get time to do it.  I wonder if the Leader of Fianna Fáil and all those who profess to speak for Fianna Fáil know that it is that kind of conduct <Col N="240" /> and deceit which put them where they will be for a long time, on the opposite side of this House.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lynch and Fianna Fáil had no notion of doing anything about death duties.  They were 16 years in Government and did not do anything about them.  Why did the leader of Fianna Fáil not tell us well in advance that Fianna Fáil would do something practical about death duties?  He did not do it, but said he had a plan himself which he must have kept to himself.  He did not even tell his colleague, Deputy Colley.  Only Deputy Lynch knew about this plan. Now that he is in Opposition he says he was going to do something about it. Deputy Faulkner tells us if he had a few months more he would have done exactly what the Minister for Education did in relation to the Leaving certificate and the Irish language.</P>
      <P>Now we are told that if they had got back into office in the last general election, according to Deputy Fahey, farmers would have got the £30 million that was not there for them.  On the other hand Deputy Brennan said and he will continue to say, that the £30 million that was not there would have been lashed out among the old age pensioners, the widows and orphans.  It is time to catch out that type of deceit and it has been caught out on this occasion with no hope of recovery.  That is the type of double talking in Government that is now resented by an intelligent electorate.  It was the intelligent electorate at the last general election who gave notice to quit and proceeded to remove Fianna Fáil from office.  It was the intelligent electorate who put this Government here, and this Government will be judged on their record of achievements at the end of four years.  One of the priorities will be to eliminate poverty from our society, poverty created by Fianna Fáil.  No party had a more wonderful opportunity to provide work, houses and decent living standards than Fianna Fáil had, and they did not do it.  It is because they did not do it that they find themselves in Opposition today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows that the type of <Col N="241" /> criticisms being voiced by Fianna Fáil, of a Government only 11 or 12 weeks in office is unreasonable and wrong. You cannot expect an intelligent electorate to fall for criticism of a Government who have not had a chance to prove themselves.</P>

      <P>One would imagine that this was the fourth or fifth budget of the National Coalition Government.  If it had been, one might expect some degree of criticism if it did not live up to the expectations of Fianna Fáil.  This budget has stunned Fianna Fáil.  They have been considering in what way they can paint a picture to discredit the budget. It is effective and businesslike.  First things were put first.  There is no loophole for serious objection from Fianna Fáil except what they can manufacture by bringing their very vivid imaginations to work in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fail to understand why there should be so much criticism of this budget by the Opposition.  May I ask the Opposition a plain and fair question: has any Deputy in Opposition any objection to an increase in the price of brandy for the purpose of giving a little more to the old age pensioner, the widow, the orphan, the disabled and so on?  Is it not correct to say that millions are spent on whiskies, on brandies, on wines and on liqueurs of all sorts?  Is it not correct to say that the lounge bars and the drinking saloons all over the country never had it so good?  Is it not correct to say that there are in our society such people as sick poor, invalids, lonely people who do not get even one square meal in the day? There are such people in our society. There are also in our society people who can afford to give a large slice of their surplus incomes, the surpluses they spend on luxuries, on whiskies, on gins, on brandies and on liqueurs, to lessen the burden of the less well off amongst us.  It is only right in the national interest, apart altogether from the Christian interest, that those <Col N="242" /> who have should be made contribute to those who have not, to those who find it impossible to provide themselves with even one square meal a day.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil cannot have it both ways.  Do they want a continuation of the high spending on liqueurs and brandies without any regard for those who can scarcely purchase a pint of milk or a loaf of bread, those for whom meat is a luxury?  These are the people this budget is designed to help, not those who have a sufficient surplus over and above what they require for clothes and food and luxuries.  The Minister had a responsibility to ensure that these people with more than a sufficiency fulfilled their duty towards their less fortunate brethren.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil are in a rebellious mood at the idea of taxing whiskies and brandies in order to give to the poor.  The rich have plenty of money to spend on luxuries and it is the rich who should be asked, in the name of Christian decency, to help the aged and the sick.  That is what this budget asks them to do.  Nothing more and nothing less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another thing this budget will do is ensure continuous employment so that people will have a decent standard of living.  Many people are in receipt of unemployment benefit because they have been denied work. This is an expansionist budget, a budget which lays a solid foundation <Col N="243" /> for the future, a budget which will be sufficiently productive to increase employment. The aim and object of the Government is to provide work and reduce the number of unemployed. The aim and object of the Government is to generate a high degree of security and independence in areas in which security and independence have never hitherto existed, in areas inhabited by the lonely and the forgotten, forgotten for 16 years so far as Fianna Fáil were concerned.</P>
    <P>This is the kind of budget the country needs and it is because there are so many excellent qualities in the budget that the Opposition try to muster in all the speakers they can in the hope that someone may say something&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He is; just for five minutes.  I should like that to go on record.  I was endeavouring to demonstrate the way Fianna Fáil disregarded and continue to disregard the poor who have been given the first ray of hope in this budget.  The Government have applied themselves to the elimination of poverty from our society and to assisting those who are in need of assistance and the Fianna Fáil Party are jealous because they could not do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to read in the newspapers about spending.  I referred to the whiskey and brandy, the gins and liqueurs.  This Government are putting first things first, looking after the people who need to be looked after. If people want to buy brandy it is a free country and they can do so but they must pay for it.  If they have sufficient money to spend on brandy it is only right that they should be taxed.  I am one Deputy who would say that the Minister for Finance was right, a thousand times right to do this if there are large numbers of our <Col N="244" /> people prepared to spend so generously on whiskey and brandy without having any consideration for the unemployed, for the old, for the sick and for the disabled.  This Government are putting those people first.  Fianna Fáil policy would be to give care and attention to the brandy drinker and the whiskey drinker first and to forget completely, as they have done so successfully for 16 years or more, the old age pensioners, the blind, the lame and the sick.  They would not give old age pensioners 12 ½ new pence in 1947 and that is not very much.</P>

      <P>I am reading from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of Wednesday, 9th August, 1972.  Fianna Fáil were in office at that time, admittedly on the way out.  Cat food and dog food was to be made available for the rich at reasonable prices when food could not be made available for the ordinary poor people&mdash;old age pensioners, widows, orphans, sick, lame, deaf or blind.  Under Fianna Fáil, the cats and the dogs enjoyed reasonably cheap food.  Fianna Fáil now realise this Government have their priorities right.  They are removing VAT in this budget from most food items from September 1st.  Among the first pieces of advice the Government got was that VAT could not be removed before November 1 st.  This Government, realising that people cannot live without food, decided to bring forward the date by two months and if it had been possible to do so, I am sure that the Minister would have brought it forward further.  Have we heard even one word of thanks from Fianna Fáil to the Minister for having done that?  Might one not expect that if they were concerned about food prices, at least some member in some part of the party, in whatever splinter it might have been, would have had the courage to stand up and say to the Minister : &ldquo;We are grateful, sir, for your kind consideration in relation to the removal of VAT from foodstuffs&rdquo;?  The advice given to the Government regarding the administrative impossibility of removing VAT from foodstuffs would not have been questioned by Fianna Fáil if they had remained in office and, consequently, VAT would have remained on foodstuffs. Our action in this regard is an expression of the Government's sincerity towards the implementation of the commitments they entered into with the electorate prior to the general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister announced that the <Col N="246" /> rate of VAT will be increased on certain items, none of which can be regarded as being essential to our everyday lives but, of course, if anyone wishes to purchase any such item, he is free to do so and the aim of this Government is to endeavour to ensure that the standard of living will be such as will enable him to make any such purchases.  It will be the task of the Department of Industry and Commerce to ensure that where VAT is removed, there will be a corresponding reduction in the prices at which the affected goods are offered for sale by traders. The Minister has done a good day's work in this regard.</P>
    <P>We had no complaints from Fianna Fáil either in respect of our action in relation to rates.  We should not divorce from the budget the outstanding concession given in this regard, a concession that is benefiting the ratepayers to the extent of £24 million.  If this relief had not been given, the rate in every county would have been increased by at least £1 in the £.  Instead, the rate has been reduced in a number of counties.  Had not Fianna Fáil been shouting from the hilltops, at church gates and elsewhere about the continuous growth of rates and how it was becoming impossible for ratepayers to meet the ever increasing charges, as they described them?  But when, for the first time ever, the State has come to the assistance of the ratepayers, there is not one word of appreciation from the Opposition.</P>
    <P>The reason why Fianna Fáil are so angry in relation to the budget is that they are jealous and that they could not have done what we have done in this instance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <P>They could not provide £24 million for the relief of rates.  They had not either the understanding or the will to do that but this Government, realising their responsibility, first to the poorer sections and then to the ratepaying community who were already overburdened, have helped in a very practical way.  The removal of VAT from foodstuffs was opposed and is opposed yet by Fianna <Col N="247" /> Fáil.  This proposal will reduce the cost of living by 0.5 of 1 per cent.  In our efforts to reduce the cost of living we might have had some co-operation from the Opposition but that was not the case.  There are none so blind as those who will not see and the reason that Fianna Fáil do not want to see in this instance is that they are disturbed by the practical nature of this budget, a budget that has been a big success.  It is the first of many budgets of the National Coalition Government that will help to expand the economy of this State and to put it on a sound footing.  Fianna Fáil's disappointment is being expressed by their own speakers.</P>
      <P>In the budget, too, there is provision for a generous estimate in respect of the Department of Local Government which will enable housebuilding to be accelerated greatly.  There is the intolerable situation here whereby more than 30,000 families are seeking housing by local authorities while there are fewer than 9,000 local authority dwellings under construction.  If any Fianna Fáil Deputy who intends contributing to this debate can tell us that he is satisfied with the progress of housing under Fianna Fáil.  I shall be prepared to remain here to listen to him so that my political education might be improved.  Can they be satisfied with a situation in which there are 30,000 families in need of housing?</P>

Fianna Fáil never seriously tackled the housing problem, but the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tully, has cut away a lot of the red tape that existed when Fianna Fáil were there to prevent the acceleration of housing.  This drive is essential if we are to relieve the conditions of those living in condemned houses or in overcrowded accommodation.  At the risk of transgressing your ruling, I would repeat that the 30,000 families sought <Col N="248" /> rehousing by local authorities and that the best Fianna Fáil could do was to provide 9,000 a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, <i>The Sunday Press,</i> and in my opinion this was politically inspired.  This nameless gentleman's comments overlooked the many advantages which this year's budget has conferred on farmers.  As one who represents a good farming constituency and who has enjoyed for over 30 years the votes of some thousands of farmers in the constituency, I would point out that this Government and this budget, thanks to the Minister for Finance, have conferred many advantages on farmers, advantages that Fianna Fáil did not like to admit, advantages that Fianna Fáil do not <Col N="250" /> like the farmers to know they have got and about which the Fianna Fáil Party will endeavour to keep the farming community in the dark.  We who are supporters of the Government have a bounden duty to use Church gate and hall to make it known to the farming community what Fianna Fáil and certain individuals connected in high places with farming organisations are trying to keep from the farmers. Death duty reliefs have been given on a scale unprecedented in the history of this House.</P>
      <P>What did Fianna Fáil do in 16 years in relation to death duties?  The leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Lynch, did say he had something in mind about death duties, but he let nobody else know anything about it.  He did not even let Deputy Colley know about it.  He did not let the country know about it prior to the election. It was like Deputy Faulkner when he was Minister for Education saying that he had something up his sleeve in relation to the Irish qualification in the leaving certificate but who, after 16 years, found that he was not long enough there to have it implemented.</P>
      <P>Relief from death duties was given to more than 25 per cent of those previously liable.  This is something which should go on record because the Press has not been very favourable in relation to this matter.  Deputies of all parties have a responsibility to tell the people the truth.  Even if this is new, and strange, to the Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party they still have a Christian obligation to tell the truth to the people.  Those in high places in agricultural organisations say that this Government have broken faith in relation to an undertaking given prior to the election even though this big number of people benefit from this change announced in the budget.</P>
      <P>This is the first time something practical was done in relation to death duties.  I know, in my capacity as a valuer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the serious problem which death duties have presented to many people in the <Col N="251" /> country.  This problem has been with these people during the 16 years of Fianna Fáil Government.  During that time it did not cross the mind of any member of that party, only silently and secretly to the Leader of Fianna Fáil, that something would have to be done about death duties.  Deputy Lynch thought of easing the problem of death duties but he had no practical proposal to deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>This budget grants total relief to more than a quarter of the people previously liable.  This in itself is a great achievement and is something that every member of the Labour and Fine Gael Parties, and their supporters, can be proud of.  More than 50 per cent of the farmers previously liable obtained complete relief while all others were given a reduction.  All this was achieved by a Government who were only three months in office. Are Fianna Fáil serious, or what do they expect the people to believe, when they offer criticism of the Government in relation to death duties?  All the people need do is to compare the decision of the Minister for Finance, taken after he was only three months in office, with that of any Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance during the past 16 years.  Fianna Fáil should be ashamed of their record in relation to death duties.  They should be ashamed to mention the words because during their terms of office the people were driven out of their homes because of the burden of death duties and not a single protest was raised by any Fianna Fáil Deputy to give these people any relief.  This Government have given the farming community something to be grateful for and their supporters something to boast about.  The farming community owe a deep debt of gratitude to the Government for easing the position in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No Coalition spokesman mentioned during the election campaign that death duties would be abolished at once. Nobody gave an undertaking that, with one stroke of the pen, death duties would be wiped out.  Fianna Fáil, and some of the leading farming organisations' spokesmen, have tried to paint <Col N="252" /> this picture throughout the country and convey to farmers that such an undertaking was given but this was not the case.  The fact remains that something has been done to give relief to the vast majority of farmers.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that to abolish death duties outright would cost more than £12 million.  This money would have to be raised by way of new taxation or withholding benefits, including rates relief.  This Government gave £24 million in relief to ratepayers but, if they were to wipe out death duties, this figure would have to be reduced by £12 million.  Realising that many small farmers were affected by rates the Government wisely devoted £24 million to give relief in this direction. This was a wise and practical step.  The complete abolition of death duties would have meant a drastic reduction in the benefits to the poor and those people who cannot provide for themselves and who never got a fair share of this country's prosperity.</P>
    <P>The Government were aware that these people were entitled to their share of national prosperity and this budget has seen to it that some degree of this prosperity is being channelled in their direction.  It would be unfair to withhold benefits from these people.  The social welfare improvements in the budget cover 700,000 families and the farmers' organisations should remember that that figure includes a number of small farmers.  I would not have intervened in this debate were it not for the fact that there is a limit to one's patience.  It is very difficult to listen to Fianna Fáil Deputies who are trying to conceal the benefits in the budget. Every Deputy who supports the Government has a moral responsibility to make known all the benefits that are available.  He has an obligation to contact the farming organisations, to attend at their meetings, to put forward the case presented by the Minister for Finance and to defend it.  He has an obligation to compare it with the record of Fianna Fáil in the last 16 years in relation to death duties and to benefits to the small farmers.</P>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity in my own constituency and elsewhere to meet all farming organisations, large or small. <Col N="253" /> rich or poor, and to discuss the budget with them.  It is a budget I can defend with pride and honour.  It is based on fact and on common sense and has a great sense of Christian charity.  Farming organisations should be told that a White Paper on a taxation system to replace death duties is in course of preparation.  Every Deputy in this House knows this is so.  However, it is necessary to carry out considerable statistical research and, as it is essential that this data be accurate, the White Paper cannot be presented overnight. It should be published within the next six or eight months, maybe sooner&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Crinion knows that Fianna Fáil have done nothing about death duties for the last 16 years.  The present Government have done something about the matter in three months and that is the comparison I want to make to the people.  That is why politically-inspired statements from people in high places are dishonest. They are not fair to the Government or to the Minister for Finance. There should be strong objections when the people are misinformed and deceived, particularly before an election.</P>
      <P>Before I was interrupted I referred to the publication of the White Paper. Let Deputy Crinion realise it will not take years to present it.  The undertaking to have consultations with interested bodies, including the IFA, will be honoured and the necessary legislation will be implemented.  I am sure there will not be any time lost in having the measure ready for discussion and debate in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If death duties were abolished overnight without provision for a fair alternative system of taxation the farmers would be the main sufferers. This country would become a tax haven for millionaires from Britain, the Continent and elsewhere, who wished to avoid paying tax.  They would build up massive tax-free estates here.  Perhaps that is what Fianna Fáil want. The people I am referring to are the type who cling to Fianna Fáil but are not the type of society I want to see in rural Ireland.  In that event farmers <Col N="254" /> would find it impossible to compete with wealthy foreign interests in the purchase of land.  For that reason, I wish to place on record the valuable contribution the budget has made with regard to death duties.</P>
    <P>This Government have been in office for a short time but already a significant impression has been created by the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  An opportunity will present itself later this year when Deputies will be able to express their appreciation of the Government's agricultural policy. The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has excelled himself in the manner in which he defended the interests of Irish farmers in Brussels and elsewhere and I am sure it has been appreciated by the farming community. Now that we are members of the EEC it is important that the common agricultural policy which guarantees fair prices to producers and good incomes to those engaged in agriculture should be preserved.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has discharged his duties with distinction and he has put forward in an able manner the case for the Irish farmers. At all times he has been concerned, in common with the Government, to ensure that the highest incomes will be given to farmers.  Nevertheless, if high incomes are readily available for our farmers in this as in other EEC countries, the question of high food prices must be faced.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil criticise the Minister for Finance and the Government as if they were responsible for increased food prices, those critics should bear in mind that we are now part of the EEC and that if we expect to get the full benefits of membership through guaranteed profitable markets for our exports, we cannot expect at the same time on the one hand to pay high prices to the agricultural community and on the other to get cheap food.  Of one thing we can be assured : while our present Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries holds office he will look after our interests in Europe where he has the confidence and affection of every member of the Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to comment further on the budget.  It is a budget which <Col N="255" /> gives a ray of hope to the poor and which inspires confidence and trust in this country as an expanding nation. It has laid a solid foundation for the future.  It is an honest budget.  One would imagine from the speeches of Fianna Fáil that they would have doled out money to every section of the community.  It must be borne in mind that, in order to shower out benefits, the means of doing so must be available.</P>
    <P>This is a courageous and an honest budget.  It is focused in the right direction, towards the poor.  It gives help where it is most needed and its contribution in relation to death duties is something worthy of note, something not contained in any Fianna Fáil budget in the past 30 years, and I remember 30 budgets being debated here.  Each provision in this budget is helpful and practical but its real effects will be felt only later this year when the recipients get their benefits. Practical steps are being taken towards raising the standard of living of all of our people and one would imagine it would be the aim and the ambition of every Member of the House without exception to co-operate with any Government whose ambition it is to improve the living standards of our people, particularly of those who have been ground down in the past without any hope of financial support in any budget.  This is the first time in which a budget has made a breakthrough towards a just society in which there will be a fair share of the national wealth for all and in which the poor will get much more than heretofore.</P>
    <P>The budget gives aid where it is most required.  Our financial resources in the next 12 months will be channelled in that direction.  It is a budget of courage and hope and, above all, it is an honest budget.  There is no double dealing in it, no squandering of public funds, no method by which public funds can be misappropriated.  More important still, this budget has been presented by an honest Government and, while it is essential to have a good Government, it is vital that that Government should have the high degree of honesty and integrity which this Government possess.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally I resist the temptation to comment on the speaker who precedes me and if on this occasion I depart from that, with your permission, Sir, it will be only for a short time and only to indicate as far as I am concerned how difficult it is to accept the gospel which he preaches from the Deputy who has concluded. On the last occasion I heard Deputy Flanagan speak from the back bench on this side he did so at great length and, I can remember, with certain embarrassment to the front bench Members of his party, during which time he made one of the strongest cases that had been made, surpassing that of Deputy Keating and all the Members of the Labour Party, against our entry into the EEC.</P>
      <P>I remember that vividly and I had a certain admiration for the backbencher who in spite of the presence of his front benchers was prepared to say out that which I accepted as his honest expression of the fears which he held as to the fate of this country should we be so bold and foolish as to enter the EEC.  He has spoken here tonight on certain increases which have been given in this year's budget.  He knows as well as I do, as well as anybody else in the House, that these increases would not have been possible were it not for the fact that the people of this country in their wisdom decided to accept membership of the EEC.</P>
      <P>I do not propose to comment any further on his contribution except to say that he was courting danger and inviting interruption when he asked Members of this side of the House to retrace with him the respective merits of preceding Governments in their attitude towards social welfare recipients.  I was glad that nobody on these benches took him up on that.  Apart from comparing additions which were made by the Fianna Fáil Government, apart from referring to increases which were given, we could have turned the other side of the coin and talked about deductions and decreases which occurred under Governments other than Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That having been said, I will now make some short and, I hope, understandable <Col N="257" /> comments on the budget. In the Minister's speech he said that in this budget there is something for everybody.  I repeat, so far as the Minister for Finance is concerned, this is a budget in which there is something for everybody.  Deputy Oliver Flanagan assured us that the Minister is an honest man.  Presumably if he is an honest man that which he says is correct.</P>
    <P>Over the years a certain section of the community did not appear to enjoy the charity of the rest of the community in thought or in action.  I do not know the reasons for it.  So far as I am concerned, this is a very important section of the community.  Why they have become an object for jokes, why they have become a subject of derision beats me.  Why now in the mind and in the expression of the Minister for Finance they have become nobodies, I do not know.</P>
    <P>The Minister says this budget contains something for everybody.  If I ask him to indicate&mdash;more important if I defy him to indicate&mdash;what he has done for unmarried ladies, the section to which I refer, the section called spinsters, he will see that he is either disregarding that section as being nobodies, or else his statement that the budget contains something for everybody is obviously false.</P>
    <P>These ladies, for one reason or another, find themselves in the single state.  Some would be prepared to admit, if admission be the word, that they have never been invited out of that state.  Others would have had the invitation but it would have come from opposites to which they were not attracted and, for their own good reasons, they would have declined. Other would have declined entering the happy state of matrimony because they live with a widowed mother, or an invalid sister or brother. They would feel their first duty should be to the members of their family. These people must exist and, to do that, they must look for and obtain employment.  They must travel to this employment.  They are in need of their own social life.  They must buy clothes and indulge in the normal expenditure of any other member of society.</P>
    <P>We all admit that prices and costs <Col N="258" /> are increasing.  Nevertheless, in this budget the only way in which the Minister could give these ladies compensation for the high rising costs, and give them recognition for the wonderful work they might be doing, was to increase their income tax allowance.  For his own good reasons, he has decided to neglect this section. For his own good reasons, and taking him on his own statement, he has decided to treat them as nobodies. What we are expected to take from that is a matter for conjecture.  Perhaps we have come to the stage where, if the interest of these people is in getting that which apparently can be given to other sections, they should depart the state in which they find themselves.  If they do not want to enter the married state, there are apparently other states into which they can enter.  Having done so, the Minister is prepared to give them recognition. It is a thought for this honest and wonderful Government which Deputy O. Flanagan tells us we have.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the agricultural community will appreciate the delicate and discreet fashion in which Deputy O. Flanagan dealt with their case and how he would tell their respected leader how he might do business on behalf of the farming community.</P>
    <P>On the day the Minister introduced the budget certain questions were put to him from this side of the House.  I appreciate that no Minister for Finance, particularly a Minister in office for only a short time, can be expected to know all the answers.  I can only speak for myself in conceding that I would be prepared to accept from him, or indeed, from any other Minister, a statement to the effect that he was not omnipotent and had not all the answers on the top of his head.</P>
    <P>I have memories of Deputies on this side of the House putting questions to the Minister for Finance in connection with that which was described as a £2,500 income.  Deputies were concerned because they were aware that all over the country there are many people in the £2,500 to £3,000 bracket. I would not describe these people as very wealthy people and I was, therefore, concerned as to what their position <Col N="259" /> would be in the matter of children's allowances and whether they would qualify for the additional allowances that were promised.  It would be an understatement to say that in the matter of his handling of these questions the Minister seemed to be at a certain loss.  On one occasion he had the assistance of the Leader of the Government and the leader of his own party, the Taoiseach, when similar questions were tabled and I remember the Taoiseach dismissing these questions from this side of the House as an exercise in playacting.  I asked the Cathaoirleach to take it from me that the Taoiseach, speaking presumably on behalf of his Minister for Finance, in reply to questions put in relation to this £2,500 net income, said that we were playacting.  I cannot recollect the column.  I have noticed since, in the course of the presidential campaign, that the Taoiseach and many other Ministers of State were at pains to explain what net income was.  I venture to say that at that stage they had realised that in this grouping were thousands of families who were not wealthy, who were indeed poor, and who were being denied the additional children's allowances.</P>
    <P>Now, quite apart from these statements. we have had advertisements in all the national newspapers explaining how the system operates.  Here I am accepting what Deputy Oliver Flanagan would say to us, namely, that we now have an honest Government&mdash;I accept it.  I should say, for argument's sake only.  I would ask them now to justify the levity with which the Minister for Finance treated the questions put to him and the Taoiseach's dismissal of the questions put to him as playacting. I would also ask them to explain why so many Ministers should have spent so much time subsequently explaining how the system works and why so much money has been spent in an effort to explain to the people what is involved.  The advertisement says that a small group of high income people will not benefit.  We take it.  therefore. that as far as this Government are concerned anybody earning £2.500 a year is in a high income group.  They then <Col N="260" /> go on in the advertisement to attempt to explain how, even though one's gross annual earnings might approximate to £3,000, one would nevertheless qualify for the additional children's allowances. We presume the advertisement was issued on behalf of this new and honest Government.</P>

I do not know, but I am assuming that he represents the normal father, a man married for ten years.  I ask the Minister to indicate to me, now that he has taken time to look at the situation, gathered some confidence and is apparently going to make an attempt at replying to questions, what kind of house this man bought when he got married. This man&mdash;married, we will assume, ten or 11 years ago&mdash;bought a house then. Houses at that time catering for this type of man were available at about £3,500.  One would have got a fairly good house at that figure.  I think the rate of interest obtaining then was, say, 5 or 5½ per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister can get figures to show me how this man now, ten years after marriage, bought a house on which he is now required to pay £405 loan interest.  If there is such a man I shall have to apologise to the Minister; but as sure as I am standing here this man is not representative of the many people in that wage or salary bracket in whom I am interested and who are not getting the children's allowance.  This gentleman too has been credited with interest on bank overdraft at £60.  We will assume that that is normal enough. Having gone through the exercise and for the purpose of accommodating him in the provisions of the budget his £3,000 is reduced to £2,322.  On that he would be required to pay normal income tax and if we take a figure say of £400 for himself and his wife plus £150 for the children, that is £1,000 income tax free, he is paying income tax on £1,300.  The income tax payable on that at, say, 35 per cent has him paying approximately £400 income tax.  We now have a new situation that this man. the only man earning a gross of £3,000 who can qualify for the Minister's generous children's allowance, must <Col N="262" /> have a net income of the difference between £2,300 and £400 which is £1,900. If he is living on £1,900 he is, according to the Minister, just immediately below the high income group and is entitled to the children's allowance.</P>
      <P>I should like to say a word in praise of and on behalf of people in that group who have commitments less than those indicated here perhaps, who have no £400 interest on the house, who might not have an overdraft, who are paying their way.  This we all appreciate represents the most responsible section in our community.  Unless we have one section of our people prepared and able to pay their way obviously the rest of us who have not got the desire or the ability to do so cannot survive.  It is a sad day and a day which is taking us on the road backwards when for this section, the section which I could prove probably represent the new poor section in our community, there is no recognition, when we classify them as being in the higher income group and deny them their children's allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a lot about the unmarried mother and I would be as sympathetically disposed to that unfortunate lady as anybody else in this House and I would advocate that for any lady who finds herself in that unfortunate position there is an obligation on the community to give her every assistance.  Having said that, I would be slow to suggest to any lady that she should find herself in those circumstances for the sake of any financial benefits that might accrue to her.  We hear an amount of talk about the working wife.  Again I have regard for and I think the community should have regard for the working wife notwithstanding the fact that if we are to encourage wives to go out to work there will not be the same number of jobs for their offspring when the offspring find themselves in the labour market.  In respect of these children's allowances it is unfortunate and it is wrong that the wife or mother who decides to stay at home and who accepts motherhood as her career is apparently not entitled to any recognition from this new, honest Coalition Government.  As I said earlier, on this lady's husband depends the wellbeing <Col N="263" /> of this country.  I am not denying any lady the right or the freedom to move out if she so desires but it is obvious that to the mother who is prepared, happy and anxious to stay at home to help with the education of her children, to shower on her children maternal love and consideration, who will be there to correct her children when they are inclined to depart from the correct course, to this lady more than any other lady the community is indebted.  This lady has come to regard children's allowances as part of the financial consideration which the community allows her.  There are, I am sure, Deputies here who will accept what I am saying.  We now find that under this great, honest and charitable Government this lady is not to get that recognition, because so far as this Government are concerned her husband, be he a civil servant or a professional man, is deemed to be in the higher income group by reason of the fact that he is earning £40 a week. While that salary may seem considerable, if it is broken down into the various commitments of the average family, it will be found that the housewife concerned is put to the pin of her collar to make ends meet.  Out of that salary must be paid food, clothing and fuel costs as well as house repayments and we may take it that such a family would be entitled to have a car.  They must also bear the cost of the education of their children and let nobody tell me that education is free.  It never has been free and never will be free.</P>
    <P>Is it the intention of the Government that the mother of that family should go to work?  Do they wish to create economic considerations that would force her to flee the house?  If that is to be the situation in our society, the cost ultimately to the State, in trying to correct the wrongs inflicted on a family because of the mother having to leave them in order to work outside the home, will be much greater than if children's allowances were to be increased further now.  I am not saying that all the problems that arise in relation to children stem from the fact that mothers go out to work but I would suggest that in such circumstances there is a greater likelihood of <Col N="264" /> there being problems.  Instead of spending £1 million on building schools for delinquent children, we should be ensuring that mothers are encouraged to remain at home and give their children the benefit of their guardianship. That would be a more desirable situation for society and would be more acceptable economically.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have expressed their disappointment and shock that the new Government have been so foolish as to reduce the moneys that are made available under the heading of sport and recreation.  Perhaps it is because of the title of that heading that the Government have not given this question the consideration it deserves.  I see a Government consisting of people who are not as familiar with the situation in this regard as they should be.  They look at figures and ask whether they might add on something in one instance and take it off in another so as to see where a gain might be made.  I can visualise them looking at the word &ldquo;sport&rdquo; and saying that this is unimportant.  How else can they explain the fact that the percentage increase this year under this heading is less than it ever has been before.</P>

      <P>The fact that it began only two years ago is all the more reason that I should refer to it.  Anything that is so new must be very sensitive to a cut-back.  What we refer to as &ldquo;sport&rdquo; is, in my opinion, physical education.  We all know that in the years that lie ahead there will be an increase in the amount of leisure time available to our people and that, consequently, it will be necessary to cater for leisure time activities as against engaged time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Oliver Flanagan, speaking earlier, took upon himself the role of Old Moore and in this regard I would venture to do the same and to say that because of advancing technology, what we call employment now will, in 15 or 20 years' time be little more than a social commitment which will engage, perhaps, 30 hours of our week.</P>

      <P>I was saying I really believe that in 15 years' time there will be very little manual work.  In 15 years' time the working week will be 30 hours or thereabouts.  Bearing that in mind, we are reminded of how important it is that people should be educated as to how they should spend their spare time gainfully.  It is the absence of this education which has brought upon us the evils and the botherations of society which exist and which manifest themselves day by day and night by night.  If the paltry sum which this Government has allocated for physical education, sport and recreation, represents the deep thinking of this new team of ours, then the sooner they bring in a gentleman like Deputy Gerry L'Estrange&mdash;who over the years, was, perhaps, ahead of most of them in so far as he was engaged in this gainful spending of his spare time&mdash;the better.  I hope that there is no note of flippancy detectable in what I say in appealing to the Government even at this late stage to make available more money for physical education or any other operation at community level that will engage the endeavours of people during their spare time.</P>

Fuair mé chomh maith líon na ndaltaí a fuair deontaisí dá bhárr, agus de réir mar thuigim, bhí mar mheán uimhir ins na tithe seo suas le scór gasúirí.  Tá a fhios agam go maith an cineál tí atá sa Ghaeltacht.  Go hiondúil ní teach mór é, agus níl mé féin ró-shásta go bhfuil sé i gceart scór gasúirí a chur isteach i dteach ar bith sa Ghaeltacht. Cinnte, dá mbeadh an méid sin ann, bheadh eagla orm nach í an Ghaeilge a bheadh á labhairt acu i gcónaí. Bheadh eagla orm chomh maith nach mbéidís ag fáil Cothrom na Féinne.

    <Title>Committee on Finance. - Adjournment Debate: Oil Refinery Policy.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter on the Adjournment because, when I <Col N="268" /> asked a question concerning oil refineries today, I received several answers to questions I had not asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I appreciate that the Minister for Education was replying on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I asked the Minister if a policy had been adopted regarding the building and siting of oil refineries in any part of the country and, if so, if he would state the policy.  The Minister, in his reply, stated that the selection of a location for any industrial project was primarily a matter for the promoters.</P>
      <P>Any project, of course, could mean a sweet factory, a footwear factory or a toy factory but, certainly, not an oil refinery.  The Minister, in his reply, went on to tell me that in the ultimate the Minister for Local Government would be the deciding factor.  I knew that this was the position to some extent but the strange thing about the Minister's reply is the fact that he never mentioned the Minister for Transport and Power, who plays a big part in the sanctioning, or otherwise, of oil refineries.</P>
      <P>Most oil refineries suggested for this country will be sited in coastal areas. The one suggested for Dublin, planning permission for which has been refused by Dublin Corporation Planning Committee&mdash;a decision which I welcome&mdash; was to be sited in a coastal area and. consequently, needed the sanction of the Minister for Transport and Power. The Minister for Transport and Power would have to issue a works harbour order before the promoters of the refinery could claim land on which to build such a project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For these reasons I find it hard to understand why the Minister, in his reply, tells me that the Minister for Local Government is the final arbiter on this matter.  This shows the poverty of thought in the Department when they do not know which Minister is the final arbiter.  I understand that in the case of the Dublin application one of the reasons given for its rejection was the fact that.  while the land had been zoned for industrial purposes, the water had not been zoned for any such purpose.  It is not possible to plan or <Col N="269" /> zone an area that does not exist.  No land exists on this site and, consequently, the refinery could not be built. If one was to accept the Minister's reply to my question at its face value one would imagine that the Minister for Transport and Power had no function in the matter.</P>
    <P>I am emphasising this to show that this question (a) had not been fully examined in the Department and (b) that the Minister for Education&mdash;I accept he acted in good faith when he gave the reply handed to him by another Department&mdash;did not answer my question.  I take it therefore that there is no policy for the establishment of oil refineries in any part of the country.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the agitation and demonstrations which have preceded the establishment or the rejection of applications for oil refineries in this country, I thought the Government would have given some consideration to the preparation of a policy on this matter.  This matter is vitally important from the pollution aspect and for the sake of industrial policy.</P>
    <P>I believe that the question of oil refineries will loom larger in our daily lives, whether we look at it as an expansion of our industrial policy or not. The Government should announce their policy in this regard so that future developers will realise the position before seeking planning permission. The application for planning permission to the Dublin Corporation has cost the city a lot of money It was first mooted two years ago and since then high ranking officials of the corporation have spent many hours considering the application.  Had the promoters tackled this matter in the right way they would have received an answer much earlier and saved all the expense and time. Had they consulted the requirements for the reclamation of land they would have seen that the corporation had no power to give permission for this reclamation.</P>
    <P>This, in my view, is a matter for the Minister for Transport and Power. The reply given to me today indicates a confusion in Government ranks between two Ministers, or two Departments, who do not appear to be able <Col N="270" /> to spell out what the requirements are for the establishment of an oil refinery. It will be said, because I am on this side of the House, that the last Government did nothing about this matter. The last Government, under the Minister for Local Government, set up a working group to examine the question of water pollution and other kindred matters.  This working group brought in a report which was to be the basis for a national policy on oil refineries. The Minister, in his reply, made no mention of this.  His reply indicates that an application for planning permission for the establishment of an oil refinery is being treated just like an application for the erection of a sweet factory, a toy factory or a footwear factory.</P>
    <P>At present at least three applications have been made for the establishment of oil refineries, in Dublin, in Bantry and in Donegal, but, as yet, the Government have not announced their policy in this regard.  The people of the country fear what might happen if oil refineries are established.  They fear pollution and other threats to the environment.  For this reason I believe the Government should announce its policy for the protection of the environment and the education of the people and promoters who are considering the establishment of such refineries.  This policy should spell out clearly what is to be allowed.  We do not want to have a repetition of the agitation and demonstrations which followed the application for planning permission for the proposed Dublin refinery.</P>
    <P>It would save all the trouble at present being experienced in regard to the Dublin application if a national policy was outlined.  This policy, which could be described as a national fuel policy, would indicate to promoters if this country is to refine oil or to allow any refineries to be established.  It is unfair to the people who propose establishing these refineries that such a policy has not been made public.</P>
    <P>The Government should spell out their policy on this matter.  In his reply today the Minister told me that grants or other assistance will be provided by the IDA.  All public representatives know about planning applications and <Col N="271" /> the work of the IDA and, consequently, this was just padding on the part of the Minister.  He did not give me any answer to my question.  In any future applications for oil refineries the people concerned will have to go through the entire process of application and agitation.</P>
    <P>The former Minister for Local Government set up a working group to examine the problem of pollution and related matters.  I would ask the Minister to accept the work done previously and I suggest there is a basis for drafting a national policy on oil refineries. It is no use suggesting this is the same as any other product.  An ordinary undertaking would apply to the local authority for planning permission and, if granted, that would be the end of the matter.  If an application were rejected and were appealed by the promoter it would be sent to the Minister for Local Government for decision.  I appreciate the Government are only three months in office and that they could not have done everything on every issue.  However, they were aware of this problem and they knew a working party had considered some aspects of the matter. They had a basis on which to draft a policy but they do not appear to have done so.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister, I have some experience of local government and I know the planning regulations.  I realise oil refineries affect many parts of the country and that when an application is lodged there will be opposition from some sections of the community.  The Government may decide that in the national interest we need oil refineries. I realise that the people responsible for the Dublin Bay project did not propose it merely because we have only one refinery at Whitegate.  Their motive was profit and there is nothing wrong in that if profit is made in an honest fashion.  However, there is no guidance given to people who do not want oil refineries or to the investors who want to establish them.</P>
    <P>We are in the oil age and this problem will crop up again.  The Government should state in an unequivocal manner their intentions in this regard. <Col N="272" /> If the Dublin project is appealed by the sponsors it may take a long time before the Minister for Transport and Power and the Minister for Industry and Commerce make a decision.  In the meantime the citizens who are genuinely concerned about the possible effects of the refinery must continue to agitate until a decision is made.  I am not trying to make capital out of this but I put it to the Minister that he owes it to the people to state the Government's policy.  If the Government want to attract capital, potential investors must know the intentions of the Government with regard to the establishment of oil refineries.</P>
    <P>It would save time and the taxpayers' money if the Government made a definite statement.  I realise the Minister cannot set out this policy tonight but I would ask him to give us some idea of the Government's intentions. I am not going to discuss the merits of oil refineries, whether they pollute the atmosphere or whether they provide employment.  That is not the point at issue here.  I realise all these points must be taken into consideration but the Government are the final authority and the onus is on them to come forward with a policy.</P>
    <P>By a strange coincidence, today the Minister for Local Government announced a plan for clearing oil spillage and he told us the State and the local authorities will finance this work.  We have a policy on this matter, but it is the wrong end of the project.  It is essential to have a policy on the establishment of plants that will produce and refine oil which, in the event of a spillage, may cause damage.  We know that when there is oil spillage the taxpayer will have to pay for clearing it up.  The Minister for Local Government is to be complimented on his action today but the more serious aspect&mdash;the establishment of oil refineries&mdash;should be considered also.</P>
    <P>In my question today I asked if the Government had a policy on the establishment or the non-establishment of oil refineries.  If they have not such a policy, is one being prepared and when will we be told about the policy?  I would ask the Minister for a definite answer to the question.</P>

I should like to thank him for his acknowledgement of the fact that we are only three months in office and, therefore, we cannot get around to deciding policies in all areas.</P>
      <P>I should like first of all to make it clear that there has not been any change in policy in this matter since the change of Government.  The present policy is, therefore, one that the present Minister inherited and which, no doubt, he will review in due course.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is not necessarily bound to take cognisance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I have said, there has not been any change in policy in this matter since the change of Government. The present policy is, therefore, one that the present Minister inherited and which, no doubt, he will review in due course as he comes to review the other matters coming within his jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no definite policy to limit oil refineries to any particular geographic area.  The permission for the siting in any part of the country of industrial projects, including oil refineries, is a matter for the planning <Col N="274" /> authority concerned or, in the event of an appeal, for the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority provide grants only where a project has complied with the requirements specified by the planning authority or by the Minister as appropriate.</P>
    <P>In general it is official policy to support the building of oil refineries only if they provide significant permanent employment or offer the possibility of substantial related industrial development. Even if these criteria are satisfied the Government would not facilitate the setting up of a refinery that would cause serious pollution or interference with local amenities.  Obviously in each case the likely advantages&mdash;for example the creation of new jobs&mdash;would have to be balanced against the likely disadvantages in the shape of pollution or interference with local amenities or tourist attractions.</P>
    <P>In general it may be taken that the Minister would not favour the indiscriminate setting up of oil refineries in the country and that he is very concerned to ensure that the need to preserve the environment is not overlooked when new industries are being established.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of IDA to discourage industries which are likely to cause pollution of the environment by effluent discharges or air emissions and to insist that all new industries and expanding industries comply with the conditions laid down by the controlling authorities, namely the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the appropriate planning authorities in relation to the discharge of effluents. There have been instances where projects have not been approved because it was clear on the information available that these conditions could not be complied with.</P>
    <P>The IDA have an established procedure in this matter :</P>
    <P>Industries which reach a serious level of negotiation are required to provide to the IDA full details of any industrial effluent discharges or emissions from their proposed plants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="275" /> These details are sent to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and to An Foras Forbartha in the case of effluent discharges.</P>
    <P>The IIRS return a recommendation to the IDA, setting out measures necessary to keep any effluent or emission at an acceptable level.</P>
    <P>The IDA forward the recommendations of the IIRS to the controlling bodies I have referred to.</P>
    <P>Thereafter, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries take any necessary action in the light of any comments on the IIRS recommendations and the local authority will normally include the recommendations as conditions in the granting of planning permission for the proposed new operation.  If the industrial promoter does not comply with these conditions, the IDA will withhold any grants which have been approved for the new industry.  All grant agreements are made on condition that the provisions attaching to planning permissions are complied with and that any licences necessary under the Fisheries Acts are obtained.</P>
    <P>With regard to the siting of industries in areas of scenic beauty, the IDA are guided to a large extent by the planning authorities.  In a location where the siting of an industry might <Col N="276" /> cause controversy, the IDA also consult Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>The Government are concerned at all times to provide the maximum employment opportunities and have to examine seriously any worthwhile proposal for the setting up of an industry. In the real sense of the words, we could be said to have no oil refinery at the present time providing the raw materials for downstream industries.  Of course, we have Whitegate but this is a refinery for crude oil to provide the country with a large measure of its petrol and fuel oil requirements.  I am aware, however, that there is great potential for further industries and employment arising from products other than the fuel oils I have already mentioned.</P>
    <P>The places where oil refineries can be set up in this country are limited because of the need for a deep-sea port capable of accommodating large tankers and, indeed, for the convenient export of the product.</P>
    <P>I hope the points I have made have gone some of the way to giving the Deputy an indication of the lines on which the Government are thinking.  I will convey his remarks to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 13th June, 1973.</P>
