      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he will grant assistance for the installation of electricity on Inishboffin, Inishturk and Inishturbot, County Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware the funds provided under the Electricity Supply Acts for rural electrification are used, with other ESB resources, to provide consumers in rural areas with electricity supply at less than economic cost.  Even with subsidy it is necessary. where costs of providing supply are abnormal, to impose a special service charge so as to enable the board to continue to get a minimum return on expenditure.  I am informed by the board that to provide electricity supply for the householders on the islands of Inishboffin, Inishturk and Inishturbot would cost so much that the special services charge would be completely <Col N="1056" /> prohibitive and it is not therefore a practicable proposition.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will recall the recent announcement by the Minister for Lands that substantial grants and assistance will be made available by the Land Commission to enable the inhabitants of Inishturk and Inishturbot to transfer to the mainland.  As the vast majority of the islanders are anxious to move to the mainland the installation of electricity on these islands should not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept it would not now apply in the case of Inishturk and Inishturbot because the Government have announced they intend to carry out the decision of the previous Government to move the people to the mainland.  However, in the case of Inishboffin, I should like to ask the Minister if it would not be possible for him and his Government colleagues to make a special arrangement in relation to this island, something similar to what has been done for the three Aran Islands where special generators are being provided to enable an electricity supply to be brought to each home.  I realise that special moneys would have to be voted for this&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider making a special arrangement in view of the fact that this island has a large community and a similar facility has already been provided for the Aran Islands.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The arrangement for the Aran Islands was one between the ESB and the Department of the Gaeltacht.  I understand from the ESB that there are approximately 230 people on the island and the cost would be abnormally high to provide generators for electricity on the island.  If the Deputy likes I shall try to get information on the exact amount of the cost in this regard and <Col N="1057" /> I shall consider the matter again in the light of that information.  However, I understand it will be extremely expensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state why it would be exceptionally expensive for Inishboffin when it was not considered exceptionally expensive in relation to Inishmore, which presents greater difficulties?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware that the ESB have quoted a price of £444 for installation of electricity in the new home of a person (name supplied) in Claregalway, County Galway: and if he considers this a reasonable charge in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the ESB that the person in question requires supply to two newly built houses.  The development of the area concerned under the final phase of the rural electrification programme has been completed for some time and subsidised terms are no longer available in the area.  The terms quoted are based on the cost of extending the electricity supply to the houses and are the lowest possible in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was whether the Minister considers the charge reasonable and I should like him to give his opinion on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In the circumstances it is as reasonable as it could be.  This area has been completed under the rural electrification programme.  As the Deputy no doubt is aware, the rural electrification scheme is based on an area-by-area crash programme and if the ESB were to disrupt that programme <Col N="1058" /> it would not be possible to carry it out at subsidised cost.  The area was canvassed and completed some time ago.  People who have come in since then would be aware they would not get subsidised electricity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter does not refer only to the area mentioned in the question.  Throughout my area the same kind of money is being requested.  I would ask the Minister to do something by way of increasing the subsidy. I know of four cases where £400 was requested&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is broadening the subject matter of the question.  I am calling Question No. 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport and Power if he is aware that a charge of £396.83 has been quoted for installation of electricity in the newly constructed home of a person (name supplied) in County Mayo; and if he considers this charge reasonable in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the ESB that the person in question is seeking supply of electricity out of turn.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that under the programme of rural electrification areas for development must be taken in a planned sequence.  Any persons in an area not yet covered under the scheme must be prepared to pay by way of capital contribution for getting supply before their time. If such persons are prepared to await their turn under the scheme no such capital contribution will be sought.</P>
      <P>I understand from the ESB that the area concerned is due for development in 1974-75.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that where a person wishes to construct a house in an area already canvassed by the ESB he will be faced with this exorbitant charge for electricity? If these large charges are to continue for those building homes in rural areas the result will be that they will be driven into the cities.  There seems to be a certain element of discrimination against building homes in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1059" />
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the rural electrification scheme was designed to provide electricity in rural areas at the cheapest possible rate. During the years it has been subsidised by various Governments; in the current programme the Government have paid £10 million towards the cost of £18 million.  When this programme is finished, anyone building a house in those areas should know that he will have to pay the full cost.  Before buying a site people would be well advised to consult with the ESB because the cost will vary from location to location within the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider this matter again.  It appears people will have to go to certain areas to try to build houses but they may be refused planning permission. If they go to isolated areas they will have to pay too much for electricity. I am asking the Minister to set a maximum price on what these people will have to pay and to subsidise them if the cost is in excess of this amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite true. The cost of building a house will vary from area to area, and the cost of supplying electricity will also vary, depending on distance from the transformer and so on.  This is quite reasonable.  People should understand that and not buy sites where the cost of supplying electricity will be prohibitive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>What advice would the Minister suggest should be given to a farmer's son who wishes to build a house on his own land?  I am referring to a person who is not buying a site but is confined to his own holding. Is such a person supposed to go to the city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are to be supplied with electricity they should understand there will be a capital cost required by the ESB.  This is not something new; it has been there since 1946.  The cost varies from site to site.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister state if there are any plans to subsidise further the installation of electricity? <Col N="1060" /> Not alone is it an economic factor, it is also a social factor.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to strengthen one of the existing runways by constructing an asphalt overlay on it.  It is hoped to carry out this work during the present financial year.</P>
      <P>The present runway system at Dublin Airport is over 25 years old and a new system will be required within some years.  The intention is to construct initially a new east-west runway to the north of the terminal area.  At a later stage a parallel runway to the south of the terminal area will be provided when traffic growth requires it.</P>
      <P>The acquisition of the necessary lands for both runways is in train.  It is not possible at this stage to state when construction work on the new runway will commence but the indications are that the runway will be required before the end of the seventies and planning is proceeding with this objective in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to use compulsory powers to acquire the necessary land?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think they will be necessary.  Perhaps I could find out&mdash;no, I am sorry; I have not that information here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">

      <P>Is it intended to pay a grant for insulation against noise for these houses which will be effected by the construction of the new runways as they are not affected by a noise problem at present?  This is being done in Stansted in England; is it intended to do it over here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a separate question because it affects the construction of runways.  I am surprised at the Minister's reply to the previous question because I had a similar question down in May and got a completely different answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy got exactly the same answer.  I think the question of noise is a separate matter which I feel would concern Local Government more than Transport and Power.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the B &amp; I that the m.v. <i>Meath</i> is the vessel which they set aside specially for the carriage of livestock from this country.  Due to the fact that the numbers of cattle shipped from this country this year has declined and because the livestock trade have preferred to ship the reduced numbers of cattle on other services the capacity afforded by this vessel has not been availed of.  As a result, the vessel has lain idle at Birkenhead since end March, 1973.</P>

      <P>I suppose it could, but I think there is a hope of improvement in the cattle trade and there is hope of utilising it then.  This is one of the vessels specially built for the carriage of cattle and it would cost some money to convert it for ordinary cargo transportation.  I presume <Col N="1063" /> they hope to get an improved cattle trade which will allow them to use this ship rather than spend money on converting it.

      <P>The question of developing the Shannon Estuary as a deep-sea port and transhipment centre was exhaustively examined by an inter-departmental committee in 1961. The committee found that in the absence of evidence that commercial interests would be prepared to use the port if it were developed, funds should not be made available for development. There has been no change in the situation in the meantime which would warrant a review of that decision or of speculative expenditure <Col N="1064" /> running into millions of pounds on the removal of the sand bar in the estuary.</P>

CIE entered into negotiations, therefore, with local development interests in Athlone and Killaloe, who had expressed interest in taking over the services, but for a number of reasons no agreement was reached for a transfer of the services.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, CIE, at my request, have agreed to operate one boat from Athlone this season on the understanding that I will arrange to have examined the possibility of the deficit incurred being met by some source other than CIE and that this will be the last year that CIE will be expected to operate the service.</P>
      <P>I should hope that before next season negotiations for the transfer of the two boats to local interests will have been finalised.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the people involved in tourist development in the Killaloe-Ballina area are very aggrieved and aggravated by the fact that CIE have decided to give first-class treatment to the upper reaches of the Shannon and in an area where efforts are being made to develop tourism the people are being completely ignored?  In the light of this aggravation and upset to the people in these areas I ask the Minister to reconsider the question especially in view of the fact that the <i>Kieran</i>, the second boat, is serviceable and available at Killaloe for the July-August-September season.</P>

      <P>Statutory responsibility for the raising of design standards in Irish industry rests with Córas Tráchtala. This responsibility is discharged through the operations of its subsidiary, Kilkenny Design Workshops, and of its own design section, whose main objective is to develop an understanding in Ireland of the role of design in industry.  As I indicated at its inaugural meeting, the reason for establishing the Council of Industrial Design is that a positive step must be taken in the direction of meeting the clear need for a national design policy.  The starting point for the <Col N="1066" /> council, and consequently its immediate purpose, is to survey the whole field of industrial design and to make recommendations to me on action which should be taken in this area.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy has been informed in reply to previous questions, the position in regard to EEC draft directives is that they become operative when approved by the Community following discussion between the member states. The Irish attitude in regard to the provisions of any draft directive is normally settled in consultation with the Irish interests concerned.  This procedure is being followed in this case.</P>
      <P>The draft directive on cosmetics, if approved in its present form, would have certain implications for industry here and the Irish point of view will be made clear in the course of further consideration of the draft by the member states.</P>

      <P>I cannot give the Deputy a great deal of detail on that, but I asked in the Department if there was any existing legislation whereby we could control this practice.

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am indeed aware of this.  The situation is that from the time of the previous Government and the last time I was asked a question on this, strong disapproval of pyramid selling was expressed on all sides of the House, and expressed in <Col N="1080" /> the media also.  The British have had the experience that they promised legislation and now they are in difficulties drafting it and may have to fall back to the situation in which we are. While it is extremely objectionable, in my view the distinction between pyramid selling, on the one hand, and what is a perfectly legitimate form of selling, on the other, is not a difficult one to draw in real life but it is very difficult to draft legislation which does not penalise people who ought to have a chance to go on making a little money as well.</P>

He is also, no doubt, as aware as I am that there is a doubt as to whether they pay VAT and as to the source of the goods they are selling. It is quite a difficult task but it is important for the Garda and others to see that this practice is stamped out. On the other hand, there have been people selling at the roadside, at fairs and at other places for a very long time, who offer a service and who are perfectly valid and useful members of the community.  It is important that they should retain their rights to offer the public this service.</P>

The Geneva meeting is one of a series of preparatory meetings and as these are preliminary discussions.

I am referring to the statements he made decrying the educational facilities available to children attending one-teacher schools.  He said they would be at a serious disadvantage.  There is no possibility of amalgamating here because this is the question of an island school. What I am asking the Minister is if in view of the special circumstances here he would agree to the appointment of a second teacher.  It is definitely warranted to ensure adequate education for these children.</P>

He did that at the time and the appointment was not made.  On the Deputy's point about one-teacher schools, the social and cultural considerations applying to the other school mentioned do not extend to the provision of staffing over and above that permitted by the regulations. If the figure of 36 is reached I will have no hesitation in sanctioning the extra teacher.</P>

The manager agreed it would be in the best interests of the pupils and he was then of the opinion that the parents would not oppose this suggestion.

      <P>, <i>Cavan</i>): I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to remove the liability to pay contributions to the redundancy fund from widows, deserted wives and unmarried mothers who are receiving pensions or allowances under one or other of the schemes of the Department of Social Welfare and who take up insurable employment.  These people will, of course, be eligible for redundancy lump sums and redundancy weekly payments, subject to the conditions of the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 and 1971.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a reflection of the humanitarian considerations which inspired the removal of the liability of the persons in question to pay social insurance contributions under the Social Welfare Bill, 1973, and is a measure of my endorsement of that policy.</P>
      <P>To achieve my purpose, a short amending Act is necessary and it is essential that the legislation be enacted before the end of this month in order to harmonise with the relevant social welfare legislation.</P>
      <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>There is a reference in section I (3A) to &ldquo;a deserted wife's allowance or a social assistance allowance under section 8 of the Social Welfare Act, 1973&rdquo;.  I think that is still in keeping with the provisions of the Social Welfare Act social assistance allowances?</P>

    <P>This again is a drafting amendment and the object is to ensure that on the framing of the scheme of incorporation under section 2 the only debts and liabilities incurred by the trustees which will be automatically transferred to the body corporate are those <Col N="1106" /> properly incurred.

      <P>This is another drafting amendment. The purpose of it is to ensure that on the framing of a scheme of incorporation under section 2 the automatic substitution of the body corporate for the trustees will not affect pending proceedings against the trustees where such proceedings are for a breach of trust or a criminal offence.  In the case of all other proceedings the body corporate will take the place of the trustees. Again, this amendment arises from comments made during the Committee Stage in the Seanad.</P>

This deals only with pre-corporation offences or breaches of trust.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the offence was in relation to a particular trust or charity, and it was a criminal offence, he would be personally liable as would any person be liable for a breach of the criminal law.  The section as originally drafted set out that any proceedings against the trustees would carry over against the members of the incorporated body and I do not think this amendment changes that position.  All it does is make quite clear what it intended.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 55 and 56, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4) Every member of a body incorporated by virtue of a scheme under section 2 shall, notwithstanding the incorporation,</P>
      <P>(a)  be chargeable for property coming into his hands as such a member, and</P>
      <P>(b)  as regards the charity to which the scheme relates, be accountable and liable for his own acts or omissions and for the due administration of the charity and its property,</P>
      <P>in the same manner as if the scheme had not been framed and he had been duly appointed to be a trustee of the charity.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to remove doubts as to the liability of <Col N="1108" /> members of a body corporate established under section 2 for their acts, omissions, <i>et cetera,</i> in relation to the charity property.  The amendment will ensure that persons appointed members of the body corporate will be liable in the same manner as if they had been appointed trustees of the charity.  This is the amendment which catches what the Deputy had in mind on an earlier amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It does but, on reading the amendment, it struck me I should ask the Minister for a definition of membership of a body incorporated by virtue of a scheme under section 2. There is a distinction here which this amendment may possibly gloss over. As I understand it, the intention of section 2 is to incorporate an existing charity.  The charity exists in so far as its trustees are the legal entity for the charity.  If one incorporates that legal entity it no longer has members in the sense that a company, which is incorporated in a different way, has members who are shareholders.  There is a clear distinction between the incorporation of a company and the incorporation of a charity under section 2 and, for that reason, I am wondering if this proposed subsection is, in fact, of any real value.  It could, indeed, do more harm than good the way it is because a potential defendant in a criminal charge or in relation to a breach of trust could plead, possibly successfully, that he is not a member of a body incorporated under section 2, there being no such thing as a member of such a body, section 2 incorporation being simply the incorporation of a charity rather than the formation of a company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to me that when a charity has been incorporated the previous trustees will be the persons constituting the incorporated body.  You will, if you like, have a corporation following the making of the scheme under section 2 and that will have a legal life of its own.  It will have to be composed of persons who manage its affairs in the same way as directors of a company manage the affairs of the company and, by analogy, the persons managing the <Col N="1109" /> affairs of the incorporated charity will be liable in precisely the same way as would the directors of a company be liable for malfeasance that might be committed by them.  What this amendment wants to make quite clear is that these persons will be personally liable for any acts that might be done by them and in the same way as if they had not been incorporated. The idea of incorporation is to provide perpetual succession to avoid the difficulty and expense that may attend the necessity of having to appoint new trustees and to vest the trust property in the new trustees.  The essential liability of the trustees will not be disturbed.  That will remain notwithstanding the charity becoming a corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The point on section 2, as I understand it, and as I intended when I introduced it, was to get over the difficulty of having to appoint new trustees at fairly regular periods.  The purpose of incorporation under section 2 was to avoid that by incorporating statutorily under the section an existing charity.  The benefit of incorporation only accrues to the charity when the existing trustees are dead and, under section 2, it would no longer be necessary on the death of the last surviving trustee for his executors to appoint a new trustee.</P>
      <P>This amendment reads:</P>
      <P>Every member of a body incorporated by virtue of a scheme . . .</P>
      <P>My suggestion to the Minister is that this terminology is not well chosen for the reason that after the death of the existing trustees there will be no members in the sense that the Minister is, I think, suggesting now.  To try to make the distinction clear I have sought to distinguish between an incorporation of a body of persons under the Companies Act and a statutory once-and-for-all incorporation of an entity known as a charity under section 2 of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The position described by the Deputy could not arise.  What the Deputy is suggesting is that when <Col N="1110" /> all the trustees would die out there would then be no persons at the helm of this incorporated charity.  That position cannot be.  There will have to be procedural machinery for appointing trustees from time to time but this will be different from the present necessity where not merely is the appointment of trustees involved but there is also the conveyancing problem of vesting the trust property in the new trustees.  In the new procedure, by virtue of incorporation, new directors, if I may call them that, can at any time be appointed by what I consider will be the body analogous to the general body of shareholders, that is the board. They can appoint new persons.  You could, I suppose, have a situation where there might be no trustees but the charity would be a live, legal entity.  There would be persons appointed to do the day-to-day administration of the charity.  What is intended here is to make sure that the people who are in charge from time to time of the company will be liable for all property that comes to their hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the point the Minister is making and I accept it in so far as he has explained it and I think he has explained it well.  It disappoints me a bit that it will, notwithstanding section 2, be necessary to appoint new trustees but the major problem of the conveyance will be avoided.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention again to the actual words used at the beginning of this amendment which says:</P>
      <P>Every member of a body incorporated by virtue of a scheme . . .</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should define &ldquo;member&rdquo; there because &ldquo;member&rdquo; seems to imply, as he says himself, either one of the original trustees or someone very much akin to them.  In a charity you would normally have perhaps three trustees in whom the charity funds are vested but you might have an executive committee which would consist of 20 or more people working on behalf of the charity.  Under the explanation which the Minister has given, which is perfectly valid so far as it goes, we would then have the situation that all <Col N="1111" /> the original trustees at the time of incorporation would certainly be regarded as members but that after their death any member of the executive committee, which could be very substantial, could come under this amendment and that is something that may not be intended.  It may be too wide. For that reason there is need for a definition of the word &ldquo;member&rdquo; as used in this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has raised a point but it is essential to remember that the word &ldquo;member&rdquo; is specific so far as corporate law is concerned.  That only means a full shareholder or somebody in that capacity.  The purpose of this section, as I would read it, is that there might be an argument made at some later stage whereby the fact that the members were appointed by the board might be a release of those members if anything went wrong.  The purpose of this section is to spell out specifically the liability of the member having been placed in that position.  It is essential to get over that possible argument being raised in the future and I can see it being raised and causing difficulty.  The member in this case is the trustee or the replacement trustee. This will be done by a simple procedure as is done by some charities at present that are run by way of a company.  The purpose is to spell out that this member, once appointed, is personally liable, that he is really in the position of a trustee and stays as such and, I think, reading that section, that his personal assets could be followed if he defaulted in something or other.  The Deputy mentioned a lower committee or executive committee. That would be purely on an administrative basis because the member of this body will be in the same position as a trustee and, as we know, to use an old legal tag, delegatus non potest delegare, in a situation like this and that is a very strong principle in the law in this country as distinct from England where trustees can delegate. I can assure the Deputy that I was acting as a trustee in an estate which was both here and in England and I was advised that I was entitled to <Col N="1112" /> delegate.  A High Court judge in England became very annoyed that I had delegated because I was in the position of a trustee and held that I was a trustee under Irish law and therefore I could not delegate.  So far as a lesser committee or executive committee is concerned, it would be purely at an administrative level.  The members will be responsible all the way through, taking the law as it stands at the moment.</P>

      <P>What concerned Deputy O'Malley as well was the question of who would be the members. Basic to this whole change is that the board, that is the commissioners, will frame a scheme for each charity that desires to be incorporated and that scheme will set out who the members of it are.  It will also say how new members are to be appointed.  To say who will be the members at a particular time is not something that can be legislated for in advance.  That is something that will depend on the terms of the scheme.  I presume a prototype scheme will be drawn up which will be more or less available and will be applicable in the case of most charities that wish to be incorporated. I am advised that in Northern Ireland there is power like this and the precedent scheme which I have seen sets out that : &ldquo;Trustees for the time being of the charity shall form the corporation by the name of such-and such&rdquo;, so it is envisaged that the trustees for the time being are appointed under the scheme and they then would be the members and would have the liability which this new subsection would impose on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the great bulk of what the Minister and Deputy Esmonde have said but it is, I think, normal practice with charities to have <Col N="1113" /> the actual trustees, legally speaking those in whom the property is vested, as rather inactive and often older members of the organisation and the executive functions and both day-to-day and long-term policy are carried out by members of the executive or the committee rather than the trustees themselves.  That I think is the general practice.  It may not be true of all charities but it is true of many of them.</P>
      <P>The Minister may run into a difficulty in that there will have to be a re-think by charities in relation to that sort of practice up to now.  The older and less active people will have to cease to be members within the meaning of this subsection.  The more active people will now have to become members.  Subject to that I am reasonably satisfied with what the Minister has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point it might clear the matter for the Deputy if I inform him that it will be for the commissioners in making a scheme in any particular case, to say how many of the existing trustees of the charity who seek to be incorporated will be appointed as members of the new incorporated body.  It could happen in a case, as the Deputy says, that there will be trustees with legal standing and with a volunteer committee assisting them.  In that case when the charity would come to be incorporated, and the scheme would come to be prepared, the board would have to look at the whole picture and see where the liability is going to be placed and who are to be made members of the new incorporated body. Under the Charities Act, 1961, in the definition section, it is laid down that references to the trustee of a charity shall be construed as including reference to a person acting in the administration or management of a charity.  It would seem from the law, as it stands, that people who are not strictly trustees but who are present in an executive capacity have all the liability of trustees.  In that regard there will be no change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I should like to make in relation to the section as a whole and to section 2. Where, on Incorporation Schemes having been made under section 2 and with the further provisions as to such schemes under section 3 as to the vesting of the property, will the Minister give the House an assurance &mdash;I would prefer if it was written into the section&mdash;that no more stamp duty would be payable than is payable at the moment on the appointment of new trustees?  That stamp duty is limited, it is not ad valorem, it is 50p irrespective of the value of the property.</P>
      <P>I imagine that the intention was, and my own intention was, that no more stamp duty would become payable. On reading the section as a whole it goes, as the Minister will appreciate, somewhat beyond simply appointing new trustees.  It is conceivable that Revenue would seek to recover duty on an ad valorem basis. For that reason the thought struck me, when I was in the Seanad. whether a further subsection should be added to make it clear that no duty greater than the existing duty would be chargeable and there would be no question of an ad valorem duty chargeable on instruments under section 3.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no instruments involved in the changeover in this case.  The vesting of the property in the incorporated body will be by virtue of section 2 and it will be automatic by virtue of that section.  No instruments of transfer will be involved.  In the absence of instruments of transfer there will be no document which could be liable to stamp duty.  If Revenue were to look for stamp duty consequent on this <Col N="1115" /> section they would have to bring in legislation to catch the transfers which will automatically follow by virtue of section 3.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister looks at subsection (2) he will see that there is provision for what the Land Registry have to accept as evidence. That consists of a copy under the seal of the board, or the commissioners, of the scheme.  I can recall having a lengthy argument with Senator Alexis FitzGerald in the Seanad on this point.  While the problem is not great in relation to the Land Registry because the registrar will clearly accept, without demur, the seal of the board, there could be a different situation in relation to unregistered land.</P>
      <P>One can clearly see a requisition being properly made on the sale of such lands and that the certified copy of the seal, under section 2, should be stamped either <i>ad valorem</i> or fixed and, possibly, that such an order should be registered in the Registry of Deeds.  Senator Alexis FitzGerald argued that point, or similar points, at some length and I was not 100 per cent satisfied that he was wrong.  I feel it is my duty for that reason to put forward similar points now to the Minister, in the changed circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course if one gets a pernickety conveyancer he can raise anything he likes on requisition and goodness knows what consequences would follow.  In regard to property that is registered in the Registry of Deeds the only thing that would concern a purchaser of charity property, owned by an incorporated charity under a scheme made under section 2, would be to see how it came to be transferred to the incorporated charity from the old charitable trust.  He is referred then to section 3 which provides for automatic vesting in the new incorporated charity and there cannot be any question, consequently, of having to register the scheme as such in the Registry of Deeds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of the Land Registry <Col N="1116" /> what will be required there is necessary because of the Land Registry regulations as to the transfer of ownership. It will be necessary to notify the Land Registry that the unincorporated charity has been turned into an incorporated charity for the amending of their records.  It will not be an instrument transferring or conveying the property. The legal conveyance takes place by virtue of section 3 and not by virtue of any instrument of any kind.  Any noting that has to be done in the Land Registry is incidental to the technical question of vesting title.  It has to deal purely with the Land Registry regulations of noting a change of name.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there is no great problem with regard to the Land Registry but I believe that there could be problems in relation to the Registry of Deeds.  I think the Minister is wrong in saying that it is the section that vests or changes the ownership; it is the making of the scheme by the board, and the seal, that does it.  The section, of itself, unless somebody applies to the board to make the scheme, will not change the ownership because, presumably not every group of trustees will wish to become incorporated under the scheme.  If such a scheme is made under seal by the board and subsequently some one, or more, of the trustees purport to deal with the property, or some part of it, in some way a <i>bona fide</i> purchaser from him, or them, for value, without notice having searched in the Registry of Deeds and not found notice of a scheme having been made under section 2, will surely, in equity, take priority over those who hold under the unregistered scheme under section 2?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point but I cannot see that that would be so.  If a charity applies to be incorporated and the application is granted then, by virtue of section 3, the property of that charity vests automatically in the new incorporated body.  If trustees of that body were to attempt to alienate the property, they could not do so and the fact that a purchaser would be <i>bona fide</i> would not mean that he could rely on registration to protect him because he would be assumed to know the law and to <Col N="1117" /> know that the law permitted the incorporation of unincorporated charities. He would be under an obligation in his requisitions to inquire whether a scheme had been made under the terms of the Act.  It would be apparent from the documents that there was a charity. On receipt of a reply to that inquiry he could proceed accordingly and I do not think that any question of priority in the Registry of Deeds would arise. Perhaps this is a question that we might have examined in more detail.  I do not think that the situation envisaged would arise but I will have a further look at the section.</P>

I have no objection to the amendment but I do not think it helps at all. While it makes certain aspects a little clearer it does anything but clarify certain other aspects.

      <P>I have no objection to the section.  The only thing that occurs to me in regard to it is that on the last occasion on which we were discussing this Bill Deputies Wilson and Callanan referred to certain problems that could arise as a result of it. The Minister on that occasion may not have had full information in relation to the problems that were raised but perhaps he may now be in a position to deal more fully with those difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Callanan's objection went to the very root of <Col N="1119" /> charity law because his point was that when one of these schools would be sold it should be possible that the proceeds could go to a purpose that was other than educational.  That, of course, would be upsetting completely the whole point of charity law which prescribes that gifts made originally for certain purposes must be applied for those purposes or <i>cy-près.</i> He was making the point that a parish could sell a school and apply the proceeds for a purpose other than an educational purpose.  That would be widening the law too much.  It would be contrary to the whole principle of charity law to enable funds to be used for a purpose other than that envisaged in the original charity or, if that no longer exists, in a charity as near in type as can be found.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson's point was that there were some cases where the successors to the original landlord showed title and re-entered and resumed the property.  I think they are entitled to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I was referring to was the interpretation of &ldquo;educational&rdquo;.  The position all over the country at the moment is that when a school is sold, regardless of which denomination sell it, they cannot use the money.  If we do not regard that what a man preaches in a church is educational then, that man should not be there at all.  One school which I have in mind was sold for about £2,000 and it was decided that the money would be used to repair the church.  One might say that the education that takes place in a church by way of preaching is sectarian but the schools are sectarian too.  In the particular case I have in mind, the school belonged to a certain religious denomination.  It is on the definition of &ldquo;education&rdquo; that the Minister and I differ.  It is grossly unfair to whichever denomination happen to own a school that their money be held up. What type of education are they expected to put the money into?  These small schools that are being closed all over the country were given, in the first instance, by way of charity <Col N="1120" /> for educational purposes.  I ask the Minister again to consider seriously this question of the interpretation of &ldquo;education&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that what Deputy Callanan hears in his local church is both enlightening and elevating but whether it is educational in the legal term is another matter. I am afraid it is not so.  The proceeds from the school were given to a community originally for educational purposes must be applied for a similar charitable purpose.  I do not think it would be beyond the wit of the particular trustees in question to find a charitable purpose of the same type within their own parish to which they could apply the money without having to spend it on repairs to the church.</P>

      <P>The Minister has people available to him who are more familiar with the details of the sections than either he or myself.  However, I wonder if, in fact, there is such a provision in section 4?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a provision in <Col N="1121" /> section 4 (2) which states that a scheme under this section framed under the seal of the board may enable the trustees of a charity to sell the property and to invest any moneys arising therefrom for the benefit of the charity or, if the charity is one for the furtherance of education&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am thinking of.  It is set out in section 4 (2) (a) (i) and (ii).  Sub-paragraph (2) (a) (i) states:</P>
      <P>In case the charity is for the furtherance of education, any other charitable purpose which, in the opinion of the Board, is for the furtherance of education,</P>
      <P>and subparagraph (ii) (a) (ii) states:</P>
      <P>In any other case, such other charitable purpose as the Board should think proper.</P>
      <P>It seems strange that distinction is there.  For that reason, the point made by Deputy Callanan is a valid one because the categorising of charities is broken down in section 4 (2) (a) (ii) in relation to each charity other than an educational charity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>This section deals only with a very limited type of charity, namely, one established by charter or statute.  I do not think it breaks the doctrine of <i>cy-près</i> as might be thought by section 4 (2) (a) (ii) because the doctrine of <i>cy-près</i> ensures that such other charitable purpose must be a <i>cy-près</i> purpose. Bearing in mind the fact that the original instrument setting up the charity would be a statutory charter which would be very specific in the objects prescribed, if these failed&mdash;as they have failed, otherwise we would not have this section&mdash;the people for whom the section is designed and at whose request it was introduced have also requested that they would be relieved, because of the specific nature of the original instrument, from having to apply the funds for that purpose, it having failed totally.  Consequently, there would be room for the board in this case to direct such other charitable purpose, the original object <Col N="1122" /> having failed completely.  The normal educational trust would be in broad terms and it would be possible to frame a <i>cy-près</i> application.  Education has many ramifications nowadays but the old charters were for a very specific purpose related to a specific institution generally.  As that has failed completely, the people affected have specifically asked for this sub-paragraph.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The point at issue in section 6. and it is demonstrated by the part of section 4 to which we have referred, is that in a <i>cy-près</i> application, if the charity is of any nature other than educational the funds of the charity can be applied for any charitable purpose.  If the charity is of an educational nature the funds of the charity can only be applied for educational purposes.  The point made by Deputy Callanan is valid.  He quoted the example of a school being sold where the proceeds can be used only for educational purposes, not for some other charitable purpose for which the trustees might wish to use them.  For example, if an old disused church is sold, the trustees could use the proceeds for any charitable purpose&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Three of these will be interchangeable, other than the furtherance of education.  Deputy Callanan's point is, why not allow the application of charitable funds originally established for the furtherance of education on some other charitable objective which is not the furtherance of education?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That cannot be because that would be contrary to the doctrine of <i>cy-près</i> and that change is not made under section 4 (2).  This states that in the case of a scheme made by the trustees with the approval of the board for the sale of property, the proceeds of that sale where the charity is for the furtherance of education shall be applied for the furtherance of education and in any other case for such charitable purpose as the board may think proper.  Where the original charity was for education, the proceeds can be applied only for educational purposes. If the original charity was not for education, it would appear it can be applied for another charitable purpose as the board may think proper.  However, the board are constrained by the requirements of the <i>cy-près</i> doctrine to think proper only such other charities as fall within that doctrine and are of the same nature as the original charity.</P>
      <P>The type of school mentioned by Deputy Callanan is a very specific type of school.  The lease of the plot in question was granted specifically for educational purposes and all the law wants to ensure is that should that school be sold the proceeds would be used for educational purposes, not for general parochial purposes even though that would be a charitable object.  The law does not allow the proceeds of one type of charity to be used for the furtherance of another; it must be used all the time for the furtherance of the same type of charity.</P>

      <P>If you accept the four traditional categories of charity &mdash;there is certainly Common Law recognition of them whatever about statutory recognition of the categorisation of them&mdash;you have a situation under section 4 where any three of them can be run together, but educational purposes are treated separately.  To go back to the example Deputy Callanan gave originally and change that to a church, for example, the Minister says that a lease made under the Leases for Schools (Ireland) Act, 1881, would have been for a very specific purpose and that land would have been given for that very specific educational purpose.  I agree, but equally a church built with charitable funds, and presumably the land on which it stands bought with such funds, was also built and bought for an equally specific charitable purpose, namely, the advancement of religion. We now have a curious anomaly&mdash; unless this matter is considered, perhaps, between now and Report Stage &mdash;in that the proceeds of sale of a defunct school will be very limited but the proceeds of sale of a defunct church will not; they will be available for any charitable purpose which the board regards as reasonably <i>cy-près.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That anomaly is highlighted from a practical point of view by what Deputy Callanan said.  One would think, for example, that if the proceeds of the sale of a disused church could be applied with the consent of the board by the trustees for the relief of poverty, why should the proceeds of the sale of a disused school not be similarly applied.  The distinction has to be borne in mind all the time that there are four categories of charity and that one of them now appears to be treated differently and will undoubtedly cause <Col N="1125" /> some problems.  Some people who, perhaps, are not familiar with the whole background will feel, as I think Deputy Callanan and his constituents feel, that it seems rather foolish that one type of charitable property can be dealt with in a certain way while another cannot.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>First, let us take the example the Deputy has mentioned of a disused church which is sold.  He suggests, the proceeds could be applied for the relief of poverty.  I would disagree with him; that would be an improper application of the proceeds because the proceeds would have to be applied <i>cy-près</i> for the advancement of religion, not for the relief of poverty unless it was in the original charter or whatever it was granting the ground on which that church was built. Secondly, in this section we are not dealing with charities generally but only with charities established by statute or by charter to deal with a specific type of charity.  If it is for education it must be applied for educational purposes; if it is for other charitable purposes, the board will direct what those other charitable purposes are&mdash;but <i>cy-près</i>, which is the only way in which the board can direct. The board is constrained by legal requirements to apply that doctrine.</P>
      <P>Possibly it might meet the Deputy's criticism if paragraph (2) were to say: &ldquo;In any case where the original charity was for the relief of poverty the proceeds should be applied for the relief of poverty...&rdquo; and then have another paragraph providing for a situation where the grant was for educational purposes.  It is not spelled out; it only says &ldquo;for such charitable purposes...&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but does the Minister not agree that it is curious that the very point that he talks about is spelled out in regard to education but not in relation to the other three and if paragraph 2 stood on its own you would have no problem?  Is that not curious?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Possibly the answer would be to draft particular paragraphs to deal with poverty, <Col N="1126" /> religion and with the fourth category of charity, public purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>But paragraph (i) deals specifically with education and limits it specifically to educational charities.  Is not the implication in the general terms of paragraph (ii) that the other three categories are not subject to that limitation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that implication arises because, again, if I might remind the Deputy, this particular section goes back to a very limited number of charities.  In fact, only a few, so far as we are aware, are limited by statute or by charter, and will be affected by this section. They are mostly schools.  But if it should happen that another similar type of charity should come within the ambit of the section it can be dealt with also by the board on request by the trustees.  However, the board can only deal with it in relation to the charitable purpose which is specified in that particular statute or charter. If, for example, there was a statute setting up a fund for the relief of poverty and there was a building of some sort as part of the assets of that charity and if that building were to be sold and the trustees were to come to the board under this section, the board could not direct that the proceeds be used for any purpose other than the relief of poverty.</P>

      <P>Apart altogether from the plot given for educational purposes the building erected was in many cases erected by the people's free labour.  Will they lose this with the cost of the school, if the little plot on which the school was built and which was given only for that purpose could not realise the amount of money which the building did realise?  In this case the building realised the money because of where it was situated.  That building was erected by the free labour of many of the parishioners.  Is it not strange to have some law which prevents them getting portion of that money? I have not a legal mind but I cannot understand why all the money should be directed in the one direction just because the plot was given for that <Col N="1127" /> reason.  All over Ireland a great amount of free labour was put into those schools.  Now that the people want to put it into their churches of either denomination they cannot do it; it must all go for educational purposes even though the buildings made the plots more valuable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments arise out of suggestions made in the Seanad that the Charities Act, 1961, should be amended to allow for a more liberal investment of charity funds.  It was argued that, by virtue of the investment provisions of the Act, charities are denied access to opportunities for enrichment of the objects of the charity.  Under the existing law, unless there is a free power of investment, charity trustees must invest their funds in a limited range of Irish securities. The same is more or less true in respect of ordinary trust funds.  Section 32 (3) of the Charities Act, 1961, allows investment of charity funds in (a) investments authorised by law, that is, by the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958, (b) Irish securities, such securities being, first, stocks or shares in any industrial or commercial company incorporated in the State or maintaining in the State a register of its shareholders resident in the State or, secondly, freehold or leasehold land in the State.  The 1958 Act and the 1961 Act affect only trusts that contain no specific power of investment.  In practice, anybody establishing a trust, whether charitable or non-charitable, would avoid the restrictions of these Acts and give the trustees a wide power of investment.</P>
      <P>Section 32 and section 33 of the 1961 Act made a substantial change in the law as it then existed.  Prior to 1961, the High Court had a wide inherent jurisdiction over charities.  I quote from Lord Watson in <i>Andrews</i> v. <i>M'Guffog</i>, an 1886 case, in which he says:</P>
      <P>In the case of a public charitable trust the court have a power and discretion which does not belong to them in the case of a private trust. The rule is this, that while the court cannot alter the object of the trust, they may, according to the circumstances of each case, vary the mode of its attainment although differing from the directions of the trustee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This case was cited with approval by Vaisey J. in <i>Re Royal</i><Col N="1131" /><i>Society's Charitable Trusts</i> [1956] Chancery 92.</P>
    <P>Our High Court in the case of charitable trusts could authorise changes in the trusts, including changes of investment, by way of a scheme.  A scheme could provide for investment outside the range authorised by law or by the trust instrument, but the jurisdiction to frame a scheme had to be exercised sparingly and not indiscriminately.  An example of the exercise of this jurisdiction by the High Court will be found in the case of <i>W.J. Sweeney Trusts.</i> This case which occurred in 1960 is unreported but is referred to in the <i>Irish Law</i><i>Times and Solicitors' Journal</i> of 23rd April, 1960.  The effect of section 32 of the 1961 Act was to take away from the High Court the general power in charity cases to vary investments, including the power to permit investment in non-Irish securities.</P>
    <P>The Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958, does not prevent the High Court in the case of an ordinary or private trust from permitting the investment of the trust funds in nonauthorised securities.  If all the beneficiaries are of full age they may alter the trust in any way they like.  If infants or unborn persons are concerned the trust may only be altered by the High Court.  The jurisdiction of the court is an administrative jurisdiction to be exercised where a situation has arisen in regard to the property creating what might fairly be called an &ldquo;emergency&rdquo;&mdash;and under the heading of administration comes the investment of the trust funds.  However, under section 3 of the 1958 Act, money under the control or subject to an order of the court &mdash;for example, damages awarded to a minor&mdash;must be invested in authorised securities.</P>
    <P>The present position in regard to the variation of trusts is anomalous. Persons of full age who are the sole beneficiaries of an ordinary private trust may alter the trust in any way they like.  On the other hand, although the trustees of a charitable trust have power to have the trust varied for the benefit of the objects thereof, the <Col N="1132" /> variation may not involve a change to investments not authorised by section 32 of the 1961 Act, and the investment restriction applies even if the beneficiaries of the charitable trust are of full age.</P>
    <P>The Government consider that, in the interests of charities, section 32 of the Charities Act, 1961, should be amended in order to restore to the High Court the inherent power which it had prior to the 1961 Act to authorise changes in investments of charity funds.  In other words, we are satisfied that the court should have discretion to authorise the investment of charity funds in any securities, including non-Irish securities.  We are also satisfied that the Charity Commissioners should be given powers similar to those of the court in the case of charity funds.  It need hardly be said that the court and the board will be bound to exercise their discretion carefully in choosing the investments.  In any event, in the not too distant future the investment provisions of the 1961 Act and the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act, 1958, will have to be considered in the light of Article 67 (1) of the Treaty of Rome and any directive that may be issued thereunder. This article provides for the free movement of capital within the Common Market.</P>
    <P>Moreover, in England and Northern Ireland although there are provisions in regard to authorised investments in the case of ordinary trusts the trustees may nevertheless apply to the High Court for authority to vary their investments and also to vary the trust itself. I hope when time is available to examine these matters in the context of a revision of the whole law as to trusts and trustees.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I should like to say that the present amendments of the law are strongly supported by the Charity Commissioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not altogether happy about these amendments for the reason that they would appear to encourage investment outside the State at a time when that investment is not necessary in the interests of the charity. On reading section 32 (3) (a) (ii) of the <Col N="1133" /> 1961 Act I find that it is in fact permitted to invest in the &ldquo;ordinary stock or shares of any industrial or commercial company incorporated in the State or maintaining in the State at the time of the proposed investment a register of its shareholders resident in the State&rdquo; provided the ordinary shares are quoted on what is there referred to as the Dublin or Cork Stock Exchange.</P>
      <P>I must confess I was unaware that the existing power was as extensive as that, because I thought it was confined to debentures and preference shares. The existing power, therefore, would seem to me to be a wide one, and any difficulty that might arise or might have arisen for charitable trustees or for the commissioners, to my mind, would be simply that there was not a sufficient variety of investments quoted on the Irish stock exchange to give the best value possible to the charities under their care.  This may have been true in the past, and I do not deny that it may have been true in the past, but I genuinely doubt if it is true now.  We have seen over the last month or so three or four pretty large public issues on the Irish Stock Exchange.  The volume of business done there generally is considerably greater in recent years than it was in the past, and there is a pretty wide variety of and a fairly active market in ordinary shares of viable commercial concerns in this country.</P>
      <P>The implication in the amendments is that Irish investment is not adequate or not sufficiently beneficial for charities and that, therefore, it should be extended to English or foreign investment. I do not know whether the commissioners have had difficulties in making adequate or beneficial investments in this country.  In the time that I was in the Department of Justice I do not recall the case having been made to me that they were limited in that way. From a purely national point of view I am somewhat unhappy that they appear now to be encouraged to invest abroad by these amendments if they are passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the point which the Minister made the last day when I referred to this is quite valid.  He said private beneficiaries under a trust of <Col N="1134" /> full age and full discretion and, indeed, that charitable trustees had full discretion also where they were given that in the instrument.  I pointed out that a very high proportion of them would have the power specifically from the instrument establishing them.  The Minister said he thought it was unfair that those who had not the power specifically should be subject to this limitation.  It is not the fault of the State or of the Legislature that they have not got these specific powers.  I am not satisfied that there is any duty on the State or on the Oireachtas to extend powers to them to enable them to invest abroad when they have full and ample power under section 32 of the 1961 Act to invest here.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister whether the commissioners have made representations to his Department to the effect that they are precluded from making the necessary beneficial investment and perhaps, without mentioning any names, we might have examples of it and also of the amounts of money that are involved in relation to any such examples.  I would not have thought myself that at the present time these problems would exist.  I can accept that they may well have existed during the past.  My reluctance to welcome these amendments stems from the fact that I fear that there might be a significant outflow of money in the form of charitable funds if these two amendments are passed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would take issue with the Deputy when he says these amendments will encourage investment of moneys abroad.  This is wrong.  There is nothing whatever in the wording of the sections to lead to that interpretation.  All that these two new sections do is to permit a wider range of investment for Irish charitable funds.  This was the position up to 1961.  The restrictions were imposed only in 1961; they are quite young in terms of legal age, and it is intended now to go back to the pre-1961 position and to give jurisdiction to the High Court and to the Charity Commissioners to order the investment of trust funds in securities outside the State.  I do not see anything wrong with this.  It <Col N="1135" /> could be to the advantage of the charity that this wider range would be available to it without in any way damaging the national interest.  I have no statistics but I find it difficult to imagine that the investments would be of such magnitude as to affect the national interest.</P>
      <P>If for some reason&mdash;far be it from me to try and guess what the reasons might be&mdash;the High Court or the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests, both bodies well experienced in advising and organising charities and in looking after investments of charity funds or trust funds, thought there was a good and valid reason for investing outside the range of securities available in the State, then I think the legal power should be there to enable them to do so.  It is unfair that certain charities have complete discretion as to where they invest their funds, while a limited number of charities are prohibited from enjoying that advantage.  In the case of charities that do not contain that power within their instrument of creation, that power should be available whether it is used or not.  I understand there was an actual demand.  This is what has prompted the change at this time, in so far as a number of small charities intend to set up a common investment pool so as to form a unit trust.  If the trust were to be confined to securities on the Dublin Stock Exchange the amount of money involved could seriously affect the market, and it would be essential for this pooling of funds of the small charities that they would have power to invest abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the power was there until 1961, I understand between 1947 and 1961 the Charity Commissioners did not invest any of the funds under their control in non-Irish securities.  I think that is an indication that, while the power was there, it was used very sparingly.  I take the Deputy's point that the range and variety of investments available in this country have vastly increased in recent years, and I do not doubt that these are the ones to which both the court and the commissioners would first look.  However, there may be considerations that cannot <Col N="1136" /> be envisaged at the moment but which would make it desirable, in a few particular instances, to look further afield.  All that these amendments do is to give the power to look further afield, and both the High Court and the commissioners can be guaranteed not to exercise their powers flippantly.  As I indicated, there is a particular demand in the case of these small charities coming to form a common investment fund.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that this particular section will enable investment to be made abroad.  Is there any way by which this House could be informed at regular intervals about how the investment was going and what proportion of it was going abroad?  With regard to the free movement of capital, if a directive issues from the EEC that would be time enough to deal with that.  Could this House be informed at regular intervals how this investment is going, in view of the fact that this new power enables investment to be made abroad?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if the Minister is aware that within the last few days an Irish registered unit trust was established in this country, the bulk of its investment, but not all, being Irish?  It is a company registered here and quoted on the Irish Stock Exchange.  Those small charities, who wish to pool their funds for the purpose of investing in a unit trust, could quite easily invest in that. I hope that unit trust will be the first of a number to be established under the Unit Trust Act, 1972.  The indications are that there will be more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister disturbed me a bit when he said, perhaps inadvertently, that a number of charities wanted to pool their funds for the purpose of investing in unit trusts and if they were to invest here the investment would affect the market in some way.  I forget the precise words that he used but the implication seemed to be that the amount of money which they would invest would be so large that it would presumably drive up the price of certain <Col N="1137" /> types of shares.  I would have thought that the amounts involved would not be of sufficient significance to have any effect on the market one way or another.  I asked the Minister earlier if he had any examples of the amounts involved and whether, in fact, representations were received in relation to this.  He told me there were in relation to unit trusts but I think the events of the past week may well have changed that situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who had something to do with the provisions which the Minister now proposes to change, I must say that I can see the point in what he is doing and, oddly enough, I see it a little differently from Deputy Des O'Malley.  These restrictive provisions were brought in at a time when it was desirable to channel the maximum amount of investment possible into Irish developments.  The situation which Deputy O'Malley describes can also work the other way. I think our financial institutions and structures have so developed since then and the inflow of capital into this country has so increased that, perhaps, these limitations and restrictions on the investment of charitable funds outside the country are not now as necessary as they were at that time.  I am afraid I have not read the section carefully enough in the time available but the Minister might deal with this point.  If there is anything valid in what I am saying he might consider, between now and Report Stage, doing something about it.</P>
      <P>It does not seem to me, in the widesweeping powers which the Minister is now giving to either the commissioners or the court, that he is putting any obligation on either the commissioners or the court to restrict their investment abroad to situations where similar types of investment are not available in this country.  In other words, I think it is possible to visualise in the case of some particular charity, which has some particular objectives, that the appropriate channel of investment would not be available on the Irish market and there might be some sophisticated type of security available abroad, which is not available here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister might consider whether <Col N="1138" /> he should not enshrine in this section some such limitation and restrict the power of the commissioners and the court to investments abroad only in cases where they are satisfied&mdash;I leave that to their judgment and discretion &mdash;that a suitable and similar type of outlet is not available for the funds on the Irish scene.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>First, to deal with Deputy Wilson's point, I understand that the Annual Report of the Charity Commissioners is laid before the House and it shows the various investments of funds at the disposal of the commissioners.  There is no such requirement in the case of the courts. I think when we have the opportunity here of meeting a requirement halfway we should do it.  So many countries are inclined to resist to the last moment for particular, selfish interests that in this case when it costs us nothing we can be seen to be outgoing.</P>
      <P>In the case of this pooling of the smaller charities, to which I referred, and which Deputy O'Malley mentioned, I understand they are only being allowed to invest some of their funds outside the State.  It is not the intention in these charities that all their funds will go outside the State. While the strength and sophistication of the local stock exchange has increased immensely in the last few years it is still a sensitive area to a large flow of money in any one particular narrow direction and I think it would be only right that this new amalgamation of the small trusts should have the power to go outside the State with some of their funds.</P>
      <P>I do not know the composition and structure of the unit trust which the Deputy mentioned.  Its particular investments might be investments which would not appeal to a charity.  There might be a speculative element in some of them and it might not be suitable.  It would be wrong to say because this one exists the extra scope should not be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Haughey that the section should try to specify the circumstances in which investment could be <Col N="1139" /> made abroad I do not think that would be possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say &ldquo;specify the circumstances&rdquo; but just to have a directive principle enshrined that only when such an investment was not available at home would the freedom apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if that would be possible.  I find it difficult to see what type of investments would be available abroad that are not available already at home at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Why put it in at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Because there might be better ones of the same type abroad to suit a particular charity. Some of those available abroad that are not available at home might be ones to keep very far away from.  The section has to be worded to leave discretion to the court and to the commissioners. They both have a long tradition of dealing carefully with charitable funds and I would have no hesitation in giving them absolute discretion. There may be situations which may arise, and which cannot be specified at the moment, where it would be desirable that the court would have power to authorise investment in securities outside the State.</P>
      <P>The House will agree that both the court and the commissioners are conservative people who will not make investments that would run beyond the normal range of careful investing. Between 1947 and 1961 the commissioners, while they had the power to invest abroad, did not invest in funds other than Irish securities.  The whole history of the thing goes to show a conservative approach and I have no doubt that if suitable investments are available at home they will be picked in the first instance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was specified that we were discussing amendments Nos. 8 and 9 together.  I did not speak on the latter amendment and I do not think the Minister did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1140" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect it permits the same thing in the case of a trust where there is a life interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The situation in the sort of case envisaged in amendment No. 9 is one in which one might sometimes feel there could be a good deal of conflict about the kind of investment the trustees would make. Where the life tenant is a private individual and the remainder man is a charity, clearly in such a situation an investment in a security that would give a high rate of interest annually would be the more beneficial to the life tenant.  Such an investment might not be beneficial to the charity because by keeping up the rate of interest you almost inevitably nowadays deplete the real value of the capital.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister not take the opportunity, when he replaces section 33 as he proposes to do by this amendment, to deal with what must be a cause of loss to charities in this respect, particularly in inflationary times?  One can clearly see the conflict in interests here and one can sympathise with the anxiety of the life tenant to get the maximum income, because the life tenant is usually a widow or some other person to whom the testator felt a sense of obligation or who was dependent on the testator in some way.  One has a natural inclination to preserve the assets at the value they had at the date of the testator's death. In proposing to replace section 33 of the 1961 Act, did the Minister consider any possibility of resolving that conflict, which is likely to be greater in these times of high inflation than it would have been in 1961 when the section was originally passed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The only way to resolve that conflict is to allow for a certain amount of speculation and the risks inherent in that are more undesirable than are the consequences of investing in stocks that suffer from the effects of inflation.  This is entirely a question of investment policy and I do not know whether it would be suitable to write this into the section.  We must rely on the experience and expertise of the commissioners and the courts to <Col N="1141" /> authorise investments which would cushion the effects of possible inflation as much as possible.</P>
      <P>I do not think one can generalise about this.  It has to be left to the discretion of those managing the fund.  As Deputy Esmonde has just pointed out to me, the court can resolve the matter should there be any conflict between the life tenant and the trustees.  I am not aware there is any dissatisfaction on the part of beneficiaries regarding the investment policy of the court or of the commissioners.  I think it would be best to leave it like that, to leave it to their long experience.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 8 amends section 34 of the 1961 Act.  It extends the board's power in relation to the disposition of land belonging to a charity. Section 34 of the 1961 Act enabled the <Col N="1143" /> board to authorise the trustees to make a disposition of land by selling it or exchanging it for other land or surrendering a lease of it.  A disposition of land under that section is confined to selling it or exchanging it for other land or surrendering a lease of it.  It has been suggested that these powers be extended to cover dispositions of land by surrendering a tenancy of it, by accepting the surrender of a lease or tenancy of it or by mortgaging it.  The power to mortgage is at present confined to certain purposes connected with improvements to land, for example, the erection of a new building or repairs.  The amendment here is to give a general power to mortgage when it would be advantageous to the charity.  It is a widening of the powers of the 1961 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 10.</P>
      <P>10.  Before section 9 to insert a new section as follows:</P>
      <P>The following subsection is hereby substituted for subsection (1) of section 35 of the Principal Act:</P>
      <P>&lsquo;(1)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  any land is subject to a periodical payment payable to or for the benefit of a charity or applicable to charitable purposes, and</P>
      <P>(b)  an application is made to the Board by&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the trustees of the charity representing that a sale of the periodical payment to the owner of the land would be advantageous to the charity, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  the owner of the land or other person having an interest requesting the Board to authorise a redemption by him of the periodical payment,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the Board, may, if they think fit, inquire into the circumstances, and if, after inquiry, they are satisfied that the proposed sale or redemption can be effected on terms which <Col N="1144" /> would be advantageous to the charity, they may authorise the trustees to sell the periodical payment to the owner of the land on such terms and conditions as they deem beneficial to the charity and give such directions for securing the due investment of the money arising from such sale for the benefit of the charity or for securing the due application thereof to such charitable purposes as they think fit.  In case the redemption of a periodical payment is authorised under this section by the Board the trustees concerned shall, without unreasonable delay, take all necessary steps to effect the redemption.  In case there are no trustees of the charity concerned or the trustees of such charity are unknown, the Board may, on receipt of such payment as they consider appropriate in the circumstances, by order free and discharge the land from the periodical payment.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>This is a drafting amendment providing for a restatement of section 35 (1) of the 1961 Act incorporating amendments thereto contained in section 9 of the Bill.  The purpose of this amendment is to make the law easier for the reader to comprehend and to save him the trouble of having to refer back to the 1961 Act.</P>

My eyes stray down from section 9 to section 10 and I see the very same thing without the benefit of a redraft. Perhaps it is not as complicated.  It is a good principle that there should be redrafts such as are proposed here. I assume that the meaning or effect of the section is not in any way changed by the redraft.</P>

Under the 1961 Act the board can authorise the trustees to grant certain leases.  Where the board are trustees they themselves can grant such leases.  The 1961 Act restricts the lettings to lettings on building, repairing and improving.  It is considered that this restriction is obsolete.  In fact, no lease of that nature has ever been granted.  The amendment, in fact, extends the power to any letting of land belonging to a charity.</P>

      <P>This section amends section 43 of the 1961 Act.  It proposes to enlarge the power of the board to appoint new trustees of a charity and to vest the property of the charity in the new trustees.  The 1961 Act gave the board power to appoint new trustees and to vest in new trustees but it is confined to charity property comprising land. There is no reason why this should be so.  It is proposed to extend the power of the board to allow for the vesting of any property in the trustees.</P>

      <P>When the debate adjourned last week I was drawing attention to the exterior of Leinster House.  In particular I was referring to the exterior on the Kildare Street side. As one approaches Leinster House from the Kildare Street gate, one sees a very fine building, but the present state of the walls leaves much to be desired.  They could do with a facelift. The wires should be tidied and the place given a general brush-down.  It is important that we should give a good <Col N="1148" /> impression to visitors to the House. The impression they get when they come into the Chamber is in the hands of the individual Deputies.  We should make an effort to give a better impression of the building to people entering it.  It could be done at very little cost. Some attention should also be given to the waiting room at the Kildare Street entrance where visitors or constituents, when they are waiting for Deputies, sometimes have to sit for over an hour, in the waiting room.  This waiting room should be made more comfortable for those who have to wait.</P>
      <P>I would not approve increasing the height of the glass surround on the public gallery.  I remember the original grill; it was a very ugly affair. I see very little wrong with the present arrangement; the effect is quite attractive.  I know the main reason for the proposal to raise the glass partition to ceiling height is for security purposes.  If security is as it should be there should be no need for raising this partition.  Deputies can help here by ensuring that the people they bring in on the premises are vouched for and, if they are, there should be no difficulty.</P>
      <P>There are many national monuments in County Dublin, such as stone crosses and holy wells, which are of great historical interest.  If these are not taken over they will disappear with the advent of the builders and developers.  Land being the price it is the temptation to remove these historic monuments is very great.  The Office of Public Works should, in conjunction with the local authority, take steps to ensure that these historic monuments are preserved.  Many of these go back hundreds of years.  They are irreplaceable and if some move is not made quickly, many of these will be lost to us for ever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contribution towards education is not sufficient in this day and age. The difficulty of finding the money for the provision of primary schools in newly built-up areas is proving too great in many cases for the school managers.  A better contribution should be made from State funds.  At the moment there is a grant of two-thirds <Col N="1149" /> towards the cost of the building but there is no grant towards the cost of the site and school managers find it very difficult to raise the money to buy sites.  The Office of Public Works should be responsible for the full cost of the sites.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter of financing school buildings and sites, <i>et cetera</i>, would seem to be a matter for the Department of Education rather than the Office of Public Work.  The latter merely act as agents for the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I refer for a moment to the grants towards the maintenance of schools?  Again, it is two-thirds for furniture.  That seems reasonable enough.  The grant for cleaning, <i>et cetera</i>, is very small.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to see if he could improve this grant because in developing areas it is difficult for the managers to find funds for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should also have a look at the grants for painting.  These are available only every so many years.  In many instances we are being pennywise and pound foolish because the painting of schools is very necessary.  We know that if we do not paint our own homes they deteriorate very rapidly.  It is important that each school should be painted as often as this is seen to be necessary.</P>
      <P>An architect from the Office of Public Works should visit each school periodically.  In some parts of the country it is necessary to paint more often than in other parts.  In certain areas it may be necessary to paint a school after two or three years, whereas in other areas it may only be necessary after three, four or five years.  One cannot have a hard and fast rule in regard to the exterior maintenance of schools but they should be checked on more frequently and an architect should be made available to visit and report on schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle has drawn my attention to the fact that my remarks would be more appropriate to <Col N="1150" /> a debate on the Estimate for the Department of Education but if there is anything the Parliamentary Secretary can do to hasten the day when his office will make a contribution towards sites for primary schools or indeed buy the sites for the school managers, I would welcome it.</P>

There are many matters to which I could refer but I shall confine myself to one or two and endeavour to emphasise them in the hope that they will be met with sympathy and understanding from the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>I should like to say how happy I was that when that vacancy occurred it was Deputy Henry Kenny who was chosen to fill it.  I say this not with a view to getting any special favours from him but I am happy that he has the personality, the resourcefulness and, indeed, the imagination to leave the track of his hand&mdash;I will not say his boot, though it might be necessary at times&mdash;on the Office of Public Works.</P>

    <P>I shall appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary on a matter which is dear to my heart.  As the Ceann Comhairle has indicated, there are certain areas where the Office of Public Works act as agents for other Departments.  The area in which I have a special interest is absolutely a household matter for the office itself.  I refer, as I have done every year since my election to this House, to the Phoenix Park.  I am somewhat disappointed that there is not greater reference to it in the Parliamentary Secretary's statement. While in quantity the reference is not there, the quality, having regard to surveys carried out, reminds me that the new Parliamentary Secretary is not unmindful of the importance of the Phoenix Park in the life of the people of Dublin and, indeed, the people of the country as a whole.  In the times in which we live, there are many pressures on people, especially in cities, I think we can say assuredly that the Lord ordained that there <Col N="1151" /> were certain amenities which the human being might have.</P>
    <P>I hope He ordained that every human being should have the right to see green pastures, to see trees and flowers, that he should have the right to walk through such an area, preferably without having to pay a fee for it, and that the only obligation upon him would be that he would leave these amenities in the same good state in which he found them.  That is what I hope the Office of Public Works will do in the matter of the Phoenix Park. I hope that the Phoenix Park will continue to be looked after and allowed to retain, as far as possible, its natural beauty and appeal.  Being mindful of the pressures that are on people, I believe it is important that they should have an area there catering for all ages. In this area the lady should be catered for so that she can move out with her baby in a pram while an old person should have facilities to sit down and enjoy the view of the surroundings.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to have particular regard for elderly people who use this park.  In recent times there has been an extension of the facilities granted to people who are anxious to indulge in horse riding.  Over the last few years this exercise has been pursued to the detriment of other users of the park.  The question of the safety of the other users of the park also arises in this regard.</P>
    <P>When I questioned the Minister for Finance about this matter I was disturbed to discover that if a person in the park is injured by some inexperienced or careless horse rider the only redress he has is against the horse rider in question.  To qualify for these horse riding exercises one need only have 50p, at the most £1.  This is a dangerous area for the Office of Public Works and one to which they should no longer contribute.  It is possible at present in the Phoenix Park for a person to be seriously injured, or killed, by inexperienced horse riders. The only redress such a person has is to take action against a youth of, perhaps, 15 or 16 years of age.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is aiding <Col N="1152" /> and abetting and helping in the commercial pursuits of the owners of these horses.  They are receiving from the State co-operation which, I believe, is not given to any other commercial concern.  The Parliamentary Secretary may wish me to elaborate on this matter.  He is providing these facilities for these people.  The stables are all on the perimeter of the park.</P>

      <P>Yes.  The Parliamentary Secretary might get special rates but the ordinary person, if he wished to enjoy this pastime, would have to pay £1 for the use of one of these horses for an hour.  This horse travels through the Phoenix Park at certain risk to other users of the park.  Such activities are also leading to the despoilation of the park.  The horses are also causing damage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  I would not object to a certain amount of commercialisation but I think that the people who use the park, and who are benefiting from it, should be obliged to pay a certain fee to the Office of Public Works.  This fee should be commensurate with the damage caused and should go towards the restoration of the areas destroyed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy also had the question of public liability in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a most important point.  What happens in the case of people who are injured by these horses?  Some of the horses are of an age, and of a type, that they will not throw any jockey but there are others that in the hands of inexperienced people could bolt, shy and do damage.</P>
      <P>I think we can leave the horse side for the moment and return to my original plea.  I am very mindful of the fact that Deputy Henry Kenny has been appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance with responsibility for the Office of Public Works.  The Parliamentary Secretary, to whom I extend my congratulations on his appointment, lives in an area where the matters to which I have referred are relatively unimportant in so far as they surround him on every side.  I know that somebody living in, say, Westport has only to travel a few hundred yards to be able to enjoy amenities of a character that are not available to the city dwellers.  Perhaps because these amenities are so available to the Parliamentary Secretary, it is necessary for me to remind him of how vital they are to the city dweller.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very happy in regard to certain proposals which the Office of Public Works have in mind.  However, I regret that it is taking so long to implement these worthwhile proposals.  I would venture to say that for every additional £ spent on the Phoenix Park, there will be a saving in one way or another to the State of £2.  If we were to spend more money on the Phoenix Park, it would not be necessary for us to spend so much money on such places as reform homes, <Col N="1154" /> prisons and other such establishments and neither might it be necessary for us to spend so much in the fields of health and education.  I hope that I will not be taken as putting forward a city view on this matter.  I would advocate the same proposals in respect of any city.  While it may sound paradoxical, the longer we live, the greater will be the need not to modernise the Phoenix Park but the greater will be the need to leave the Phoenix Park as it was 100 years ago.  I would hope that, by and large, it would be the same 100 years hence as it is now.</P>
    <P>There must be no departure from the natural state of the park.  This is the lung of the city and an amenity of its kind is necessary in any growing city.  While the Phoenix Park may be regarded as a tourist attraction my real interest in it is its relationship to the well-being of the people of Dublin, especially those who do not find it possible to get out to country areas.</P>
    <P>I should like to correct any false impression I may have given in regard to the horse because there is no more attractive or natural addition to the park than this animal but we must not allow the park to be used by horses to the extent that this is happening at the moment.</P>
    <P>As an educationalist, the Parliamentary Secretary might consider the final point I make so far as this park is concerned.  The natural environment, such as that available in the park, is very beneficial to our citizens.  Having regard to the thousands of people of all ages who avail of the park it is interesting to note that there is an extraordinarily low incidence of vandalism there. Perhaps this can be attributed to the respect which people have for nature at its best.  On the question of physical education in the context of the Phoenix Park, I make an appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary on behalf of those people who play soccer and Gaelic football in the area known as the Fifteen Acres.  Some time ago arrangements were made between the Office of Public Works and the respective executives of the two associations catering for these sports in regard to pavilions that were erected in that <Col N="1155" /> area.  During the short few weeks that I acted as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Education I was surprised to discover that in respect of the construction of those pavilions the two associations concerned were required to pay a fee.  No fee is required from those who own the horses that are to be seen in the park.  The GAA is an amateur association and the soccer association which caters for juveniles can be described also as an amateur association.  I understand that some proportion of the money they were required to pay towards the construction of the pavilion is still outstanding. The least we might do&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the Deputy is asking me to remit the amount concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary might consider the situation in relation to the horses.  Having got an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that there will be a remission in respect of the GAA I hope that his generosity will extend to the other association also.</P>
      <P>Before concluding I shall renew an appeal that I made last year in respect of the portraits that hang in this House.  On several occasions I have heard Deputies who, while acting as guides, attribute the wrong names to certain portraits.  It would be desirable to have a small name plate under each portrait.</P>

      <P>This is an indication of my faith in the Parliamentary Secretary.  I hope he will help to redress the imbalance that exists in Dublin in relation to planning, although I realise that is a tall order.  Dublin is an extraordinary city.  The planners, most of whom live on the south side, arrange to have prestigious buildings on the south side but on the north side there are prisons, reformatory schools, the bulk of the local authority dwellings and 85 per cent of third-level education establishments.</P>
      <P>I am not suggesting the Parliamentary Secretary can bring about a great change in this but perhaps he might do something about the location of State offices.  I have already expressed my thanks that his office have arranged to have State offices at Phibsboro' and I hope more will be sited at Finglas and at the North Circular Road.</P>

      <P>I should like to congratulate the Office of Public Works on the guide system now in operation throughout the country with regard to national monuments.  I should also like to congratulate the local guides in Cashel and in Cahir Castle for their very valuable work.  Their example has been of benefit to other areas in the country.  However, there are one or two problems with regard to the Rock of Cashel.  Money collected during the summer months at any national monument should be redirected back into the improvement and maintenance of that monument. I understand that preservation work is to commence this year on the Vicar's Choral at the Rock of Cashel and I hope the Office of Public Works will take full account of the potential of this area.  I have been asking to have this work carried out for the last three years and I am delighted work is to commence shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of some difficulties that have occurred with regard to the local caretaker.  The difficulties are in regard to a concession he has in writing from the Office of Public Works for the last 18 years to operate a small shop for a very paltry wage.  This man has five children.  The Office of Public Works may say they give him a free house and have added extentions <Col N="1158" /> to it.  All this is desirable but they are not benefits.  They are his rights but he is being paid the paltry sum of £14 per week for a six-day week&mdash;indeed it could be regarded as much longer because his wife also works&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Office of Public Works have always been considerate and in all my dealings with them they have been most courteous.  I hope they will consider this man as a human being with a small shop who wants to continue in business.  I consider the shop an asset to the national monument.</P>
      <P>I should like, while he is in the House, to correct Deputy Lemass who, if he had bothered to consult the local authority&mdash;that is myself in this case&mdash;in regard to the allegations he made of carelessness by the caretaker and the Garda in regard to the flood lighting on the Rock of Cashel, he would have been better off than in making ill-timed and ill-informed statements.</P>

      <P>I do not quite know but if the Board of Works want a caretaker 24 hours a day they will have to pay him 24 hours a day seven days a week.  The lighting is financed by a local voluntary committee for which I have the greatest praise.  One of them, the principal of the local school, is one of the people who have been most persevering in replacing the lights as they are broken.  The last official complaint to the local Garda station was in 1969 during the Fleadh Ceoil.  Messrs. Guinness have not complained officially either to the Board of Works or to the Garda.  I suggest Deputy Lemass's information was based on local rumour rather than facts.  There is easy access to the Rock at night through Scully's monument where we all played as children at night.  That is how the young vandals who are breaking the lights get there and it is they who are doing the damage through no fault of the caretaker or his family who are, and have been totally dedicated to their work for three generations.</P>

      <P>I can assure the former Parliamentary Secretary that, if he were living locally and knew as much as I knew, he would not open his mouth about the situation because he's absolutely and totally ignorant regarding the actual damage done there.  I do not intend to enlarge on the subject but I wish to exonerate totally both the caretaker and the local gardaí, who can do a certain amount but cannot maintain a 24 hour watch unless the Board of Works would help by ensuring that there is a watchman employed 24 hours a day.  I should like the board to clean the outside walls of the castle which are being covered in ivy.  In the past few years sheep were allowed to graze inside the walls and keep the grass down.  There was objection because of the other benefits left by the sheep, but I now find that the contract system under which the grazing was done was not properly timed and at present there is a good growth of what <Col N="1160" /> is almost hay there.  This is where most tourists walk around.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary ensure that growth is kept in check so that tourists may enjoy the amenities freely?</P>
      <P>There is also the matter of burial rights on the Rock.  Declarations have been given by the Board of Works to such families, but I should like that in certain circumstances, where there are men with no families to succeed them or no brothers or sisters to be buried in those graves, their wives who are not specifically mentioned in the burial rights documents should be allowed to be buried in that cemetary because that would be the end of the family.</P>

      <P>I was about to mention what the Chair is most interested in, Cahir Castle.  I shall take only a few minutes.  I know that the Chair is personally concerned about this castle and would not think of interrupting me. Before coming to that I should like to say that I was shocked at Whit weekend to find one of our national monuments being used by a band of travelling Italians in a local carnival.  They had a motor cycle on a trapeze wire running from a pole in the middle of Dominick Street to the top of Moore Abbey.  I am sure this will cause the Board of Works to turn their eyes to heaven but I can assure them I saw this myself.  Moore Abbey was thus used in a commercial enterprise or, perhaps, in a sort of a trick-o'-the-loop entertainment.  I ask the board to ascertain who allowed or caused that to happen and to ensure that no such desecration will be allowed in the case of any national monument.</P>
      <P>Last week the Parliamentary Secretary said that he would accept under guardianship the outer walls of Cahir Castle belonging to Mrs. Kenny, no relation of the Parliamentary Secretary. I think she deserves mention here.</P>

I have absolute confidence in him that he will ensure that the outer walls will be taken in guardianship. It was intimated to me last February that they would be accepted in guardianship but not in ownership. It is hardly understandable that this woman, who was shabbily treated by the Board of Works, even though she has given them so much help was not even invited as a next-door-neighbour, not to mind one who had given so much help, to the opening of Cahir Castle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I do not want to name any civil servants but I would object to the manner and attitude to that woman of one or two of them.

      <P>I shall inform the Parliamentary Secretary in private of the person.  I can assure him there were more witnesses than one.  This may be said to be a personal grudge between this gentleman and myself, but at least I have witnesses for this <Col N="1162" /> occasion.  I should like to ensure that the walls are taken into guardianship. Whatever money has been spent on the monument to date will bear little fruit until the total walls are taken into consideration and it can be a complete castle monument.  The preservation, not conservation, of the outside walls should be included.  The Office of Public Works have done a tremendous job.  I should like to pay tribute to Mr. Wade, one of the people who carried out so much work there.  He was the foreman and he is very ill in hospital at the moment.  I should also like to pay tribute to the clerk of works in the area from whom I have seen nothing but dedication and service to the Office of Public Works. I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give a reasonable guarantee that the Office of Public Works will take the outside walls around the Swiss Cottage into guardianship.</P>

      <P>Not diplomatic but merely confident of both the National Monuments Section and the Parliamentary Secretary.  I would beg and plead with the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="1163" /> to drain the River Suir.  This was promised in 1948 by the late Michael Donnellan.  We are still waiting. It is the third longest river in Ireland.  It flows through the Golden Vale.  I know the Ceann Comhairle is intimately interested in this.  He is personally involved and asked questions about it when he was in Opposition. I know he will sympathise with me.</P>

      <P>I will talk about drainage and you can talk about pollution. I know the Ceann Comhairle is as aware of and as worried as I am about the farming position in South Tipperary.  Between 3,000 to 4,000 acres of the Golden Vale are affected yearly by flooding.  In the village of Ardfinnan shops are affected. The heart of Ireland, the best agricultural land, is affected by lack of drainage in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that plans for national schools will be drawn up quickly to ensure that children will not be allowed to remain in substandard schools for too long a period.  The Parliamentary Secretary has practical experience of this as a national school teacher.  He knows that proper standards should be maintained for the betterment of education and that substandard schools should not be allowed.  I would ask him to ensure that plans for the four or five national schools in South Tipperary which are <Col N="1164" /> awaiting approval will be expedited and sent to the Department of Finance for quick and sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>I thank the Parliamentary Secretary and I would remind him to take the outside walls of Cahir Castle into guardianship not ownership and ensure that Cahir town will benefit from this extra attraction for the tourist industry, the Butler Castle.</P>

      <P>Tuigim.  Cuirim fáilte roimh an méid adúirt an Rúnaí Parlaiminte i dtosach na díospóireachta seo.  Ba mhaith liom chomh maith tagairt ghairid a dhéanamh don méid oibre atá idir lámhaibh ag na coimisinéirí agus don mhéid atá déanta acu ag féachaint i ndiaidh na seanfhothrach, na n-oifig Stáit go léir, Caisleán Átha Cliath, áiteacha ar nós Páirc an Fhionnuisce, Faiche Stiofáin agus mar sin de.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Luaigh cuid de na Teachtaí, nó Teachta amháin ar aon nós, an gléas aistriúcháin atá in úsáid faoi láthair. Cheap mé go ndúirt duine acu nach raibh aon ghá leis.  De réir mar adeirtear liom cuireadh an gléas seo isteach an Fómhair seo caite agus tuigtear dom, cé nach rabhas sa Teach seo ag an am, gur baineadh níos mó úsáid as le mí anuas ná mar a baineadh as ón Fhómhair go dtí an Nollaig.  Triail í <Col N="1165" /> seo chun Teachtaí agus, ar ndóigh, Airí a spreagadh chun Gaeilge a úsáid sa Teach ionus go dtabharfaidh siad dea-shompla don náisún ar fad.  Ní bheinn ag súil le go mbainfí a lán úsáide as an ngléas seo i dtosach.  Ní cóir d'aon duine bheith ag tnúth le torthaí tapaidh ó ghléas aistriúcháin dá shórt.  Ba chóir féachaint air a leithéid mar thriail ar feadh, b'fhéidir, 5 nó 10 mbliana.</P>
    <P>Tá deacrachtaí ag baint leis.  Tá an t-aistriúchán go han-mhaith agus is féidir le gach duine sa Teach nach bhfuil dóithin taithí aige ar Ghaeilge an t-aistriúchán a leanúint ach sa <i>Tuarascáil Oifigiúil</i> tá tuairisc iomlán le fáil ar cad deirtear i nGaeilge.  Dá bhrí sin, má bhíonn rudaí le rá ag Teachta ní thig le duine nach bhfuil mórán taithí aige ar Ghaeilge an méid atá san <i>Tuairisc Oifigiúil</i> a leanúint. Sin ceann de na deacrachtaí a bhaineann leis faoi láthair ach is dóigh liom gur maith an rud é an gléas seo a bheith ann.  Is dóigh liom gur fearr an dualgas a bheith ar dhaoine poiblí dea-shompla a thúirt i gcás na Gaeilge a úsáid ná bheith ag moladh do dhaoine eile Gaeilge a labhairt.  Bheinn féin ag súil go mbeadh níos mó den teanga á húsáid, mar a thárlaíonn go minic anois le linn Tráth na gCeist, ach, ar an dtaobh eile den scéal, bheinn ag súil go mbeadh cuid mhaith Teachtaí ag labhairt i mBéarla chomh maith. Measaim gurb é an cuspóir is cóir a bheith ann ná úsáid na Gaeilge a mhéadú diaidh ar ndiaidh i rith na mblianta ní amháin sa Teach seo ach ar fud na tíre.</P>
    <P>One of the matters to which I wish to refer briefly is the proposal to erect a protective glass screen here in the Visitors' Gallery.  Some Deputies seem to favour this proposal, while others seem to be opposed to it.  I understand the idea was put forward by those responsible for security and was approved of by the outgoing Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I do not think it is a very fundamental question but, I, like some other Deputies, would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to take another look at it.  Certainly it would be awkward if anything happened from the Public Gallery, but if <Col N="1166" /> there are people around from time to time who want to attempt something, a little bit of glass will not stop them. It is by the practice of democracy that a free community strengthens itself, and, without going too deeply into this question, it does seem to me that, having regard to events in recent years, the pressure of public opinion has been more effective than preventive action. To put this House in a glass box or to put the visitors in a glass box would not, in my opinion, be a great contribution to democracy.  Democracy would be better served by people showing their disapproval of somebody's action in, say, throwing a bag of flour over that screen.  Therefore, I would urge the Parliamentary Secretary to talk with the security people a second time on this question.  I think it would be preferable to leave the Public Gallery as it is, so that there is no greater division between those listening to the proceedings in the Dáil and those of us taking part in them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is against the proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am not violently against it, but I think it would be better not to proceed with this proposal. I see a garda up there.  I do not think there is very much danger, and even if there is, the person who would do anything would be shouted down by the public that that sort of action would be discouraged.</P>
      <P>I would agree with those Deputies who have spoken in favour of improving facilities for Members of the Dáil and Seanad.  This has already been spelled out, and I shall not go into detail, but we would envisage Leinster House as a permanent site for Dáil Éireann in future years, if additional areas become available to the commissioners, such as that occupied by the Natural History Museum or the College of Science, they should be earmarked for improving the facilities available for the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to office buildings, I welcome the outlook that the commissioners should be providing any additional office building for State Departments rather than that private sources, <Col N="1167" /> either foreign or domestic, should be doing so.  The idea of continuing to lease expensive office property on short-term leases goes totally against my instincts as a businessman, thinking in terms of the interests of the taxpayer. Here I might mention the sort of sites that may become available in the foreseeable future.  There are many large military installations in Dublin. These are pretty antiquated buildings. Some of us have spoken on the Defence debate in favour of a military complex outside the city, so if and when these other sites become available, the Parliamentary Secretary and the commissioners should, perhaps in conjunction with the NBA, use such sites for the purpose of providing office accommodation, housing accommodation and, perhaps, even commercially-rented accommodation. Another site that occurs to me&mdash;and I do not know exactly what is to happen to it&mdash;is the Dublin Cattle Market. I understand it is no longer in use.  It is the property of the Dublin Corporation but, here again, perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could take a look at the question.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the provision for national monuments.  Like other Deputies, I believe that the work of preservation which has been going on is of enormous value to the present generation and the future.  In regard to the restoration of national monuments, castles and so on, which come under the care of the commissioners, I would suggest that, where suitable, they should be made a living part of the community rather than showplaces.  Consideration might be given to leasing suitable buildings to responsible bodies and organisations for use as local museums, tourist offices and even as places for local civic receptions or public meetings.</P>
    <P>Mention has also been made of extending the Office of Public Works information service as regards national monuments.  This is a very good idea.  It might be most efficiently fulfilled through liaison with the local regional tourist organisations.  One would thus tie in the local information and the local interests with the <Col N="1168" /> national objective of the commissioners.</P>
    <P>The Kennedy Memorial Hall has been referred to already.  I would like to inquire from the Parliamentary Secretary what the position is.  Unlike others I question, in relation to this proposal, whether any cost/benefit analysis has been made of its potential use if it is built.  I know this is not directly a question for the Parliamentary Secretary or the commissioners but, as has been mentioned by another Deputy, if one is to spend a considerable amount of money in quite properly honouring the memory of a man like the late President Kennedy consideration should be given towards spending it in a way which would be useful and fruitful.  I question whether a concert hall for that purpose only will not be something of a liability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Deputy any suggestions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but one Deputy suggested providing an amenity centre.  This is one good suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>No brainwave occurs to me.  The Parliamentary Secretary might recommend the Government to look at it from the point of view that while it is quite proper to honour the late President Kennedy one should look at the way in which one does so from the point of view of value to the nation as well as honouring him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the interparty committee must be consulted and their suggestions must be considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave that to the Parliamentary Secretary.  Mention has been made of the Phoenix Park.  The Parliamentary Secretary mentioned the proposals coming from the students at Bolton Street Technical School.  I would encourage him to consider some of these proposals because the type of exercise they have <Col N="1169" /> carried out is a very useful one.  The idea of eventually phasing out motor traffic is a very good one.  This would help, as Deputy Tunney said, to maintain a very good amenity.</P>
      <P>In relation to Aras an Uachtaráin if possible part of the Aras and the grounds should be open to the public from time to time.  The office of President should be brought as near as possible to the people.  I believe the office of President is a valuable and useful one in a democracy.  There is a tendency to downgrade it and to suggest you do not need it.</P>
      <P>There is a proposal that the commissioners take over the Grand Canal. At what stage is this?  The commissioners are also responsible for looking after a number of graves in Glasnevin Cemetery but from what I have seen some of these are not in the condition they might be although I do not want to elaborate on this.</P>
      <P>The Board of Works are also doing very good work in relation to some of our harbours, especially Howth and Dún Laoghaire.  The Parliamentary Secretary dealt with questions arising out of the provision of accommodation for ferries, the removal of the temporary accommodation and the provision of permanent accommodation.  Have the parties involved in Dún Laoghaire been consulted in regard to the proposals for the new ferry?  I believe there are four yacht clubs in the Dún Laoghaire area.  I have not had much time for this pastime but I wonder, in relation to constructing a causeway connecting the pier to the car ferry, which seems to be a necessary proposal, where exactly the ramp, to which the Parliamentary Secretary referred, will be.  It seems to me, from reading his remarks and looking at the site, that this ramp might cause less dislocation if it were at the causeway or running into it.  As I am not sufficiently expert on this matter I recommend the Parliamentary Secretary to consult the yachting people, if this consultation has not already taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there are approximately 3,000 members of the different yacht clubs who are interested but I am mainly interested in the amenities which Dún Laoghaire provides for the <Col N="1170" /> citizens of this city and also for visitors in the business of yachting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear it. I do not altogether understand the proposals.  I know there was considerable dislocation earlier and I think there was some sort of understanding that the position would revert to what it was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The position will be just as it was&mdash;all the amenities will be as before.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear it. In his opening speech the Parliamentary Secretary referred on a number of occasions to the work being done by the commissioners in the areas of environmental amenity and perhaps I will be allowed to refer to some aspects of the problem which we are facing. We are beginning to see the frightening consequences to the quality of our lives the uncontrolled or partly controlled expansion of industry and the increasing pollution of our rivers and countryside in general.  It is a sort of creeping monster we have got to face up to and bring under control.</P>
      <P>I know there are many bodies in addition to the commissioners involved in the problem of how to deal with an expanding industrial society.  I had the experience during a couple of years of sitting on a committee of Foras Forbartha which produced a very useful report on our national heritage.  Many State and semi-State bodies, including the commissioners, were represented on that committee.  One of the problems I observed was that though each body were doing what they could, during the discussions there did not seem to be any sort of overall means of co-relating the work being done by the different bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Chair will permit me, I should like to make a suggestion which might be useful and which the Parliamentary Secretary might consider.  He said that 1,000 national monuments were in hands.  If the commissioners were not in existence and had not existed, most of these monuments would have been <Col N="1171" /> destroyed by now and I would say something similar applies to the question of the environment and pollution. If some means is not found by the Government to bring together the different bodies, all of whom are doing their best&mdash;for example, the local authorities and the Department of Transport and Power&mdash;we may later regret it.  We may one day look back and ask why there was not, for example, such a body as &ldquo;Commissioners for the Environment&rdquo; established in order to provide the means whereby the different groups would be brought together.</P>
    <P>Current thinking in relation to pollution of our rivers is that it is purely a matter for the local authorities.  I know this does not come directly under the Board of Works but it impinges on the question of amenities and conservation. It does not seem to me to be sufficient to leave responsibilities of this kind to the local authorities alone.  They have a lot of other responsibilities, just as the commissioners have a very wide area to cover.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>And not enough money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely.  I do not think we will solve these problems and come to grips with them unless we have some kind of fresh approach.  The sort of approach I would suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary is that he might consider recommending the setting up of a national authority, something similar to the Board of Works, with reserved powers and finance.  If we are to use our resources in a practical way and at the same time preserve our national physical heritage we need a fresh approach to this subject.  Many of the bodies involved in this area are looking for help, guidance and leadership and I believe that in working amongst them there are many dedicated people who have the sense of tradition and history which the Office of Public Works has.  It is a question of encouraging them, of providing a structure through which this sort of work can be done.  If a vigorous, imaginative approach is not undertaken soon, in the year 2,000 our people will condemn us <Col N="1172" /> irrespective of which administration is here now.  They will find us wanting in the fulfilment of our responsibilities in relation to the preservation of our amenities and environment and particularly from the point of view of failing to control pollution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other Deputies I wish to congratulate Deputy Kenny on his appointment as Parliamentary Secretary and I thank him for the way he has sat here during the entire debate, sometimes without tea or lunch.  He has listened to what every Deputy had to say without interrupting anybody.</P>
      <P>I represent part of the country which one would not describe as the best land. It is Leitrim and north Roscommon and it has had the highest drop in population not alone in the last census or in the previous census or in the census before that, but in every census since the foundation of the State.  It has the least number of jobs per head of the population in the country.</P>
      <P>Since the last general election and since this Government came into office we have heard a tremendous amount of talk from the opposite benches about promises.  From time to time and for their own arguments they misinterpreted the policy we put clearly before the electorate.  They have said we have not fulfilled this or that promise, that we have not done away with the means test for old age pensioners, that we have not done anything about death duties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be given every opportunity to speak.  I will put a fact to him now.  I will refer to a by-election in my constituency ten years ago when Deputy Joan Burke was a candidate.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy O'Malley, God rest his soul, came to Castlerea and told people he would drain the Shannon.  He said that £10 million would be spent on the drainage of the Shannon.  At that time the people were walking up to their knees in it; today they are walking up to their tummies in it.  When one thinks of promises we in my constituency think of that one.  It was a clear <Col N="1173" /> promise given to the people of my constituency.  These people had been hoping something would be done about the Shannon drainage.</P>
      <P>References to drainage have been made by Deputies opposite.  I will refer to some rivers in my constituency which are tributaries of the Shannon.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to let the people of Roscommon, Leitrim and Galway know exactly what is the position in regard to Shannon drainage. We should like to know whether it is on the priority list and at what stage and when it is hoped that a survey will commence so that drainage can be tackled, or whether it is possible to have it drained at all.  I, representing those people, say they are entitled to know what the position is and I have no doubt the Parliamentary Secretary will tell me.</P>
      <P>There is no point in him, his predecessor, his successor or anybody else coming down to that part of the country and telling us we have no problem.  We have serious problems and our major one is drainage and I look forward to some positive action in this respect.  The Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal has been left out of the 1938 Act which was put through this House at that time by a Deputy representing Cavan.  Portion of this waterway went through that constituency.  There is no hope whatever of getting these rivers into the arterial drainage scheme because they are prevented from being included by the 1938 Act.  What is the position with regard to these rivers? At the moment the Office of Public Works are carrying out a survey which it is hoped to complete by the end of this year.  When it is completed, are the people to be told that no money will be provided in the area for arterial drainage?  Are they to be told that because it flows into the Erne no agreement can be reached between this country and Northern Ireland about it?  Have the Office of Public Works or the Department of Finance started to negotiate agreements with Northern Ireland about this matter?  Have they discussed the drainage of the area?  This is the second longest waterway in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1174" /> At the moment the Shannon is used for navigation.  The Ballinamore-Bally-connell canal was used some years ago for navigation.  There is also the question of drainage in that area.  If this waterway could be used for navigation from the River Erne to the Shannon it would be the second longest waterway in Europe and would attract a tremendous number of visitors who are now anxious to get on waterways.  As a Deputy representing that part of the country I would be anxious to know the intentions of the Office of Public Works in regard to these two drainage areas.</P>

    <P>It is only natural that I should be interested in the provision of Garda stations in my own part of the country.  Even where sites are available progress is so slow in this regard that one asks from time to time what is wrong?  What can be done to improve the situation?  Is it lack of money?  If it is, let us say so and say we must wait a certain time.</P>
    <P>In that statement he was trying to convey that the present Government are short of money.  The Deputy is quite right in that statement.  We are all short of money.  Every Deputy and official in this House is short of money. It is no crime to be short of money. Every piece of work that we want to be done, on a Garda barracks or elsewhere, cannot be done in one year. Why were we not told last year or the year before, or for the past 15 years, that there was a shortage of money? The motive behind that statement is to convey that, for the first time in the history of this country, there is now a shortage of money.  We all know that the true situation is that all these things cannot be done at the one time.  There are difficulties about Garda barracks in my constituency.  As with drainage, there should be a priority list of Garda stations to be built according to the amount of money available for them. There are towns like Mohill and Carrick-on-Shannon where the Garda barracks are in a deplorable condition. If the Parliamentary Secretary is channelling money into the building of <Col N="1175" /> Garda barracks, the two I have mentioned and others in Roscommon should be attended to.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to security in this House.  Some people think that if there were glass up to the roof in the Public Gallery there would be no difficulty about security.  A few years ago there was wire up there which one could describe as a fence between ourselves and the public.  Every time one looked at it, one would think it was sheep or cattle were on the other side of it.  If people want to come in here and interrupt us that is not a mortal sin. If people want to come in here and shoot us they will do so.  A glass partition will not stop them.  They will shoot us outside if they cannot shoot us inside and we will not be the first Members of this House to be shot.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary not to raise the partition any higher. It is ideal as it is.  We all know the security there is and, even with that security, people have shouted at us from the Public Gallery and have promptly been removed.  If people want to look at us they are certainly entitled to do that.</P>
    <P>What I have to say now may not be entirely relevant on this particular Vote for the Office of Public Works but, from now on, before any new national school is built, would the Office of Public Works have a look at the situation because the Department of Education is, in my opinion, falling down completely on the job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús, ba mhaith liom comhgáirdeachas a dhéanamh leis an Runaí Parlaiminte nua.</P>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of welcoming the Parliamentary Secretary and congratulating him on his elevation to this most important post.  I know his term of office will be a fruitful one.  He will certainly have my full co-operation and, I am sure, the co-operation of my colleagues, but that will not prohibit us being critical if the need to be critical arises.  We will, however, never be unjustly or unkindly critical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the Estimate has increased by over £3¾ million on last year.  As Deputy Reynolds said, all <Col N="1176" /> Governments, even this Government, can be short of money and when I see an item, such as the proposed glass screen between the Public Gallery and the Deputies, I deplore such a decision.  It will cost money.  There may be some good reason for it, apart from the obvious one, but most of us here have been in other Parliaments in Europe and elsewhere and none of us have ever yet seen a screen between the Members and their constituents. Irish Parliamentarians are in no more danger than are their counterparts in Britain, France, Luxembourg or Strasbourg.  I doubt if a glass screen would provide all that protection.  In one European Parliament bundles of pamphlets were thrown on top of us but in five minutes the security men had removed the interruptors and the session went on smoothly.  If the Parliamentary Secretary can do anything to reverse this decision he will be doing a good day's work for the dignity of this Parliament.  The whole idea is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary dealt at length with the programme of new office building.  Civil servants in certain areas in the city are only too well aware of the non-beauty of Georgian houses when they are turned into commercial or Civil Service offices.  If Dublin Corporation were to apply the law rigidly on office standards the Government might well be prosecuted many times over.  I know one office which I consider a danger to those working in it.</P>
    <P>The programme mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary has been in progress for some years.  It went on apace under the last Government.  I support Deputy Brugha in his suggestion that the Government should provide decent office accommodation and not leave it to private enterprise to reap the financial rewards it does. I am realistic enough to appreciate that the Government may not be able to raise the money at once, but it might be possible to approach these developers and have a kind of hire purchase arrangement.  The Government should set the headline in providing the best possible accommodation for the workers.  Bearing in mind <Col N="1177" /> that it is the people who will pay for these office blocks, we should formulate some policy which would give some return to the State eventually. One national sporting organisation, of which the Parliamentary Secretary is a member, has recently commenced office block development. Perhaps the Government could reach some agreement with that body whereby the Government could rent the accommodation for a period of ten, 12 or 15 years with an option of outright purchase at the end of the period.  Possibly that suggestion could be knocked on the head by some financial wizard.  We will have to spend many millions of pounds on the provision of proper accommodation for our civil servants.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on the work done on Scoil Éanna.  I know this had been going on in his predecessor's time.  If we believe in anything of the past Scoil Éanna, where Pearse lived and taught should be preserved.  The people of Dublin are very much aware of the worthiness of this project and would not begrudge any money spent on it.</P>
    <P>On another side of the city there is the Royal Hospital which I am told is in a very bad state of disrepair. It is very old&mdash;it was built during the Williamite Wars&mdash;but it should be preserved.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary could tell me whether the charter of the hospital has ever been changed.  Do we really own it?  There was some doubt about this some years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I can tell the Deputy that we do own that building.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear that.  I should like to congratulate the Office of Public Works too, on the building of schools, particularly those for handicapped children.  We can never spend enough money on this type of development.  The more the Parliamentary Secretary can expand the programme of school building the better we, on all sides of this House, will like it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brugha mentioned the Kennedy Memorial.  By a strange <Col N="1178" /> coincidence today is the tenth anniversary of President Kennedy's arrival in Dublin.  While we still have not got a worthwhile memorial to him I do not despair of our coming up with some solution, whether it will be a concert hall or something else.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will not get faint-hearted and drop the idea.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to Dún Laoghaire harbour.  I am glad to say that the Office of Public Works kept their word over the years in restoring the harbour to its former state before the new ferry terminal was erected there.  Dún Laoghaire harbour is a haven for yachtsmen and as we become more affluent more people will take up sailing and we will need more space for yachts.  Therefore, I am a little alarmed to hear that some change is to take place there and that a passage is to be provided for yachts.  I would fear for any yacht that would have to be taken down a passage into the sea there.  It is bad enough at the moment.  The Parliamentary Secretary might consider providing a special yacht haven outside the actual harbour itself by constructing a pier or wharf which would give shelter to yachts.  The yachts are safe enough there at present but there will be a huge expansion in this sport and the demand for space at Dún Laoghaire will grow and grow.</P>
    <P>In this historic city of ours the marking of houses where famous men lived is very often left to voluntary bodies and to the tourist organisations. Dublin, which can boast of Shaw, Sheridan and Wilde, not to mention our patriots, would be a wonderful place for the historian if we had all the historic houses properly marked.  The Office of Public Works could take over this work.  Dublin has had great men in literature, art and politics.  A special plaque could be designed to mark the various houses where these people lived.  We must preserve the memory of these men.  I know there is more important work to be done but the small matter of marking all the historic houses in Dublin would not cost much and it would arouse the interest of our visitors and, indeed, of our own people.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the erection of a new complex for the Courts of Justice <Col N="1179" /> is to be undertaken.  Anybody who has ever been in the children's court in Dublin Castle will realise the great need there is to provide proper accommodation for these youngsters, for their parents and, indeed, for the staff who have to deal with the problem of juvenile crime.  When will the building of this complex start?  Will it be in a year, two years or five years?  If it is a long-term plan I think we should provide a new setting for the children's court because despite the good work being done by the district justice, the Garda and the welfare officers the whole atmosphere down there is against them.  I suggest that the children's court should be taken out of Dublin Castle without any further delay and given some kind of adequate premises.</P>
    <P>I think it would take a much bigger Department than the Office of Public Works to deal with pollution but each Government Department has an interest in pollution, which is becoming such a frightful problem.  The Office of Public Works should be represented on any inter-departmental committee or any official or semi-official body set up to deal with this.  I should like to pay tribute to the staff of the Office of Public Works for the tremendous work they do in all parts of the country. One can see their interest and dedication in the preservation of national monuments and in their publications. Pollution will get worse until, perhaps, some day civilisation will be threatened by it.  The Office of Public Works, because of their record in the matter of the preservation of national monuments and their contribution to the maintenance of our national identity, should be given a leading role in the battle against pollution.</P>
    <P>Last week the Parliamentary Secretary was asked a question about St. Stephen's Green and he promised to visit it.  I hope to go there with him some day and if necessary to point out to him some of the inadequacies of that lovely park.  Last week he was asked to state the type of equipment provided there for children and he said that, in fact, the equipment was not being used fully.  The reason for this is that much of it is old-fashioned <Col N="1180" /> equipment and children nowadays, with their boundless energy, want a more challenging type of plaything, a more adventurous type of equipment. If we had more of this type of equipment in the park we would have less vandalism and fewer road accidents because when children get bored in a park such as this they run out on to the streets where the traffic is very heavy.  I should like to pay tribute to a predecessor of the Parliamentary Secretary's, the late Donogh O'Malley. About eight years ago I approached him about the question of equipment for St. Stephen's Green.  Without much delay he started the process of having this playground installed.  Under other Parliamentary Secretaries since then vast improvements have been made. In Dublin, with its 800,000 people&mdash; soon to be one million people&mdash;we cannot have too many parks like St. Stephen's Green but each of them must have the best we can provide in the way of amenities.  We should make sure the children have proper equipment in them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney spoke at length about the Phoenix Park.  While I do not have any views on whether horses should be allowed to use the park I think we should resist all attempts at any type of building taking place there.</P>
    <P>Various memorials have been suggested for the Phoenix Park but I feel that we should jealously guard every inch of green in that park.  We should not allow anything to take up even one square yard of this park.  We are fortunate in that the land alongside the Liffey is available for use as a golf course, and I believe that there is sufficient space there to provide other amenities.  In the interests of the Irish people the Members of this House should ensure that nothing is done to the Phoenix Park that would reduce the area available for use by the general public.</P>
    <P>Dublin was fortunate in having this park made available for the use of its citizens.  It was not given by a native government but every square yard should be jealously guarded.  It should go forth from this House that no incursion by builders on any part of this park will be tolerated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1181" /> The Estimate for the Office of Public Works is, in my view, one of the most interesting to come before the House because it covers everything from school buildings to archaeological excavations.  I should like to congratulate the Office of Public Works on the work it has carried out throughout the country, particularly in Dublin city.  In the Christchurch area very good work has been carried out by the Office of Public Works to preserve this city's links with the past.  This area has been described as &ldquo;the first Dublin&rdquo;.  It has links with the Norsemen, the Vikings, and later the Normans, all of whom contributed to our history.  It is a mark of our civilisation that in this age of commercialisation we can afford to stop, and think, and spend money on the excavations in order to produce more evidence of our history.</P>
    <P>Similar work has been carried out in other parts of this country and I believe that no criticism will be offered from this side of the House when archaeological excavation is proposed.  The need may arise for new schools and new hospitals but, I believe, we should get our priorities right.  With the leadership of the Office of Public Works we will effect a transformation in some aspects of our national being. We can ensure that our national monuments will not be forgotten or destroyed.</P>
    <P>In the building of schools, whether they are primary or schools for the handicapped we show that we are aware of the needs in this sphere.  In congratulating the Office of Public Works I should like to state that they have succeeded over the years in keeping a very fine and distinguished line of priorities.  I hope that they will continue to do so in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other Deputies who have spoken on this Estimate I should like to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his appointment.  We have a &ldquo;Government of the Pale&rdquo;, and for this reason I am delighted to see that such an important office as that of Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, has been given to a Deputy <Col N="1182" /> of the calibre of Deputy Kenny.  I have often felt that there is only one thing better than a Mayo man and that is the son of a Mayo man born in Dublin. Deputy Kenny, I have no doubt, will fulfil his role in the Department of Finance with the rare ability that he shows and has shown in the past in this House.</P>
      <P>While congratulating the Parliamentary Secretary on his appointment I should like to state that I was bitterly disappointed that in his speech, which covered a wide range of matters relating to the activities of the Office of Public Works, no mention was made of the constituency which I represent, North County Dublin.  In this area we have many problems which could be properly handled by the Office of Public Works.  For example, we have the Skerries harbour.  An extension was carried out to this harbour recently but this was only for fishery purposes.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the decision in 1972 to discuss the extensions of harbours in relation to fisheries under the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries but what I have in mind is a further extension of the harbour, not just for fishery purposes, but as a commercial proposition. I envisage something on the style of Greenore in County Louth.  Skerries is near to the Dublin Airport complex where we will have industry in the future.  It is adjacent to Balbriggan where there is a substantial amount of industry at the moment, and also close to Swords where there is quite an amount of industry.</P>
      <P>The improvement of this harbour would have the effect of reducing the traffic load and the delays involved in exporting from these towns.  Long delays are being experienced at present by firms in these towns due to the fact that they have to drive through the centre of Dublin.  An extension of the facilities at Skerries would greatly relieve this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to extend the survey at present in operation in Skerries harbour. On the 3rd May I received a reply from the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to the effect that the need for a further extension of the pier at Skerries harbour in the interests of the <Col N="1183" /> fishing industry is at present under active examination by his Department. I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to extend this examination to evaluate the possibility, and the worth, of an extension as a commercial, as well as a fishing port.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that the Parliamentary Secretary did not refer to the major coast erosion problems that we have in north county Dublin. My constituency is being eroded by nature and by the Department of Local Government in its revision of constituencies.  I have fear that between nature and the Department, and the Minister for Local Government, I may be left with just the town of Swords unless something is done about this coast erosion problem.</P>
    <P>For example we have the Portrane-Donabate peninsula, an area known as the &ldquo;Burrow&rdquo; in Portrane.  Over the last five or six years, winter after winter, this fine stretch of beach which is a natural amenity used by the people of the city and county of Dublin has been washed away.  On 2nd May I asked the Parliamentary Secretary a question in regard to this coast erosion.  The answer he gave was to the effect that no proposal under the Coast Protection Act, 1963, for coast protection works at the Burrow, Portrane, had been received from the local authority.</P>
    <P>This brings me again to the Parliamentary Secretary's speech where he mentioned the protracted procedure involved in having work carried out under the Coast Protection Act.  The Parliamentary Secretary said, as reported at column 16 of the Official Report for the 7th June, 1973:</P>
    <P>. . . Deputies will appreciate that the procedures required by the Act are protracted; while the design of a scheme involves prolonged and detailed study with a high degree of specialised engineering skill.  In the event the period between the initial application by a local authority and the commencement of work could run into some years. . . . </P>
    <P>Since the procedures are so protracted and the problem is so great, some alternative legislation must be brought <Col N="1184" /> in because the situation should not be allowed to continue whereby such fine beaches and land tracts are being washed away by the sea.  There is the same problem in Loughshinny in North County Dublin between Rush and Skerries.  There is a very fine coast there but one side of it which is of soft rock&mdash;it is shale more than rock&mdash;is being eroded rapidly.  In that case, there is the danger also of many houses slipping slowly into the sea but this danger is very real in respect of one house in particular.  Therefore, I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to take some steps to bring about a change in the legislation whereby there would be a speedier process in respect of coast erosion schemes.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the problem of the construction, repair and maintenance of Garda stations which are proper to the Office of Public Works. The Garda station at Lusk is in such condition that it is unchristian to ask men to work there.  In reply to a question from me on the 2nd May, the Minister for Justice informed me that he intends to increase the Garda strength there.  I might say that the increase is from one to two gardaí. There is a water supply through the site of the station but there is no connection from the pipes to the building.  This is a disgraceful situation and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to give it his attention.</P>
    <P>There are very bad conditions, too, in other Garda stations in my constituency. It is not fair to ask members of the Garda Síochána who are providing a tremendous service to the public to work in such conditions.</P>
    <P>In this context I should like to refer to the possibility of the purchase of land as sites for Garda stations in areas that are expanding but before such areas have expanded to any great extent.  What happens at present is that after a population explosion in an area, by which time all the available land has been utilised for the building of houses or is used by commercial concerns, the Department of Justice decide that a Garda station is necessary in such area.  Of course, at that stage the price of a site is prohibitive.  Why cannot the Department <Col N="1185" /> of Justice work in close liaison with the local authorities in this regard so as to ensure that in the development of new towns or in the expansion of existing ones, provision is always made for Garda stations? I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will comment on this problem when he is replying.</P>
    <P>What I say in regard to Garda stations could be said with, perhaps, more force, in relation to schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair would point out to the Deputy that the Parliamentary Secretary's Office is a functional office for other Departments.  The Departments must look after their own requirements; for instance the Department of Justice are responsible for Garda stations while the Department of Education are responsible for schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer to these questions in the context of the purchase of land for the buildings.  The Board of Works are responsible for the purchase of the land and for the construction of the buildings on behalf of the Departments.  If the sites for Garda stations were bought early enough, they would not cost nearly as much as they cost at a later stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Chair is pointing out to the Deputy is that the Office of Public Works act as agents for other Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that but I was speaking in the context of the Parliamentary Secretary's speech where he referred to Garda stations. He referred, too, to school sites and the construction of school buildings. Again, this is an agency situation whereby the Board of Works find themselves assisting the Department of Education.  In my constituency there are some major problems in regard to the provision of school sites and new school buildings.  In Swords where there is a rapidly expanding population and where there are large numbers of children the problem is very serious.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that all possible co-operation will be given <Col N="1186" /> by his office to the school manager there so that a school may be erected as quickly as possible.  I am aware that the Department of Education are assisting in this matter.  The same situation arises in respect of the acquisition of school sites as that which I have described in relation to sites for Garda stations.</P>
      <P>I turn now to the question of national monuments.  In this regard, the Parliamentary Secretary said, as reported at column 16 of the Official Report for the 7th June, 1973:</P>
      <P>. . . there is a growing emphasis on the proper presentation of monuments and this year it is planned to extend the guide information service during the tourist season . . .</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary went on to mention the various places to which this service would be extended but one place he did not mention was Dunsoghley Castle at St. Margarets. This is a very fine national monument. It is close to the main Ashbourne road as one goes from Finglas. More efforts should be made by the Department to provide car parking and a proper guide service as well as other amenities at this castle.  The round tower in Lusk has been a national monument for many years. The remarks I made with regard to Dunsoghley apply in this case also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Parliamentary Secretary a question about the money which was given by the Swords Progressive Preservation Society for the restoration and renovation of Swords Castle.  The reply I received stated that Swords Castle is in private ownership and is a national monument in the guardianship of the Commissioners of Public Works.  It also stated that under the National Monuments Act, the Commissioners have the duty of preserving and maintaining the castle but they are not empowered under the Act to spend money on restoration work.  I was told in the reply that a sum of £1,000 was contributed by the Swords Progressive Preservation Society towards the cost of restoring the chapel and the main entrance of the castle, but this amount fell far short of the total estimate for the proposed restoration works which was of the order of £15,000.  I was told <Col N="1187" /> that as the owner's consent was not at that time obtained no further action could be taken by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>With due respect to the Parliamentary Secretary, some action should be taken to secure the consent of the owner.  I am sure it is not beyond the powers of the Parliamentary Secretary to devise some scheme whereby this necessary work can be carried out.  The goodwill of the people in Swords has been demonstrated by the fact that £1,000 has been collected by the preservation society and has been presented to the Department.  This alone deserves a <i>quid pro quo</i> from the Department to see that some work is carried out.  I suggest that the Department could take some steps to get the owner's consent.</P>
    <P>Swords Castle has many connections with our history.  The proper name of the area is Swords Colmcille because of its connections with the saint and many of our great leaders passed through Swords.  We should not neglect to carry out the necessary restoration work I have outlined.  The contribution of £1,000 towards this work has been a unique gesture by the people of the area.  I will leave the matter with the Parliamentary Secretary and I know he will give it his attention.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the Grand Canal and the Royal Canal.  In the 1972 Development Plan for the county of Dublin which was adopted by the Dublin County Council reference was made to the canals. Under the heading &ldquo;Preservation and Conservation&rdquo; it is stated:</P>
    <P>Where in development areas such features exist including canals, these will be made use of to the maximum in developing the amenity content of the new urban areas.</P>
    <P>The Royal Canal is connected with Blanchardstown which is one of the rapidly expanding areas.  It can be regarded as a city within a county and it will have a population in the region of from 120,000 to 130,000.  I should like if the Parliamentary Secretary could assist the Dublin County Council in the development of this amenity for the Blanchardstown area.  Sections of the Grand Canal are used for boating <Col N="1188" /> and there is a connection to the midlands. I would ask that the Office of Public Works carry out development work on this amenity.</P>
    <P>The people in County Dublin are grateful to the Office of Public Works for the work they have done and for their declaration of some monuments as national monuments, including the church on St. Patrick's Island in Skerries.  There are many other valuable and historical buildings in County Dublin that are worthy of consideration by the Office of Public Works and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take them into account.</P>
    <P>For example, there is the Malahide Castle, gardens and church.  I do not want to go into this subject in detail but I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to keep it in mind.  There is also the Braemore Castle and church, the castle and church at Balrothery and Portrane Castle which has connections with Dean Swift.  This has been noted as a protected building under the County Dublin Development Plan but perhaps the section dealing with national monuments might take note of this also.</P>
    <P>In North County Dublin there are a number of Martello Towers.  There are towers at Portmarnock, Malahide, Donabate, Portrane, Rush, Skerries, Balbriggan <i>et cetera.</i> All of these have a place in our history.  They are landmarks in North County Dublin and I hope they will come under the attention of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention the round tower, the church tower and the Cross in Swords.  This is a special landmark in the County Dublin area and the Swords Progressive Preservation Society are carrying out guide services similar to those operated by the Office of Public Works on national monuments. They are doing an excellent job and they are preparing their own brochures but the Office of Public Works could do something to help them.</P>
    <P>One of the oldest fortifications in the country is at Dromonagh, in Loughshinny, an area between Rush and Skerries.  There are only embankments left but it is one of the old timber fortifications.  Now there is a Martello <Col N="1189" /> Tower at that spot.  Unless the Office of Public Works do something to protect these fortifications we will lose them for posterity.  We must protect all these monuments not only for ourselves but for our children.  What we fail to protect today will be in ruins tomorrow, will disappear the following day and will be forgotten afterwards.  It is essential that the Office of Public Works extend their responsibilities in this connection, with particular reference to the old fortification at Loughshinny.</P>
    <P>I could mention various other monuments, the gateway of Finrure Park, St. Catharine's Well, Martello Towers and so on, but I shall simply ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider those I have particularly mentioned.</P>
    <P>He mentioned the office buildings used by the Department.  I am delighted that it is his intention to continue the policy of construction rather than renting.  I always thought it very desirable that Civil Service offices should be housed in buildings owned by the State rather than leased from private enterprise which undoubtedly has a very important part to play in our national economy but Civil Service offices should primarily be provided by the Government.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the desirability of protecting Phoenix Park amenities and the undesirability of having any buildings on it.  Nobody wants to see more buildings here.  The park is being used at present to a great extent by various riding schools situated on its outskirts.  It is right that a large area such as the park should be used for this recreation which is growing in popularity in the Dublin area&mdash;with one proviso.  At present the horses are wandering throughout the whole park, leaving hoof-marks in football grounds and so on, and if the ground is soft these grounds can be destroyed.  I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary consider the provision of a horsetrack such as, for example, exists in Hyde Park, London, to which horses could be restricted.  It could be constructed in sand as in Hyde Park or in peat moss or in one of many different materials.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to know that the <Col N="1190" /> public golf course there is going ahead.  Golf has become one of the major recreations of Dublin people whether the full game or the pitchand-putt variety for which courses are now dotted all around the city. We should do all in our power to promote golf.  Aware of this need, we in Dublin County Council purchased Corballis Golf Links and developed it as a public course.  It has the disadvantage of being a bit away from the centre of the city.  The new public golf course will have the advantage of being central.  From our experience in County Dublin I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary the desirability of having proper club facilities.  It is no use having only shower facilities and changing rooms; the normal facilities associated with the normal golf club should be available at public courses.  It is necessary to have a fulltime steward, cooks and so on, so that people can get meals after a game.  Golf is not just a game for which one goes in and changes, then plays 18 holes, changes, showers and goes home; there are social elements involved.  Those using public golf courses are entitled to the same facilities as those using a private golf course.  The Parliamentary Secretary should consider having normal facilities such as bar, restaurant and full professional services and professional shop.  I am sure there are many professionals who would be willing to take on stewarding at a public golf course.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ruairí Brugha mentioned the concert hall and, unless I misinterpreted him, said he was not in favour of the project.  As a capital city I think we should have a concert hall and not in the distant future but very soon.  The cultural life of any city without a concert hall is sadly lacking.  It is an essential amenity.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary was not here at the beginning and I am very grateful to him for coming in and sitting there all afternoon listening. In his absence I complimented him on his appointment.  I referred to the fact that as this is the Government of the Pale I was delighted to see at least one man of the west <Col N="1191" /> there.  I also observed that there was probably only one better thing than a man from Mayo and that was the son of a man from Mayo, born in County Dublin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="StephenCoughlan" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to congratulate our new Parliamentary Secretary on his bold and courageous approach to his new office.  He has increased the Estimate by £4 million and not one hour too soon.  We have spent many a day trying to impress on the Department the urgency of works that we feel are so important to our own areas and if an attempt were made to assess the total amount to be provided for them it would be an astronomical figure.  We have found that in the allocation of money for this Department, Dublin and the Dublin area have always got priority particularly as regards provision of office blocks, renting of offices and other things of secondary importance when we consider what we would like to see preserved, our national way of life and traditional heritage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must refer, first of all, to the conditions of workers employed with, as we like to call it down the country, the Board of Works.  There are men in my area who have been employed by the Board of Works for ten years and more, and they are still employed on a temporary basis.  I cannot see why any man with such a service should not be employed on a permanent basis.  I cannot understand the reasoning behind this.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to apply himself to the working conditions of the people in his Office.  If you have not contentment and security of employment how will you get good results?  It is absolutely impossible. The first step the Parliamentary Secretary should take as a young, able, courageous and energetic man is the provision of decent and permanent employment for these workers.  That is not the position, unfortunately.  I do not know why.  I would impress on the Parliamentary Secretary that, if he wants to get a job well done, he must make conditions of employment happy and also give workers security and pensionable employment.  If he <Col N="1192" /> does that, the results from his Department will be much better.</P>
    <P>I want to congratulate him again. I am not a man who congratulates people too often; the reverse is the case.  For some 15 or 20 years we in Limerick have been advocating a development which we know will be remunerative, and will repay whatever investment is made in it.  We have been continually agitating down the years for the development of the historic Castle of King John.  Developments have been made within our region at Bunratty and Knappogue. These investments have proved sound, not alone financially but also as a tourist attraction.  The banquets, which give the historical background of our nation, presented by the players through pageants and ballads, have greatly impressed visitors from England, the Continent and America. When we started at Bunratty we had one session.  Now we have three or four sessions a day The same applies at Knappogue which is six or seven miles further inland in County Clare. We have been advocating and agitating for a similar development within the city of Limerick in the Castle of King John.</P>
    <P>Something is about to be done.  I am at a loss to find out what exactly will be done because there is a big development involved in this area. For some unknown reason, some 30 or 35 years ago, somebody got the brainwave that we should build houses within the confines and in the courtyard of this castle.  Some 20 houses were built by Limerick Corporation within the bounds of this castle. These houses will have to be demolished if the scheme, the courtyard, and the banqueting hall which we have in mind are to be developed.  If we are to do a job we had better do a good one.</P>
    <P>Has the Parliamentary Secretary made arrangements with the Department of Local Government on this issue?  We have been fighting with that Department for some ten years about the replacement of these houses which were built 30 or 35 years ago and are on fixed rents.  We have made provision.  We have sites ready within 200 yards of the castle for the <Col N="1193" /> erection of houses, our problem is a renting problem.  The Department insist that if any changes are to be made these people who are to be removed will have to pay a differential rent.  There our big problem lies.  I would suggest respectfully to the Parliamentary Secretary that he should get in touch immediately with the Department of Local Government. Otherwise he will run headlong into a storm that he might not weather.</P>
    <P>We have tried it unsuccessfully as a local authority.  The then Minister for Local Government was the personification of arrogance.  I hope the present Minister will be sympathetic and will understand the problem and with the help of his Department he will see things our way. Most of the people living within the precincts of the castle are old.  Some are widows, whose rents are small and whose incomes are small.  We must make some provision for them in their old age.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to apply himself immediately to this problem if we are to go ahead with the development of King John's Castle.</P>
    <P>I want to assure him that with the development of this castle as a tourist attraction the investment made in it will be re-paid in a shorter time than was the case either in Bunratty or Knappogue.  I know the people who are interested in it.  The Shannon Development Company are interested in it.  We, as members of Limerick Corporation, are interested in it, and we are prepared to go as far as a local authority can go, because we are convinced that we are backing a winner. It will be a greater winner and a winner by a far greater distance than either Bunratty or Knappogue.  No time should be lost.</P>
    <P>At the moment the castle is falling into disrepair.  Nobody is caretaking the building.  Holes are being bored through the walls.  Away back in 1651 and 1691 it withstood the battles that were waged in Limerick but at present, through vandalism and through neglect by the Board of Works the castle is in disrepair.  The old cannons around the sides of the walls are thrown off their stands on to the ground.  There is no <Col N="1194" /> meeting of the Limerick City Council at which some complaint is not made in regard to this historical monument.</P>
    <P>I should like to know what money is being provided for King John's Castle.  If a proper reconstruction job is to be done it will cost a great deal of money.  The Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor sent some engineers and advisers down to the committee which we have formed in Limerick, from the Shannon Development Committee and certain members from the Limerick City Corporation and the Limerick County Council.  We have had discussions with officials of the Board of Works and have kept them up to date, but for some unknown reason we have not met now for well over 12 months.  The whole thing seems to have fallen through.  As far as I know, the Shannon Development Company, who were very interested at the time, pulled out.  It seems that some people were dragging their heels.  We blamed the Parliamentary Secretary.  The Shannon Development Company are trying to blame us, the members of the Limerick Corporation.  I do not know where the fault lies, but this whole matter has been dormant now for nearly two years. I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary has re-opened the matter, and I want to put him on the right road in regard to this development.  It is something that is dear to us all.  It is of greater historical significance than Kilkenny or any of the other castles that have been developed.  The Parliamentary Secretary's job in this connection will not be an easy one, but I want to assure him that he will get the full co-operation of Limerick Corporation.  We shall surmount any difficulties that arise, but we will have to get the co-operation of the Department of Local Government on this issue.</P>
    <P>I am also glad the Parliamentary Secretary is setting up an agricultural regional research department in Limerick.  I did suggest to the previous Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries that we had an ideal building within two miles of Limerick with over 100 acres of land ready for any development the Minister wished to undertake in regard to this research work.  I refer to the Jesuit College at Mungret which <Col N="1195" /> is 104 years old this year.  At the end of 1975 it will cease to be an educational institute.  The Jesuits announced that their inter-cert students of last year, will continue their studies this year, and when they finish their leaving certificate next year, Mungret College will be closed down.</P>
    <P>This building is in excellent condition. It is centrally heated.  It has a heated indoor swimming pool.  The laboratories and classrooms are there. At the moment there is accommodation for 130 to 150 boarders.  This is an ideal site for any kind of research work, and I would suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary have discussions with the Jesuit Order and prevent what I am afraid will happen, speculative builders coming in and putting up masses of concrete around this historic building which was originally built as a university.  I made representations to the previous Minister, Deputy J. Gibbons, with a view to getting an agricultural institute established there, but he explained to me that the demand was not there. However, it should be preserved for what it is.  First of all, somebody should be sent down to inspect the building which, as I say, is in first-class condition.  The farm side of it, which was there for the provision of milk and vegetables, has also been kept up to date.  I am giving my information about this place to the Parliamentary Secretary with the best of intentions, and I hope he will pursue the matter and see that whatever can be done is done.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary also states that he is setting up a headquarters in Limerick for his Office. Again, I should like to know where these headquarters are to be situated. What is in Limerick at present is only a ramshackle building.  It is miserable, in bad repair and completely inadequate for the work the office is doing.  Their stores are scattered all over Limerick.  You will find school desks in one building and various other equipment in other buildings. You will find their machines, vans and lorries scattered everywhere. The whole office is so scattered around <Col N="1196" /> Limerick that one would not know where to go to find what one wants. This central depot, which is to provide for the needs of the Limerick region, could be set up within the confines of Mungret College.</P>
    <P>When I speak on the different Estimates I particularise rather than generalise because I want to put my own house in order first.</P>
    <P>I impress on the Parliamentary Secretary to develop our canals.  Have his Department realised the importance of sailing over the last five to ten years?  We should realise that most people who want relaxation and pleasure nowadays get away from the roads as much as possible.  They take to our lakes as they are doing all over the Continent of Europe.  The Parliamentary Secretary should look at what is happening in the Scandinavian countries and the Rhine Valley.  Most of us who have visited those places have seen the importance of their waterways.</P>
    <P>What are we doing here?  Our canals are overgrown and are not being used to the extent they should. I know people in Dublin who go away for weekends from Friday morning to Monday morning who tow their yachts from Dublin to Killaloe and Portumna to go sailing on Lough Derg.  If our canals were cleaned they would sail on them to the Shannon. When I was very young there was great activity on the canals and rivers in my county.  Many people travelled from Dublin by canal.  Their boats were horse drawn, with four horses changing every ten miles.  The position has now changed to the detriment of the tourist trade.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works should carry out a survey of the canals. They should have them cleaned and the banks maintained.  If that is done, a great tourist attraction will be provided. At Question Time today there was a question in regard to the boat which travelled from Killaloe to Portumna and around Lough Derg.  It was hard to get standing room on that at one time.  Perhaps it ceased to be an attraction.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to mention <Col N="1197" /> is the facility which is threatened to be withdrawn from the workers on the Bourn Vincent estate at Killarney. Those workers received supplies of milk free from the estate.  They had this concession over a long period. This milk was just cooled and then given to them.  We hear now that they are to be deprived of this concession. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to remember that if we want work well done we must have good relations with workers.  We must have a good <i>esprit de corps.</i></P>

      <P>We had good health before we ever heard of Louis Pasteur.  We can cool the milk and give it to those workers.  I know there has been dissention about the withdrawal of this concession.  I hope there will not be any agitation and I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary, with his diplomatic approach, will be able &ldquo;to pasteurise&rdquo; the situation and allow those workers this concession.</P>
      <P>I wish the Parliamentary Secretary luck in his new office.  I hope he will attend to his correspondence with more alacrity than he has been doing as far as I am concerned.  I hope he will see many developments taking place during his time in office, which I know will be at least three or four years.  I hope it will be for a lot longer after we go to the hustings again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating the Parliamentary Secretary on his appointment.  As a young boy growing up in Mayo, he was one of my idols on the football field. Today I may have a lot more white hair than he has but like other speakers who have spoken on this Estimate I congratulate him and wish him success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary's predecessor, Deputy Lemass.  Speaking for my county, where we have a good deal of marine works, I can say Deputy Lemass set a very high record in the <Col N="1198" /> amount of money which was spent in the past few years.  He was responsible for initiating schemes which the present Parliamentary Secretary will have the privilege of completing. Various grants in the region of £2¼ million have been spent on marine works in Mayo in the past few years and it is something for which we are grateful to Deputy Lemass.</P>
    <P>I am happy to see that the Land Commission buildings are coming to Castlebar.  At the same time, it is a bit sad that Mícheál Ó Moráin, who represented west Mayo for so long and worked so hard to have these buildings in Castlebar, is not in the House.  However, we have some consolation in the fact that we have a Castlebar man to complete the job.</P>
    <P>I am glad that there are some marine works of major importance listed for Mayo.  One is the pier at Clare Island.  This was sadly needed in the area.  I know there is pressure from the people of the area to have a further extension carried out there. This is only natural because up to now there were no proper harbour facilities for boats, and because this major scheme is now being carried out a number of young people will be encouraged to look for boats and go into the fishing industry on a larger scale.  I know the Parliamentary Secretary is bound by the recommendations of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries but I hope he will use his influence with that Minister to ensure that the extra extensions being asked for will be forthcoming.</P>
    <P>We are glad that a major harbour at Ballyglass now seems a likelihood. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take the long term view and not build merely something which will be adequate for a number of boats.  I can see this major harbour at Ballyglass becoming one of the most important in the country.  At the moment many of the Killybegs fleet fish off the coast of north Mayo and sometimes it is necessary for them to steam for seven or eight hours to get to the fishing grounds.  They have to take the same length of time to get back to harbour, and when this major harbour is provided at Ballyglass it <Col N="1199" /> will not be necessary for them to waste so much time getting to and coming from the fishing grounds. Ballyglass will then become a really important harbour not alone for north Mayo but for the west coast.  For that reason I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to ensure that an adequate harbour is built from the long term point of view.</P>
    <P>In the Estimate reference is made to improving harbour facilities at Boffin Island.  Indeed, the question of the islands in general and their facilities is something the Parliamentary Secretary should look into because if the people there have not proper harbour facilities it means they are tied down, that they cannot come to the nearest village to shop.  They have to use small open boats.  I, therefore, ask the Parliamentary Secretary to take a look at the facilities in Inishturk and the other islands off the Mayo coast.</P>
    <P>One of the problems in regard to the islands off the Mayo coast is the fact that, for some reason or other, the Irish language is no longer spoken on them.  This means they cannot avail of grants from Roinn na Gaeltachta which are readily available to islands that are fíor-Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect is tourism. I should like to relate this also to the question of harbour facilities in the islands.  There are many people living in cities who now like to enjoy the quietness and peace they find in the islands like Clare Island, Inishturk and Inishboffin.  There are many tourists who decide to take their own boats and use them while on holidays.  One of the snags they encounter is that there are no slips available where they can launch boats easily.  Bord Fáilte and Roinn na Gaeltachta, as well as other Government agencies, should have liaison with the Office of Public Works so that money could be provided for this type of facility.  The county councils could also be included in this work.</P>
    <P>As one who has witnessed some works carried out by the Office of Public Works in our area, I am glad to see that the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="1200" /> has made provision in his Estimate for new machinery.  It is past time that this should have happened.  I have seen machines used for dredging which, in my opinion, were obsolete. The Office of Public Works will get a better return for their money by providing suitable machinery.  I remember an American who was on holidays in a certain part of Ireland watching one of these machines at work.  The bucket went down and came up again, but all it seemed to be taking up was water.  At last the American spoke to one of the local people and asked what was going on. The answer he got was: &ldquo;They are washing the buckets&rdquo;.  This explains the necessity for having better machinery made available to the Office of Public Works in order that they may do a better job.</P>
    <P>I should like to agree with Deputy McMahon, who spoke about the condition of public buildings.  He mentioned the state of the buildings in the vicinity of the Dáil and the Dáil itself. I remarked on this myself before this Estimate came before the House.  I agree entirely that it is time this beautiful building, which is a showpiece to our own people and to visitors from many parts of the world, should be improved.  We see moss growing in certain places.</P>
    <P>Many speakers have referred to the provision of Garda barracks and the state of some of the barracks.  One or two barracks in our area are in a bad way.  If the Garda staff were to call in the public health authorities, I am sure some of these buildings would be condemned.  This state of affairs should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see that our schools have improved a good deal over the last few years.  Water, sewerage and facilities of that nature which were neglected for so long have now been provided.  I have a complaint about the way certain matters are dealt with and about the fact that the engineering staff of the Office of Public Works do not seem to be able to cope with all the extra demands made on them.  The same number of people as were employed ten years ago <Col N="1201" /> are now asked to carry out ten times the amount of work which they had to do previously.  The Parliamentary Secretary should have a good look at the position and try to help the engineering staff who are doing a good job but who, unfortunately, cannot find time to cope with all the demands made on them.</P>
    <P>I had a Parliamentary Question down to the Minister for Education with regard to the building of a school at Newport, County Mayo.  I am disappointed to find it seems this school is still a long way away.  This may not be the fault of the Office of Public Works but possibly with more men in the field they could exercise enough pressure to have works of this kind commenced.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Ceart go leor.  With regard to the design of new schools, <Col N="1202" /> while they may be much brighter and much easier to work in, and while the children may have more room and more facilities, I think the outer design at least indicates a lack of imagination. We have vivid reds and blues in exterior decoration.  Very often they are not at all in keeping with the other buildings in the area.  The architects in the Board of Works should try to ensure that these buildings fit in in the local environment.</P>
      <P>I am happy to note the Parliamentary Secretary has made provision for the building of more schools for the mentally retarded.  In Mayo we have a very active committee which is doing great work in providing funds and buildings and in taking care of mentally retarded children.  So far their efforts have been confined to dealing with mildly mentally handicapped children.  Since coming into public life I have been amazed to find so many severely handicapped children who find it impossible to get into any institutions. We have, of course, to plan within the moneys available to us but I would hope that the Parliamentary Secretary would press on as quickly as possible with building for these children so that parents who have the misfortune of having to look after these children will get all the help they need.</P>
      <P>A very important matter where schools are concerned is the provision of ample play space for the children.  It is a shame to see fine schools being erected and then discover that the children have no space in which to exercise.  I remember a built-up area here in Dublin.  There was only one patch of green left on which the boys could play hurling or football.  Within a few short years that last remaining space was taken over as a site for a hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of Public Works should also consider the provision of swimming pools.  I am not advocating any grandiose scheme.  Year after year in my area I see families coming home from Britain.  The children are the children of people who emigrated to Birmingham, Manchester, London and elsewhere.  It is pathetic to see our own children with not the remotest idea of how to enter the water <Col N="1203" /> or make an attempt at swimming while the children reared in London, Manchester and Birmingham are excellent swimmers and they take out the native children to teach them how to swim.  I do not think we are demanding too much in this day and age in asking for the provision of swimming pools, centrally cited, to which the children could be brought and taught how to swim.  The new curriculum gives a good deal of scope to teachers and it should be possible to arrange transport to some central point at which this kind of facility would be provided for the children.</P>
    <P>With regard to coast erosion, I notice Mayo is not included in any of the proposed schemes.  I do not blame the Parliamentary Secretary for this.  Only the other day in this House I learned that these schemes have first to be taken up at county council level and passed on from there to the Parliamentary Secretary's office before a grant is made available. The engineering staff, who are often under pressure from local councillors on this very important matter, must know quite well what the position is and I am very disappointed that we, as public representatives, do not seem to be getting the full support of our engineering staff in dealing with this very important subject.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies have stressed the importance of drainage.  I agree that some intermediate schemes between the major arterial drainage schemes and the local improvement schemes are very necessary.  In the past two years, because of the importance of drainage to the farmers, we have allocated 25 per cent of our local improvement scheme fund for drainage. That can cover only a very small proportion of the demands we have for drainage.  There are many small rivers and many areas close to the sea where major grants are necessary in order to carry out any kind of decent job and our local improvements schemes are wholly inadequate.  The Parliamentary Secretary should take a long look at this and try to have more money made available for this very important work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1204" /> Because of the increased prices for cattle and so on a greater number of people are now taking an interest in land.  Because so much can now be done with machinery there are schemes and jobs which could not be attempted a number of years ago with a pick and shovel which can now be undertaken.  In this way greater areas of land can be improved and people, especially in the west of Ireland, can make additional acres available to themselves.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider this very important question.  He is probably well aware of the situation and I would ask him to do his utmost to have something done about it.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned that he intends to make money available to improve facilities at Dún Laoghaire for people coming on holiday with their cars.  There is hardly any need for me to dwell on the importance of tourism to our economy.  Any efforts that can be made to improve facilities are very welcome.  Our own emigrants are the best tourists and they are always very happy to see improvements which will make it easier for them to take their families to Ireland. This is very welcome.</P>

      <P>I should like to wish the Parliamentary Secretary every success, happiness and health during his period of office which I hope will be a long one.  I hope he will see many of the items he has mentioned here reach successful fruition.  I suppose the one nearest and dearest to his heart would be the opening of the new offices in Castlebar for the Department of Lands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important Estimate.  The Office of Public Works deal with national monuments, the different Government Departments, restoration of buildings and many other things. One item which I hope the Parliamentary <Col N="1205" /> Secretary will consider seriously is the inter-departmental report on pollution.  If the Ceann Comhairle will allow me I hope to elaborate on this.  This office deal with many matters that are part of our heritage, part of our present and part of our future. The inter-departmental report has just been sent to local authorities; it is being considered by them and when it comes back it will be acted on.  I should like to see the Parliamentary Secretary setting up a section in the Office of Public Works to begin considering straight away this problem as it affects his Department.  This matter must be tackled seriously by each Department.  The Office of Public Works are doing much in regard to bays, canals, piers, the coastline and so on but I do not believe they have sufficient power to prevent people spoiling our lakes, canals and rivers.  It is all very well to restore monuments and extend piers but something very significant will have to be done and some power given to the Office of Public Works to prevent pollution or we will have a very serious situation.  Local authorities have a certain amount of power in regard to people polluting rivers.  The Inland Fisheries Trust also have certain powers.  I am not certain what powers the Office of Public Works have but I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consult with his top officials to consider this.  This is important.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works provide buildings.  There was a reference in the Parliamentary Secretary's speech to minor works, urgent and unforeseen works, <i>et cetera.</i> Perhaps in the future the Parliamentary Secretary will consider the erection of buildings to facilitate the Government Departments once the inter-Departmental report has been studied.</P>
    <P>Every time I endeavoured to raise the problem of pollution I was informed that I was questioning the wrong Minister.  I always run into difficulties in this regard.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is well aware that he should <Col N="1206" /> not advocate legislation on an Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not advocating legislation although I feel some is necessary.  The fact that there is an increase of £3,886,000 in the Estimate is an indication that the Government recognise the importance of the Office of Public Works.  Having studied the proposals in this Estimate I am satisfied that the money allocated will be spent in the best possible manner.</P>
      <P>On the question of drainage, I should like to point out that now that we have entered the EEC it is important that every acre of land is utilised to its maximum potential. Thousands of acres of land, through bad drainage, are non-productive.  A lot of the land that is flooded is unsafe for cattle because of the danger of cattle contacting diseases.  There is a great need for the introduction of a major drainage drive in this country. I have been in communication with the Parliamentary Secretary in regard to a number of drainage problems in my constituency and I feel sure that he will attend to them. Every constituency has drainage problems.</P>
      <P>The amount of money at the disposal of the Parliamentary Secretary is not adequate to carry out any major drainage works.  The Parliamentary Secretary should set aside a sum in the region of £2 million annually for the purpose of carrying out major drainage schemes.  Drainage work, in the long run, would be beneficial to the farming community and the country as a whole.  Such work would also help to relieve the unemployment situation, particularly in rural areas.</P>
      <P>A number of farmers in my area are handicapped by the flooding of the river between Kilcormac and Birr. Thousands of acres of land are affected by this river and I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to instruct his officials to survey this river with a view to having a drainage scheme carried out on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter of importance in my area is the maintenance of the <Col N="1207" /> canals.  In the midland counties the canals are important from the tourist point of view.  These counties are favoured by their fishing and shooting attractions but in recent times boating has become very popular, not alone with the tourists but also with the local people.  The canals in this country are in a bad state of disrepair. They have been allowed to become overgrown over the years.  If they were cleaned, and properly maintained, they would be a great tourist attraction and a big asset to the midland counties.</P>
    <P>The canals running through Offaly and Laois should be cleaned.  It is possible for boating enthusiasts to use portion of these canals but the cleaning and the proper maintenance of them would mean that tourists would avail of the boating facilities in greater numbers.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that, for the year 1973-74, £350,000 has been allocated for the erection of new Garda stations while a sum of £65,000 is being allocated for the improvement of existing stations.  The Garda at Portlaoise are anxious that a new station be provided for them.  Therefore, I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will request his officials to make a study of the situation there in this regard.  If it is not possible to provide a new station, a major improvement scheme should be undertaken in respect of the existing one.  Portlaoise is a big town and the Garda force there includes a chief superintendent, a superintendent and a large number of gardaí.</P>
    <P>I am pleased, also, that accommodation is being provided for female clerical assistants at Garda stations.  These girls will undertake much of the clerical work that has had to be done by Garda personnel up to now.</P>
    <P>Item 50 of the Estimate refers to housing for married members of the Garda Síochána.  I am disappointed with the sum being provided because £7,000 could not be of much help in this regard.  This is a very important matter because when a married man is transferred from one area to another he usually has great difficulty in acquiring a house in the new area.  This may be in a very big town where <Col N="1208" /> housing is very costly.  Therefore, he cannot afford to purchase a home and, consequently, his wife and children may have to remain in the old area for some time.  I am glad to be able to say that in Birr there are a number of houses for married gardaí.</P>
    <P>Efforts should be made, too, to ensure that our courthouse buildings are kept up to a standard that is fitting for places in which justice is administered. The courthouse at Ferbane is urgently in need of repair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take it up with the local authority and I thank the Chair for his assistance.  I am glad to note that more money is being spent on the Garda Training Centre at Templemore.  This is a very important area of the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>It is pleasing, too, to note that the very large sum of £5 million is being allocated for the provision and improvement of national schools.  Many of the national schools that I have had occasion to visit are in very good condition.  Vocational educational committees have been concentrating a lot on prefabricated buildings.  This may not be such a good idea.  It is preferable that permanent structures be erected.  National schools are very important in the context of the early education of our young boys and girls and, therefore, it is essential that they be adequate in every respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before concluding I should like to mention Clonmacnoise, which is one of the most important tourist attractions in Offaly and which is visited by many people from at home and abroad each year.  It is a very interesting area in which there are a number of round towers, crosses, early gravestones and holy wells.  Some money has been spent on the centre but there is need for more improvements. I do not see any mention of any allocation for it in the current Estimate. I know that, certainly up to ten days ago, there were no public toilets at the centre and I expect that is still the position.  Bus loads of visitors arrive there daily from all over <Col N="1209" /> the world so I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will ensure that proper facilities are provided there.  I do not know whether this is the responsibility of the local authority but I can only hope that whoever is responsible will ensure that the matter is rectified as soon as possible.  It is important that the Board of Works give constant attention to this whole area of Clonmacnoise because of its importance in terms of tourism.</P>
    <P>When speaking of drainage earlier I forgot to mention the Ballyfinboy river which rises in Moneygall and flows across towards the Shannon near Borrisokane.  I hope that this river will be drained also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancisTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all pleased to congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his well-deserved promotion to the Front Bench and we express the hope that his term of office will be a fruitful one.  May we also express the hope that the western counties, which up to now have not benefited to the extent we would have wished, might have the advantage of the Parliamentary Secretary's generosity. Of course, drainage is a major problem in the western area. Flooding causes much anxiety to those affected by it.  For many years I have been advocating a major drainage scheme for one of the biggest rivers in County Clare.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the cost benefit study has been used since the Parliamentary Secretary took up his appointment. I would ask him to remember that Ennis, through which flows the river Fergus, is expanding economically, has great industrial potential and has a growing population.  I am sure the drainage of the Fergus will be high on the priority list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one considers the expenditure devoted to other areas, the benefits to Clare have been comparatively few.  I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to consider the inclusion in his Estimate next year of some measure to replace the local authorities works scheme which was scrapped by the previous Government.  This gave many benefits to people but now they are deprived of them.  When the scheme <Col N="1210" /> was in operation the county councils did excellent work and the scrapping of the scheme has been referred to by many local authority representatives throughout the country.  It would be worthwhile if the Parliamentary Secretary would re-introduce a similar scheme which would do the unfinished work that was commenced during the term of office of the previous interparty Government.</P>
    <P>There has been comment on the expenditure of money on schools.  Many rural schools have been closed and the pupils have been transferred to larger centres.  However, there appears to be undue delay in erecting and designing the necessary accommodation for national school children.  In this connection I refer to a school at Kilkee, County Clare.  Because of the closure of the national school the children have been accommodated in a very small room.  I would ask the Office of Public Works to try to finish the work before next September when the school reopens. Before any school is closed the authorities should ensure that proper accommodation is available for the children.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to see that the Office of Public Works have undertaken to purchase the necessary sites for the erection of Garda stations and also that provision is made for the improvement of existing stations.  During the years the number of derelict buildings, particularly Garda stations, has increased considerably.  One wonders why members of the Garda Síochána or the Defence Forces are asked to live in premises to which the public would strongly object.  In the past 30 years several Garda stations have been classified as unfit for habitation but the Garda are obliged to live in these premises.</P>
    <P>Similarly, members of the Defence Forces have to live in unsuitable premises. The rate of progress in renovating Garda stations and premises occupied by the Defence Forces has been too slow.  Frequently people wonder why the rate of intake to the Army has not been as high as we would wish; one of the reasons is that the accommodation is not up to a desirable standard.  I would ask the <Col N="1211" /> Office of Public Works to consider these matters.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is considering the question of the erection of premises for State offices.  I would ask him to consider siting these buildings in the western counties which have not yet benefited by the decentralisation all of us consider necessary.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should consider the matter of improving facilities at harbours.  In some areas the Office of Public Works should erect winches and do some dredging work.  In this connection I refer to Liscannor where there is good deepsea fishing.  The Office of Public Works should instal a winch in this area and carry out some improvements. These have been requested by the boat-owners.</P>
    <P>Some thought should be given to archaeological excavations of forts throughout the country.  In Clare there are several such forts but they appear to be forgotten.  Excavation work on these ancient forts would be valuable and this work should be undertaken.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>At about 11.30 a.m. I put down a Private Notice Question to ask the Minister for Labour if he would intervene at once with a view to settling the dispute between Aer Rianta and the airport security force at Shannon in view of the enormous losses being incurred by the continued closure of the airport.  Unfortunately there was error, apparently made by the General Office, and the question was filed as an ordinary one rather than a Private Notice Question and by the time it was realised that it was a Private Notice Question the Department of Labour did not have time to prepare a reply.  For that <Col N="1212" /> reason I gave notice of my intention to raise the matter tonight and I am obliged to you for allowing a debate on it because unfortunately the matter is extremely serious.</P>
      <P>We now have a situation in which Shannon Airport has been closed since last Friday.  The latest I heard of the matter tonight was that there did not seem to be any further developments in regard to settling the dispute which has closed the airport, other than an agreement earlier today to allow planes bringing a pilgrimage from Limerick to Lourdes and back to use the airport.  Of course, I am glad that has happened but that involves only a few planes and the airport is closed to all other traffic and, if things remain as they are, may continue closed indefinitely.</P>
      <P>We are now towards the end of June at the peak of the eastbound traffic across the Atlantic and the number of flights which would normally be expected at Shannon at this time could be as many as 12 a day, all of which, one might expect, would be full or nearly full.  The number of passengers, therefore, unable to land at Shannon at present is considerable.</P>
      <P>This is no ordinary strike with the normal consequences of a normal strike; this closes down the most important economic unit in the West of Ireland.  The consequences of allowing this situation to continue would be disastrous not only for the 7,000 people working at Shannon but for the whole mid-West region and the West of Ireland.  That is why I am so concerned about it that I have asked the Minister for Labour if he can intervene. I do not mean that he should intervene personally but through the various channels and officials at his disposal to see if anything can be done to bring this most unhappy situation to a speedy conclusion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know it is not customary for the Minister for Labour, or Ministers generally, to intervene in a dispute but I think the Minister for Labour and the Government in general should, because of the appalling consequences of this dispute, use every means open to them to try to have the dispute concluded at a very early date.  I do <Col N="1213" /> not mean the next few days: this matter is so important that even hours count significantly.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go into the merits or demerits of the dispute or into the details of it.  I am not fully familiar with these details and do not want to make any judgment in regard to it. Deputy Barrett who will follow is more conversant with the details of the matter and will deal with them but I want to avail of the opportunity to point out to the Minister for Transport and Power, who is here, the need to ask his colleague the Minister for Labour who is not here, and the Government in general, to take without any delay any possible steps to resolve this situation.  The Government would be in error if they regarded this as an ordinary strike.  It is not: the consequences of it are enormous.  In one of today's newspapers I read that the loss to Aer Rianta alone is calculated at £19,000 a day, being £3,000 in landing fees and £16,000 in the duty free shop. I am sure these figures are accurate but, great as they are, they represent only a small fraction of the losses being daily incurred at Shannon now.</P>
    <P>Everybody there is, in fact, out of work; there is really no work to be done there.  I presume most of the workers are still being paid but if this dispute goes on longer than another day or two I cannot see them being paid any further.  Presumably they will all get protective notice very shortly.  The workers at the airport itself are not the only ones affected; the many thousands working in the industrial estate at Shannon must inevitably be involved because the figures given by the Shannon Free Airport Development Company regarding the amount of air freight which is generated by the industrial estate show that a very high proportion of both incoming and outgoing goods are carried by air.  This being now no longer feasible it is only a matter of a few days until the factories are in the position that many of them will be in danger of closing. The effect of the dispute goes far beyond the confines of the airport and its industrial estate.  The tourist industry is clearly the one which is <Col N="1214" /> hit most severely.  This industry, as we all know, has not had an easy time in the past couple of years. Everybody is very hopeful particularly in the west of Ireland that there will be an improvement this year.  Unfortunately, this dispute had hit them probably harder than any other single thing could hit them and hit them at the worst possible time when the greatest influx of visitors from the US begins.  Also, there are numerous other firms and businesses dependent to a very large extent for their economic viability on tourists coming into Shannon from the US in June and July, the principal months for eastbound traffic.</P>
    <P>Shannon Airport suffered a severe blow as we know in the past few weeks through the new agreement regarding rights for American carriers. This is the very time when everybody concerned with Shannon Airport and with the prosperity and progress of the mid-western region should do all in their power to ensure that no further avoidable damage is done.  It is tragic that this should have happened at this particular time and in my submission there is a clear duty on the Minister for Labour in particular, and on the Government in general to take every step reasonably open to them, even steps that might not be appropriate in the ordinary trade dispute with limited consequences, to bring about a settlement. The consequences in this dispute are virtually infinite for the mid-West region.  Therefore, I urgently request the Minister for Labour and the Government to take every step open to them to resolve the situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy O'Malley, I should also like to stress the serious effects this strike is now having in our region.  I should first like to say that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and afterwards the Minister for Transport and Power were responsible for running this airport for 25 years. During those 25 years we did not have any strike there.  Strangely enough, even in the past two weeks we have had two strikes, two stoppages.  I am not saying that Aer Rianta are at fault but it is an extraordinary situation <Col N="1215" /> which has arisen so quickly after the take over by Aer Rianta.</P>
      <P>For people who are not living in this region it may be difficult to realise what is happening.  Sales and catering are very badly hit.  They are definitely very badly hit.  They are hit to the extent that on Saturday alone they had to dump 1,000 meals which were prepared for passengers by the flight kitchen.  In one hour the duty free shop had to hand back £1,100 to passengers who had made purchases.  When they realised that they would not be permitted to fly out of Shannon Airport they had no option but to return the money and take back the goods.  All the other ancillary services are hit: the bars, the self-drive car people, all the commercial interests, the taxi-men, not to talk about what is happening to the local hotels and guesthouses.</P>
      <P>Up to now in this tourist season we were showing a reasonable improvement in my constituency, and I am sure the same applies to the other constituencies involved in this region.  Coming at this moment, at the peak of the trade, this has undone what good was being done and, worse than that, it has brought tourism to a complete standstill. As well as all these losses there is the loss of landing fees.  Aer Rianta may say that the landing fees are being collected in Dublin Airport instead of Shannon Airport.  This is of no interest to us down there, or to the people down there.  We are concerned only about Shannon Airport at this time and about getting it back to work. There are also the re-fuellers and all the other workers connected with the running of the airport.  This strike has caused a very serious chain reaction throughout the entire area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, the question arises as to how the whole thing started. The security people claim that they have many grievances.  About two weeks ago there was a one day stoppage. They were prevailed on to return to work, which they did under an interim arrangement.  In due course the Labour Court sent down a conciliation officer who heard their grievances and decided that he was not in a position to help them.  The next <Col N="1216" /> step, as I understand it, would be to send down an arbitration officer, but it appears that the conciliation officer was of the opinion that the grievances were so many and so complex that an arbitration officer was not the proper person to deal with them.  He recommended that a works study officer should come down and do a complete study of all the problems involved.</P>
    <P>This was agreed to by the people on strike and I understand it was also agreed to by the management in Shannon Airport.  If the Minister wants to get these people back to work and get the airport running again all that is required is to appoint this works study officer as quickly as possible.  These people will return to work in the morning, I am told, if Aer Rianta will agree to the interim arrangement which worked reasonably well from 13th June to 21st June, and without any tremendous cost to Aer Rianta for extra overtime and so on.</P>
    <P>The interim arrangement is not very complicated or costly.  At Shannon Airport there is a day shift, an evening shift, and a night shift.  The workers want the company to permit 21 people to work the day shift instead of 18, 16 people to work the evening shift instead of 14, and 16 people to work the night shift instead of 14.  That is the interim arrangement. If this is allowed to stand until the works study officer makes his report, they will be back to work within an hour.  There seems to be a failure in communications in the past few days at Shannon.  While I appreciate that it is an unofficial strike, something must be done about it.  The workers say they would be far happier if they were dealing with the airport management at local level instead of with management at Dublin Airport. They feel, wrongly or rightly, that the people at head office are not as interested in getting work restarted as are management at Shannon Airport.</P>
    <P>The seriousness of the situation has been emphasised and dealt with very well by Deputy O'Malley.  It cannot be over-emphasised.  We are not discussing a problem to which there is no solution.  I have put forward a <Col N="1217" /> solution.  Surely in the interests of reaching a compromise it is not too much to ask the management to allow seven extra men to work the three shifts.  This will not break Aer Rianta. The workers have undertaken to abide by the findings of the work study officer whatever they may be.  The Minister now has the solution to the problem of how to get them back to work.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy O'Malley for the temperate way in which he put his case.  I do not think that any hot words or aggravated claims would alleviate the situation in Shannon Airport.  I am very conscious of the harm this strike is causing to the Shannon region.  As Deputy Coughlan said, this is an unofficial strike.  I also agree with Deputy O'Malley that we should thank the men for coming back tonight, unpaid, to allow the three flights to go out to Lourdes.  As Deputy O'Malley says, this is no ordinary strike.  I suppose there is no such thing really as an <Col N="1218" /> ordinary strike.  Every strike has its own little nuances and differences of opinion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>From my information there were five points at issue in the strike at Shannon.  All of them were settled amicably except the point about the number of men who should be employed.  The workers want 100 men and the company say that 90 men should be rostered in a different way at different times of the day.  When the stoppage took place on the 12th or 13th of June the company did agree to an interim arrangement pending the arrival of a conciliation officer.  The conciliation officer said he could not comment until after the weekend.  The company made it quite clear in a letter to the secretary of the union that this interim arrangement could only last until the conciliation officer heard the case and that it could not be extended beyond this.</P>
      <P>The conciliation officer arrived, heard the case and managed to clear up many of the small points that were troubling the workers down there, but this one point of the number of people to be employed in security at Shannon Airport could not be cleared up to the satisfaction of the workers.  Last Thursday they gave notice of requiring a meeting at which they would put forward a number of points.  They agreed, as Deputy Barrett said, to two officers, one representing the company and one representing the trade union, and the company said they would agree to whatever their findings were.  However, pending this hearing the workers said that their assessment of how many men should be employed at Shannon Airport should hold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the trade union point of view and from the company point of view this would have been an impossible situation, and the company had to refuse this.  The men then gave strike notice and withdrew their services on Thursday night at 7.30.  Since then the <Col N="1219" /> airport has been closed.  It is causing a very grievous situation in the west. Until the men return to work the company could not agree, nor would the Minister for Labour agree&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am not going to agree with Deputy Coughlan because I do not know anything about that. What I am agreeing to is that the men must go back to work, and this is what their trade union want.  The company assure me that, when the men go back <Col N="1220" /> to work, they will abide by the findings of the arbitration officer in regard to employment there, but they cannot agree to any interim arrangement that would tie their hands before the case is heard at arbitration, and I think that is the position as it must be.</P>
      <P>There is just one other point.  Deputy Barrett said there was no strike before Aer Rianta took over.  This is not true. There was a dispute that lasted three to four weeks in 1965 or 1966.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Labour agrees with me on this, and I am sorry he is not here tonight to take this debate.  However, he cannot intervene nor can the Labour Court intervene until the men return to work, and this is the attitude adopted by their trade union and by the company.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.55 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 27th June, 1973.</P>

      <P>I am informed that 56 industrial undertakings closed down in 1972; the number of workers who had been employed in these undertakings was 1,793.</P>
      <P>I understand that eight of the 56 undertakings have since been re-opened. The estimated employment content of these eight undertakings is 200 persons.  I have no doubt that many of those employed in the remaining 48 undertakings have since secured employment in new industries set up with the assistance of the Industrial Development Authority.</P>
