      <P>I have received a revised statement of operational policies and an outline schedule of accommodation for the new hospital which have been under consideration.  I hope to communicate with the health board in the very near future regarding these matters.  Following this it will be necessary to prepare a detailed schedule of accommodation and, subsequently, sketch plans, working drawings and bills of quantities and also details of mechanical and electrical proposals before it will be possible to invite tenders.  I am not in a position to say exactly at this stage when it will be possible to invite tenders for the project.</P>

I do not propose, therefore, to extend the age limit further.</P>

In view of the fact that the Local Appointments Commission quite obviously felt&mdash;because the standards looked for were minimal&mdash;that the qualification for a hospital of this size should be almost consultancy status, would he not now consider sanctioning consultancy status backed up with the help of a junior doctor?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crinion</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare when an allowance book for the old age contributory pension which was awarded on 6th July, 1973, to a person (name supplied) in County Meath will be issued; and the reason for the delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>An old age contributory pension was awarded to the person referred to in the Deputy's question on 17th September, 1973, retrospective to 6th July, 1973.  The person concerned continued to be paid disability benefit up to 22nd September, 1973, and a pension order book containing orders from 28th September, 1973, was sent to her local post office on 28th November, 1973.  Payment of arrears due, after deduction of the amount of disability benefit already paid to her, will be made this week.</P>
      <P>The delay is attributable to extreme pressure of work arising from the reduction of pensionable age to 69 with effect from 2nd July, 1973, and in this particular case, to the need to establish the amount of other benefit paid to the claimant subsequent to 6th July, 1973.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In the 14-point plan announced before the last general election, the Government stated that &ldquo;rates will be reduced drastically by transferring health charges and housing subsidies to central taxation and will be replaced progressively by a form of taxation related to the ability of persons to pay.&rdquo;  On 30th March last, the Government announced that, as an initial step in a phased transfer of the cost of health and local authority housing services from local to central taxation, the Exchequer would bear the full increase in the cost of these services as between 1972-73 and the present <Col N="975" /> financial year and, in addition, 25 per cent of the cost of these services to rates in 1972-73.  The effect of this decision has been such that this year, for the first time in many years, rates in most areas are less than they were in 1972-73 and in many areas the reduction has been significant.</P>
      <P>The question of relating local taxation to the ability of persons to pay, which is referred to in the second part of the Government's statement of intent on rates, is at present under examination in my Department.  All relevant aspects including that referred to by the Deputy will form part of this examination.</P>

      <P>I have been asked a question and perhaps Deputies would await the answer.  I know they will not like it.  The position is that those who have been paying rates on office blocks and business premises, if they save anything that saving is taken off them in another way, and Deputy Lynch and Deputy Colley who smile, know that this is so, while people under the Fianna Fáil scheme who owned small business premises and lived on these premises would have had to pay the full rate if Fianna Fáil had got back.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he has any proposals to make the prize bond scheme more attractive, having regard to current high interest rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Current interest rates are not of primary relevance to holders of non-interest bearing prize bonds, most of whom are attracted to such bonds in the hope of earning one of the substantial tax-free prizes which amount annually to about £1.6 million.</P>
      <P>The scheme is kept under continuous review, and revised when deemed appropriate.  It is not proposed to amend the prize bonds scheme at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will accept that, where a sum of money is deposited with the Government on which interest is not paid as such, interest rates are relevant in the sense that, if the prize money corresponds <Col N="977" /> in some way to current interest rates, he will attract more money in.  Failure to adjust the prize fund in relation to the movement in interest rates is, to say the least of it, a short-sighted policy.  Having regard to the answer he gave me yesterday, which shows that the net withdrawals in prize bonds in the first seven months of this financial year, of the present Government's year, amounted to a quarter of a million pounds whereas in the corresponding period last year there was almost £1 million increase, does this not underline the necessity for the Minister to take account of the movement of interest rates and increase the prize fund?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Withdrawal was negligible having regard to the total size of the prize bond fund.  The real rate of interest from the point of view of an investor works out at about 7 per cent when the figure is grossed up for income tax purposes.  When you consider the principal incentive to investing in prize bonds is the possibility of a tax-free speculative gain you will see it is not quite correct to be comparing prize bonds and the rate of interest which controls the size of the prize fund with interest rates on other investments.  If they were strictly comparable then, of course, the interest rate which governs the size of the prize bond fund should always be related to the going rate compared, for instance, to the most recent national loan; but it is always at a lesser figure because of the possibility of a substantial gain, which can be anything from £25,000 for the first prize to £10,000, £5,000 and so on.  There are several non-taxable gains which can be made and it is quite wrong to overlook that aspect of the fund.  As I said, I am prepared to keep a continual look at the situation, but we are satisfied that at the moment such small withdrawal as there has been is not because of the size of the present prize fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is difficult to forecast the trend of world grain prices indications are that a substantial decrease in the price of feed grain is unlikely in the short term at any rate.  The good cereal harvests this year appear to be sufficient only to meet the world demand and provide a modest increase in carry-over stocks which were reduced to a very low level at the end of the 1972-73 cereal year.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister, as near as one can go, indicate or assure <Col N="980" /> us that there is not likely to be this substantial decrease?  I am aware that it is difficult to know to a fine detail but there are rumours that there is a decrease coming and it is not good in the market or in the business.  Has the Minister any guidance to give us in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The information we have is that there has been a bumper harvest but there is also a great deal of activity in the cereal market.  In the last week the price of maize went up by £2.50.  This is due, to some extent, to very large purchases by Egypt and the fact that Morocco are on the point of making large purchases. It is also rumoured that China needs a lot of wheat.  Of course, stores will empty.  While this bumper harvest is there the indications are that there will not be any great drop in prices if prices can be kept at present levels, or slightly lower.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Development mining work in County Meath was put out to tender by the principal mining company and a number of contractors were engaged to undertake <Col N="984" /> different stages of the operation.  As each contract was completed the contractor and his work force ceased to be engaged.  One contractor engaged for a specific section of the work was given permission to employ foreign specialists.  The replacement of Irish by foreign workers did not arise on the individual contracts.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied from the representations made that these arrangements will contribute to earlier employment of substantial numbers of Irish workers on the main construction and mining work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister be quite sure that it was not the better miners who were paid off?  My information is that a man who was the best miner in these islands was paid off and others were taken on from Canada who could not lace his boots. I can give the Minister names if he wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union&mdash;the union representing the miners&mdash;made a protest to the Department of Labour against the employment of these foreign specialists and agreed they would not oppose the granting of permits.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Of the three people two were never employed on the mining site in Navan; the third was employed by a sub-contractor and left along with everyone else when the job was completed.  He was subsequently employed by the demolition company and eventually he went back to the original sub-contractor who had employed him at Navan.  I think the Deputy is a little off track.</P>

I am informed there were only two deserving congests and that both had been given allotments in the recent past.  I am also told there was another farm in the immediate vicinity which has been offered on a voluntary basis to the Land Commission and, having regard to that, that it was not reasonable to acquire this holding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 26, 27, 28 and 29 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="992" /> Practically all our requirements of crude oil and oil products are purchased through or from the major oil companies in Britain and in the present situation we expect to receive supplies at the same level as the British domestic market.  From the information available to me I understand that there is an overall shortfall of something over 15 per cent of full current requirements at present and I have no reason to believe that we are not securing our fair share on this basis.  While this reduction in supplies is bound to cause some inconvenience and requires a reduction in unnecessary consumption it should not, in the short to medium term at any rate, cause serious hardship to individuals or to the economy. I cannot say, however, whether deliveries will continue to be maintained at this rate in the coming months.</P>
    <P>In the light of the supply situation, I have already made orders restricting deliveries of oil products.  In the case of products for manufacturing industry and essential users deliveries for the current quarter are fixed at 95 per cent of last winter's user.  Petrol and oil products for retail sale through garages, etc. are restricted to 90 per cent of last winter's user.  Because the restrictions were imposed in the middle of the current quarter the impact of the cuts on garages or others who had been using up their allocations at normal or increased rates has, of course, been greater than the normal rates of 10 per cent or 5 per cent.  The orders provide for special allocations for new or substantially increased businesses.  There is also provision under which, after consultation with my Department, the oil companies may be authorised to deliver additional supplies to meet essential requirements or special circumstances. Unless and until formal rationing is introduced difficulties experienced by industrial and other essential users should be taken up in the first instance with their suppliers as this is the most rapid way of dealing with them in present circumstances.</P>
    <P>The present level of oil supply <Col N="993" /> should not require the introduction of formal rationing of petrol which accounts for only 15 per cent of our oil consumption but all necessary preparations for a rationing scheme are being pushed ahead so as to ensure that if such rationing becomes necessary it can be brought into effect at short notice.  In the meantime I hope that motorists will respond to my appeal for a reduction in petrol consumption, particularly by the elimination of unnecessary motoring. I have also discussed with the trade the possibility of introducing more order into the situation so as to ensure a measure of priority for essential users.  There is much scope for voluntary reduction in motoring and if my appeals are responded to reasonably the situation should stabilise and it should not then be necessary to introduce formal rationing unless the supply situation deteriorates.</P>
    <P>I have no reason to believe that oil supplies which would normally come to this country have been diverted to more lucrative markets.  I do understand, however, that there may be limited supplies of oil in certain categories available on the international market to the highest bidder.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that his appeals over the last week or ten days have failed completely and have fallen on deaf ears as far as the public are concerned? Is he not aware that members of the public, industrialists and industrial workers are experiencing concern and that all of them would welcome some form of rationing rather than have the present chaotic conditions continue to prevail?  Would the Minister not agree that what is really needed now is some definite action in order to regularise the present position rather than have it in the long-term as mentioned in his reply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not mention long-term.  I do not agree that my appeals have fallen on deaf ears throughout the country.  By and large, with the exception of Dublin, as I said last week, there seems to be tremendous co-operation with my appeals. <Col N="994" /> This week in Dublin&mdash;one can judge this for oneself by observation and by the action of some garages in allocating supplies in a different manner&mdash; there are not such large queues outside Dublin stations now.  There is sufficient petrol available at the moment&mdash;and that is as far as I can say now, at the moment&mdash;provided people do not use it for non-essential purposes, provided they reduce speeds, are careful in driving and avoid stopping by jamming on brakes and so on.  There are many ways in which this 15 per cent effective cut in present requirements can be met without rationing&mdash;with some inconvenience, yes, but without rationing. If, when people go to their garages they take only what they require and not try to grab what should be left for those who need it such as commercial travellers, doctors, nurses and so on, there should not be necessity for formal rationing now.  At the same time, as I said in the reply, steps are proceeding to introduce formal rationing should it become necessary.  That will depend on how seriously people take my appeals, what the supply situation is and what level stocks remain at.  If the supply situation becomes worse, of course there will have to be formal rationing.</P>
      <P>Deputy Barrett spoke about industrialists and this of course is the most important thing.  Many people can do without private motor cars. This does not mean that the petrol which we import which is refined in Whitegate can be switched to running machinery in factories and so on.  I am meeting the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the farmers' organisation and the Federation of Irish Industry in the morning to discuss with them how they can cut down on the use of an essential fuel for industry to ensure that there will not be redundancy or that people will not be laid off because of the present very serious world-wide situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody reading the papers can see that the other governments in Europe and in the world are concerned about the present shortage of energy.  We will have to watch the situation carefully and ensure that as few people as possible, and none at <Col N="995" /> all if possible, lose their jobs because of it.  It is serious but we think that this is the right action to take at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Having full regard to the difficulties of the situation imposed on the Minister, does he consider that his admonition to people not to use petrol other than for essential purposes and the requirement on those who distribute and supply petrol to do so to those who are most in need for industrial and other purposes, is not too great a burden for them to bear?  Should the Minister intervene and impose some form of rational system of distribution at this stage?</P>

      <P>Arising from the Minister's reply could I ask him specifically in regard to Question No. 28 whether he is satisfied that there is no diversion of our supplies from the country of supply or on their way to this country and whether he has taken steps to ensure that this does not happen?  In regard also to the answer which the Minister has given generally, is it a fact that, instead of there being an alleged 10 per cent cut in petrol supplies as announced, related to 90 per cent of last year's supplies, because of the cut being half-way through the quarter, with an <Col N="996" /> increase in consumption this year of at least 20 per cent, the net effective cut is somewhere in the region of 40 per cent rather than 10 per cent, and if the figure is not 40 per cent it is substantially higher than 10 per cent? Would the Minister clarify everybody's mind in this regard because the 10 per cent being bandied around is giving a false impression?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Blaney is right.  There has been an increase in consumption in the last 12 months. That is estimated to be around 10 per cent.  That, taken with the 10 per cent on last year's pickup, means that something less than 20 per cent is the best estimate.  Because this imposes certain difficulties for garages which may have sold more in the first half of the quarter than what they would be allowed under the quota system.  I have made arrangements with the oil companies from the 10th of this month that the garages may get an advance of 5 per cent on the January supply. That will help to ease the position around Christmas.  I agree that there has been some confusion about these figures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the people engaged in the long haulage business are experiencing great difficulty in getting supplies of diesel fuel?  For instance, people leaving the <Col N="997" /> south or west of Ireland to get to Dublin are having great difficulty getting supplies for the return journey. They are unable to make any commitments to their customers.  Does the Minister realise that this could have a serious effect on the economy, particularly with regard to the movement of industrial and many other goods? Would the Minister make some special provision to ensure that these people get supplies for the return journeys?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am well aware that this could have very serious effects on the economy.  It is up to everybody, including the long distance haulage people, the Deputies, big industrialists and the housewives to cut down on their use of energy.  We cannot say whether the situation will get worse or not.  If particular people have difficulties in certain situations and if Deputy Barrett wants to give me a list, I will have their cases considered in my Department.  There are people in difficulties all over the country.  If the Deputy gives me details of particular cases I will do my best to see that they are considered.</P>
      <P>I cannot say their problems will be solved.  Nobody can have 100 per cent of his usual supplies.  Everybody must save.  The problems cannot be solved but we will try to alleviate the position. I will do my best to see that people are satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This has been suggested. I have asked the motor traders to look at this point.  We will discuss it again in the morning.  Their preliminary advice&mdash;and my own feeling&mdash;is that the situation in this country is different from that in other European countries which have banned Sunday driving.  There are many sports fixtures in rural areas on Sundays.  Many of these fixtures involve travel.  There is a big church going population in this country in the rural areas.  People must be taken <Col N="998" /> to Mass or to church.  They require transport.  This ban is something which could be considered if necessary but at the moment I am not greatly in favour of it.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that rationing cards are about to be distributed and as there are several users of oil and fuel who are not recorded and who are unrecordable&mdash;I instance users of bottled gas and people who use oil heating systems in their homes&mdash;could the Minister allay their fears and assure them that they will get a reasonable supply of fuel in the event of rationing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>At the moment they are getting 90 per cent and it is up to them to cut down on the use of such fuel and to spread it further. Normally the person from whom they get supplies will have 90 per cent of what was available last year.  It will be up to the people who use this form of heating or cooking to use their supplies as sparingly as possible.  The ordinary town gas which we use is also made from oil.  Its use should be conserved at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be on an allocation system such as the garages are using at the moment.  There are relatively few outlets from which such supplies are available.  Most of the suppliers know their own customers. If a customer has a difficulty in such case we will try to solve it in the Department.</P>
      <P>It is up to the people who use five cylinders for the winter to cut down their use to four, and this can be done by not leaving the cylinders on unnecessarily. There are various ways of saving even 20 per cent of our use of heat.  It is essential for this country, if we are to keep going, to cut down on our use of energy.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="999" /> accept that there are some people who depend entirely on oil for domestic heating, that in respect of the application of his 90 per cent quota certain oil companies are refusing to deliver quantities which are less than 100 gallons?  The result is that there are people who cannot enjoy the 90 per cent quota and who have absolutely no oil at all.  Would the Minister direct the companies to deliver whatever amount people are entitled to?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a problem, and what we have asked the companies to do now is to give the quota for the coming quarter in this quarter as well.  There is no economic drop under 100 gallons and they are now being asked to deliver the next quota as well as the current quota.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to authorise a voluntary contribution of £3,100,070 towards the replenishment of the resources of the International Development Association (IDA), one of the World Bank group of organisations.</P>
      <P>The association was established in 1960 to provide credits on easy terms to the poorest and least developed of the member countries, in practice those with an annual per capita income of less than $300.  These credits are repayable over 50 years and subject to an interest charge of only ¾ per cent per annum to cover administration expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>IDA membership is divided into two groups.  The original part I members were those industrialised countries which subscribed in gold or freely convertible currencies more than three-quarters of the initial capital of $1,000 million.  Part II countries subscribed the balance but only 10 per cent of their subscriptions was payable in gold or freely convertible currencies, the remainder being payable in non-convertible national currencies.  A small number of the original part II countries, including Ireland, later agreed to the release of their 90 per cent portions in freely convertible form.  There are now 21 part I and 92 part II members. In general, part I countries <Col N="1002" /> provide the resources of IDA, the poorest of the part II members being the recipients of the aid.</P>
    <P>IDA is the oldest and most experienced international institution providing financial aid on concessionary terms and assistance in institution building.  For the most part the funds are provided for specific projects and great care is taken to ensure that the money is used to the best advantage. It is the policy of the association to give the largest measure of support to efforts towards economic and social structural adjustment aimed at a more equitable distribution of income and opportunities.  If it is to continue this vital role it requires an assured and increasing volume of financial resources.</P>
    <P>Since its foundation, the association has been financed mainly by the initial capital subscriptions and by special replenishments of its funds on three occasions.  The first and second replenishments covering the period to 1971 were provided by part I members and by a long-term loan from Switzerland, a non-member.  Contributions towards the third replenishment covering period 1972 to 1974 were made by part I members and three part II members&mdash;Ireland, Spain and Yugoslavia. There was also a Swiss loan and a voluntary contribution from New Zealand, a non-member, which has recently applied for part I membership.</P>
    <P>The resources made available to the association, amounting to £17,242 million since its inception, are expected to be fully committed by June, 1974. Following consultations between the association and the contributing countries, including Ireland, agreement has been reached on a fourth replenishment of $4,500 million subject to the necessary legislative authority being given in the participating countries. This would cover commitments in the three years commencing July 1974, but disbursements would be over a much longer period.</P>
    <P>Ireland's contribution to the third replenishment was $4 million, out of a total of $2,400 million, and this was authorised by the International Development Association (Amendment) <Col N="1003" /> Act, 1971.  Our proposed contribution to the fourth replenishment, equivalent to $7.5 million, represents about the same proportion of the total as on the previous occasion.  In view of the substantial economic progress of the country since 1960 and the fact that EEC countries, except Ireland, are in part I, the Government decided that it was no longer appropriate that we should continue as a part II member and that part I membership should be sought.  Our application for this change in membership status, which has been approved, is a concrete indication of the Government's intention to play its part in providing for the most needy peoples of the world.  It involves a continuing moral commitment to contribute towards the financing, through the association, of the social and economic development of the most impoverished countries.  The commitment is of a voluntary nature and contributions are negotiable with the association.</P>
    <P>The executive directors of the association have recommended the governors, representing all member countries, to vote by 31st January, 1974, on a resolution to give effect to the proposals.  As governor of the association for Ireland, I propose to vote in favour of the resolution.  This will not become effective and the obligation to contribute new resources will not become binding on any member, unless and until members, including at least 12 part I members, whose contributions aggregate not less than $3,500 million give the association formal notification that they will make the contribution authorised for each of them.</P>
    <P>The Bill, if enacted, will enable this country to continue to participate financially in the excellent and most desirable humanitarian work of IDA and I feel sure that all Deputies will support these objectives wholeheartedly.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as this party are concerned, the Minister may rest assured that we support the objectives of this Bill and of the International <Col N="1004" /> Development Association wholeheartedly and without reservation.  As is generally known, the International Development Association is an offshoot of the World Bank and works very closely in consultation with it and, indeed, shares offices and staff to a great extent.  I understand that very often an aid programme for an under-developed country includes a package deal, partly assistance from the World Bank and partly assistance from the International Development Association.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons why we can support this association and its activities wholeheartedly is that it represents, perhaps, the least self interested form of assistance to under-developed countries that is available.  I say that because it is operated on a multilateral basis and there are no strings attached as far as the contributing countries are concerned.  One frequently hears comparisons made between the amount of aid given by one country and another on the basis of, say, a percentage of GNP and there are other bases of comparison used.  These bases should be examined very carefully before they are accepted because very often one finds that in the case of some countries which appear to be performing very much better than other countries, and than Ireland in particular, the truth of the matter is that a great deal of the aid they give is not aid without strings on a multilateral basis but rather aid given on a bilateral basis which, in the crudest form, can consist of simply disposing of surplus stocks which the donor country has and in a somewhat more sophisticated form can consist of credits, the making of money available on condition that that money or a large proportion of it is expended on the purchase of goods from the donor country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suppose there is no doubt that from the point of view of the recipient countries it is better to have this kind of aid than none at all.  Nevertheless, inherent in that kind of aid is something that is very akin to economic imperialism.  It is certainly not in any way as attractive or as laudable as the kind of aid that is involved in this Bill and in our participation in the International Development Association. <Col N="1005" /> It is very important when one hears comparisons between, say, this country's performance and another country's performance in regard to aid to developing countries to analyse the form of aid that is given. When one does this and relates to official aid given by the Government of each country and confines it to this kind of multilateral aid without strings attached, one then finds that our performance is by no means bad in relation to that of other countries who are in many cases in a better position to give assistance than we are.  That is one of the reasons why we can support without reservation the proposals in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Another reason is that to the best of my knowledge the International Development Association schemes are well administered.  Certainly as compared with many other international schemes they seem to be well administered, confined to countries really in need and given on terms which are really worthwhile to the recipient countries and, perhaps, most important of all, are directed in the main to the kind of economic development in the recipient countries that will lead to those countries becoming more self-sufficient in the future and not merely directed to <i>ad hoc</i> remedying of particular problems. This, of course, is necessary in any long-term approach to aid to developing countries.  There are problems which arise from time to time which do need <i>ad hoc</i> remedies but any long-term approach to aid to developing countries must be on the basis that the aid is directed to enabling the recipient countries to help themselves.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons we are fully in support of this Bill.  There are, however, one or two matters that I would like to mention to the Minister and, perhaps, when he is replying he could clarify the position in regard to them.  I wonder if I am right in assuming that the decision to become a part I member was influenced, to a great extent, by the fact that we had, in practice, almost become a part I member because although we were only bound to pay 10 per cent of what <Col N="1006" /> we had committed ourselves to we did, in fact, in the past agree to release the other 90 per cent and to a great extent this practice put us into a part I category.  I know there are some other obligations involved in being a part I member but I should like to know whether the Minister would agree that that was an important factor in deciding to become a part I member.</P>
    <P>For a number of reasons I support the decision to become a part I member not least of which is the fact mentioned by the Minister that we are the only member of the EEC that is not in that category.  It would help if, when replying, the Minister could give some indication of the likely commitment now and for the future for this country by reason of being a part I member, not only in relation to the present subscription which is being required but on the basis of the pattern of growth in the IDA.  I realise that any assessment in this regard must of necessity be tenuous but it would be of some help to have even a tenuous estimate of what rate of growth is likely to be involved in our contribution.</P>
    <P>Another matter on which I would appreciate some clarification is in relation to the contributions we have made already and the contributions to which we are committing ourselves on foot of this Bill.  The figures which the Minister quoted in his speech are in dollars.  This is the normal procedure in dealing with this association but the figures in the Bill are in sterling and since it is not clear to that extent I would appreciate the Minister giving us in sterling the amount of the commitment which we made originally in 1960, the amount of the initial commitment made under the 1971 Bill, the amount of the commitment being made under this Bill and also the amount of the actual payments we have made up to now on foot of the previous commitments and the amount of the payment we propose to make on foot of this Bill.  I think from what the Minister said that what is involved in this Bill is a commitment to pay the full amount now and not as happened originally, <Col N="1007" /> that was to pay 10 per cent and leave oneself ready to pay the other 90 per cent when called on.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I reiterate that, subject to clarification of the points I have raised, we support the Bill fully, a Bill that arises from a further request from the IDA to the member countries to subscribe further so as to enable the association to continue with an ongoing programme of assistance to underdeveloped countries. When this party were in Government in 1960 we accepted the necessity of becoming members of this association. By reason of the Bill of 1971 we accepted the necessity for stepping up our contribution.  The Bill before us is in pursuance of the policy we were following.  We support it without reservation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Colley for his attitude to this Bill, a Bill which commands the support of the House generally.  As the Deputy pointed out, since the setting up of the IDA in 1960 we have been part II members which, as I indicated in my opening speech, includes the less industrialised countries like ourselves and the developing countries.  At that time it was accepted readily that because of our 1960 state of economic development we could not do other than accept part II membership.  At that point in time we were not ready for part I membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part I members provide the association's funds while the poorer part II members are the recipients. Membership of part I means a moral commitment to contribute to the resources of the IDA.  The level of contributions by all members, part I and those in part II who are prepared to participate, is negotiable with the association in discussions prior to each replenishment.  The contribution normally is related to a member's share of the combined GNP of the participating countries.  With the considerable economic progress in Ireland since the 1960's the question of transferring to part I membership has arisen from time to time.  In the 1971 replenishment we participated on a <Col N="1008" /> voluntary basis to the extent of $4 million.  Whether we were part I or part II members participation in future replenishment would be expected of us.  The change to part I membership does not involve any extra commitment in this replenishment beyond what we would have contributed on a voluntary basis had we remained part II members.  Also, at present we are the only EEC member country in the part II membership group.  Therefore, I think Deputy Colley will appreciate that a combination of those factors&mdash;our economic progress since 1960 and our membership now of a progressive economic group in the EEC&mdash;has made it necessary for us to transfer to part I membership.</P>
    <P>Part I membership entails a definite moral commitment, a definite obligation to support future replenishments. The discussions with the IDA regarding the level of the contributions were dominated by that association's concern not to burden countries beyond that which their resources would permit.  This should mean that for future replenishments a fair contribution, in the light of our circumstances, would be negotiable.</P>
    <P>The figures in sterling for earlier contributions are bound up with changes in currencies.  Perhaps it will be possible for the Minister to give these figures in the Seanad or communicate privately with Deputy Colley in regard to these points.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the substantive section which authorises the making of payments not exceeding £3,100,070 to the association.  Section 3, subsection (2) of the 1960 Act shown in the table to section 1 of the Bill sets out the payments which may be made to the association on behalf of the Government. They are the payments provided for in the association's articles of agreement which are scheduled to the 1960 Act and are as follows: the initial membership subscription, an increase in subscription, payments to maintain the value of the subscription, including any increase, in terms of the US dollar in the event of depreciation in the exchange value of the Irish currency, and payments arising out of termination of membership.  The 1971 Amendment Act added another paragraph (cc) to subsection 3 (ii) to authorise the payment of $4 million to the last replenishment of the IDA's resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill adds to the list the proposed contribution of £3,100,070 to the association's resources.  Thus the other provisions of section 3 of the 1960 Act will apply to the paragraph being included by this amendment of section 3, subsection (2). Thus payment will be made out of the Central Fund and non-interest bearing non-negotiable demand notes may be issued to the association <Col N="1010" /> should it not require cash immediately. The Minister will also have power to borrow any moneys required to pay the contribution and the Central Bank of Ireland are empowered to lend for the purpose.  It is not in fact, envisaged that recourse will be had to borrowing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Before I deal with any of the provisions in this Bill I think I should mention that it was almost entirely prepared when my predecessor was in office.  I am glad, however, to have the opportunity to introduce the Bill, which I am confident will be welcomed by all sections of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three main types of pensions under the Army Pensions Acts. <Col N="1011" /> Wound pensions are granted where the degree of disablement is not less than 20 per cent.  Disease pensions are given where the disablement attributable to service is not less than 80 per cent and vary with the degree of disablement. Where the disablement is less than 80 per cent but not less than 50 per cent reduced pensions are payable at a final flat rate.  The Acts also provide for pensions where the disablement is not caused by service but is aggravated by service.</P>
    <P>The main object of the Bill is to provide for the review, within reasonable limitations, of final pensions granted under the Army Pensions Acts and to provide for the review of certain other types of cases arising under these Acts.  At present the Acts lay down certain limiting periods in which application for review must be made.  In many cases these periods have long since expired and this Bill will enable these cases to be reviewed at the request of the pensioner.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1932 laid down a period of ten years after the grant of a final wound or disease pension in which application for review of the final grant should be made.  Section 2 of this Bill provides that, where that period has expired, such final pension may be given a first review at any time at the request of the pensioner on production of medical evidence that the degree of disablement has increased by at least 10 per cent, and thereafter may be reviewed at intervals of not less than two years.  In special circumstances the Minister for Defence may authorise earlier review.  The section also provides for the reassessment of the degree of disablement by the Army Pensions Board and for the increase, reduction or suspension of the pension in accordance with the degree of disablement found on reassessment. If the degree of disablement due to disease is found to be less than 80 per cent but not less than 50 per cent, a final flat rate pension may be awarded.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with the review of the final flat rate pensions to which I have referred.  Under the Acts as they stand these pensions cannot be reviewed. Section 3 of the Bill enables <Col N="1012" /> them to be reviewed subject to much the same conditions as apply to final disease pensions.  If, on reassessment, the degree of disablement is found to be not less than 80 per cent a disease pension may be awarded in lieu of the final flat rate pension.  The section also provides for the suspension of the final flat rate pension if the degree of disablement is found on reassessment to be less than 50 per cent and for its restoration if on subsequent application for review, the degree of disablement is found to be less than 80 per cent but not less than 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>Under the Acts at present there is no provision for the review of final pensions granted in respect of disease aggravated by service.  Section 4 makes a somewhat similar provision for the review of these cases as is made in section 2 in relation to the final disease pensions.</P>
    <P>Under the Acts a gratuity may be paid if the degree of disablement due to a wound attributable to service is less than the pensionable minimum of 20 per cent.  Different periods in which the application for review must be made, are laid down.  It is considered only fair that a person who was awarded a wound gratuity should be given an opportunity of having one final review of his case.  Sections 5, 6 and 7 provide accordingly.  They also provide for the grant of pensions if the degree of disablement is found, on reassessment, to be not less than the 20 per cent minimum for a wound pension.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for the review of a case where the application was not successful because the degree of disablement due to disease attributable to service did not reach the pensionable minimum of 50 per cent.  The conditions for review are the same as those in sections 2 and 3 and provision is made for the grant of a pension if the degree of disablement is found on reassessment to have reached the pensionable minimum.  Section 9 is on exactly similar lines except that it deals with &ldquo;aggravation&rdquo; cases as distinct from &ldquo;attributability&rdquo; cases.</P>
    <P>Sections 10 and 12 call for little comment. They are merely consequential amendments to certain provisions of <Col N="1013" /> the Acts which are necessitated by changes in Defence Force Regulations.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1953 pensions under the Military Service Pensions Act, 1924, were not payable while an officer or soldier was still serving.  In some instances the officer or soldier died in service and consequently their widows were not entitled to an allowance under the Army Pensions Act, 1971.  Section 11 enables an allowance to be granted in these cases.  However, the appropriate allowances have already been awarded in anticipation of the Bill and section 11 provides the statutory authority for the payments.</P>
    <P>I trust that my remarks have helped to make the provisions of the Bill clearer to Deputies.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for acknowledging that his predecessor had a lot to do with the preparation of this Bill.  There is nothing political to be gained in this Bill for any party.  We are all agreed on what it contains.  We will discuss, on Committee Stage, minor matters.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that this Bill should become law as soon as possible.  We should be able to take all Stages today, which I think is the Minister's intention. My party intend to facilitate the Minister as far as possible.  Anybody who has read the Bill and the explanatory memorandum will see that the first nine sections refer to giving some wounded or disabled people a final fling, so to speak.  They had many complaints down through the years. They said that their cases should be reheard but they could not have them reheard because of some rule or regulation which prohibited them either in the 1932 Act or the 1949 Act.  They felt very aggrieved and as time went on they became more aggrieved. I would not blame them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the first nine sections of this Bill is to give people who were refused a wound pension or a pension for a disease contracted while they were in the service a chance to restate their case.  The Minister will be able to have their cases reopened and referred to the pension board for decision.  I have no doubt that <Col N="1014" /> many of them will be successful.  We should not delay this matter any further because these people are not young.</P>
    <P>The Minister says that sections 10 and 12 call for little comment.  I suppose they tidy up the position.  Section 11 deals with the 1971 Act under which widows could get an allowance if their husbands had been in receipt of an Army pension at the time of death.  It was found that a group of people had been left out and they are now being dealt with under this Bill.  There are many widows of Old IRA men who had special allowances who are not included in the 1971 Bill. I wonder could anything be done about them.  They were entitled to £1 per week or half of the pension on the death of their husbands.  I know that medal-holders got special allowances.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister could include the widows of Old IRA medal-holders who were in receipt of special allowances at the time of their death. A very strict means test is applied to those claims.  These widows feel they should get some allowance.  Some of them may be reaching the age when they will get the old age pension and some of them may be in receipt of widows' pension.  While the special allowance is not very large these widows are most anxious that they should get consideration.  The Minister probably cannot deal with them on this Bill but I hope he will consider the matter.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party agree with the Minister on what is contained in this Bill.  We support it.  I thank the Minister for his reference to his predecessor who had a lot to do with the preparation of this Bill.  There are no political kudos to be gained by either party and I am anxious that the Bill should go through the House as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Meaney for his remarks in relation to my quite proper and truthful statement that my predecessor was in office when most of this Bill was drafted.  I regard the Ministry of Defence as a national Ministry which should be removed as far as possible from politics.  In my view this Ministry provides a national service under the strictest provisions of our Constitution and our laws and it will benefit greatly from Deputy Meaney's approach and, although I say it myself, from my own approach in acknowledging the work of my predecessor.</P>
      <P>Deputy Meaney raised the question of doing something for widows of special allowance holders.  I am not against this.  I would be very pleased if they could get something extra.  The important thing about the special allowance is that it is not a pension. Many people who fought for the freedom of our country in days gone by found themselves, sadly, later on not blessed with the world's goods.  In appreciation of the fact that they risked their lives, and of their work for the country, a system was evolved whereby they were given a special allowance on a strict means test.  The fact is that the widow of a special allowance holder is no worse off, even though she is probably quite badly off, than any other widow in a similar position.  That would be the legalistic view.  All I can say to the House is that I am well-disposed towards trying to help those people in every way I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Pensions Act, 1971, widows of military service pensioners benefited in so far as they were entitled to half their husbands pensions or £80.52, whichever was the greater. That was a good step forward.  There is the legalistic view and, I suppose, the quite materialistic view that the widow of a special allowance holder is no worse off than any other widow in like circumstances.  That will be my problem in trying to convince the Minister for Finance that there is a need for this.  I think the House will realise that that problem exists.  The House desires to do the very maximum <Col N="1016" /> for every widow in poor circumstances, no matter who is on this side of the House or that side of the House.</P>
    <P>A person was given a special allowance for service to the country at a very crucial stage, at the time of its birth.  He was given special treatment, if you like, and special consideration. The question then arises as to whether this should be extended to his widow.  I have the utmost sympathy for the views expressed by Deputy Meaney.</P>
    <P>Deputy Timmons suggested a remission of taxation for widows of Old IRA men.  We would find ourselves with the same sort of problems as we would have in relation to an allowance for widows of special allowance holders.  Perhaps the right thing to do is to give them more money from the Exchequer.  Very few of these people are paying taxes.  I would say with respect to my good friend Deputy Timmons that probably the better way to do it is to try to give them bigger pensions.  I can assure the House that is something I would favour.</P>

      <P>May I repeat my earlier plea in relation to a tax rebate on or tax exemption for Old IRA pensions? The Minister earlier suggested the way in which he proposed to deal with this problem was by giving increased pensions.  I go with him to a certain extent on that but I would emphasise that it is his responsibility and that of his colleagues in government to try to ensure that these people are properly rewarded.  They <Col N="1019" /> got very niggardly benefits considering the services they rendered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take Deputy Timmons' point.  I am fully aware of the humanitarian views of Deputy Timmons who is probably one of the nicest gentlemen who comes into this House.  However, there are very rich men in receipt of Old IRA pensions also.  When we saw the end of hostilities on the formation of our State some of those who fought for our country at that time were people who may not have been well off before it and, as I said during the course of this debate, were not blessed with the world's goods afterwards.  These are the people who are the special allowance holders.</P>
      <P>Military service pensions are payable to people who could be millionaires. In fact, I could think of a couple of people who were very nearly millionaires and who, if they did apply for a military service pension&mdash;it is possible that they did so&mdash;were entitled to them and were paid them.  That type of person should, in all equity, be liable to pay tax on that pension just as he would on his very large income. However, when it comes to the poor person that person would not be liable for tax anyway.  The provision in respect of special allowances is related to income and the limit of income allowed to a person before he or she would get a special allowance is such that they would not be subject to tax.</P>
      <P>I would consider my task in trying to convince the Minister for Finance, the Government or any Government or Minister for Finance, that what Deputy Timmons says is proper would be a very hard one.  In my view the right way to approach this is to give more to the needy, and to give to those who are entitled to military service pensions and who are well off more also but take some of it back in taxation.</P>

      <P>While I realise that this particular Bill is merely a ratification of an international convention this section appears to put a lot of emphasis on the duty of commanders. It puts a duty on a commander to hand over a passenger, a duty on a commander to furnish information, <Col N="1022" /> and a duty on a commander to notify the appropriate authority.  A lot of the emphasis seems to be on the work of the commander of an aircraft.  The commander of an aircraft has enough work to do irrespective of all these duties.</P>

      <P>It is his duty to see that it is done and to do it.  The situation could arise where the only crew member aboard would be the pilot.  The pilot is bound to be aboard if the plane is flying and, therefore, there is always somebody aboard to accept this responsibility.  It is the duty of that person to see that it is carried out.  He can give instructions to members of the crew to do it but as the pilot is the one person certain to be on board he is the obvious one to give this authority to.</P>

      <P>I should like to endorse what Deputy Barrett, spokesman on Transport and Power matters on behalf of our party, has said on this Bill.  Any protection which can be afforded to air passengers and air crews is desirable and I am delighted that this Bill is before the House for the ratification of these conventions.  I have only one regret about it, from the point of view of our air crews on Irish airlines, and that is that the conventions so far agreed to and signed have not gone far enough in tackling this problem.  I think the Minister will agree on this.  The First Schedule speaks about The Hague contracting states, meaning states in which The Hague Convention is for the time being enforced.  Sufficient member countries have not signed this convention. The countries that are principally suffering from hijacking have not, to the best of my knowledge, signed this convention.  Consequently, Irish pilots, air crews and passengers travelling over the territory of countries that have not signed the convention are in serious danger due to the lack of protection because the countries <Col N="1024" /> have not signed the conventions. I hope that the Minister will put pressure on IATA and other organisations to have the scope of these conventions extended to give as much protection as possible to our air crews and passengers.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport and Power (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point made by Deputy Burke.  This is true but these conventions tend to be out of date almost before they are incorporated in legislation.  We are giving effect to two conventions here today. The Hague and Tokyo Conventions, which were later seen to be faulty. Following on them will be the Montreal Convention.  I shall be bringing in legislation as soon as possible to give effect to it.</P>
      <P>The points made by Deputy Burke are valid.  He may remember that in August, at the conference in Rome, these matters were debated without any firm commitments emerging as to what could be done about aircraft hijacked or landed in countries that had not signed the convention.  This will be followed up again, quite vigorously, I think, under pressure from the Air Pilots' Association and bodies of that kind and governments, of course, which want to see this crime completely eliminated from the world.  We shall probably find that at the next conference there will be a further move towards finding some way of giving effect to conventions in countries that have not signed them. I should like to thank the Opposition for the speed with which we were able to get this measure through the House.  I think everybody in the House recognises how necessary this measure is.  Perhaps it does not go far enough but it is as far as we can go under these conventions.  I shall be introducing further legislation to give greater protection to aircraft.</P>

      <P>When we were discussing this matter last week, as a result <Col N="1025" /> of some interruptions made by the Minister for Local Government the tone of the debate accelerated and, indeed, there were some sharp exchanges across the House.  I am aware that the speed of the exchanges was such as to prevent any stenographer from getting everything that was said. I am aware also that Ministers and Deputies have the privilege to go into the office of the Editor of Debates and edit their own contributions, but I am not aware that at any time can one Deputy or, indeed, a Minister, alter the contributions of other Deputies.  On looking at the Official Report of last Wednesday, Volume 269, No. 5, 28th November, it appeared to me in particular that the references or the exchanges I had with Deputy Coogan, where I had insisted on a withdrawal of an inference he had made&mdash;the Deputy had the courtesy to rephrase his earlier remarks to my satisfaction&mdash;have not, I regret, appeared in the Official Report.</P>
      <P>You know, Sir, I think probably what nettled the Minister was that I questioned his competence and ability and I will do that again today.  I treat everybody in this House with courtesy and respect and I expect to be treated back in the same way.  But if any Minister, any arrogant Minister, wishes to treat me in a different way I will give him more than he can give out, as indeed the Minister withdrew from the exchange with a very insulting and personally insulting remark when he realised he was not getting the better of the argument. I was making my contribution practically without interruption when the Minister pointed out that in his view he had to spend six months cleaning up the mess left by his predecessor and that is why we had the delay in seeing this particular Bill.  But the Minister knows as well as I know, as well as every Deputy in this House knows, that he produced a Bill which was unacceptable, in the first instance to some of his own colleagues and certainly to his own Executive and then unacceptable, indeed, to the Parliamentary Secretary, who is sitting across, if my reports are correct, in certain facets, and the Bill had to be drafted and redrafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1026" /> If I thought this Bill was the complete work of the Minister for Local Government I would urge our party to support it.  The Minister has made so many decisions that have proved incorrect, he has been so anxious to make decisions without being properly briefed or without fully considering the implications, that if this Bill were his work it must be wrong for the present Government.  However, it is not his Bill.  I am aware that the Taoiseach consulted with some of his &ldquo;whizz kids&rdquo; and, as a result, we have a Fine Gael Bill introduced by a Labour Minister.</P>
    <P>I have gone through the Bill, constituency by constituency.  With the sole exception of the amazing exercise of putting Ennis with Galway in the hope of electing Senator Higgins, there is not one prospect I can see of any extra Labour seats being acquired in the next general election, regardless of whatever way public opinion may swing at that time.</P>
    <P>I admit the Minister has carefully put an extra seat in his own constituency to protect himself and also that he has put one in Waterford to protect the party chairman, Deputy Tom Kyne. If there are seats to be won by the Government in the next general election as a result of this Bill, working on the statistical facts available from the last and previous general elections, they will be won by Fine Gael not by Labour.  The one exception is the extraordinary exercise of putting Ennis in with Galway, in the interest apparently of the Senator in that area.</P>
    <P>Referring to the debate last week, I expressed the view that I had no objection whatever to the introduction of three-seat constituencies in Dublin.  Indeed, I have expressed the view since the first referendum was defeated that we should maximise the three-seat constituency situation throughout the country.  I believe in the system of single-seat constituencies. The next nearest thing to letting proportional representation work as it should, namely enabling a government to be elected, to be formed and to govern, is a three-seat constituency situation.  Admittedly there may be some exceptions to that but we should maximise the three-seat <Col N="1027" /> constituency situation.  In that event, depending on public opinion at the time, one side will get two seats and the other side will get one seat if the general trend throughout the country is the same.  That means that a government will be elected with a reasonably comfortable majority and will be able to put their programme into effect without compromising, perhaps, with Independent support.</P>
    <P>I do not know how Fianna Fáil got an overall majority in 1933 because at that time there were two nine-seaters. As I pointed out last week, in the townships in Dublin South there were seven seats, of which Fianna Fáil got five.  I should like to quote the following because the Minister's interruption is very interesting.  At the time Deputy Cluskey was sitting opposite me.  At column 689 of the Official Report dated 28th November, 1973 I said:</P>
    <P>As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare will remember, there was a seven-seat constituency in his area and on one occasion Fianna Fáil elected five out of the seven Deputies and, indeed, it was on my late father's surplus that Jim Larkin was elected.</P>
    <P>Mr. Tully: People became very intelligent since then.</P>
    <P>I do not know if it was the Minister's intention to insult my late father or to insult Jim Larkin. Both these men are respected by the people in Dublin and I can assure the Minister if it was his intention to insult either of them it will not do him any good in the Dublin area.  In the seven or nine-seat constituency situation it was an amazing achievement for any one party to get an overall majority.  The smaller constituencies we have now are far more workable.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the exchange between Deputy Coogan and myself.  When I named the Dublin-based Ministers in the present Government, as the Deputy always seems to object to anybody with what he calls &ldquo;Jackeen&rdquo; associations some names were left out such as the Minister for Education, Deputy Burke, and <Col N="1028" /> the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Clinton.  As Dublin is expanding at the moment, I suppose we can call the Minister for Local Government, Deputy Tully, a &ldquo;Jackeen&rdquo;, if not now then in the very near future.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Blaney was Minister for Local Government I asked him to do only one small thing.  Some cumainn in my constituency bought a house; I told the Minister to do what he liked but I asked him to leave the house in the constituency.  Of course he did not do that.  Any Ministers with whom I have been associated in constituency revisions have said that what might suit me might not necessarily suit Deputy Briscoe, or Deputy Dowling as the case might be.  Except in broad outline, the details of all Bills in connection with constituency revisions are largely the work of statisticians, mathematicians and officials in the Department of Local Government.  With the exception of a few very obvious points, I find little objection to the Bill.  However, there are some very obvious matters that stick out like a sore thumb and they make the Bill objectionable.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote the Minister when he was in opposition.  At column 1817 of the Official Report dated 4th December, 1968, he said:</P>
    <P>I do not care what any Member of the House says, I have a personal view on this.  I believe that county boundaries are important just as I believe that the national boundary is important and I would not agree that somebody who lives in County Meath would be happy being attached to another county... I do not agree, therefore, that county boundaries should be sundered.  The Minister has a sin to answer for.</P>
    <P>At column 1986 of the Official Report dated 15th November, 1973, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>It is particularly desirable that the historic county boundaries should be preserved as far as possible and that natural communities should not be divided between different constituencies.  In practice, these considerations may be incompatible with one another in certain cases <Col N="1029" /> and in such cases a choice must be made.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to the Ennis-Galway position, the only effort I can see to bring in an extra Labour seat. What the Minister seems to forget is that in a three-seat situation in Dublin he is running a grave risk. Prior to the revision introduced by the then Minister, Mr. Boland, it was mostly a five-seat situation in the Dublin area.  Not on the first occasion but in due course Fianna Fáil succeeded in electing three out of five and in one election when we dropped one of the three seats it was by a matter of four votes.  I refer to the time Deputy Eugene Timmons was the victim of a long count.</P>
    <P>Most of us were in Monaghan in the last four weeks.  Most of us were probably in Mid-Cork and the extent of constituencies such as this was absolutely amazing to me, as a Dublin Deputy.  I moved from one comhairle area to another.  I had to drive 57 miles and I was not going from the extreme north to the extreme south. I am trying to figure out how a Deputy who is elected for a constituency&mdash;he is not elected only for a parish or a part of a constituency but he represents all the people in the constituency&mdash;can give service to these vast areas.  Certainly the Minister has given no recognition to that problem.  There has not been a by-election in County Meath that I can recollect.  But how the Minister can put the county of Cavan and the county of Monaghan in together and make the constituency so much greater than the constituency we recently canvassed is something which I will never understand.</P>

It was something over 50 miles, which means that the constituency was something like 60 miles long.  This is a three-seat constituency. What is it going to be like as a five-seat constituency?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no danger at all about that.  For the Deputy's benefit, as you will recall, Sir, I was recommending that we should maximise on three-seat constituencies all over so that when the people were giving a decision they could give a clearcut, firm decision on whatever Government get in and they would get in with a clear majority and with a mandate and with sufficient strength to make sure they could be held responsible for all their policies and could implement them.  This is what we do not get in very large constituency situations.  As a Fianna Fáil Government on one occasion we were dependent on Independent support and we still lasted as long as two Coalitions.  That day is still to come. We will have it in 1974-75.  It is difficult for a Government to carry out a proper programme policy without a reasonable majority.</P>

      <Col N="1031" /> Again, like the Ennis-Galway thing, this is an extraordinary thing. I was down in Mid-Cork and working in Douglas where they are very nice people.  It is a very nice place and I enjoyed myself there. Douglas is traditionally a Fine Gael area, but now it is voting sensibly Fianna Fáil and we won it for the first time in history.  When I had to go to the count I had to drive nearly half way across the country.  As a four-seat constituency that was obviously too big and unwieldy.  Now it will be a five-seat constituency going right around Cork city and a bit of Cork city has gone into it.</P>

      <P>I am paraphrasing a <Col N="1033" /> general report in the newspapers.  This is what I have been led to believe is the kite that is being flown by the Coalition.  I hope it is a kite, because people will shoot it down, and if it is shot down, then this problem to which I refer will not arise.  In the event of the Government proceeding with these proposals, what I am curious to know is where these people will be, what their constituency will be; will they be self-governing or what will the position be?</P>
      <P>I should like to get on to Dublin, if I may, because in Dublin I see all that is good in the Bill.  If we can gain, as we have done on many occasions, three seats out of five, we can certainly gain two out of three, and it will take only a very small change of public opinion, which is already starting and is very obvious in city areas.</P>

      <P>I do not know how the price of feedstuffs counts with people, but I certainly know how the price of foodstuffs counts with people in Dublin city.  In regard to the constituency of Kildare the Minister says at column 1986, Volume 268 of the Official Report of 15th November last:</P>
      <P>It is particularly desirable that the historic county boundaries should be preserved as far as possible.</P>
      <P>I have already given the quotation from the Minister when he was in opposition.  Bearing that in mind I cannot understand why a constituency called Mid-Dublin and another called West-Dublin will require any parliamentary party that gains two seats in these areas to select one from the city and one from County Kildare. Both of these constituencies are the same.  I know Mid-County goes into Wicklow rather than Kildare, but West County goes into Kildare.  The Minister, when in Opposition, said at column 1817, Volume 237, of the Official Report of 4th December, 1968:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1034" /> I do not care what any Member of the House says, I have a personal view on this and I believe that county boundaries are important, just as I believe the national boundary is important...</P>
    <P>He has the audacity to state that belief and then present us with this when introducing this Bill.  The worst example is the Ennis-Galway one, but here we shall have to have rural and urban people selected if we aspire to two seats in these constituencies, as of course we will do; our city area will be our rural area and our rural area will be our city area.  There are many unusual things about this.  I talked about West Galway; indeed, East Mayo and West Mayo seem peculiar to me as well.</P>

      <P>As far as Deputy Nolan and I are concerned, while it will not be possible to elect two Fianna Fáil Deputies in every constituency, even without any change in the figures available to us for the last couple of elections, there are certainly at this time 18 out of 43 seats.  But what I can tell the Minister and the Government without any fear of contradiction is that if they continue as they are doing there will be two-thirds of those 43 seats which will come to the Fianna Fáil Party when the people once again ask us to clear up the mess.</P>

      <P>Having studied this Bill and listened to and read some of the contributions on it, I am certain that no matter what decent motives the Minister credits to himself&mdash;and he must have had to search very hard for any decent motives for this type of Bill &mdash;it is an attempt to secure a proportion of the seats for the Labour and Fine Gael Parties that is much more than the votes of their supporters warrant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one looks at the map one sees the crooked, tortuous line, the butchering that went on, the unusual little snippets that were taken out here and there and the lack of any overall pattern in the framing of the constituencies. <Col N="1035" /> What I mean by an overall pattern is that there would appear to be a special policy for Dublin city and a different policy for Dublin city of Cork, and an extra special policy for the constituency of Meath; but the same policy was not applied to Wicklow. Any child could easily see through this and that it was political expediency and a desire to hold the reins of office that dictated these changes in the constituencies. There is no need for me to labour this fact when the Chief Whip of the Government Party has already admitted it.</P>
    <P>When a previous Minister, the former Deputy Kevin Boland, was doing his job, the Opposition looked for an independent commission at that time. It is extraordinary that what they felt was so desirable then is not desirable now.  Boland's so-called butchery would not hold a candle to Tully's trickery. The Tullymandering, the bisecting and the trisecting of my own constituency, beggars description.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's bisecting and trisecting&mdash;I shall leave it at that&mdash;beggars description.  The biggest difference I have seen between the carving up of the constituencies on this occasion and the carving up on the previous occasion is that Kevin Boland was prepared to take a chance.  He gave himself a three-seater in South County Dublin and he was elected to the third seat on the eighth count.  Boland's bravery contrasts very forcibly with the timidity of the present occupant of that office. <Col N="1036" /> The Minister, Deputy Tully, was very much afraid to take a chance.  He had a three-seater in Meath; he has now made it a four-seater.  He was afraid he might not be in the first three.  He was lucky to be in third in 1969 and 1973.  In our part of the country, if we have an each-way bet, bookies will pay out only on the first three; in certain big handicaps where there are a lot of runners you might get odds on the first four.  Apparently the Minister had not much faith in his own ability for the next election, and so he made a fourth place.</P>
      <P>With regard to the independent tribunal I believe, and I am not a party spokesman, this is my personal opinion, that this is the proper way to have this matter decided.  I think that we in Fianna Fáil should make this one of the planks of our future policy to be enacted when we resume Government.  I would certainly welcome this and Deputy Molloy has also indicated that he would welcome it.  It is important that the people of Ireland should know that this offer has been made to the Minister.  I am making it to him again now and asking him whether he is turning it down.  It is important that the voters should know that an offer of an independent tribunal or commission was made and that it has been turned down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What was so desirable when Deputy Tully was on this side of the House is no longer palatable to him since he gained ministerial status on the other side of the House.  Of course, we can look upon this as just another broken promise and when one is in the habit of breaking one's promises one may adopt the attitude that one may as well be hung for a sheep as a lamb.  It is now evident to most clear-thinking people that these promises were merely political posturing, that they were motivated by greed and that the present Government were eaten up with the very vices they accused our Government of when we were in office.  It is clear to me that these people, the people of all talents, are now shown up for what they are. They are just a sham as far as I am concerned and their short period in <Col N="1037" /> office has shown them up for what they are.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass mentioned that the word &ldquo;sacrosanct&rdquo; was used in regard to county boundaries.  That word should not be used because &ldquo;sacrosanct&rdquo; comes from the word &ldquo;sacred&rdquo; and it is clear from a cursory examination of these proposals that the word &ldquo;sacred&rdquo; does not enter into it because no county boundary is sacred.  Look at Mid-Cork, a portion deep into the heart of Cork City now being added on to a very ungainly constituency.  Look at Kildare, Wicklow and Clare.  In fact, look anywhere on the map and you will see that boundaries have been breached. I do not think the Minister would fool anyone by the use of the word &ldquo;sacrosanct&rdquo;. To me the use of that word is sacrilegious because no boundary is sacred.</P>
    <P>The key to the Minister's attitude can be seen in his remarks during this Bill and in particular in his many interruptions.  He was not content to tell us about the Bill and sit down and listen to our comments.  He interrupted many times and he seemed to take delight in telling us all that no one personally dislikes the Bill.  He seemed to lay great weight on the word &ldquo;personally&rdquo;.  I would ask the Minister why should personalities enter into this at all.  Personalities should not enter into the carving up of constituencies.  I know they did and very forcibly in the Minister's case but why should the Taoiseach's personal position be safeguarded in Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown?  This attitude, to me, is political fawning at its worst, fawning on the boss.  In the overall thinking on this Bill there must have been a thought in the Minister's mind as to what he could gain personally? That is political patronage at its worst and the fact that the Minister facilitated a Fine Gael Taoiseach indicates to me that he possibly would, as many people now think, feel much more at home with Fine Gael than he does with his former colleagues in Labour.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to know about my personal feelings, I do not care what the Minister does about the constituency.  I defy him to carve up <Col N="1038" /> Kildare and deprive me of my seat.  I will get in in spite of him and Fine Gael and Labour and all the scalpels and long knives in the Custom House. I dislike the overall implications of the Minister's remarks, that he should be thinking personally at all.  I notice that when the Minister interrupted Deputy Moore in the course of his contribution he said:</P>
    <P>I am proud of my work.  I think it is great.  Fantastic.</P>
    <P>Those were the words he used.  One would expect that if the Minister got more opportunity from the Chair he possibly would have come up with that famous remark &ldquo;I am the greatest&rdquo; or, like the person to whom the phrase was first attributed, one could expect Minister Mohammed Tully to break into poetry.  Perhaps this little piece of doggerel, with your indulgence, Sir, would be appropriate:</P>
    <P>In '69 and '73</P>
    <P>The last elected was Jimmy Tully And just in case he slips some more He gives Fianna Fáil two and he makes it four.</P>
    <P>In Meath it is clear to me that party expediency played second fiddle to personal expediency.  It is easy for anybody to see that we will get a second seat in Meath on the next occasion.  It would appear that the Minister had no faith in his own ability and he is quite content to give us an extra seat there and let the rest of the country make up for his shortfall in County Meath.</P>
    <P>When one examines this Bill I think the biggest single defect in it is that Dublin will decide in all future elections what the Government of the country will be.  This, I suppose, is in keeping with a Coalition Government that is pickled with Dublin-based Minister, whether they are sweet pickles or sour pickles remains to be seen.  From an industrtial viewpoint and from a population viewpoint Dublin is top heavy.  The metropolitan area has far too big a population and it needs to be decentralised.  I am told that one of the first signs of decay in a country is when the capital becomes too big.  Dublin has at least two seats more than it should have.  I would ask <Col N="1039" /> the Minister to explain why Celbridge, Maynooth and Leixlip were packed into Dublin and why two portions of Wicklow were clipped off and put into Dublin constituencies.  I am confident that we, the rural people, deserve an extra seat in each and whatever constituency had the extra seat would not suffer thereby.</P>
    <P>Why were 13 three-seaters established in the Dublin Metropolitan area?  My belief is that that was done so that 47 per cent of the voters of the country in the Dublin area would, it is hoped, succeed in getting 33 per cent of the seats and that 25 per cent of the voters would get the same percentage of the seats, 33 per cent.  However, as Deputy Lemass remarked, this might not work out as the mathematicians plan.  Mathematicians' and Ministers' and mice's plans &ldquo;gang aft agley&rdquo; and even the best laid plans in this case will come unstuck, too, because Dublin voters are much more fiickle than their conservative rural brethren and the expected one Labour, one Fine Gael and one Fianna Fáil return in each of the three-seat constituencies in Dublin will not materialise.</P>
    <P>Assuming that those people within the Minister's party who do not agree with him will decide to vote for this Bill, the Minister will find at the next election that the minds of the people cannot be manipulated as easily as can county boundaries.  He will have no control over the votes of people when they go to the booths.  In the tricky three-seater situation in Dublin many of the Minister's Labour, or should I say Coalition colleagues&mdash;although one wonders about the order of preference after the rather passive role of the Assistant Whip yesterday when Deputy Toal was introduced to the House&mdash;will rue the day that this Bill was passed.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the Minister's proposals with which I agree is the decision to have 148 Deputies returned to this House.  No doubt the four extra Deputies will warrant the small amount of extra expense involved.  I am convinced that a Deputy from any <Col N="1040" /> party is a help to any constituency: if he were not, he would not be in office for very long.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of Kildare the Minister's proposals are very disconcerting. The county of Kildare is a growing and developing area.  Before the last change, with the aid of a portion of Meath and of Westmeath, ours was a four-seat constituency but after the last change it was reduced to a three-seater.  The portion of a rural area near Carbury was transferred to Meath for election purposes.  We find now that, despite the growth in our population, it is proposed to retain the constituency as a three-seater and that a built-up portion in the Kilcock area is being transferred to Meath while a small rural area is being given back to us from the former Meath constituency and also that a big chunk of north Kildare&mdash;Celbridge, Maynooth and Leixlip&mdash;is now being transferred to Dublin.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the metropolitan area, Kildare has the highest growth rate in the country.  Our population is greater than that of Meath, and for that reason alone we should have been one of the counties to receive an increase of one seat.  At the time of the last revision the population of Meath was slightly more than that of Kildare.  Possibly that would have swayed the issue in deciding to give three seats to Kildare and four to Meath before the 1969 election; but on this occasion we have the greater population and, consequently, should have had a claim to a fourth seat.</P>
    <P>Kildare was tri-sected to make it a three-seater.  One would wonder why that should have been done, but it is no more than an example of the personal tone that is evident in all the Minister's plans.  The reason why Kildare is being divided in this way&mdash; portion of it being given to Meath and another portion to West County Dublin&mdash;is to ensure that Mr. Terry Boylan would no longer pose a threat so far as votes are concerned.  In order to do this the portion of Kildare that must be cut off would possibly have given a Fianna Fáil nominee a secure base in any new constituency. <Col N="1041" /> Consequently, it was decided to give portion of the constituency to Meath and another portion to Dublin.  Even in the case of Celbridge parish it was decided to divide that parish so that the Straffan portion would remain in Kildare and the Celbridge portion would go to West County Dublin.  This was done with the intention of helping the Labour Party, or perhaps, a stag party might be more appropriate. My colleague, Deputy Bermingham on the opposite benches will know what I mean.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand why a portion of Kildare that was necessary to give Meath four seats some years ago could now be given back to Kildare while Kilcock and another portion of Kildare is being given to Meath.  The desired result of this effort is to ensure that Mr. Boylan's base will be such as not to have a significant bearing on his new Dublin constituency.  Enough butchering has been done to deprive him of a seat in Kildare.  I am amazed that the Minister should have considered the Labour Party to be so vulnerable. Indeed, the Minister's action is no compliment to Deputy Bermingham. He must not have much faith in the good work that Deputy Bermingham is doing in the constituency.  The only difference I see between the Minister's actions regarding Leinster and Cromwell's action in relation to the whole country is that while Cromwell said &ldquo;To hell or to Connacht&rdquo;, the Minister, to give him his due, gave Kildare people a choice in that they could go either to hell or to Meath or Dublin.</P>
    <P>I have some interesting figures here regarding Kildare.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would convey them to the Minister.  These figures show the decline in population which occurred in that county between the years 1841 and 1971.  In 1841 Kildare county had a population of 114,488 persons.  It is interesting to note that in the same year Dublin, which comprised the county and county borough, had only 372,733 persons.  At that stage Dublin was hardly three times bigger than Kildare but in the meantime the population of Dublin has increased every year, <Col N="1042" /> or at least for every year in which a census was taken, and the figure for 1971 was 852,219.  Kildare's population dwindled consistently every year from 1841 to 1936 when the population was 57,892.  Perhaps it is significant that in 1936 the policies pursued by the then new Fianna Fáil Government who had only taken office a short time before began to have effect and on upward spiral began in Kildare at that time.  There was a slight decrease from 1951 to 1961, the population being a little more than 66,000 in 1951 and a little more than 64,000 in 1961 but the figure has increased every year since and at the last census our population was 71,977 so that there were 5,500 more people in Kildare in 1971 than there were in 1966.</P>
    <P>The Minister has decided to put into other constituencies the areas of our county in which there was the greatest growth rate.  The people of Kildare will not be very happy about that.  At the time of the Normans the Fitzgerald family established Kildare as their base, erecting a castle in Maynooth and another at Kilkea and they decided on the boundaries of Kildare.  These boundaries remained unchanged from the time of the Great Earls and the time of the halycon days of the Geraldines but the Minister has changed that.  He might as well go the whole hog and change the name of Leinster House, the town residence of the Fitzgeralds, and of Kildare Street to West Dublin House and West Dublin Street from now on.  With very little help we would have had the population to warrant four seats.  Our county boundaries demanded that.  If the remarks which are credited to him when matters like this were being discussed mean anything, he should have given Kildare back to the Kildare people.  We deserve another voice in the Dáil; we are entitled to that.  I know the people in the Carbery and other areas would prefer to be in a Kildare constituency.  The Minister should apply to Kildare the same guidelines he applied to his constituency.</P>
    <P>When this Bill is discussed and analysed the people will not thank the Minister for giving Dublin a say out of all proportion to its size.  That is <Col N="1043" /> the Bill's biggest defect.  The Minister is denying rural areas the representation they deserve, not alone from a population point of view but also because of geographical factors.  Rural constituencies are much more unwiedly than city constituencies.  Local people must travel long distances in order to maintain contact with their Deputies.  For that reason I feel Kildare deserves an extra seat.  Dublin could easily have been restructured. The two seats which were given to the metropolitan area could have been given to Kildare and Wicklow.  Regretfully, I am confident that the Kildare voters in the Meath and Dublin constituencies will not be of sufficient number to succeed in electing a Kildare man.  Two divisions saw to that. As we know from experience, political loyalties do not pass over county boundaries.  People now in Kildare will not feel properly represented in the metropolitan area.</P>
    <P>A name will often succeed in electing a person to a Dublin constituency. I do not know what criteria the city voters use when electing representatives, but many people are elected who would not be in the first three in a rural constituency.  If the Minister cannot change the Bill at this stage, and he must persist with three seats in Kildare, why does he not apply the same test to Meath?  Why should he show the white feather with regard to Meath?  He should take a chance on his re-election.  He should be confident in the fact that he is a Minister and in the news every day.  He is seen opening new housing estates and so on and taking credit for them.  He directs operations from his lofty eyrie in the Customs House.  He should not be afraid that the people of Meath will not think the world of him at the next election and return him to a three-seat constituency.  If he wants to cover up the skullduggery he hopes to enact in this Bill he should show an overall pattern.  Why should he have three-seaters in Dublin and a five-seater in Cork?  Why take a chunk out of Cork City and put it into Mid-Cork? My only remark on the carving up of Mid-Cork is that after the next <Col N="1044" /> election the Minister will be wise after the event.</P>
    <P>This Bill will have far-reaching effects on politics.  It is sad to think that the Minister will be remembered for this Bill and this Bill alone; a Minister who kept his seat while everyone about him was losing his.  The Minister should feel ashamed of himself, if he has any sense of shame.  It is evident in every carve-up that it is political patronage at its most vile; it is party advantage carried to extremes that nobody could defend, and, worst of all, it is his personal salvation ensured to the extent of giving us a seat.  It is no wonder it took the Minister so long to produce this shameful sham.</P>

      <P>This is the first time I have addressed the House on an Electoral (Amendment) Bill.  With no disrespect to the Parliamentary Secretary, I am sorry the Minister is not here to hear my comments.  We have all been waiting for this Bill which was promised and expected since the election last February.  Any time the Minister was asked a question he smiled or laughed and said that the Bill was coming.  One expected it to be a wonderful production for which the Minister would be remembered and that it would follow the lines he had preached for so long in Opposition while adopting a holier-than-thou attitude.  In the early summer he promised to have the Bill ready in July.  Of course, the Minister was not able to keep that promise, like many other promises.  We are all aware of the reasons why he could not do so.  There was in-fighting between the two parties forming the Coalition. Members of these parties, who had been so long in Opposition, were determined that they would introduce a Bill which would keep the Coalition Government in power for at least another term of office.  Despite the Minister's confidence in his own ability, I do not think that even a man far superior in ability would have been able to introduce a Bill to achieve this because many mistakes have been made up to now.  However, he has tried, and tried to the best of his ability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1045" /> One striking aspect of the Bill is its inconsistencies.  The influence of the two parties is obvious from the document before us.  It reminds me of a chunk of wood which was round at the beginning but when each member had finished chipping and adding, it had become a very peculiar shape. When the last Bill was introduced somebody described it as a &ldquo;Bolander&rdquo;; this could be described as a &ldquo;Tullyar&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I was coming to that point because there was a lot of biting done in Cork and I think the mongrel foxes played a big part. I offer my sincere sympathy to the Minister because, despite his faults and despite the complaints and criticisms we will voice of him, I accept that he is a hard-working Minister and that he is determined to do his job to the best of his ability. I am sorry that this production is so definitely designed to gerrymander the constituencies to give him the result he and his Government would like to see.  The mistake they are all making is that they are forgetting that the people of Ireland are very sensible when it comes to voting, and they will give this Bill their answer at the first available opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will have many worries between now and the next general election.  He will worry about the eventual result of the election.  He will worry about how many seats his Government will get.  He will also worry about how many seats his <Col N="1046" /> own party will get.  Therein lies the crunch.  This is where the Minister will be regarded as having failed the Labour Party throughout the length and breath of the country.  This will be proved to him in the next general election.  It will react on him and on his party in a very unfavourable way when the opportunity arises.</P>
    <P>I suppose we are all parochial on a Bill such as this.  There are areas with which we are familiar and there are areas we do not know so well.  To those of us who do not know the area so well, it seems a bit peculiar to see a big chunk of Clare added to West Galway.  I wonder did the Minister forget the promise he made to keep the county boundaries intact so far as possible.  That one went a bit lobsided on him.  We all know why that constituency is being so framed. Deputy Power has already mentioned his own constituency.  A Minister who sat in Opposition for so long, and adopted a holier-than-thou attitude, and talked about how he would treat such a Bill if he were given the opportunity, should have set an example instead of entrenching his own position and perhaps upsetting the position of some of his colleagues.</P>
    <P>This is typical of the Government. I am glad the Parliamentary Secretary is here because he is a Munster man. He is one of the few men from outside the Greater Dublin area in the Government.  This Bill is giving more power to the metropolitan area and this gives people down the country reasonable grounds for criticism.  It is worth looking at the situation in Cork. Cork City has six seats under the existing arrangement.  The Minister has now seen fit to downgrade Cork City and to reduce its representation in the city, as such, by one seat.  The people of Cork will remember that for the Minister.  They will look at Dublin and see that he gave Dublin all three seat constituencies with the exception of the Taoiseach's constituency. That is an interesting one and I will come back to it later.</P>
    <P>The Minister decided that he would reduce the representation in Cork, the second largest city in Ireland, by one seat.  Naturally the first question everybody must ask is: why?  Why <Col N="1047" /> should the Minister look at Cork and decide to reduce Cork City by one seat and give that seat to Mid-Cork? This is one of the jokes in this Bill. When the previous Electoral Amendment Bill was introduced the constituency of Mid-Cork got most of the criticism from the Opposition at that time.  It was referred to as a monstrosity. It was referred to as a constituency that crawled almost from Cork City Hall out to the county boundaries of Kerry and Limerick.  It was suggested that it was an impossible constituency to work.</P>
    <P>While agreeing that it is a very big constituency, I think the four representatives from that area would not say that it is impossible to work, nor could the people say they did not work hard enough for them.  The joke is that now, when these people who spoke so loudly, so strongly and so clearly about Mid-Cork are in office, approximately 15,000 voters from Cork City have been added on to make Mid-Cork a five-seater.  If you look at this area which has been added on to Mid-Cork you will discover that included in it are some of the older parts of Cork City, traditional old areas.  I refer specifically to Bandon Road and The Lough, to places like Gillabbey and Togher.  I cannot say when University College, Cork, was built but it is no longer in the Cork City constituency.</P>
    <P>The voters of these areas are included in Mid-Cork and we welcome them.  We welcome working for them but I do not think it is sensible to think that the same type of representation can represent some of the older areas of Cork City and some of the outlying rural areas.  Obviously this was done with a purpose and this is where I think the mongrel foxes bit the deepest.  The people of Cork will not blame the Minister to the same extent as they will blame the Minister for Transport and Power for their own city.  As a Government Minister from that city, he would have been expected to show a greater regard for the people of Cork and for the area of Cork generally.  Obviously he used his influence and his powers of persuasion <Col N="1048" /> on the Minister to have this constituency divided in the way it has been divided.  This is very interesting. I am sorry the Minister is not here so that I could tell him a few things.</P>

      <P>It is significant that the areas coming into Mid-Cork are the Labour areas of the city.  They are traditionally Cork City, having long links with Cork City.  As I said, we welcome these areas; we welcome the voters in them and we will certainly work in their interests.  Nevertheless, this change is really a tragedy.  It is something that will not be forgotten for the Minister when it comes to facing the people.  The Minister for Transport and Power must share most of the blame because it is obvious his powers of persuasion on the Minister for Local Government exercised a strong influence on the Minister's final decision.  It may interest the Minister to know that his own party members in the city are most disappointed because of the areas which have been taken out of Mid-Cork.  Blackrock and Douglas were in Mid-Cork at one stage, but they were not moved out because that would not have suited the Minister for Transport and Power. This addition has a specific purpose behind it.  The Minister has let down his own party in dividing Cork City. Again we have the inconstituency of a five-seat constituency in Cork City, a five-seat constituency in Mid-Cork and the city of Dublin carrying mainly three-seat constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the debate on the last Electoral (Amendment) Bill in 1968, at column 1725 of Volume 238, Deputy Barrett, the predecessor of the present Minister for Transport and Power, referred to the unfairness of having residents in Blackrock and Douglas within a quarter and half mile of Cork City Hall having to depend for their representation on rural Deputies living throughout the county.  What was true of Blackrock and Douglas then is equally true now of Ballyphehane, Gillabbey, Bandon Road and the Lough.  The argument used then by Deputy Barrett applies with equal <Col N="1049" /> force today.  It is, of course, a question of designing an area to try to help the present Government.</P>
    <P>I have a message to give the Minister: the reconstructed Cork City and Mid-Cork will give us in Fianna Fáil the very same representation as we now hold in the next general election and the Minister's party in the city will not forgive him for the way in which he has treated them, considering he had an opportunity of winning a seat there.</P>

It would be foolish of me to say I have a personal complaint because my personal complaint is not important in the long run.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach is in the House at the moment and he was one of the people that publicly stated on very many occasions that electroal amendments should not be made by a Minister for Local Government or by the Government but that a commission should be set up for this purpose.

      <P>Would you bring the Parliamentary Secretary to order, Sir?  He has an unfortunate habit of interrupting.  This is the first electoral Bill since I came into this House.  It is a sore disappointment.  I am disappointed that the Minister designed what he regards as a Bill to keep his Government in power.  I am disappointed that he should have yielded to the pressure put on him by both parties and the in-fighting which was known all over this House, the in-fighting that went on for months and delayed the Bill for months, with Senator John Mannion and others putting in their spoke in regard to the townlands they wanted in their constituencies. When the parties opposite were in Opposition they stood in these benches and preached about what should be done and what they would do if given the opportunity but, when given the opportunity, this is what they produce.  As I said, this is the &ldquo;Tullyar&rdquo; which fell at the final fence.  In the next general election the Minister and the Government will have many worries about how many seats they will win.  I have a message for the Minister: the people at the grassroots level of his own party are not happy and the Members opposite will be less happy when the general election is over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The only conclusion that I can come to is that the Minister for Local Government consulted with all of his Deputies before the introduced this Bill and that they are happy with what has been presented to this House. I am surprised at this and, in particular, I am surprised at the Deputies from the west of Ireland.  Under this Bill the west of Ireland will lose two seats.  I cannot understand why the Fine Gael Deputies from the west of Ireland accepted this.  There is no point in them saying that they had not been consulted about it or that they did not know about it because everybody knows that for a few months previous to the introduction of this Bill they had the soles of their shoes worn going in and out to the Minister for Local Government in an effort to carve up their own constituencies to suit themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a fact particularly in relation to County Galway which, under this Bill, will be divided into two four-seats constituencies.  It is obvious that a seat will be lost in County Galway. This is unfortunate.  I know we cannot blame the Minister for juggling the constituencies in an effort to get the most out of them for his own political end.  This had been done before.  However, it is unfortunate that the west of <Col N="1052" /> Ireland, over which so many crocodile tears have been shed, should be deprived of two voices in this House.</P>
    <P>We know that when the Taoiseach was appointing his Ministers he almost forgot the west of Ireland.  All he gave to the entire western region was one Parliamentary Secretary.</P>

This is something that should concern those representing that area of the country.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach has admitted that the population in the west was sufficient to elect 30 Deputies as has happened in the past.  That cannot be denied.

However, I do not believe this will happen because if the present swing against the Government continues it will lead to a change of Government.</P>
      <P>In my view the most important thing is that in the west of Ireland it takes more people to elect a Deputy than it does in Dublin.  This is a grave injustice against the west and it should not be allowed to happen.  I should like to protest again against the Minister's action in reducing the representation of the west of Ireland by two Members.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important piece of legislation although the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach feels that a limited amount of time should be devoted to it.  This legislation can manipulate the affairs of the nation for the next eight or <Col N="1055" /> nine years.  This Bill, in my view, is a device to maintain power.</P>
      <P>The people of the six north-eastern counties of this country must be very depressed to think that there is a Government here that sets out to do the same thing that they have been fighting against for many years.  This Bill is an effort to gerrymander this section of the country.  We are aware of the difficulties that exist in the North; we know of the trouble that resulted there due to the gerrymandering that took place over the years.  I shall just quote the Minister for Foreign Affairs when he said, in an article printed in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on 12th November, 1972, that for 50 years Unionist control of government in Northern Ireland was extended far beyond the areas where the Unionists secured a majority of votes.  This, he said, was done by gerrymandering, by rigging the constituency boundaries in such a way as to convert a minority of votes into a majority of seats.  Of course, we now have the riggers in Government here who will ensure that the area is gerrymandered. We should know by now the terrible tragedies that resulted from consistent gerrymandering over the years in another part of this country.  No doubt the Unionists in the North will read this discussion with interest and see how the Fine Gael and Labour Parties have endeavoured to gerrymander the situation here.  I am certain that they will say that should they come in here they will be subjected to the same treatment which is regarded as so undesirable in that part of the country.  I am certain that the Northern community will be watching the situation here and we want to tell them now that this is a Bill to gerrymander this part of the country.  It is a type of treatment they would possibly get under a Government such as we have here at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will not be two parties, Fine Gael and Labour, contesting the next election.  There will be only one party and this Bill is so devised that it will be for one party and one party in Opposition.  We welcome the day <Col N="1056" /> when we shall meet on equal terms one party comprised of Fine Gael and Labour.  An effort was made in Monaghan to establish that party.  So, some members of the Labour Party were distrubed by some of the meetings which took place in Monaghan between Members of the Government and numbers of people in corners in order to bring about a position in which they would form one party. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach may not have been aware of this development but some Labour Party Members feel that their Ministers in this Coalition are losing their identity and are being absorbed into this great gerrymander machine that we see in action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>If they had steered clear of the campaign the Deputy would have said they were not behind the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>They participated in the campaign and they set in train a situation in which the workers of this city who supported Labour in the last election will have completely lost their identity because I am sure very few of them would support Fine Gael.  The only party we shall have in the next election will be a combination of Fine Gael and Labour.</P>
      <P>So long as Labour Party supporters are aware of what is happening at this early stage, that some of their people are now betraying them in order to assure themselves of Ministerial posts in a future Government should the people be foolish enough to re-elect them, I am certain that the collective wisdom of our people will give an answer to the present Government when the time comes.  We have relied on that wisdom through the years and the people have responded in a responsible way on every occasion. Only on two occasions since 1932, other than the last occasion, did we have a change but never did either Fine Gael or Labour get a clear mandate from the electorate.  When on the next occasion we have only the one Party we shall see how the people will feel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This type of gerrymander and constituency rigging which the Minister <Col N="1057" /> for Foreign Affairs spoke about in his article is exactly what is happening here now.  The Parliamentary Secretary cannot deny this and that this is an attempt to rig the constituencies. This is a fact that cannot be denied and I want to say that here and now so that people north, south, east and west fully understand it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and well the Parliamentary Secretary knows this. I am certain that the people in the North will be watching the situation here to see if a responsible Government will devise electoral areas to the satisfaction of the community as a whole.  They now can see this Bill which is designed to do just the opposite. It is designed to do what a group of people were condemned for doing for so long and so violently in the six north-eastern counties.</P>
      <P>I support the view of the Minister for Foreign Affairs when he spoke recently about the type of situation which evolved there.  We do not want that here; we have no time for it and I am quite certain that in time the people here will give their answer.  It is a question of how many seats that party will get.  I do not know the names or even the form of the party. I am not sure if the Parliamentary Secretary will have a position in it but nevertheless there were Ministers who took part in discussions regarding the formation of a combined party of Fine Gael and Labour.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary knows about it.</P>

      <P>Through the Chair, I want to say that I am quite positive he was.  He was up there and so I am sure he was familiar with the set-up. As many speakers have pointed out, we have, first, the Minister for Local Government who has apportioned his constituency in such a way that he must retain his seat, or so he hopes. He has added a further seat so that this upholstered constituency which had three seats will now have four. This is to make sure that he as a Minister will be re-elected.  Again, the people will have their say.</P>
      <P>Many Deputies have made the important point regarding the western problem, which is a very serious one. In Opposition members of the present Government shed many tears for the people of the west but the amazing fact is that when they came to power, as Deputy Hussey and others pointed out, not one Minister was appointed from the west of Ireland, showing their complete disregard for the west. But for the fact that it was mentioned here, when the Taoiseach had his Cabinet lined up, that he completely forgot the west, I am quite certain the Taoiseach would not even have appointed a Parliamentary Secretary who comes from west of the Shannon. We have a situation of complete disregard for the people of the west of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a complete disregard for the west but the people will give the Government their answer when the time comes.  At column 2012 of the Official Report dated 15th November the following is stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Examples of this manipulation can be found in what has been done in Dublin.  The proposed revision is North County Dublin, three seats, population 59,514; Dublin/Cabra, three seats, population 59,314 Dublin/Clontarf, three seats, population <Col N="1059" /> 58,592; Dublin North-Central three seats, population 58,357; Dublin South-East, three seats, population 57,875, making a total of 15 seats for a population of 293,652 persons.  Compare that with the following constituencies in the West; Sligo-Leitrim, three seats, population 63,030; Roscommon-Leitrim, three seats, population 63,358; East Galway, four seats, population 83,176; Donegal, five seats, population 105,509, making a total of 15 seats for a population of 315,073 persons. In the Dublin area mentioned there is a total of 15 seats for 293,652 persons; in the western area mentioned there is a total of 315,073 for 15 seats.  There is a difference of 21,421 persons.  To elect 15 TDs in the five constituencies in Dublin you need 21,421 fewer people than it takes to elect a similar number of TDs in the Western constituencies.</P>
    <P>A complete disregard for the west was shown in this electoral Bill&mdash;it might be called the &ldquo;anti-west device&rdquo; because it is designed to ensure that the population of the west will not get the same kind of representation as the people in the capital.  During the years we have heard from the people on the Government benches that the west needs assistance. However, the Taoiseach disregarded it in the composition of his Cabinet and the Government are gerrymandering the constituencies to deprive people in the west of representation. One might ask what will be the Government's attitude in relation to western development in the future? Will the west get the same kind of treatment that is evident in this anti-west device and in the Taoiseach's appointment of personnel?</P>
    <P>I sympathise with Deputy Hussey and other speakers from the west who spoke about their concern because their people will be deprived of adequate representation.  In these scattered constituencies it is necessary and desirable that the tolerance should act in favour of them but it is obvious the Government do not believe that. This Bill was designed by the Minister for Local Government, who upholstered <Col N="1060" /> a seat for himself in his own constituency, because of the pressures placed on him to deprive the west.  A group of Ministers and pressure groups in the city insisted that the west be further denuded not only of people but of representation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to sympathise with Deputies who spoke here about giving greater representation to the west.  As I pointed out already, to elect 15 Deputies in the five constituencies in Dublin requires 21,421 fewer people than it takes to elect a similar number in the west, notwithstanding the fact that during the years the emphasis has been on greater representation from the west.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out earlier, the Taoiseach did not think it worthwhile to appoint a Minister from the west and it was not until he was so prompted that he decided to appoint a Parliamentary Secretary.  There has been a complete disregard by the Taoiseach, the Government and members of Fine Gael and Labour for the western constituencies.  However, Fine Gael and Labour will not be together for long; as we saw in Monaghan there is only one party but they will get their answer from the workers of this city.</P>

      <P>Since this debate started there has been talk about <Col N="1061" /> every election, not just Monaghan, and also about future elections that will occur in the revised gerrymandered constituencies.  The concern of Deputy Hussey and others from the western constituencies regarding the reduced representation is not shared by some Deputies.  Some of those elected for constituencies in the west are deserting their supporters who sent them here time and again. Deputy Coogan and his friends will support this Bill to deprive their people of an additional voice in Dáil Éireann.  We want to ensure that the people in that section of the country get the representation to which they are entitled.  When the time comes no doubt Deputy Coogan will be forced into the lobby with other Members elected by the people in the west on the last occasion to deprive those people of this additional voice.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the in-fighting that went on in relation to the maintenance of seats by members of Fine Gael and the Labour Party and of the various pressure groups which are in existence and have been a prime pressure factor on the Minister for Local Government for the last six or 12 months.  The Minister indicated on many occasions that the was ready to bring in the Bill the following week, but it went to the week after and the week after that again.  It took a long period before he was allowed to bring the Bill to the House.  We now have this long-awaited measure which will deprive the people in that section of the country of the representation to which they are entitled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The present gerrymandering is taking place on the very same basis: the rigging of the constituency boundaries, and the gerrymandering that has caused so much suffering and so many problems to so many people not far from here. We hope the Minister and the Government will see sense and ensure that representation will be extended to the areas where there is the greatest need and that tolerance will operate in favour of people in those areas.</P>
      <P>It is obvious from the Bill that the Government have completely deserted the western seaboard and that they will get the unanimous support of their backbenchers in that desertion. It will be interesting to see how many of the Deputies who represent western constituencies will go into the lobby and vote against this Bill, because by voting for it they are voting to reduce the representation in the constituencies that most deserve additional representation.  Some of the constituencies have been dealt with here in detail by other speakers.  I do not intend to dwell too long on other constituencies; I have dealt with the west to some extent.  Paragraph 12 of the Explanatory Memorandum says:</P>
      <P>Maps will be deposited shortly in the Oireachtas Library indicating the proposed constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has completely misled the House by giving erroneous information in the Bill or on the map, because the Bill is different from the <Col N="1067" /> map, especially in my constituency. I have not studied the other constituencies, because I have the map of my own constituency only.  A completely different area is indicated in the Dublin-Ballyfermot area in the Bill as distinct from the map.  I wonder is this a deliberate error, an attempt to mislead the House.  A person might look at the map or read the Bill, because at all times the map would not be side by side with the Bill.  This may be an effort to mislead the Attorney General, who would seem to be the person most likely to fall.</P>
    <P>As regards the registers that are outlined, if the map is correct, then the Bill is wrong, and if the map is wrong, then other constituencies are wrong.  I do not know how the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary will explain this away.  I do not know whether it is deliberate, but I would be inclined to think it was deliberate. Taking into consideration the pressures that were on the Minister, he may have been confused, or if he was not confused then it was a deliberate act to mislead some Deputies who he felt might just look at the map and be satisfied with the division of their constituencies.  I hope that by the time this Bill reaches Committee Stage the Minister will have rectified this situation and that the Attorney General, Deputy Declan Costello, will then be in full possession of the facts, because I understand he was a very worried man.</P>

It is just to inform the gentleman that there is this knife brigade who are out to ensure that he is not re-elected, and they are doing it in this way.  I want to draw it to his attention.  I am sure that when he reads the Official Report and examines the map and the registers he will see how he was misled by Deputy Tully and Deputy Cosgrave and other people who told him they would give him a safe seat.</P>

    <P>A great deal of in-fighting has gone on over the last six or eight months. There have been problems in the Labour Party and in Fine Gael over who would go, who would stay, who would be promoted, who would be demoted and who would be fixed up here and there should certain eventualities take place.  No doubt they have made arrangements for every type of eventuality for some Deputies; other Deputies will be left to fend for themselves. It is common knowledge that certain Deputies will be facilitated by the Government before they go out of power because out of power they will go at the next election when the <Col N="1069" /> people get the opportunity to decide. However you endeavour to rig the constituencies, the people will become aware of this rigging in a short time. However you endeavour to deprive people of their just representation, the people will become aware of this and they will give their answer as they have done on so many occasions in the past.  Deputy Coughlan is probably quite happy with the set up.</P>

      <P>I was interested to hear Deputy Dowling state that Dublin is over-represented.  I hope the people of Dublin will understand this when it comes to the next election. He talks about gerrymandering.  This Bill would be completely lost in the gerrymander that was carried out on the last occasion.  Of course, we know the fate that befell the Fianna Fáil Minister who carried out the gerrymander.  I challenge Deputy Dowling to tell us any peculiarity in the Dublin area which would compare with Clondalkin being in North County Dublin.  He has endeavoured to make much capital of the Minister's decision to have three-seater constituencies in Dublin, but I would like to remind Fianna Fáil that it is not so very long ago since they, even at the expense of a referendum, endeavoured to create single-seat constituencies in Dublin.</P>

      <P>Possibly, but opposed bitterly by many Members of Fianna Fáil.  After the result of that referendum had been made known I heard the <i>pro tem</i> leader of the Opposition, Deputy Lynch, state that he was glad the people had spoken and had given their decision in no uncertain manner and that they had shown they wished for the retention of the PR system.  It was not very long afterwards that Fianna Fáil proceeded to reduce practically every constituency in Ireland.  As a <Col N="1073" /> result of the last gerrymander there were only two five-seaters in the country.  If it is the position that larger constituencies are needed to ensure the most effective working of PR, one must congratulate the present Minister in that at least there are more five-seaters now than there were after the Fianna Fáil carve-up.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Fianna Fáil advocated the three-seater constituency in the west of Ireland when it suited them to do so.  How many times have that party re-arranged constituencies? They say now that the Minister should have left the matter to a commission but despite all the opportunities they have had to do this they never before suggested a commission. Yet they tell us that we should take this step.  I would remind them that in the past they despised every attempt by this party to have such a commission set up.  Their change of heart stems from the answer they received in no uncertain terms in the recent by-election.  They know that the people support fully the policy of the National Coalition and no amount of talk from the Opposition will succeed in disillusioning the people or in giving them the impression that this Minister has been less fair than was the Minister responsible for the last revision.  The present Minister has been more fair than Mr. Boland was and has not breached as many county boundaries as were breached on the last occasion.</P>
      <P>In the west of Ireland Fianna Fáil have a very slender majority over Fine Gael.  So far as I am aware they have 11 seats in the entire west as against Fine Gael's ten.  There is no point in Fianna Fáil shedding crocodile tears in regard to this Bill. Looking at the map of the proposed revision one can see that county boundaries look much more natural now than in the past.  We will not have the ridiculous situation of Clondalkin and Newcastle being in North County Dublin with Balbriggan.</P>

      <P>The last speaker's contribution was a record in terms of the length of time he spent in making it, that was, some five or six minutes.  However, that is an indication of the type of pressure that is being brought to bear on the Coalition cacophony, cackle, group or parties&mdash;call them what you will&mdash; by the Whip.  Apparently they are not allowed even to interrupt Fianna Fáil speakers now.  All this is indicative of the concern they have for this, probably one of the most infamous pieces of legislation ever proposed in this House.  It is a gross piece of hypocrisy for the present group&mdash;the Government for the time being&mdash;to come here and produce this Bill having regard to what they said in relation to the revision of constituencies while they were in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who recall their opposition to the last electoral amendment Bill must be shocked to see them introduce the Bill now before us.  The Dáil debates of that time are littered with statements about the propriety and probity of setting up independent commissions and about <Col N="1075" /> the matter of the breaching of county boundaries, which Deputy Belton spoke so glibly of, while in this instance county boundaries have been breached many times throughout the Bill.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to refer to the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown to be known after the enacting of this Bill as the constituency of Dún Laoghaire.  This constituency which happens to be the Taoiseach's, is being subjected to the most gross piece of gerrymandering ever to take place in the history of this State.  This gerrymandering has been carried out to the extent that back gardens were syphoned off from the constituency to be put into the new constituency of South County Dublin.  Indeed one might say that some garden sheds have not been missed in the proposed gerrymander. It is my intention, too, to place on the record of the House the piece of drafting which purports to bring about that gerrymandering.  Apart from the drafting, the Bill is a lot of gobbledegook and is couched in complicated and confusing language.  One can have nothing but the utmost contempt for the entire Bill.</P>
    <P>The part of the Schedule which deals with the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown will be seen in its proper context when put on the record.  I understand that, unless I place this Schedule on the records, it will not find its way into the report. I quote from page 6 of the Bill:</P>
    <P>... commencing at the point where the centre line of Kilmacud Road Upper meets northern boundary of the district electoral division, then in a south-westerly direction along the centre of Kilmacud Road Upper to the point where is meets the imaginary north-westerly projection of the southern boundary of St. Joseph's Carmelite Monastery&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To get back to this piece of gobbledegook to which I have referred, and which is contained in the Schedule to the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1973.  Page 6 of the Schedule relates to the constituency of Dún Laoghaire as mentioned in the Bill but refers to the existing constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. It states in the most beautiful of bureaucratic language</P>
      <P>In the administrative county of Dublin, the district electoral divisions of:</P>
      <P>Stillorgan Number Two, Stillorgan Number Three, Stillorgan Number Four, Stillorgan Number Five;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1080" /> and that part of the district electoral division of Stillorgan Number One situated within a line drawn as follows:</P>
    <P>commencing at the point where the centre line of Kilmacud Road Upper meets the northern boundary of the district electoral division then in a south-westerly direction along the centre of Kilmacud Road Upper to the point where it meets the imaginary north-westerly projection of the southern boundary of St. Joseph's Carmelite Monastery, then continuing, initially in a south-easterly direction, along the aforesaid projection and boundary to the point where it meets the western boundary of No. 75 Merville Road, then continuing, initially in a south-easterly direction, along the western boundary of each of the following&mdash;No. 75 Merville Road, Merville Road and No. 78 Merville Road&mdash;to the point where the western boundary of No. 78 Merville Road meets the rear boundary of No. 1 Weirview Drive, then continuing, initially in a south-westerly direction, along the rear boundary of the houses on the western and southern sides of Weirview Drive to the point where the rear boundary of No. 131 Weirview Drive meets the southern boundary of the Electricity Supply Board property on Brewery Road, then continuing from that point, initially in an easterly direction, along the southern boundary of the said property and the imaginary easterly projection of that boundary to the point where that projection meets the district electoral division boundary, then continuing, initially in a northeasterly direction, along the district electoral division boundary to the point first mentioned;</P>
    <P>and the borough of Dún Laoghaire.</P>
    <P>What a piece of infamy?  What a deliberate and calculated attempt to be carried in this House, unfortunately, <Col N="1081" /> by virtue of the number of Deputies in Government <i>vis-à-vis</i> the number of Deputies in Opposition. Back gardens and boundary walls were breached to ensure that known Fianna Fáil supporters in the constituency would be lopped off at the whim of the Government Deputies in the constituency.  If you continue the gerrymandering line from Stillorgan to Shankill, you find that in parts of Rochestown Avenue, a road known to myself and Deputy Desmond, a very large group of his own supporters, in fairness to Deputy Desmond, and supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party have been gerrymandered out of the constituency to make things easier for the Coalition party.</P>
    <P>I will be dealing with the map as it relates to the Bill shortly, but that part of the map of the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown has to be seen to be believed.  It looks as if somebody put his hands into a jar of sweets and took a bundle of sweets from one place and put it in another. The same thing happened in relation to the map.  They said: &ldquo;We will take that part of Weirview Drive from here and put it into South County Dublin and so on up along the proposed new boundary of the constituency which will be known as Dún Laoghaire.  Chunks were taken from here and there right along the line.  It is an incredible performance.  I can imagine the situation which confronted Deputy Tully&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government.  There was a knock on the door and who presented themselves to the Minister led by the respected Taoiseach but Deputy Desmond with Deputy Percy Dockrell hovering in the background.  This is pure speculation.  I have no evidence that this happened.  One can only speculate but this speculation is probably correct and proper.  They would describe the Minister as Jim and say: &ldquo;Here we are Jim, the three of us. We would like to discuss the legislation you intend to introduce in Dáil <Col N="1082" /> Éireann.&rdquo;  Then they would produce their own views on what it was best to do from the point of view of the Coalition party to retain their three existing Deputies, Deputy Cosgrave, Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Desmond.  They would then say: &ldquo;Good bye Jim.  Thanks Jim.  That will be all right Jim.&rdquo;  Of course they got their way.</P>
      <P>I accept that Deputy Desmond is in a more difficult position.  Of course, it is well known now that the Labour Party will be consumed by and become integrated into the Fine Gael Party, so Deputy Desmond will bear the tag of Fine Gael if not at the next election at the election after that. There is no doubt about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a reputation he will have forever.  To come back to the matter of the constituency boundaries and the denials of the Labour Party, it was understandable that the Fine Gael juggernaut in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire would overcome the lesser weight of the so-called Labour left.  I have already quoted from the schedule a lengthy piece of complicated drafting to ensure the continued welfare of the Coalition party in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown to be known as the constituency of Dún Laoghaire. Undoubtedly, the Taoiseach, Deputy Dockrell and Deputy Desmond conspired together to ensure that the Coalition party would be kept in office for a considerable time to come.  They made one very serious mistake.  The people in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown will realise the extent of the gerrymander hoodwink perpetrated on them and the deliberate and cold and mechanical fashion in which the gerrymander was brought about to the extent of actually breaching the borough boundary.  That is how it was organised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As we know in this constituency the Fine Gael Party have quite considerable support, and fair enough.  Equally in a number of areas to my certain knowledge, they have a number of very good people who have decided themselves to the welfare of the party in which they have believed over the years.  They are good people.  I do not deny that.  While I may not agree with a man's political views, it is good to see him with a commitment.  I do not criticise people for their involvement in the Fine Gael Party, quite the contrary, but these individuals would know, properly so, where their vote is in their own locality and, of course, their messages were coming in from the various parts of the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown to the Taoiseach and to Deputy Dockrell and, I have no doubt, to their Coalition party colleague Deputy Desmond: if you keep that part of the constituency in you will be all right; if you keep that part of the constituency out it will be equally all right because that part of the constituency contains a greater number of Fianna Fáil supporters as against support for the Coalition parties.  That is the way, <Col N="1085" /> as I understand it, and as I understand it, that this vile gerrymander was brought about in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.</P>
    <P>The job is well done.  Make no mistake about that.  It was done well and I accept that.  When one talks about a gerrymander being done, one thinks of the same job being done in the Six Counties over the years by the Unionist Party.  A job done well, certainly, but whether it is in the best interests of democracy is the question.  I believe it is not.  The mechanics, the deliberate working out, the mechanical calculated working out of a gerrymander of this nature to continue the best interests of one political party as against the other is politically and conceptually wrong.  It is false.  It is undemocratic.  That is why I charge the present Coalition outfit&mdash;forgive me, Government&mdash;with hypocrisy. They must be complete hypocrites.  If one looks at the record, at the whole history of the debate on the last Electoral (Amendment) Bill introduced by the Fianna Fáil Party the Opposition then were calling for independent commissions.  I personally &mdash;I must have this on the record of the House&mdash;do not favour independent commissions.  I believe we are elected here to do our own work and I do not think responsibility should be shrugged off lightly by this House.  I would not accept the proposition for one moment that we should have independent commissions and let someone else do the work for us.  We should stand on our own two feet. Whatever decisions we make here let us stand over them.  We are sent here by the people for a term of years to represent them and if we make mistakes during the course of those years here we will have to answer for them in the next election, and so be it, but in the meantime let us do our duty according to what we consider our duty to be.  I believe it is not proper that an independent commission should sit on a Bill of this nature or other related matters.  This is a purely personal opinion but it is not in conflict with the policy of Fianna Fáil on this Bill in any respect.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the constituency which the respected Taoiseach and my <Col N="1086" /> colleagues, Deputy Desmond and Deputy Dockrell represent.  Over the years we have enjoyed a rather friendly relationship and I would hope that nothing I said in relation to the constituency would in any way harm that relationship in the personal sense of that relationship.  Of course, we are going to be forever in opposition in relation to the political philosophy, one party as against another and that is proper.</P>

I must recognise and so must all Deputies, if they are honest with themselves, that they are trustees for the time being of their political party; it does not matter if the Fianna Fáil Party gets the seat or Deputy Larry McMahon gets the seat or the Labour Party gets the seat, the person holding the seat is a mere trustee for the time being and the name of the person does not matter so long as the party is represented.

      <P>I am certain that the people of the west of Ireland will take a clear note of what is happening. This is a continuation of a very serious and insidious process begun by the Government when they returned to office after 16 years.  The Government is again consistent in depriving the west of Ireland of a Minister on the one hand, various industrial schemes on the other hand, and now depriving the west of Deputies.  At the same time, they increased the number of Deputies in the Dáil.  If that is not scandalous in the proper sense of that word I do not know what is.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer again to the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown which will be known, when this Bill is passed, as the constituency of Dún Laoghaire.  We have the situation daily where we are informed by the news media and some of the sophisticates therein that the Dáil will be overburdened with something like 82 or 83 seats on the Government side.  This, in my opinion, is not giving credit to the people of this country who will decide on the issues and policies presented before an election whether the Government outgoing will be the Government incoming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>The next election will be fought on the non-discharge <Col N="1091" /> of promises and particularly on the prices front.  The Labour Deputies will have to go back to their constituency organisations, those who have such organisations left, prior to the next election.  I can understand the decent man who supported the labour philosophy as propounded by Labour Deputies in the past when he sees the situation of the Parliamentary Labour Party being taken over lock, stock and barrel by the Fine Gael Party, having difficulty in supporting the Labour Party organisations in his constituency.</P>
      <P>I can see the Labour Party, under the three-seaters, being wiped out in the Dublin area.  With all their smartness, all their glibness, their arrogance and other matters related to the type of mind which would introduce a Bill of this nature, I do not believe that the people will accept it.  Unfortunately, democratically they must get away with it in the sense that it will pass through this House and will become the law of the land.  I believe the people will reject it.  The greatest point of rejection, as those who have spoken to wellknown Labour supporters were given to understand, is this question of the consumption of the Labour Party by the Fine Gael Party in the Dublin area.  The people at the next election will wipe them out formally.  Then they will go running to the clubs, the wigwams, the tents and the lodges of the Fine Gael Party seeking protection.  They have the umbrella of the Fine Gael Party while they are described as the Labour Party, a description that does not properly fit them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maybe the next election is not that far off.  Indeed, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Defence was pressing to have this Bill dealt with expeditiously. He was pressing to have it dealt with as a matter of urgency before the Christmas recess.  Naturally one's antennae are inclined to go up and one is inclined to question this rush and indecent haste.  Why is this Bill wanted so quickly?  Flushed with the limited success of the Monaghan by-election I believe the Taoiseach saw <Col N="1092" /> the opportunity and he sent his messenger boy, I beg your pardon, Deputy Professor Kelly, along to the Fianna Fáil Whip's office with the message to get the Bill through as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>However, our antennae also went up.  We want a general election as a matter of urgency, tomorrow, if possible.  Nevertheless, we feel that we have an obligation to expose this vile and infamous document which has been given the title of the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2 Bill), 1973.  We have an obligation to the community and to democracy to expose this insidious Bill proposed by the Minister for Local Government.</P>
    <P>On the Committee Stage more particularly I intend to challenge the legality of that part of the Bill which relates to the then constituency of Dún Laoghaire&mdash;the now constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.  We are informed that the Minister for Local Government produced a map of the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and that the statement in the Schedule relates to the map of the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown then and the new constituency of Dún Laoghaire.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  There is no such thing as a map of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. I defy any individual Deputy to go to the Library and have a look at the detailed map of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown as distinct from the map of Ireland where you will see Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown set out as a spot.  In that sense there is a comprehensive set-out of the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, in the map of Ireland, in the totality of the map, but not in the small map which is presented as the constituencies in the Dublin and county area.</P>
    <P>The constituency of Dún Laoghaire does not exist in map form and I must challenge the Minister for Local Government to produce a proper, full map of the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown to let us know where we are.  Certainly, as a Deputy for the area I know exactly what the gerrymander means.  As somebody said, in fairness, as far as one's personal future is concerned, for an individual <Col N="1093" /> Fianna Fáil Deputy in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown there is clearly a Fianna Fáil seat there but the gerrymander is so organised as to ensure&mdash;and I am entitled to say this because it is a fact &mdash;that a second seat for the Fianna Fáil Party will never rear its head in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LawrenceMcMahon" hpid="Mr. McMahon Mr. McMahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMahon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but it did the time before that and the time before that and, I believe, the time before that.  Deputy McMahon, who is a very fairminded Deputy, will agree with that assessment if he analyses what I have said, that it was a calculated gerrymander to ensure the survival of the National Coalition Party in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown being made up of the Taoiseach, Deputies P. Dockrell and B. Desmond. This map, as I have said, is not in existence.  I would ask the Minister to ask the respected civil servants to go about getting the mapping section or whatever section they have, to produce a proper map of the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. As I understand it at the moment it is truncated to the extent that when you come to Loughlinstown Cross it ceases and you then have to go from Loughlinstown Cross by your imagination to the outskirts of Bray.  A Deputy for the area should know&mdash;and does know in this case&mdash;exactly what this Schedule means in the context of the constituency of Dún Laoghaire.  he knows it, indeed.  He knows what has been done deliberately to continue, really, the existence of the National Coalition juggernaut in that constituency.</P>
      <P>On the matter of the breaching of county boundaries the Minister for Local Government while in Opposition&mdash;he was spokesman for something or other; I cannot quite remember what it was&mdash;stated in Volume 237, column 1817, of the Official Report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not care what any Member of the House says; I have a personal view on this.  I believe that county boundaries are important just as I <Col N="1094" /> believe that the national boundary is important and I would not agree that somebody who lives in County Meath would be as happy being attached to another county.</P>
    <P>Later in the same column he said:</P>
    <P>I do not agree, therefore, that county boundaries should be sundered.  The Minister has a sin to answer for.</P>

We are dealing with the breaching of county boundaries by the present Minister for Local Government and I have just quoted two rather interesting passages from his contribution on the last Electoral Amendment Bill.  He says he does not agree that county boundaries should be sundered and that the Minister has a sin to answer <Col N="1095" /> for.  If the then Minister had a sin to answer for surely the present Minister who made this statement has some sins to answer for now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a greater sin because it was said, I am sure, with great sincerity at that time; and the person who alleged the then Minister was sinning is now committing the very same sins.  In my view this could be described as hypocrisy.  Those with a greater command of the English language might use less crude phraseology in charging the Minister with this but I must charge him with hypocrisy because that is what it is&mdash;humbug and hypocrisy.  The whole tragic gerrymander Bill is littered with this: views expressed a number of years ago cease to have validity now.  What was good four years ago appears to be bad now. They called for an independent commission and they have reneged on that. They suggested county boundaries should not be breached and they have reneged on that.  They have reneged all along the line in the production of this mammoth gerrymander.</P>
      <P>Let me make the point once more, and I shall go off it again, that I do not accept that the Bill itself will give the outgoing Government continuity in office as it is calculated to do.  It is deliberately calculated to ensure the continuance in office of the outgoing Government for years to come.  I do not think they will get away with it because the electorate are too sophisticated and will understand the intention behind a measure of this kind.  The Government will not get 82 or 83 seats.

    <P>With regard to the breaching of county boundaries, I should like to quote a letter from the corporation of Dún Laoghaire dated 4th December, 1973.  I might put on record that the council is Fine Gael-dominated. Unfortunately it is over-burdened with Fine Gael councillors but at the <Col N="1096" /> next June elections that matter will be sorted out and I have no doubt that Fianna Fáil will have their fair share of seats there.</P>
    <P>The Government talk glibly about power sharing but we know that they have appointed all their own pals to State boards.  We know what they have done in other areas that I will not mention here.  We know they have wiped out individuals who purported to support Fianna Fáil.  It is a case of jobs for the boys, but the only problem they have is that they cannot decide which boy to give the job to because one person may be Labour and the other Fine Gael.</P>

Everyone knows Fianna Fáil's attitude in relation to those talks.  The Minister for propaganda, Deputy O'Brien, through his propaganda machine&mdash;otherwise known as the Government Information Services&mdash; from time to time has produced the most beautiful litany in the newspapers of what the Government are doing or are not doing, and what they intend to do in the future.  This is presented in such a way to suggest that the Government have cornered the market in political purity.  We know they are not practising power sharing and that they never intended doing it.  It is there for the grabs, and my goodness they are grabbing it. Since coming into office last March they have distinguished themselves in grabbing the loot, from the most minor appointment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have outlined my own views.  I have put on the record the fact that Deputy Kelly, Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Defence, rushed up to Deputy Lalor in a breathless state and said that they wanted the Second Stage, in fact the whole Bill, before Christmas.  Deputy Lalor might confirm this when he is making his contribution to the debate.  Fianna Fáil's antennae went up.  Why do the Government want the Bill before Christmas?  It cannot be for any altruistic motive.  It cannot be that they want to streamline the business of the House because their reputation in relation to legislation is deplorable and disreputable.  With the compliments of the Government propaganda services&mdash;otherwise known as the Government Information Services&mdash;we are provided with the daily lie that the Government are producing certain kinds of legislation.  I suggest to them that they put up or shut up.</P>
      <P>The Monaghan by-election has far greater significance for the Government than they realise and it is a lesson they might learn in the very near future in a general election.

      <P Just="Right">4th December, 1973.</P>
      <P>Dear Deputy,</P>
      <P>The following is the text of letter of this date which has been forwarded to the Department of Local Government with regard to proposals contained in the Electoral (Amendment) No. 2 Bill, 1973, affecting this constituency:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Borough Council have considered the proposals in the Electoral Amendment (No. 2) Bill, 1973, so far as they affect the Borough and the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown Constituency area.  On 3rd instant, they adopted the following resolution in this connection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>`This Council recommends the transfer of Ballybrack No. 1 (8703) from the proposed South County Dublin to Dún Laoghaire, with Stillorgan No. 5 (4776) and Stillorgan No. 1 part of (2758) total (7534) being transferred from the proposed Dún Laoghaire to South County Dublin.'</P>
      <P>The members have pointed out that the Corporation has provided a 100 acre housing site in the Ballybrack No. 1 Electoral Division and have rehoused or will rehouse there borough residents who could not be accommodated in the borough. They suggest that a very sizeable proportion of the electorate in the Ballybrack No. 1 Electoral Division consists of these former residents of the borough and that it would be contrary to the Minister's expressed intention of not splitting unnecessarily natural communities to cut them away from the borough electorate and attach them to the Dublin South County Constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has also pointed out that a constituency consisting of the borough with the Ballybrack No. 1 Electoral Division and Stillorgan 2, 3 and 4 <Col N="1099" /> Electoral Divisions would provide a constituency with natural physical boundary so far as possible, in that the Dublin-Stillorgan-Bray Road would be the boundary from Booterstown to Loughlinstown.</P>
    <P>Based on the 1971 census figure, the deviation from the national average population per seat would only be 292 which is considered reasonable.  I am to request that the Minister will give sympathetic consideration to the Council's resolution before the Committee Stage of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I had to get the letter properly on the record.  If one has to close brackets one has to close brackets.  That is all about it.  The Minister's expressed intention when he was spokesman for Local Government in Opposition on the matter of the breaching of constituency boundaries has been quoted by me at considerable length.  Here we have a very reasonable request from the corporation of Dún Laoghaire, which is the borough council.  They have properly considered the proposals in the Electoral (Amendment) Bill.  I am sure other local authorities have also done so.  I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating the Borough Council of Dún Laoghaire for going into this matter in such considerable depth.  It is a matter which affects their own area and they have properly articulated a point of view to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>They have the majority in the constituency and in the borough unfortunately.  When June, 1974, comes there may be a different story to tell.  Fianna Fáil <Col N="1100" /> will get a proper and consistent representation on the Dún Laoghaire Borough Council.  In the letter the council recommend the transfer of Ballybrack No. 1.  One must imagine the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. It is a triangle with a broad base at the Booterstown end and it runs into a narrow apex at the top around the Killiney-Ballybrack area.  In that apex is contained parts of the borough of Dún Laoghaire, and Ballybrack is prominent in that respect.  Here it is being wiped out of the borough of Dún Laoghaire which itself is an autonomous borough in the sense that it is one unified whole. Why should we not keep Ballybrack? Why should not Ballybrack, a natural part of the borough of Dún Laoghaire, remain within Dún Laoghaire. It is just not being done by the Minister for Local Government who has decided that it does not suit the Coalition Party machine or juggernaut. The Minister is going to cut out that piece ruthlessly.  He is going to snip it.  He is going to snip that piece of Ballybrack which he considers to be most embarrassing to the Fine Gael Party.  That is what he is doing.</P>
      <P>The Minister has taken a natural piece of the Borough of Dún Laoghaire out of that borough for selfish, political, party reasons.  I cannot speculate about any other reason.  This was not done through any sense of altruism.</P>

I apologise for delaying the House but I felt it was important to speak.  Deputy Desmond may have spoken on this.  I have no doubt that when he spoke on the Bill he praised and congratulated the Minister, and went through all the old rigmarole and formula.  Poor Deputy Desmond knows as well as I do that he is in a difficult situation. Not only did they not appoint him to some office but they did the dirt on <Col N="1101" /> him in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.  That is understandable.</P>

      <P>I have the greatest respect for Deputy Desmond and sympathy for him.  I have respect for him in every sense.  I do not agree with his political philosophy, and I will fight him on those grounds only and reasonably so.  I just want to give this Bill my &ldquo;amen&rdquo; with one more reference to the main charges which we have been making consistently against it during our contributions and which we will continue to make against it during the course of its journey through this House.  We will continue to fight it to the very last and we know we cannot win.  We are going in on a losing wicket.  The whole Government apparatus is loaded against the Opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The weakness of the Opposition case is only that it lacks a certain number of Deputies to defeat the Government in bringing about their wishes.  It is probably one of the most dangerous Bills ever, it is dangerous to democracy.  It is the most dangerous <Col N="1102" /> type of Bill to come before this House.  It is an undemocratic Bill and a Bill of a highly gerrymandering nature.  We will continue to expose it for what it is as long as the opportunity presents itself.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that apart from a very brief intervention by Deputy Luke Belton no effort was made by any Deputy on the Government side to defend this Bill.  I suppose it is true to say that it is understandable that they should not attempt to defend a Bill of this type, or at least that it might take a certain amount of courage on the part of Deputies opposite to defend it.  They are quite obviously lacking in that courage.</P>
      <P>The Bill is an effort by the Minister for Local Government to copperfasten the Coalition in office for as long as possible.  There is very little more to be said in relation to this aspect of the Bill.  When the Bill was clearly published this aspect was identified by the media.  Later on when neutral observers had time to consider the Bill properly they also recognised it for what it is.  Today it is recognised by the public at large as an attempt to copperfasten the Government in office for as long as possible. I have no doubt that the Deputies on the Government side also recognise this Bill for what it is.  In fact, the Minister himself recognises it.  It would be too much to expect that the Minister concerned would express this view in public. While the Minister may be successful in his quite obvious aim, time will tell whether or not he will be successful.  However, it is of little use that the Minister should pretend that this is not his aim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand why the Minister has taken up this stance and why he is not willing to admit publicly that his objective is, as I said earlier, as best he can to ensure continuance of this Government in office and to stifle as far as he can the democratic will of the people.  It is, of course, because he himself&mdash;and this was quoted on many occasions so I am <Col N="1103" /> not going to bother quoting it again&mdash; while in opposition was one of the severest critics of the system which he is now operating.  He it was who condemned the system under which the Minister for Local Government decided on the constituency boundaries. He vehemently advocated that this method should be abolished and that quite a different procedure should be adopted.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the public, reading the then Labour Deputy's statements felt assured that should his party, whether as a single party Government or in coalition, be returned to office, when the opportunity would arise his party would press for change and that he himself would be foremost among those who would endeavour to change the system which he regarded as despicable when he was in opposition.</P>
    <P>The same arguments were reiterated by the Fine Gael Deputies during the previous debates on constituency Bills in this House, and not only were those arguments put forward by the Fine Gael Party but they tried to introduce a Bill which would change the system. Again, I must underline that the public could be forgiven if they were to feel that a change in Government, where again the Fine Gael Party would come to power either as a coalition or as a single party Government, would ensure that the methods by which the constituency revisions were made during the Fianna Fáil Administration would be changed and that we would have instead the new methods which were so strongly advocated by the Fine Gael Party when they were in opposition.</P>
    <P>There is no point in alleging, as has been done by some of the speakers on the opposite side in the earlier part of the debate, that the Fianna Fáil Party when in office, when they decided on constituency boundaries, decided on them to suit their own purposes.  Even if this were true, there is no point in the Government alleging that Fianna Fáil did this.  I am not accepting that it is true, but all one has to do is to look at the result of the general elections in 1969 and 1973 in the same <Col N="1104" /> constituencies, and it will be seen that it would be very hard to argue that Fianna Fáil did, in fact, change the constituencies to suit themselves.  So vehemently was the case for change and for neutral involvement in constituency changes pressed by the Fine Gael and Labour Parties then in opposition, that one could be forgiven if one felt that this was not simply an argument being put forward by the Opposition Deputies against proposals by the Minister for Local Government in relation to the changing of constituency boundaries, but rather that it was a matter of principle with them and that the first thing they would do if they assumed office would be to make the changes that they were so strongly advocating.  I do not know what one can think of Coalition promises and arguments when in opposition, when not only have the Coalition Government continued the system in operation whereby constituency boundary changes are decided by the Minister for Local Government, but have put in charge of it a Minister who himself was one of the strongest opponents of the system which was then in operation.  This is too much altogether.</P>
    <P>It would appear, in so far as the Coalition parties are concerned, that principles and promises are forgotten when they come to power.  Of course, I have had my own experience of this, particularly in relation to the Arts Council Bill, when certain sections were introduced by the present Government into that Bill which during my time in office in a similar type of Bill were opposed to the extent not only of arguments against them but of calling for votes in the House to oppose them.  Therefore, I am not particularly concerned about this situation, because it is something I have come to expect.</P>
    <P>There is a further aspect to this matter to which I would like to refer. The Parliamentary Secretary referred to political commentators who stated that under the revised constituencies the Coalition would gain 83 seats and Fianna Fáil 63 seats.  He went on to say that this was nonsense and that the argument was simply put forward <Col N="1105" /> for the purpose of frightening people. I would say he had a very good reason to worry about this, because his own party did a very good job of frightening the people at the time of the referendum on proportional representation, when they said that Fianna Fáil would get 90 seats under the proposed changes.  I have little doubt that this was one of the arguments used by the opponents of the straight vote system which most affected the result of the referendum. The Parliamentary Secretary may very well worry that a similar fate awaits the Coalition because of the case now being made not simply by the Opposition here in this House but, as I mentioned a moment ago, by the media as well.</P>
    <P>There is another factor here which was referred to by Deputy Andrews in the course of his speech.  One of the most objectionable features of Unionist rule in the north of Ireland was the fact that they gerrymandered constituencies in order to ensure their continuance in power at all levels of government.  During the campaign on the two referenda on the PR system, the Fine Gael and Labour Parties campaigned against the abolition of proportional representation on the basis that this system was a fair system, that it was not possible to gerrymander under the system, and that its retention was a worthwhile incentive to encourage unity in this country.</P>
    <P>The forecasts of the media regarding the number of seats that will go to the Coalition and to Fianna Fáil respectively in the next election related to the total Fine Gael and Labour vote, as compared with the total Fianna Fáil first preference vote, shows, I am afraid, that it is possible to gerrymander under the proportional representation system.  It will hardly be the incentive that the Coalition partners suggested it would be.  One would think that in present day circumstances the Government would concern themselves with the overall national situation rather than with narrow political advantage.  I was intrigued by the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach that he was unaware of the <Col N="1106" /> constituency changes until they were published.  From the Parliamentary Secretary who attends Government meetings this is a peculiar statement though perhaps he recognised that he did not have to bother very much about it because the matter could be safely left in the hands of the master.</P>
    <P>One matter which particularly concerns me is the fact that in many of the city constituencies the average population per Deputy is below the national average.  For example, in Dublin South-East it is 831 below the national average and in Dublin (Rathmines West) it is 771 below the national average.  On the other hand, the population per Deputy in many of the rural constituencies is well above the national average.  In Donegal, for example, it is 971 above the national average while in Mid-Cork it is 812 above it.  I have always felt that the population per rural Deputy should be lower than the population per city Deputy.  We must take into account the fact that some rural constituencies are territorially very large and that this presents a considerable difficulty for constituents when they wish to see their Deputy.  Constituents do not always feel that a letter to a Deputy is sufficient, they often wish to see him personally and distance is very often a deterrent.  We should try, in so far as it is possible, to treat all our citizens as fairly as possible in this respect.  This can be done by reducing the population per Deputy in rural constituencies and particularly in rural constituencies of very large areas.  If one looks at the proposed new constituency of Donegal, the distances to be travelled by constituents and by Deputies in the course of their duties are exceptional, and I have no doubt that were it not for the political implications in relation to this particular constituency nobody would dream of creating one constituency in such a large county.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall deal with that later.  I recall the case in the High Court brought by the former Labour Deputy and former Fine Gael Deputy and Senator and Parliamentary Secretary, Dr. John O'Donovan, in relation to the population per Deputy and the national average.  I was a witness in that case.  At that time the whole county of Louth was a three-seat constituency.  The population per Deputy was well above the national average, if my memory serves me about 3,000 per Deputy.  I pointed out in my evidence that while the population per Deputy was high nevertheless because the county was small constituents had no difficulty in getting in touch personally with a Deputy. But in West Cork the population per Deputy at that time was considerably below the national average, although it was territorially already very large, and if the Fine Gael Senator won his case further areas would have to be added to that constituency to retain it as a three-seat constituency and this would make it almost impossible for a very large section of the community in that constituency to get in touch personally with one of the Deputies representing them.  I pointed out that County Louth was a unit for many different purposes and that the people there were, as were the people in Monaghan where the population per Deputy was much below the national average, anxious to retain County Louth as a unit just as the people in Monaghan were anxious to retain County Monaghan as a three-seat constituency.  However, as it happened <Col N="1108" /> the Fine Gael Senator won his case and a large part of County Louth had to be transferred to the Monaghan constituency to bring the population per Deputy in each of the constituencies into line with the court decision.</P>
      <P>The county of Louth is now to be a four-seat constituency with a part of Monaghan added to it.  I welcome this because it is generally accepted that the people in an area which is cut off from the main stream of the population in that county, particularly in a county the size of Louth, Monaghan or Kildare, have not got the same interest in political life as if they were integrated in the county as a political unit.  My whole attitude, as far back as the time of the court case I have mentioned, was that County Louth should be a unit in the political sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fine Gael speakers during the course of the recent by-election spoke of the return of West Louth to the constituency of Louth and they inferred that this could have been done equally easily in 1961 when this part of Louth was transferred to the Monaghan constituency.  This is simply not true.  The population of Louth increased by 5,000 between 1966 and 1971.  As far as I can remember it increased by 2,500 from 1961 to 1966 as a result, I might add, of the good government of Fianna Fáil.  It will be obvious that if in 1961 the then Minister for Local Government decided on a four-seat constituency for Louth it would have meant that a very large part of County Monaghan would have had to be incorporated with County Louth.  The Minister had to decide at that time whether he should add the part of Louth, which subsequently he did add, to Monaghan thereby leaving two three-seat constituencies as had been the position, or to add a large part of Monaghan to Louth and make it a four-seater while adding the other part of Monaghan to another county, perhaps Cavan, in which case Monaghan as a political entity would have ceased to exist.  The reason why the Minister is now able to make the <Col N="1109" /> change he proposes is because of the very exceptional increase in the population of County Louth.</P>

The Coalition parties have long ago given up any hope of ever shaking the Fianna Fáil vote in the present constituency of Louth and, judging from the 1973 General Election result and the result of the Presidential Election, they have every good reason for recognising that the intelligent people of Louth vote for the party they know from experience have done such exceptional work to develop the economy of the county and to put it, as it is now, in the forefront of both agricultural and industrial development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a strong inkling that the Minister for Lands is not very happy with the transferring of Inniskeen and the surrounding district to the constituency of Louth. The Minister for Local Government has decided also on a four-seat constituency for Meath.  I have never indulged in personalities and do not propose to do so now except to say that the Minister, like all of us, is human. However, I would hope that we shall not be given any philosophical reasons for the change.  Part of Kildare is included in the Meath constituency and I note that when it suits the Minister's purpose he has no scruples regarding the breaching of county boundaries.  I understand that there is very little change in regard to the part of Kildare now being added to <Col N="1112" /> the Meath constituency from the position which obtained before.</P>
      <P>I can understand the people in that section of Kildare not having any great objection, such as other people might have, to continuing as part of the Meath constituency because I have no doubt that they would like to retain their connection with Deputy Crinion, who is well known to be a very active and hard-working Deputy. Nevertheless, we find that the County of Kildare is to be not in two but in three parts.  I expect that the people of Kildare will endeavour to detect the logic whereby the Minister, on the one hand, can talk of his efforts to retain county boundaries while breaking them in a number of cases in their county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested in the comments of Deputy Malone in relation to the Kildare situation.  It would appear that the Deputy will have some difficulty in extricating himself from the rather awkward position in which he may find himself at the time of the next revision should that part of Kildare that is now being transferred to Meath or Dublin be returned to the Kildare constituency, because I have no doubt that he will be reminded of the arguments he made here in favour of the division of his county and of his pointing out all the reasons why he believes that parts of Kildare which were to be attached to the Dublin constituency are rightly being removed from Kildare.  He said they had to sacrifice a large part of Kildare to Meath and Dublin.  I agree. This is in direct contradiction of what the Minister for Local Government said at an earlier stage in this debate. He stated that a very small slice would be taken from Kildare and joined to other constituencies.  I expected Deputy Malone to argue for a four-seater for Kildare rather than attempt to justify the taking away of a large part of his county.  I agree with him when he says that there will be additional seats in the next Dáil as a result of the increase in population. This increase reflects our growing prosperity.  When one remembers that the figures he refers to are the 1971 census figures, nobody from <Col N="1113" /> this side of the House could have paid as worthwhile a tribute to the Fianna Fáil Party and Government as Deputy Malone.</P>

      <P>The west of Ireland has been forgotten by the Coalition. Deputy Molloy clearly indicated the manner in which it would be possible to retain 30 seats in the west.  If he was concerned with Ireland as a whole, the Minister would have approached the position in the west of Ireland in this way.  This was not to be.  Apart from reducing the number of seats in the west by two, the Coalition's only concern was to make adjustments to suit their own ends.  These went against the stated principles of the Minister in relation to county boundaries. He created the monstrosity which will be known in future as West Galway, and includes a large slice of Clare.  I do not mean to go into detail about what could have been done in relation to the Galway-Clare situation.  It is patently obvious what the proper and fair distribution of seats should have been.</P>

      <P>We had a considerable amount of peace when the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach was out of the House.  Unfortunately, now that he is back, we have more than our quota of interruptions.</P>
      <P>The two extra seats should have been given to the west.  We are in danger of being dominated by Dublin's need and outlook, because of the large share of Deputies which Dublin is getting.  If the population of Dublin continues to increase, then the number of Deputies will increase also.  This should concern us all because of the needs of rural Ireland, especially along the west coast.  We must always keep in mind the need to develop properly as a nation, not only economically&mdash;and our economy is still largely dependent on agriculture &mdash;but culturally as well.  It is well to remember that one of our greatest cultural assets, the Irish language, is spoken in the west as the vernacular, and real concern should have been shown here rather than political expediency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" /> Reference was made on a number of occasions during this debate to the fact that Dublin has got three-seat constituencies, except in one notable case, while at present it has four-seat constituencies.  In Cork where there are two three-seat constituencies at present they will be replaced by a five-seat constituency.  If three-seat constituencies are deemed to be best for Dublin, why are three-seat constituencies not suitable for Cork?  I cannot see the logic behind this decision and I do not think anybody else can.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that one of his main objectives was to preserve county boundaries.  We recognise, of course, that he is not in the least concerned with county boundaries except where it suits him.  If he is not also concerned with city boundaries, how can he justify cutting off a large part of the city of Cork and joining it to a rural Cork constituency which is exceptionally large at present?  I do not suppose that at this stage of the Bill it is necessary for me to continue to show up the many anomalies and contradictions in the Bill.  As was said by Deputy Andrews and as I have already said myself, this Bill is quite obviously an attempt by the Minister and the Government to copperfasten the Government in office.  Like many other speakers I should like to say that the people will have last say.  I have no doubt that the people will recognise what is being done here and will deal with the Government accordingly when the next general election is declared.</P>

      <P>I can truthfully say in relation to this discussion that I am in the peculiar position&mdash;I will not say the unique position because there are a couple of other constituencies like mine&mdash;in the light of this Bill and the damage it is endeavouring to do, that I can speak objectively about the Bill because it does not interfere with the possibility of my re-election or otherwise.  The Laois-Offaly constituency is not being changed and it has not been changed down through the years.  My observations can be made objectively because of the fact that I have no personal axe to grind. <Col N="1117" /> Opposition Deputies have spoken about changes which affect their own constituencies and they have dealt with the overall picture.  They have been able to show up this Bill for what it is.  Instead of being called the Electoral (Amendment) Bill it should be called the National Coalition Consolidation Bill.  The Bill is likely to backfire.  Deputy Andrews said that there seems to be unholy haste about the manner in which the Government are anxious to rush this Bill through the House.</P>

A few moments ago he had some questions for my colleague, Deputy Faulkner.  He did not himself contribute to the debate so far.  If he did he would, of course, have to say in justification of what his own Minister is doing that he is quite happy with the carve-up of Leitrim, but it would be rather difficult for him to come in here and say that.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Molloy, dealt very comprehensively with this Bill.  He drew attention to the fact that on a population basis the province of Connacht, with the inclusion of Donegal and Clare, was entitled to 30 seats in this House but the Minister was making provision for only 28 seats.  I have been listening to this debate and to a considerable amount of heckling from the Government benches.  I now want to put on record that on 15th November, the day on which this Bill was introduced, there were 128 interruptions in the debate from the Minister for Local Government.

      <P>I would like now to draw the attention of the House to the first day of the debate, Thursday, 15th November.  When Deputy Molloy was speaking he quoted the average population per seat in Dublin and he gave a figure of 20,142. The Minister for Local Government interrupted and said:</P>
      <P>To help Deputy Molloy, may I say the average in the West is 20,509 and in the Dublin area it is 20,840.  So would the Deputy please correct his figures?</P>
      <P>This was said with the usual sneering smile.  Later on the same day, immediately after Questions, at column 2092 of volume 268 of the Official Report the Minister said:</P>
      <P>With the permission of the Chair, I should like to make a statement. This morning in the course of Deputy Molloy's speech there was an interruption by me on the average population for Deputies in certain areas.  I stated in good faith from information I got that the average population for Deputies in Dublin was 20,840.  I should like to correct that: I am now informed that the correct figure is 20,142.  It is only fair to put that on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This was exactly the figure Deputy Molloy had quoted earlier that <Col N="1122" /> morning and was corrected by the Minister.</P>

      <P>We appreciate what the Minister has said.</P>
      <P>Deputy Colley was giving him full credit for being a gentleman, as he thought:</P>
      <P>I heard of the incident but I did not have the precise figures.  Could the Minister indicate whether what he has said means that Deputy Molloy's figure was correct?</P>
      <P>To which Deputy Tully, the Minister for Local Government, the gentleman, replied:</P>
      <P>No, not quite accurate.</P>
      <P>Mr. Colley: But it was more correct than the other one.</P>
      <P>To which the Minister, being a gentleman, responded: &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  Later that day Deputy Molloy, having heard what the Minister for Local Government had said and having heard&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy, according to column 2104 of the Official Report of 15th November, on a point of information, asked the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for permission to ask the Minister for Local Government a question.  Deputy Molloy was duly given this permission and he said he understood that after Question Time the Minister referred to a figure which he, Deputy Molloy, had quoted and which the Minister had <Col N="1123" /> said earlier was wrong.  The Minister subsequently gave another figure and Deputy Molloy asked for an explanation from the Minister on that.</P>
      <P>On that occasion the Minister said he had already given the figure and he was sorry that Deputy Molloy could not find time to be in the House.  That was one of those sniggering remarks we have come to expect from the Minister, Deputy Tully.  It would be very easy for me tonight to say that, as this business has been ordered, it was a pity that the Minister could not be here.  I appreciate why the Minister is not here tonight because he is on far more important business.  Deputy Molloy pointed out to the Minister that, as he was aware, he was not present at the time.  I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach will appreciate that it is not very easy for the Opposition spokesman on Local Government to be in the House at all times.</P>
      <P>Later Deputy Tully told Deputy Molloy:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;You were right and I was wrong.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Official Report goes on:</P>
      <P>Mr. Molloy: I was correct?</P>
      <P>Mr. Tully: The Deputy's figure was as nearly correct as makes no matter.</P>
      <P>Mr. Molloy: The figure I gave was 20,142.  That was correct?  I understood that the Minister said my figure was still not correct.</P>
      <P>Mr. Tully: It is slightly off.</P>
      <P>Therefore, according to Mr. Tully, the figure of 20,142 was slightly off the figure of 20,142.  Are the interjections by the Minister by way of correction rather than interruptions?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a brilliant intervention. On a point of order, I ask for a ruling from the Chair.  I know that the Minister for Local Government is to be referred to as the Minister for Local Government but I am quoting <Col N="1124" /> from the Official Report and that report describes the Minister as &ldquo;Mr. Tully&rdquo;.  What description am I to give?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Standing Orders of this House ordain that Members shall be referred to as Deputies and office holders shall be referred to as Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries as the case may be.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should now like to continue with observations on other remarks made by the Minister for Local Government in this House.  In introducing this Bill the Minister drew attention to the fact that the population of the State had increased by 3.3 per cent since the census in 1966.  Apparently this does not seem to have sunk in with the Deputies on the Government side who are still talking about an emigration problem that was overcome by the previous Administration.  We have had this increase in population and there is no doubt but that in at least two of the counties west of the Shannon there has been a sizeable increase in population. The trend in the other counties shows that the exodus is drying up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

      <P>I needed that protection, thank you.  I have been endeavouring to do a sum for the back benchers with a view to their conveying the information to the Minister for Local Government when he returns.  The population of Sligo in 1961&mdash;it is higher now since we opened Snia (Ireland) Ltd. which gives valuable employment&mdash;was 50,275.  The population of Leitrim&mdash; I know Manorhamilton and surrounding districts and Carrick-on-Shannon are also improving&mdash;was 28,360, making a total population in the area of 78,635.  Add to that the slice which the Minister for Local Government has stolen from Donegal in order to make sure that it will not be two three-seaters, a total of 2,835 votes, making in all 81,470.  Sligo-Leitrim can be a distinct four-seat constituency with no border breaching as far as it is concerned.  You have the complete county of Sligo and the complete county of Leitrim making a four-seat constituency which no Deputy on the Government side likes. The logical thing to say is: &ldquo;That is grand if you can continue it.&rdquo;  I move on then to the situation in Roscommon-Mayo. <Col N="1130" /> We have already five seats in Donegal and four in Sligo-Leitrim making nine.  I am sorry to have to count it out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>
      <P>We had somebody here from Mayo but he has gone.  In Mayo we have 109,525 people and in Roscommon 53,519 which means that in the area it is possible to have eight seats giving five to Mayo and three to Roscommon with a very small incursion across the Mayo border.  Deputy Mrs. Burke was rather worried about Roscommon having lost some land back to Athlone.  That brings us to the third part of that area.  We already have nine seats and eight seats making 17.  We have another 11 seats to distribute and we have two counties.</P>

      <P>The population of Galway is 149,223 and the population of Clare is 75,008, making a total population of 224,231.  This entitles that two-county area to 11 seats.  Clare is only 2,000 votes short to make it eligible for a four-seater.  It should be possible to have four seats in East Galway, three in West Galway and four in Clare.  In that context it would be necessary to borrow a small piece of Galway to make up the four-seater in Clare.</P>

      <P>The Government are robbing them of their birthright.  It is obvious that the Dublin-dominated Cabinet have had their way.  The Government have shown their animosity not only towards the west of Ireland but towards rural Ireland.  Kildare, which has a population of 71,977 with three seats, is also being robbed.  The population of Meath is 71,729 but because the Minister for Local Government had his seat almost snatched from him on the last occasion, he robs Kildare, which is entitled to greater representation, slips it into Meath and gives the rest of Kildare to Dublin. Deputy Andrews quoted this evening the speech of the Minister for Local Government when he was in Opposition when he challenged the then Minister to add to County Meath a bit of County Dublin.  Instead of taking from Dublin, the Minister now robs Kildare and Wicklow.  In fact, a great slice is taken from North Kildare to ensure that the former Deputy, Terry Boylan, will not be sent back to this House by the people of Kildare. As proof of that we had Deputy Malone coming into the House, saying he was very sorry for the people in Kildare.</P>
