      <Col N="596" /> Members of the FCA are eligible for gratuities as a measure of reimbursement on account of losses, expenses and disabilities incurred by them consequent on their obligations as such.  The matter raised by the Deputy was one of a number of points borne in mind in a review of the rates of gratuity carried out in 1971 as a result of which these rates were substantially increased.</P>
    <P>I should add that Defence Force regulations provide for the issue of free travelling warrants to members of the FCA for the purpose of attending and returning from a course of training or instruction, an overnight camp, field day, test mobilisation or other official duty excluding church, funeral, ceremonial or training parades.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of sites on the Curragh Greenlands have been offered by my Department to Kildare County Council for the purpose of erecting houses in the allocation of which overholders of married quarters at the Curragh Training Camp would receive priority.  These sites were, however, found to be unsuitable for this purpose by the council's architect and planning officer on major traffic and amenity grounds.</P>
      <P>A site between William's corner and the new married quarters now nearing completion at Brownstown was recently sought by the council but this site is being reserved for possible future housing needs of serving Army personnel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Kildare County Council informed my Department last month that they are providing private building sites both in Kildare and Newbridge and that overholders on the Curragh are at liberty to make application for these sites as soon as they are ready.  A number of other suggestions in relation to assisting overholders to be rehoused are also being pursued with the council <Col N="597" /> and I will let the Deputy know the outcome of my Department's inquiries into these suggestions in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate that efforts have been made in this matter, could I have an assurance from the Minister that in the realisation that certain Army overholders would prefer to be housed in the vicinity of the Curragh, he will endeavour to provide a site there for this very laudable purpose?</P>

      <P>In the year ended 31st May, 1972, three vessels were taken into port by the Naval Service under the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959.  In the year ended 31st May, 1973, the number of such vessels taken into port under the Act was 7.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that a number of polling stations in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown constituency were re-located for the Presidential election on thoroughfares which were of a dangerous and narrow nature and also long distances from the areas they were intended to serve; if he will ensure that many people are not so deprived of the franchise in the future; and if he will make a statement in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware of the many complaints about the inadequacy of some polling stations in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown constituency, particularly at the Town Hall, Dún Laoghaire, Killiney and Ballybrack; and if he will request the Returning Officer to review the matter as soon as possible and to consult fully with the public representatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>The polling arrangements at the Presidential election in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown were based on a polling scheme made by the elected members of Dublin County Council following consultation with the Dáil deputies for the area and with Dún Laoghaire corporation.  The selection of the premises to be used for voting in each polling place nominated by the scheme is a matter for the local returning officer.</P>
      <P>My Department are taking up with the county council and the local returning officer the matters referred to in the Deputies' questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to note that the Minister made the point that Dáil Deputies were consulted.  I <Col N="599" /> should like to put it on record that no such consultation took place but I am glad lo note that the Minister is to conduct an inquiry and that the matter will be rectified.  Will he consult the Deputies concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin County Council contacted all Dáil Deputies for the county, including Deputies Desmond and Andrews, on 19th November, 1971.  A revised draft was circulated to them on 14th April, 1972.  I propose to ask the county council's local returning officer to have a look at the matter. However, it is not a matter for me.  It is a matter for the returning officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the designated polling station for Dún Laoghaire was Dún Laoghaire? For Killiney it was Killiney and for Dalkey it was Dalkey.  Deputy Andrews and I, and I am sure other Deputies in the constituency, have some strong views about that kind of consultation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that if Deputy Desmond has strong views on these matters he should put them to the returning officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. Desmond Mr. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I did but I got no satisfactory answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>We put down parliamentary questions on the matter.  The Minister will agree that this official document, whenever it arrives, does not constitute direct consultation as we know it, physical consultation.  Will he ensure that in future this position will be rectified?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because it is not a matter for me.  In my constituency, as Deputy Crinion will confirm, if we receive a draft document showing the polling stations and we are not satisfied with them we go to see the returning officer and the secretary of the county council who are only too pleased to oblige us.  I agree that Deputy Andrews has a point.  Polling stations should be as convenient as possible and this year I particularly asked that polling stations should be put on ground-floor level so that people would not have to go upstairs.  Unfortunately, this did not seem to be possible in the short time <Col N="600" /> given for the making of the arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I can appreciate the Chair's concern in this matter but can the Minister give us the dates on which these documents were passed on to the Deputies in the constituency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of course.  I have already given Deputy Andrews and the House the dates.  The first one was on the 19th November, 1971 and the second was the 14th April, 1972.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackLynch" hpid="Mr. J. Lynch Mr. J. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister suggested it was impossible to arrange only downstairs accommodation for voters because of the short time available. Does the Minister and the population of Ireland know that for over seven years the date of the next Presidential election was known?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I do but my predecessor and Deputy Lynch's Government did not do anything about it.  When I was appointed Minister I took the necessary steps.  I asked the local authorities to do something about it but it appears they had not got the necessary time.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is the sole judge as to the number of supplementary questions which can be asked.  I feel I have dealt with the Deputy very fairly in this matter and he ought not to challenge the right of the Chair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have.  What concern has the Minister shown in relation to the dangerous location of some of these polling booths?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Andrews must be aware that I do not know where there were dangerous polling stations located but he does.  I suggest that he would spend his time better if he brought the matter to the notice of the people responsible for fixing those polling stations.  It is not my responsibility. I have people appointed to do that.  I have asked them to do it and I would be glad of the assistance of Deputy Andrews and, indeed, Deputy Desmond and others who might be interested in having them sited in different places.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he is aware that the wrong address was given on the voting cards for the polling station in the Monkstown, County Dublin area during the recent Presidential election and that the facilities were very poor within the relocated station; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The selection of premises for voting purposes is a matter for the local returning officer.  I understand that St. Patrick's School, Monkstown was used as a polling place at the Presidential election for the first time.  The polling cards sent to electors referred in error to the former polling premises.  The error came to light before polling day and the local returning officer posted a notice at the former polling premises directing electors to the new building. I understand that the premises are across the road from one another and that little inconvenience was caused.  I understand that the reason for the change was that the facilities in St. Patrick's School are better.</P>

      <P>The selection of buildings to be used for polling stations is a matter for the local returning officer for the constituency concerned.

      <P>This is a matter of grave concern to the people there.

      <P>Secondly, before this election took place I notified all the returning officers in the following manner :</P>
      <P>The Minister is most anxious that every effort should be made to facilitate voting by incapacitated persons, particularly those confined to wheelchairs.  He has requested that polling stations should be selected with a view to easy access for such persons and should in all cases be located on the ground-floor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The returning officer in the area concerned said he was not able to obtain alternative accommodation and since the election could not be postponed <Col N="604" /> until next September, when Deputy Andrews says, this will be available, I am afraid he will have to put up with what happened.</P>

      <P>People in this area had to negotiate 50 steps up to the polling room.  This is one of the largest polling stations in the country, with nearly 6,000 electors.  Representations were made to the former Minister for Local Government but were ignored.  In fact, representations were made over the past seven years in this matter.  Perhaps the City Sheriff, Mr. Desmond Moran, and the returning officer might exercise some imagination in the matter and take heed of the many complaints which all Deputies in the constituency have regarding this polling station.  I can assure the Minister we cannot even find the polling stations in some parts of the constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Dublin Corporation's proposal to redevelop two of the six flat blocks at Benburb Street at an estimated cost of £62,500 was approved in June, 1972, and I understand that the work of converting these two blocks into self-contained flats with all modern facilities including heating is in progress.  The number of tenancies in the other four blocks has been reduced by about 50 per cent and as further flats become vacant they are being offered to existing tenants as additional accommodation.  If not accepted by existing tenants the vacant flats are being closed.</P>
      <P>I understand that in Hollyfield Buildings two of the blocks containing one-roomed flats have been demolished and the site has been converted into a play area for the tenants of the remaining flats.  The number of tenants in the other two and three-bedroom flats is being reduced and the extra accommodation is being offered to existing tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in Mountpleasant Buildings is that two blocks of one-roomed flats have also been demolished to provide a bigger play area for the remaining flats and the number of tenants in these flats is being reduced. <Col N="609" /> The practice of offering the extra accommodation created by the reduction in the number of tenants to existing tenants is also being followed here.  While I share the general concern about the conditions in the flats in these areas and have asked the corporation to keep me fully informed of developments I should mention that the management of their estate, including the upkeep of their houses and flats, is primarily a matter for the corporation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Housing Act. 1966, it is a matter for each housing authority to decide the terms of their scheme of letting priorities, which are then subject to my approval.  In the case of Dublin County Council, the approved scheme includes a clause giving special priority in letting dwellings to natives of the general area in which the dwellings are situate.</P>
      <P>I am reluctant to interfere with what the county council think is the best scheme for their area.  Having regard to the special pressures on them for housing from families who come into the Dublin area, their desire to give special priority to local applicants is understandable.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the hardship which these priorities might entail in an area, such as Ballybrack, where there is little on-going house building activity by the council at present.  I hope that the position in Ballybrack will be improved substantially within the next few years by participation by the council in the Government's emergency supplemental housing programme. In the meantime, I would suggest that the Deputy might ask the council to consider whether any special action may be required by way of modification of the approved scheme to meet any such cases of hardship.  I will give my decision quickly on any modification which the council may propose for this purpose.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that a provision of that nature made by a local authority is unduly harsh, bearing in mind that one already has to satisfy a 4-year residential qualification to get on the Dublin County Council list?  For example, somebody living in Stillorgan, where no houses are being built, might have to opt for a house in Dundrum, half a mile away, but because it is another housing area he is automatically docked 20 points.  The Minister might bear in mind the representations of Deputies in that regard.  I appreciate the limitations on ministerial action in the matter but the councils are &ldquo;ghettoising&rdquo; people in housing areas for administrative convenience.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decided <Col N="616" /> on 22nd May, 1973, to make available, on a temporary basis, a direct payment to building societies for the purpose of enabling them to offer such rate of interest on shares as may be specified by me from time to time.  Having regard to the current level of interest rates generally, I have for the time being specified a rate of 7 per cent for this purpose. The payment will amount in present circumstances to the increased cost, in the case of each society, of a 7 per cent shares rate over and above a 6 per cent rate.  It will be made only to societies which maintain an upper limit of 10 per cent on home loans and which maintain an embargo on lending for purposes other than housing, although loans for non-housing purposes to which a society was inescapably committed on the 23rd May, 1973, may be made without prejudicing its claim to the subvention. Further, with a view to lowering the level of management expenses, I have asked the larger societies to consider taking steps to reduce the volume of competitive advertising and make greater use of joint advertising and to consider drawing up an agreed code of practice governing their activities.  The subvention does not involve any disclosure by the societies, to the Revenue Commissioners or other Government Department, of the identities of depositors.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Report of the InterDepartmental Working Group on Water Pollution indicates in chapter 4 that, while a large proportion of sewerage is discharged untreated into rivers, lakes, estuaries and the sea via unsuitable outfalls, a greater portion of the smaller towns have sewage treatment plants, while the larger towns do not even though they discharge a greater pollutional load.  The reasons for this are that the sewerage systems of the smaller towns were generally constructed more recently than those of the larger ones, and therefore benefited from the more modern concern about pollution and also that the larger towns are generally situated on estuaries or on larger rivers, which were considered to have sufficient capacity to absorb pollution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  This year £6 million more is available than was available last year for this type of work.  I hope to encourage local authorities to submit proposals for sewage disposal schemes in their areas.  This appears to be the most direct way of dealing with the problem.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That decision was taken by the former Deputy Boland, one of my illustrious predecessors, when he was Minister for Local Government.  I am sure it was repeated by other Ministers, including Deputy Molloy himself. I would be glad if the local authorities would keep updating their priority lists.  According to some of the deputations which have visited me it appears that people consider that their areas are too low on their own county priority list.  I would be glad if such schemes would be prepared.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Some local authorities would submit schemes for approval which would in fact provide for a new sewerage scheme where such scheme did not exist, or would submit schemes for replacing existing schemes which have gone out of date.  I am talking about the treatment works at the end of the sewerage line before there is any discharge of the effluent, wherever it is discharged.  There is a question of priorities here.</P>

      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 43 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>I have not made any change in policy in relation to the amenity grants scheme.  I would have liked to develop the scheme further this year but on assuming office I found that the provision for 1973-74 had been affected by a decision taken last year and at the same time I found it necessary to put all the additional funds available to me into the expansion of the housing and sanitary services programme and towards the relief of the rates burden on ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original provision for the schemes last year was £300,000. During the year it was decided to allocate a further £165,000 to the schemes but the Minister for Finance at the time.  Deputy Colley made it a condition of his sanction that there would be a corresponding reduction in the budgetary provision for the scheme for 1973-74.  I would point out that this <Col N="631" /> sum of £165,000 and the net £240,000 provided in this year's estimate together comes to £405,000, more than a third more than last year's original provision.</P>

      <P>No matter what way the Minister tries to twist these figures he comes out in a very poor light.  May I ask the Minister whether he is satisfied that he should reduce substantially, by nearly 50 per cent, the amount of money allocated for the provision of playgrounds and amenities of that nature, which the whole community are crying out for?  Each local authority are unable to proceed with such schemes because of inadequate funds. The scheme had shown a substantial increase since it was introduced and now the Minister, in his wisdom&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>National School Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Scheme 1972: Motion.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke) Richard (Dick) Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the National School Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) Scheme, 1972, prepared by the Minister for Education with the consent of the Minister for Finance under the Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1928 and laid before the House on the 21st July, 1972, be confirmed.</P>
      <P>The main provisions of this amending scheme are, briefly:</P>
      <P>1.  The national teachers' strike in 1969 will not interrupt pensionable service (paragraph 24):</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="636" /> 2.  The national teachers' pension scheme will be a contributory scheme (paragraph 7);</P>
    <P>3.  The establishment of reciprocity of pensionable service as between the national teachers' and secondary teachers' pension schemes (paragraphs 9 and 10);</P>
    <P>4.  National teachers who, in the past, had given service in preparatory colleges may have that service reckoned for pension purposes (paragraph 9);</P>
    <P>5.  A national teacher who had certain service in the Irish Folklore Commission and who had been allowed to have half of that service reckoned for pension may now have it reckoned in full (paragraph 23).</P>
    <P>The national teachers' pension scheme has been a non-contributory scheme since 1934, a circumstance which was taken into account when the salary scales for these teachers were being drawn up or adjusted from time to time.  On the other hand, the pension schemes for post-primary teachers were, and are, on a contributory basis at the rate of 5 per cent of the teacher's pensionable rate of pay and this circumstance, too, was adverted to in the drawing up or adjustment of salary scales for post-primary teachers.  The introduction of common basic scale of salary for teachers generally as from 1st July, 1968, demanded that these discrepancies in regard to pension conditions be rationalised and, so, the superannuation of national teachers was established on a contributory basis with effect as from 1st July, 1968.  Paragraph 7 of this amending scheme will give statutory effect to this situation.</P>
    <P>In preparing this amendment I felt it was only right to have regard to those national teachers who had to retire, either because they had reached the statutory age limit or because of disability, at the end of the school year which ended on 30th June, 1968, that is, one day before the introduction of the improved pay structure for teachers.  Accordingly I have provided in paragraph 8 of the scheme now before the House that these teachers will, in their pensions <Col N="637" /> and lump sums, get the benefit of the improved salary structures. Post-primary teachers who had to retire at the end of the corresponding post-primary school year&mdash;31st July, 1968, for secondary schools and 31st August, 1968, for vocational schools &mdash;had their superannuation awards based on the improved rates.</P>
    <P>At present the secondary teachers' pension scheme allows for the reckoning of national teacher service for superannuation purposes.  There is not, however, a similar reciprocal provision in the national teachers' scheme for a pensionable secondary teacher who transfers to national teaching. Paragraph 9 of this amending scheme will rectify that anomaly, and teachers who have retired since 1st October, 1956, inclusive, will have the opportunity of availing of this provision where applicable and have their pensions revised from the date of retirement.</P>
    <P>A small number of national teachers had, in the past, given service in the preparatory colleges but through lack of suitable provision could not receive pensionable credit for that service.  I propose, in this paragraph 9, also, to give any such national teacher, including those who may have retired on or after 1st October, 1956, the opportunity of recovering the pensionable value of preparatory college service which ceased before 5th January, 1957; and where the opportunity is availed of, I propose to have pensions which have already been granted to these teachers revised with effect from that date of retirement.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to have, eventually, pension reciprocity generally for the teaching services in order that there may be greater mobility within the teaching profession.  Unfortunately there are difficulties&mdash;not the least being the necessity for amending legislation&mdash;in the way of including vocational teachers in reciprocity arrangements.  These teachers are employed by local authorities and their pensions are provided for under the Local Government (Superannuation) Act 1956.  My Department is at present tackling this problem in collaboration <Col N="638" /> with Departments of Local Government and Finance, but it will be a little time yet before the necessary proposals can be brought before the House.  In the meantime I thought it best to establish what reciprocity could be speedily achieved.</P>
    <P>An amendment to the national teachers' pension scheme in 1967 allowed a teacher who had at least three years whole-time service in the Irish Folklore Commission prior to 5th November, 1951, to reckon half of that service for pension.  As the number of teachers involved is insignificant, and having regard to the nature of the work of the former Irish Folklore Commission, I consider that a more liberal approach is warranted.  I have therefore provided, in paragraph 23, that such service may be given full pensionable credit.</P>
    <P>I believe that this amending superannuation scheme will be generally welcomed by the teachers and I am satisfied that its provisions are just and reasonable.  I have no hesitation, therefore, in recommending to the House that it be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>Os rud é gur mé féin a thug isteach i dtúis ama an scéim úr seo, ní féidir liom rud ar bith a rá ina éadan.  Mar adúirt mé, is é mo scéim féin atá ann.</P>
      <P>This scheme was drawn up by me with the consent of the then Minister for Finance.  Therefore, I can find little wrong with it.  This is one of the occasions in this House when we appear to be in complete agreement.  To some extent the scheme relates to teachers who had been in other branches of the teaching service and who have become national teachers.  Apart from this, as stated by the Minister, the scheme provides for a number of other matters.  It provides for the introduction of a contributory pension scheme for national teachers and that the payment of contributions would be taken into account in respect of salary scales.  This, of course, relates to the findings of the Ryan tribunal and it brings the scheme into line with that of the secondary and vocational teachers' schemes which are and have been contributory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary teachers had a contributory <Col N="639" /> scheme at one stage but, by virtue of an arrangement with the then Minister for Education, the scheme was discontinued.</P>
    <P>It is provided in paragraph 8 of the scheme that teachers who retire, on age or disablement grounds on 30th June, 1968&mdash;that being the end of the school year&mdash;would get the benefit of the new salary structure which came into operation on 1st July, 1968.  This is reasonable. It does not apply to those who retired voluntarily on 30th June, 1968 and I wonder if we could have a few examples of cases of people who would, in such circumstances, retire voluntarily?</P>
    <P>The really important aspect of paragraph 9 is that, taken in conjunction with the existing provisions of the secondary teachers scheme, there is the introduction of pension reciprocity between national and secondary teachers.  Paragraph 9 is important also, as the Minister has mentioned, to those who are serving as national teachers and who had service as secondary or preparatory college teachers before 5th January, 1957 because they are given the opportunity of reckoning that service, regardless of whether they were members of their pension schemes, under certain conditions. So far as I can remember, the significance of that date 5th January, 1957 is that the secondary teachers pension scheme is voluntary.  Many did not join it at all and, on 5th July, 1956 the scheme was thrown open for the second and last time so as to enable non-members to join or to allow members to antedate their membership with full retrospection in each case. They were given six months, ending 5th January, 1957 to exercise this option.</P>
    <P>The provisions in paragraphs 11 to 22 extend the scope of the existing provision in the national teachers' scheme to provide against dual reckoning of the same period of service and against according to a transferee from secondary to national teaching, more favourable terms than would be available to a national teacher.</P>
    <P>Regarding paragraph 23, I was glad to be able to make the change permitting those teachers who gave at <Col N="640" /> least three years' wholetime service in the National Folklore Commission before 5th November, 1951 to be reckoned in full for national teacher pension purposes rather than, as the Minister has pointed out, have half the service reckoned for such purposes as was the case up to now.  The number of persons involved was very small.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 24 provides that the national teachers' strike period from 28th May, 1969 to 8th June of that year will not interrupt pensionable service, provide the teachers concerned paid the appropriate contributions and that they resumed work immediately after the strike unless prevented from doing so by retirement or death.  It also provides that pensions awarded already and which were affected adversely by the strike, can be adjusted. This is not something new but it is very important.  Strikes are very serious matters not only at the time they are taking place but also in respect of the rather estranged atmosphere that often follows.  Anything that can be done to improve relations between the parties involved should be done and this paragraph is a contribution towards better relations in the circumstances. I welcome the confirmation of this scheme which was signed by me in July last.</P>

      <Col N="641" /> That the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation (Amendment) (No. 2) Scheme, 1972, prepared by the Minister for Education, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, under the Teachers' Superannuation Act, 1928, and laid before the House on the 14th July, 1972 be confirmed.</P>
    <P>When the comprehensive schools were being established it was arranged that the teachers concerned would be provided with a pension scheme on the same lines as that already in existence for secondary teachers.  In consultation with the Department of Finance it was decided that the most effective way of providing such a scheme would be by amending the existing secondary teachers scheme to embrace teachers in comprehensive schools.</P>
    <P>This amendment is intended to make that provision.  The amendment comprises a definition of a comprehensive school teacher, and then goes on to provide that each relevant paragraph and schedule of the existing scheme is amended to include comprehensive school teachers.  This amendment does not alter the secondary teachers scheme in any other way.</P>
    <P>The essential principles of the secondary teachers scheme are broadly the same as those applying in other public service pension schemes, the main point of difference being that it is a voluntary scheme.  Therefore, every comprehensive school teacher will have to decide for himself whether he will join the scheme or remain out of it.  The amendment provides that a comprehensive school teacher who exercises his option to join the scheme within six months of the date of confirmation of this amendment may have all his previous teaching service in a comprehensive school made pensionable.  If he has not joined within six months he may, of course, join at any later date, but then he could only reckon previous service up to a limit of 15 months in accordance with the terms of the existing scheme.</P>

A serving comprehensive schoolteacher may opt to join the scheme.  So long as he does so within six months, he can reckon all his service as a comprehensive schoolteacher. This matter might be drawn to the attention of the comprehensive schoolteachers, particularly as the Minister has pointed out that it is not mandatory that a teacher should join the scheme.  I welcome the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The limits are set out &ldquo;£9.50 not to exceed £10.50&rdquo;, and it is a case of whether there are dependants. I should like the Minister to let me know in how many cases of old age pensioners are there dependants and to what extent this affects the situation numerically.  With the easing of the means test, the position is that anybody having over £9 per week will get only 65p.  As a result of the publicity given to the changes, I have had a lot of difficulties with pensioners who believed they could get the full old age pension even though they have £9.50 per week income, whereas it must be made clear that this is the upper limit, that a person with £9 will get 65p and 65p only unless he has dependants.  I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary, when speaking on the section, to remind me what was the previous figure: where £9 now operates as the maximum at the top for pensioners without dependants, what was the previous limit in this case.</P>
      <P>This is one case where the public have been more disappointed than with any other aspect of this whole new social welfare legislation which is implementing the budget proposals. The persons who supported the Coalition Government in the election believed they were doing so for the complete abolition of the means test for old age pensions.  The abolition of the means test was one of the 14 points, whereas we have a paltry reduction from a figure which I cannot recall at the moment to £9.  A pensioner will now get 65p if he has an income of £9 a week, and this is taking the place of a very explicit promise that the means test would be abolished. This is one of the greatest betrayals and it makes a mockery of the whole question of issuing and promulgating policies before elections take place.  I think this is disgusting.</P>

      <P>As regards the Deputy's query as to the number who would be eligible now for the pension and the number who would be eligible <Col N="644" /> when this Bill comes into operation, I am at a loss to relate the realities of the situation to some of his comments, in so far as the situation before the budget announcement and before this Bill comes into operation is that any person who has an income of or exceeding £273 per year is not eligible for a full pension&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure is £494. In fact, it means that before one can qualify for a pension at all in the present situation he cannot have an income exceeding 50p per week.  The effect of the provisions of this Bill will be to allow persons who otherwise qualify to earn up to and including £4 per week.  That is a very considerable increase in the monetary qualification for the pension.  In regard to the number of persons who qualify for a full pension at present, it is 21,000, and when this Bill comes into operation in July, 108,000 will become eligible for the full pension. I think the Deputy will agree that there is a very substantial difference between 21,000 receiving full pension&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary is misleading the House when he says one can earn up to £4 and still get full pension. The £4 is the weekly means assessed by the investigation officer, who assesses means <Col N="645" /> on such things as the right of free lodgings, ownership of a house, valuation.  All these things are assessed.  If he was earning £4 per week the investigation officer would probably assess his means at £10.  This is well known.  The Parliamentary Secretary says that only 21,000 people qualified for full pension in the past. This is not correct. In the course of the lifetime of the Seventeenth Dáil very strong representations were made that certain old age pensioners were in a much worse position than others and that, consequently, there should be a special rate for those who had no means as compared with those who had some means and those who were entitled to the use of free lodgings, living with relations.  Submitting to that very legitimate demand by voluntary workers, the Minister at that time, who was Deputy Boland, decided to have a second rate for persons of no means, which indeed, should always apply because there is a very marked difference between those with absolutely nothing and those with some means.</P>
      <P>Consequently, the extra five shillings a week was granted to persons of no means.  That was a second level rate to such persons.  When the Parliamentary Secretary refers to only 21,000 people qualifying he is referring to the number of persons who qualified for the no means five shillings.  My recollection is that 121,000 persons qualified for the full pension apart from the no means classification.  It is quite misleading to suggest that the five shillings should be reckoned in what would be regarded as the full pension.  The full pension was the pension minus the five shillings which was payable only as a result of pressure brought by voluntary bodies to pensioners of no means whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very good case could still be made for this.  There is a vast difference between the type of old-age pensioners in the category of those with nothing and those who have the pleasure of enjoying the company of their own family at their own fireside.  If a parent makes over his farm or land to his son he can qualify for full pension and he gets the full rate pension <Col N="646" /> now.  While that man continues to live with his family in the comfort of his own home, the person with no means whatever, living in a rented house, still gets only the same rate.  The five shillings recognised the fact that there arc some pensioners much worse off than others.  The Minister is using the extra five shillings to give the number of persons receiving full pensions as 21,000, whereas the number receiving full pensions, leaving out the special five shilling payment, was, if I remember correctly, 121,000.</P>
    <P>The £4 per week income limit does not mean that a pensioner can earn £4 per week and still qualify for a full pension.  All the other factors, the number of hens he has, the number of cattle he may have, whether he has a right to free lodging&mdash;anything he enjoys in the way of living will be put against him as means so that the £4 income, if he were earning it, would when the investigating officer finished with him, at least mean £8.  That should be made clear because many people will be seriously disappointed, particularly When the Parliamentary Secretary's party promised to abolish the means test.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>When any change comes about such as a rise in pensions, pensioners find their books are taken up and this causes great hardship to many of them.  I ask the Minister to see that the Department try to expedite the return of pension books after such changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem also arises with British contributory pensioners who are receiving a small portion of the Irish pension.  Because they do not qualify for a full British contributory pension they receive portion of a pension here.  Every time there is an increase in the British contributory pension these pensioners are immediately asked to hand up their pension books here.  This means handing up their books sometimes two or three times in the year.  The Parliamentary Secretary might look into this question of a person here getting the British contributory pension and portion of the Irish old-age pension.  When he gets an increase in the British pension <Col N="647" /> that increase is immediately deducted from his Irish pension which really means that he gets no increase in pension.</P>
    <P>I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look into these matters and try to rectify the injustice which people suffer through their pension books being taken up for long periods leaving them with no money during such periods.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to endorse what Deputy Brennan said. This figure of 21,000 is entirely wrong.  Definitely, there were people who had no means whatever and who were entitled to this five shillings. Other people got the full pension, less that five shillings.  It is ridiculous to suggest 21,000 as the number getting the full old-age pension.  I come from a rural area where a very small minority get this extra five shillings because there are few people in rural areas entirely dependent and having to live in flats or some such accommodation. Usually they have the comfort of their families and they are getting the full pension without doubt.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that promises were made to abolish the means test. Frankly, I would not agree with that because I do not believe in giving anything across the board.  I do not believe it is right.  Taxation should be collected for the purpose of bringing people on lower incomes up to a reasonable standard and not to make the rich richer. The increase in the limit in 1973 is ridiculous&mdash;£4 for a single person.  That must be your total income and it does not mean you can earn £4; everything is taken into account.  If your income is estimated at £4, that is £8 for a man and his wife and with the present cost of living this is entirely too low.  I should like to see the limit raised much higher but would not like increases to be given across the board. The Parliamentary Secretary should realise that putting the limit up to £4 and considering the other factors that must be taken into consideration leaves it still very low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="648" /> There are two types of income for old-age pension purposes: the farmer's estimated income and the wage earner's cash income.  Whatever you can do with an estimated income you can do nothing with a cash income.  I have seen very hard cases in towns where the wife was 70 and the husband still under 60 and drawing a wage from, say, the urban council.  Half of that wage was put against the wife and she could not get any pension.  With present wage rates, if you take a man and his wife and allow only £8, who would work for £8?  It is ridiculously low.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider seriously substantially increasing this limit.  It is ridiculous to state that only 21,000 people were drawing the full old-age pension.  That is the picture which should be made clear here.  It was five shillings for people who had nothing else.  They were penniless.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the tribute Deputy Brennan paid to the departmental officials.  Frequently there is criticism of the Department in regard to delays in the paying out of allowances of all kinds.  Of course, the investigations that have to be carried out because of the means test cause most of the delays for which the Department are blamed.  The easing of the income limit up to £4 a week will improve the lot of many people because up to the present if a person had any means whatsoever he was debarred from getting the full old age pension. This was an additional cause of worry to people approaching 70 years of age because they had to consider what to do with any small funds they might possess, such as life savings.  In many instances they had to transfer such funds to relatives in the hope that the money would be looked after for them. Many of them consequently, were unable to retain even small sums to meet emergencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thus, this improvement in the means test will mean a lot to a great many people.  In previous years people who retained the right of residence, or maintenance, or support on their farms or other property were disqualified for full pensions.  Any person who had <Col N="649" /> any money at all was debarred.  Not only will this Bill mean a monetary improvement to such people but it will remove a great source of worry.</P>

      <P>I do not think it should go out from this House that the means test has been abolished.  It was very firmly stated during the election campaign that the means test would be eliminated.  We all know the hardships caused by the means test.  I should like to get an assurance from the Parliamentary Secretary that he will consider abolishing the old age pensions committees. Their existence means that many old age pensioners have their claims delayed for anything up to eight weeks.  For instance, an applicant might reach the age of 65 years on a Tuesday.  The local committee might have met on the previous evening and that applicant would have to wait for a month before his application was considered and sent to the Department. I suggest that applications should be dealt with directly by the Department and that the committees should be abolished.</P>

      <P>I am glad Deputy Brennan raised the question of the number of people who will qualify under this section because I do not think it is widely appreciated how many will benefit.  His figure of 21,000 is accurate, although it is subject to fluctuation in the course of the year. Under the previous Government, only 21,000 people qualified for full pension but under this Bill the number is 108,000.  That is the extent of the improvement.  Can anyone fail to see the significance of the two figures? Many Deputies raised the question of the five shillings for what is described as free board and lodgings and I should like to stress that it is not possible for us in one fell swoop to do away with all the unpleasant aspects of the administration of these schemes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>We did say it.  I do not think we need apologise for the very significant step we have taken <Col N="650" /> towards complete abolition of the means test.  As one of their first priorities, the Government reduced the age to 69 years for qualification for the old age pension.  People who heretofore were disqualified from full pension if they had more than 50p per week may now earn £4 a week.  That is a considerable achievement which will affect a large number of people.</P>
      <P>In reply to the Second Stage debate, I said that as far as the Minister, the Government and I are concerned, despite the very significant achievements we have made this year, we are only at the beginning, not the end It is not only the monetary needs of those in the social welfare field that need to be catered for. The significant difference between our aproach and that of Fianna Fáil is that not alone do we consider the monetary needs of those people but we also have a policy in relation to the entire concept of social welfare. Unless that concept is one of a comprehensive, all-embracing regard for the needs of the people concerned&mdash; not necessarily individuals but families&mdash;social welfare will not really deserve that title.  That is what the ultimate goal must be.  It will not be possible to do it all at once.  I make no apology for the advances that have been made towards that goal in this budget.</P>

That poses no particular administrative problems; they either could or could not do it.  They promised this when they knew they could not do it. I am not letting this through the House lightly today.  I would even go to the extent of dividing the House because of this ridiculous cajoling of the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not accepting that, when the two-tier system is abolished, an extra few thousand will be brought into full pension.  Under the two-tier system those with small means got 5s extra.  I should like to have seen this made £1 extra because there is a vast difference, <Col N="651" /> even at the level where full pension is payable, between the means of those who live with their families and those who have no means whatever.  The voluntary organisations used to press me about some allowances for old age pensioners living alone.</P>

The present Government have done nothing about extending those to any other section of the community.  We set a headline there.  We gave something which monetary emoluments, weekly or otherwise, cannot give to the people. We enabled them to get out and live a fuller life in their old age and we gave them comforts which money alone would not bring to them.</P>

We have to expose that here as a racket to get the support of the weakest section of the people.  The Government did not live up to the promises they made before the election. We are told that a person can earn £4 per week and get the pension. Every party spent the EEC money, as it is known now, eight thousand times from every platform in the country over the last three years.  When this party were in Government we carried the EEC Referendum against the Labour Party by pointing out that the money to be saved from the agricultural subsidies would be devoted entirely to social welfare.</P>

      <P>I am on record in this House on at least two occasions as saying this and it was said also by the former Minister for Finance in this House.  Most of the things which the Labour Party tried to prevent us having were promised eloquently by the present Government before the election.  Now they are coming in to tell us what they did for the people with the money at their disposal as a result of our joining the EEC.  The people were promised the abolition of the means test before the election but now it is only a partial reduction.</P>
      <P>Farmers' produce is now fetching an increased price.  The investigation officers from the Department of Social Welfare assess the income of a smallholder living in the remote mountains of Donegal.  They are now putting down against the sale of sheep three times the figure they put down four or five years ago.  Fewer people will now qualify for old age pensions as a result of the enhanced agricultural prices which were formerly assessed at a lower scale.  We know well that any improvement in the means test is only in accordance with the improved income of the people applying for pensions.</P>
      <P>The Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary should not try to get away with the idea that their disposing of the funds we made available should reflect any credit on them.  This is one case where the promises made should have been honoured.  The people have shown their disgust at what was done by the present Government in their resounding vote in the Presidential Election, an election in which the Government said that a vote against them would be a vote of no confidence. The people were disgusted at the Government dishonouring a promise made before the general election.  The Coalition parties made a political football out of the old people in order to gain votes.  Unfortunately, it effects the Opposition as much as the Government, because we will eventually reach the stage where nobody in this country will accept anything said by anybody before an election.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 2, I should like to say that this section is coming into operation on 6th July, 1973.  I am in this House only a few years but on each occasion I spoke on a Social Welfare Bill or a budget debate one of the things I pressed for was that the old age pension should be paid at an early date.  The procedure was that it was not paid until September or October due to administrative difficulties.  Many people who would have benefited from the increase had passed away by the time it became payable.  I am glad that this section of the Bill will come into operation on 6th July, 1973.  I do not know what the administrative difficulties were but they have now been disposed of.  This means that many people will benefit.  You often find that, if you are waiting for money, when you get it, it is well nigh useless.</P>
      <P>Section 2 provides for an increase of £1 to old age pensioners.  This is a major and significant increase.  We have not had an increase of this nature ever before.  It represents a breakthrough in social welfare benefits.  I hope it will be followed by further increases over the next few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased with the easing of the limit for the means test.  In the few years I have been in this House, I have come across many instances of people who were terrified of getting a call from officials of the Department. <Col N="654" /> They were afraid that whatever few pounds they had would interfere with their pension.  I agree with Deputy Gallagher who spoke about the pension book being taken from people while their claims were being investigated. I hope that whatever administrative difficulty there is on this point can be resolved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to avail of this opportunity to put two propositions to the Minister which I think have some merit, and to which he might give sympathetic consideration.  We all agree that ideally social welfare recipients should not be used in a political game.  Social welfare recipients are in need of all the money they get, and could do with much more.  There is a time during the year when every member of the community feels in need of as much money as he can possibly get, namely, Christmas time.  I suggest to the Minister that, to indicate his concern and our concern for social welfare recipients, he might arrange that they would get a double payment in the week immediately prior to Christmas Day.  I realise that there might be administrative difficulties but, when it comes to serving those people, administrative difficulties or difficulties of that nature should not be regarded too highly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJones" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Denis Francis Jones">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to bring it to the Deputy's attention that this section deals with the means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>While the section refers specifically to the means test, other speakers have, with your permission. perhaps, strayed a little beyond it, and forgive me if I have done the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come to my second proposition which refers specifically to the means test.  While all great things happen by degrees, I would be happy if there could be a global removal of the means test.  One area in which the Minister could do that forthwith, and there would not be any great cost involved &mdash;and it could be the foundation on which we could move towards the removal of the means test entirely&mdash;is in the area of the blind pension.  I was <Col N="655" /> very saddened during the year to discover that in the case of a married couple, both of whom were blind, because the gentleman was working and receiving an extra 32/- per week, the blind pension was reduced by that amount.  There cannot be many married couples both of whom are blind.  I think&mdash;and I said it to the Department at that time&mdash;that the appeals officer who adjudicated that the couple in question should be subjected to a means test had more regard for regulation, indeed for legislation, than I would like him to have.  I hope the Minister will henceforth ease the minds of the appeals officers and remove the means test which exists in that area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>A few points have been raised.  Deputy Brennan, when stating what the Fianna Fáil Government had done for recipients of social welfare benefits, mentioned the free travel and free electricity as an illustration of their deep concern for people who come within that category.  As I mentioned by way of interjection, this is also a monetary consideration and a very welcome one no doubt; one that should not be downgraded.  With the reduction of the qualifying age limit from 70 to 69, of course, the qualifying age for these benefits is also reduced. Even in that field an advance has been made.  The point I am trying to make is that the whole approach is how one should define social welfare. If we are to define it as an assistance officer shoring up poverty by giving out a few pounds, and leaving it at that, that is exactly what will ensure that poverty is perpetuated from generation unto generation and one of the most significant features of the recent budget and of this Bill is the new awareness of what is needed and the realisation that we are not just dealing with individuals <i>qua</i> individuals but with families.  That must be the approach if we are to have any degree of success in our campaign to eliminate poverty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish Deputy Brennan would make up his mind.  He sweeps aside the provisions in this Bill as insignificant; he says we are fooling the people.  In the <Col N="656" /> same breath he implies that I should be ashamed of myself since these marvellous advances have been made possible only because of our entry to the European Economic Community, something the Labour Party opposed. Now he just cannot have it both ways. He must make up his mind.  Either it is a good budget because of our entry into the European Economic Community or it is a bad budget.  He cannot have it both ways.  It must be either one or the other.</P>
    <P>I believe the provisions in the Bill to be extremely good provisions despite the fact that the money from the EEC just was not there.  With regard to the Labour Party's opposition to joining the EEC, as I said before, I do not feel one bit ashamed either about this Bill or about the Labour Party's attitude to the EEC. We gave honest, honourable and legitimate criticism of some aspects of the negotiated terms, negotiated by Fianna Fáil, for our entry into the EEC.  As I also said on another occasion when discussing this Bill, I am not nearly as fearful now about the EEC because I have far more confidence in the people going there to negotiate on our behalf.  That has greatly lessened my fears.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan made some very extravagant charges against our political honesty in regard to the means test and commitments made before the election.  I do not know what Fianna Fáil's hopes were when they had charge of the Department of Social Welfare but, by heaven, I know what the realities were.  I agree with Deputy Tunney when he says we should not use the provisions of this Bill as a political football, but not perhaps for the same reason as his. What this Bill will provide for people will be theirs by right and this is something we must get across.  One of the really interesting things that has come to light in recent years is the tremendous amount of work done in the field of social welfare by voluntary organisations and one of the most significant features that has come to light is the degree of hidden poverty in our society.  A great deal of that hidden poverty can be attributed to the fact that the stamp of the workhouse <Col N="657" /> ward was put on social welfare. People who needed social welfare were made to feel that they had to go cap in hand and ask: &ldquo;Please, sir, may I have something in order to provide the necessaries of life?&rdquo; It must be brought home to the people that what they get by way of social welfare, be it contributory or non-contributory, is theirs by right and, secondly, it is theirs by right by virtue of the fact that they are citizens of this country and they do not have to come cap in hand for it.</P>
    <P>It was no intention of mine to make this kind of speech on this Bill.  I would have been quite happy to get the Bill through as speedily as possible. Indeed, that is still my hope. Deputy Brennan said a moment ago that he was going to expose this con man trick and, if necessary, he would divide the House.  As I said, I am anxious that the Bill should go through as speedily as possible but, on the other hand, I would welcome a lengthy debate on the Bill because I do not believe the people really realise the advances that will be made in social welfare when this Bill is passed.  It is up to Deputy Brennan now.  If he wants to go on debating the provisions of the Bill I will welcome such a debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly did not expect the Parliamentary Secretary to say he wanted to curtail the debate on the Bill.  Deputy Enright on the Government benches said that he is not concerned with what is in the Bill; he is concerned with what is not in the Bill.  It is with what is not in the Bill that we are also concerned. I can assure the Parliamentary Secretary that we welcome the provisions in so far as they will benefit social welfare recipients, but we have the right to expose the promises that were broken.  One of the promises was the abolition of the means test.  That is what we are discussing in section 2. Section 2 merely seeks to keep parity with rising costs and improve the incomes of smallholders who are applicants for old age pensions.  That is what we want to expose and we would <Col N="658" /> be doing less than our duty as an Opposition if we did not make it known to the people that the Government, who promised the abolition of the means test before the election, are now not honouring that promise.  We are not denigrating the improvements in the Bill, I had the pleasure of giving £1 to old age pensioners when there was not a penny for anything. I gave them a £1 last year and there was no song and dance about it.  I did not regard it as enough and I would have liked to have been able to give more, but I did not promise I was going to do something I knew perfectly well I had no intention of doing.  It is the broken promise we are concerned with and with the honour of the House and the disparity as between what people say and what they do.  There is a vast gulf between the promise and the performance.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary's party promised the abolition of the means test and the reduction of the age to 65.  Some people believed this. There never was a year since Fianna Fáil first took the line of improving social welfare when the people had the right to expect better benefits than they had on this occasion.  They had this right because we shouted it to them from the housetops, from every platform on three occasions.  We told them about the great improvements that were coming.  We, in Fianna Fáil, told them what we had decided to give them and it is on record.  We did not tell them anything we did not feel we could do.  We did not promise the abolition of the means test.  We certainly eased it each year.  I would not expect the Parliamentary Secretary to be fully conversant with all the workings of his Department but he will find out that each year social welfare benefits were increased.  For old age pensioners the means test was automatically relaxed each year, in order to qualify for the minimum which now, over £9, gets the recipient 65 pence.  Those are the things we are concerned about.  The Parliamentary Secretary talks about a new approach, that the people are not going cap in hand.  I candidly confess that I cannot understand what he means.</P>

There is no change in that system; there is no change in that approach.  It is the exact same approach.  What change has taken place?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary trying to tell the House that he has done something new?  The investigation officer comes in and asks the number of hens, geese, ducks and cattle you have.  He must ascertain what your income is, what you enjoy, what he must put against you.  There is no change whatever in that.  Why the nonsense of talking about a new approach? I do not see it.  The officer works out, on the scale presented to him by those of us who make laws in this House, what the man is entitled to.  Is there any change in that system?  The Parliamentary Secretary is trying to hang a debate on some sort of imaginary concept that I am not aware of.  It is beyond me to understand what this talk about a new approach means.</P>

    <P>We increased social welfare payments every year.  I had great pleasure in doing that.  Every time the Opposition said: &ldquo;Thanks for the increase but it is not nearly enough.  It has already been eroded by rising prices.&rdquo; That is a stock argument.  It can be applied this year as well as before.  In fact, the budget has already contributed to a rise in prices.  The only thing new in the whole approach to social welfare is that the recipients were led to expect something wonderful and they only got, if you take children's allowance out of it, a little more than they got before we ever entered <Col N="660" /> the EEC.  I gave them £1 across the board the year before last, 50 pence last year and £1 to those over 80.  I thought that was an excellent budget without one penny of an increase in taxation.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;when we come to the exposition of one of the greatest frauds that has ever been perpetrated on the most needy and weakest section of the people, the old age pensioners. It is a disgrace, and the Parliamentary Secretary has made no effort to explain why he has done this. We all love to have good things to say before an election but we only say what we know we can honour when elections are over.  We spelt out what we would do and we outlined a very generous programme indeed. The Government have let the people down and they have no answer. I am not accepting the section.</P>

      <P>The Deputy referred to a couple of items.  He talked about what I referred to as a new approach to social welfare and said he could not understand it.  I accept that fully. That has been one of the main barriers to any real advance in that field.  Nobody on that side of the House would understand it.  To make it a little more simple I shall confine myself to monetary advances because it would appear that anything outside that field would not be understood by the Deputy and his party.  The facts are, and this is a matter of records, that Fianna Fáil spent £11.6 million last year on social <Col N="661" /> welfare.  That was their total expenditure. This year £51 million is being spent in the same period.  That is also on public record.  I shall let those two figures speak for themselves.  The approach to the Department of Social Welfare by the Fianna Fáil Government was: &ldquo;Let us make out our budget, let us see what every Department requires and we will give the residue to social welfare&rdquo;.  I do not blame Deputy Brennan alone for that because there is collective responsibility in the Cabinet.  I blame the Fianna Fáil Government and the Fianna Fáil Party.  I can only say that, no matter what is said, I am quite confident that the very significant advance that has been made in this budget speaks for itself.</P>

      <P>I certainly will not let the Parliamentary Secretary away with a stupid statement of that kind when he gets up to explain this new approach and sits down without explaining it, merely contenting himself with saying that the new approach is there but that nobody on this side of the House understands it.</P>

      <P>I do not see where the new approach is.  I have already pointed out that the new approach is that the pensioners were promised the abolition of the means test and that promise was dishonoured.  It is difficult to understand a new approach of this kind.  Last year £11.6 million was spent.  The Parliamentary Secretary does not understand what he is talking about.  In every year when I was Minister for Social Welfare, and in years when I was not Minister in that Department, the Government gave the major allocation of what was available to social welfare.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that that Department got the residue after every other Department were satisfied.  Last year the social welfare recipients were the only people who got anything.  It was of great benefit to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We did not include the children's allowances last year because the whole scheme was under examination due to <Col N="662" /> pressure from the Labour Party mainly, although not entirely, to have selectivity introduced.  We had an interdepartmental committee examining the possibility of introducing selectivity and it was pressed by members of the Labour Party every time they spoke on social welfare.  We gave the social welfare recipients £12 million last year for a full year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We gave them benefits without imposing one single penny of taxation, without sending up the inflationary spiral and without bringing in a budget that would erode the fruits of what we gave them.  We gave £1 to each old age pensioner over 80 years.  We are now discussing the means test.  We gave £1 to pensioners over 80 years of age and 50p to others. This was without any bonanza from the EEC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has not made the slightest attempt to explain to the House why the Coalition Government, with their 14- or 15-point document promising the abolition of the means test&mdash;just as they promised a complete prices and income policy, although that is not relevant in this section&mdash;acted as they did.  We had to stand at church gates and at platforms and listen to candidates promising that there would no longer be a means test if they supported the Coalition Government.  We must now stand here humiliated and submit to a Deputy on the backbenches saying that we did not do too badly but we did not keep our promises.  We are delighted that the pensioners got something which they were promised a thousand times from every party in this House over the past three years.  Why mislead them? That is unexplained. What about the new approach which nobody on this side of the House can understand?  It is there somewhere.  It is peculiar.  It is a strange thing.  It is supernatural.  It is only possible with some sort of supernatural wisdom to understand this new approach.  Every single pensioner in the country must undergo the same performance as heretofore.  The Government get away with a lot these days. <Col N="663" /> They must be allowed their honeymoon and all the assistance of the media that is coming to them, but they are building up in the minds of the people an image which will not assist <Col N="664" /> them, in so far as distrust and mistrust are concerned.  Explain why you have left them down about the abolition of the means test.</P>

      <P>Has the Parliamentary Secretary any figures to indicate how many new recipients are likely to be brought into the scheme because of the relaxed means test?  Also, regarding the 4th July as being the operative date, the Parlamentary Secretary made it reasonably clear that it might be impossible physically for the Department to have payments made on that date.  This type of problem was one that we encountered frequently in dealing with these matters.  The Department always assured me that it was not possible physically to make payments within a short time.  I accepted that and that was why, in announcing our scheme before the election, we said that payments would be made as and from 1st April of this year but that they would be made in retrospect.  The date of the commencement of payments would be determined by the ability of the Department to deal with the matter. I doubt that the Department will be in a posiion to have these payments made on the date mentioned unless extra staff is available to them. We are prepared to accept that if the payments are not brought in on the date specified they will be paid retrospectively.  The obvious means of overcoming this problem was the line taken by us.  That was that payments would date from April 1st of the current financial year and that they would be made retrospectively as soon as it was possible for the Department to effect them, probably July or August.  We did not specify a date because of the great strain that such changes impose on the Department.</P>
      <P>Can the Parliamentary Secretary let me know how many additional persons will be put on the unemployed register as the result of the improved means test in respect of unemployment assistance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy must be aware, it is not possible to give an accurate figure as to how many persons will be affected by this legislation, but some figures which I have may be of assistance to him.  These are that it is estmiated that the total number of persons comprehended in the increase will be composed of 49,000 applicants. 29.000 adult dependants&mdash;wives&mdash;and 75.000 child dependants.  Regarding the <Col N="666" /> date of operation, we hope that the payments will come into effect from the 4th July but, in the event of this not being possible in all cases, payments would, of course, be retrospective. At the moment I am not aware that that situation will arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that it may be possible to honour the date specified in respect of the increased benefits which means merely increasing the amounts.  The reason I was trying to elicit from the Parliamentary Secretary the number of new claimants and, consequently, the number of new recipients who would benefit as a result of the changed means test, was that this is where the backlog of work could prevent the operative date from being adhered to.  The applications of a large number of new claimants would have to be examined, thereby creating a blockage in the working of the Department.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has been referring to a restructuring of existing schemes and to the introduction of a new comprehensive scheme and all that nonsense.  The social welfare structure is sound.  Basically, it is comprehensive, and requires only additions and improvements.  When I introduced the Employment Period Order a couple of years ago I found that there were a large number of chronically unemployed persons in this country, persons who would not be taken off the unemployment register, irrespective of what employment might be provided.  As the Parliamentary Secretary may verify from the records in the Department, my arrangement was to transfer such persons to national assistance, thereby not requiring them to complete a non-employment certificate each week. These are people who are not available for work for many reasons&mdash;for example, because of age, family conditions or infirmities&mdash;but they are persons who are in need of the weekly payments they have been receiving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has only to consider the situation that arises when a new factory goes into operation in any town to realise the veracity of what I am saying. If, say, there is an unemployment figure in the local exchange of 400 <Col N="667" /> people and if a factory beginning production employs 600 people, it will usually be found that almost the entire 400 people continue to be registered at the local employment exchange.  This situation results from the fact that industrialists seek out school leavers or other young and active people who have been employed in other organisations. Therefore, in regard to unemployment assistance, if the Parliamentary Secretary wishes to engage in a useful exercise, I suggest that he follow up my proposed change in the home assistance field.  This would provide that the chronically unemployed would be brought into a national assistance scheme and, consequently, written off the unemployment register.  Apart from this aspect of the section, there is nothing in it to which I take exception.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly the staff in Social Welfare are and, indeed, will be under very severe pressure in order to ensure as far as possible that these payments will be made at the appropriate date.  Having regard to the sheer volume of claims and reassessment of claims going through the Department, with the best will an the world, there will be some delay.  I would ask Deputies to bear this in mind when the time comes.  However, every possible effort is being made to ensure that the payment will be made on the appropriate date.  I would like to take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of the tremendous amount of work being done by the staff to ensure that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan made one very significant point, and it relates to an exchange we had on the other section which is also appropriate to this one. Deputy Brennan said that we have&mdash; and it is quite true&mdash;a large number of chronically unemployable persons, and he suggested that we should remove them from the unemployment register onto the home assistance register. While accepting that we have a large proportion of people in that category, I do not accept that it would solve our society's problems to any extent to transfer them from one register to another or from one set of figures to another.  Deputy Brennan <Col N="668" /> also made the point, properly, that where a new industry is set up in certain areas and job opportunities become available in those areas, it does not have any significant effect on the number of people registering as unemployed in the area because of this large number of what he described as chronically unemployable people.</P>
    <P>That is where the new approach to social welfare comes in.  It is not a question of transferring people from one section to another but of realising that we have this problem, that it is not an individual problem but a family problem, because in the majority of cases, for various reasons mostly outside their control the people who fall into this category are the heads of families.  Unless we do something more than provide monetary assistance we are perpetuating that type of problem. The whole approach to Social Welfare must be not only to assist the individual and the family in their immediate needs but to find ways and means of getting them out of this terrible situation in which they find themselves as a family.  Unless we do that, we are not going to make any contribution whatsoever to solving this question of poverty which looms very large in our society.  I am glad Deputy Brennan illustrated the high proportion of people we have in our society in this category.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary talked about heads of families, but when Deputy Brennan was speaking he mentioned specifically those who are excluded under the employment period order a couple of years ago and were as the Parliamentary Secretary will know, single persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the time of payment of these benefits, I have noticed in the last few weeks that recipients of unemployment assistance who have qualification certificates have been sent out queries, new forms to fill up.  These have come out of the blue.  There does not seem to be any logical reason why recipients of unemployment assistance should get these forms. I could see some reason for one or two queries in the forms sent out but in a large number of <Col N="669" /> cases in the last few weeks they have had to give over again the same data which they gave when applying, some of them recently, some of them not so recently.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would indicate why this procedure is being adopted on a large scale.  The question asked of me by these people who called to see me is: &ldquo;why did I get this?&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Frankly, I am at a loss for a reply to the Deputy's question, because, as far as I am aware, there is absolutely no change in the normal queries that would be asked by the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with this section I was anxious to know the number of extra persons who would qualify and so forth, and that brought me on to the question of the chronically unemployed which to some extent, we did get tabs on during that famous year when I reintroduced the employment period order. I learned a lot from that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, indeed, in more ways than one.  I learned that there were many people who would not benefit even if work was provided on the other side of the street.  If the Department sets out tomorrow to enforce the provisions of the Unemployment Assistance Acts to ascertain whether people are capable of, available for and genuinely seeking employment, they could deal very harshly with these people.  This is what Deputy Cunningham is talking about. There is a suggestion that that is being done at present.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>There are signs of persons being approached and asked: &ldquo;how long is it since you sought work?  Have you evidence of where you worked?&rdquo; This is periodical.  This happened before.  It is happening now, too.  The Parliamentary Secretary is talking about a new approach, but if this is done these people will find themselves without any means.  My suggestion was that the newlyorientated home assistance scheme, <Col N="670" /> being nationalised, would make a national assistance payment to these people without dragging them in weekly to sign a certificate that they were capable of, available for, and genuinely seeking employment.  These are people who could not exist without some weekly assistance to which they have adapted themselves for many years.  Some have invalid brothers, some elderly parents and some are themselves not in a position, through bodily infirmity, to undertake work.  This is a section that is being provided for under the Unemployment Assistance Acts for a long time but which in actual fact does not qualify under these Acts.  I am not suggesting that payment should be discontinued; they must get something although it is being erroneously described at present.</P>

      <P>In regard to the separate list for what are termed chronically unemployed, I am quite certain that Deputy Brennan had no intention of simply transferring people from one list to another; there was much deeper thought behind it. It is something which I have felt for a considerable time we should do, that is, have a list of the people who have been unemployed for, say, two or three years and who could be considered as chronically unemployed.  I should like to know what specific proposals the Parliamentary Secretary has to deal with these people? Will he set up a special unit in his Department to investigate the rehabilitation of these people? Something like that might be worthwhile. A sample might be taken of people in an area where&mdash;to cite Deputy Brennan's example&mdash;an industry arises with 500 jobs to offer and the local employment exchange shows little if any fall in the number registered there.  I am sure that new industries would want a realistic assessment of the true unemployment figure in an area.  If there is an area of high unemployment, where it can be shown that work is available within a reasonable distance, an industrialist considering the area will want to know why.  Possibly he would be interested in taking on some of those who have <Col N="671" /> been unemployed for a significant length of time.</P>
      <P>From the Government point of view also I should have thought they would be most anxious to know the true unemployment figure.  As public representatives we have all met people who would not work in a fit: unfortunately such people exist in every society, people who will make no attempt to get a job and if sent for interview will not take the job.  I see nothing wrong in the suggestion that a study of such people be made and, if possible, a list of people made out, people who have been unemployed longer than two or three years.  This is not to say that such people are the flotsam of society&mdash;that is not suggested&mdash;but, I would emphasise, in order to arrive at a true figure a study like this must be undertaken. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider this or tell the House now what specific steps he has in mind to deal with this matter.</P>

      <P>I accept the Parliamentary Secretary's statement regarding his lack of knowledge of the fact that there seems to be a fairly widespread&mdash;I can only speak of my own constituency&mdash;reinvestigation. There has been an issue of forms which have to be completed.  During a previous Coalition period, 1954-57, I remember that definite instructions were given to key Fine Gael members in certain areas&mdash;I raised this in 1954-55&mdash;to report on people who in their opinion were wrongly receiving unemployment assistance.  A copy of a letter was there suggesting to a certain Fine Gael supporter from the Fine Gael organisation that people of this kind should be reported and reinvestigated. I raised the matter in the House then and went into it fairly thoroughly.  I am satisfied such instructions were given.  I hope that is not what is happening now: I am not making the same charge.  At a time when the previous Minister says that in order to operate the provisions of this Bill it will be necessary to have all available staff engaged on it, I cannot see any good reason why if the Department's staff will be put to the pin of their collars to meet the July 1st deadline <Col N="672" /> this reinvestigation is taking place now.  I hope no appreciable number of people will be knocked off the unemployment assistance register as a result of what is taking place.  I emphasise that I can only speak for my own constituency.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish) Brendan Corish">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. Corish)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to assure the Deputy who has made the allegation on two occasions to the effect that there was an attempt by the Department of Social Welfare to knock people off unemployment assistance that the contrary is the fact.  I do not know if the Parliamentary Secretary said it&mdash;I gather from Deputy Cunningham's remarks that he did during today's debate&mdash;but, rather than engage in that sort of activity every single section of the Department is being strained to the utmost to ensure that people will get the benefits applicable from the first week in July.  To do this is indeed a big task but I have every confidence that the vast majority, 99 per cent of the people, will get their increases in the first week in July.  That was the instruction given to the officials of the Department and as far as the Parliamentary Secretary and myself are aware within the Department the machine is certainly operating.</P>
      <P>I also want to assure Deputy Cunningham, because I think I was Minister for Social Welfare in 1954-55, that such an allegation was never brought to my notice or if so, I do not remember it.  I have nothing but contempt for those who give certain information in respect of social assistance to any of the investigating officers to the effect that some man is working.  On the contrary, I want to tell the House that I am also telling the Department to ignore every anonymous letter that comes in.  I agree that in some cases they may be valid but in the vast majority of cases, as far as I am aware, they are only mischief makers who make a lot of extra work for officials, locally and in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Briscoe and Brennan asked about a change in the system for determining the number on the unemployed register and the types.  I <Col N="673" /> know there are a big number of unemployable people but I should hate to have them designated as unemployable. The whole question does not impinge so much on social welfare and in this measure it is not intended to do anything dramatic now in the entire social welfare field.  All we are doing is giving £38 million or £39 million towards the relief of people who need it.  The other problems will begin to be tackled this year.</P>
    <P>I announced in Blarney last week at a conference of social workers that my intention, as Minister for Health is to employ many more social workers and to give them the necessary funds for training and so on.  These workers can investigate the types of cases Deputies Brennan and Briscoe referred to.  These people may have domestic troubles or mental problems which make up their mental attitude to work.  I have the greatest sympathy with the fellow who was sacked 15 years ago, who tried to get work for five years thereafter and who then gave up trying.</P>
    <P>This raises the whole question of unemployment.  As a TD for my constituency I have to attend the courts of appeal and it is there we see the real problems.  I have had occasion from time to time to say into the ear of the assessor what I knew about this man or that.  I have found him to be very humane.  I have had to say: &ldquo;If that person were offered a position he would not be acceptable to the employer&rdquo;, or &ldquo;If he thought the job would last for only two weeks he would not accept it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I know the former Minister, Deputy Brennan, had some tentative proposals, as I suggested in a speech some years ago, for the establishment of a system of national assistance.  I would not be wed to such a system.  I have seen Deputy Brennan's tentative proposals.  I realise this is a problem and my Parliamentary Secretary, with special responsibility in this field, realises it, but do not let anybody think that there will be any effort on my part as Minister or on the Parliamentary Secretary's part to reduce the numbers of unemployed by the <Col N="674" /> method suggested by Deputy Cunningham.  There is no question of any directive being issued to any official to try to take anybody off social assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary for having given the social welfare classes the substantial increases contained in the budget.  It is all very well to ask which changes have come about but one can recall that for every £1 spent last year on social welfare there will be £5 spent this year.  That is a great change and it is badly needed.  It is also an excellent idea to try to pay the increased benefits from 1st July.  Even if the Parliamentary Secretary fails in his attempt to do this at least he will have tried.  For donkey's years we have been told these increased benefits could not be paid until October or January. There was always a song and dance about it, although the people who paid for the increases, those who take a drink, who smoke or who burn petrol, had to pay the increased duty on the day it was announced in the budget. Thank God this change has come.</P>
      <P>In regard to chronic unemployment, about which the Minister and Deputy Brennan have spoken, there is no doubt the list will have to be looked into seriously.  I agree that unemployable people have been getting benefits for years.  Perhaps in their early stages they were fully entitled to them but they have remained in that category and the Department never did anything to take them out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the suggestion that they be taken off unemployment assistance and put on home assistance. They would have to go to the home assistance office, fill in forms and then queue for their benefits on Tuesday or Wednesday.  If they are to be  removed from the present list, and I sincerely think they should be, putting them on home assistance would not solve the problem.  For instance, local authorities who contribute towards home assistance from the rates would blame the Government for shedding their responsiblility in this respect.  The obligation is on the Exchequer, on the Government of the day, to see that <Col N="675" /> those people are looked after in a proper way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This makes better provision for widows.  They have created a very strong lobby in recent years and I am sorry to say they had difficulty in striking a chord with those associated with social welfare. Last year, with £12 million at my disposal, I gave to widows' dependants a better increase than to the dependants of other social welfare recipients.</P>
      <P>My feeling always has been towards widows with dependants, although I have not a lot of sympathy for widows without dependants.  Such widows are not very different from single women, although some of them may be saddled with trying to maintain houses left to them by their husbands. On the other hand, the widow with dependants deserves our best efforts. She cannot go out to work or go out into the social world because she must look after her children by every means possible.  Section 9 of this Bill makes certain provisions for widows in that they will not be liable for contributions when they work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year I relaxed to a limited extent the amount they could earn before it reflected on their pensions. I thought the Minister would have gone further in that direction this year.  When I met representatives of the widows' organisation in a deputation and when I confronted them on telvision they had two complaints. One was that widows were only allowed half the benefits when they applied for unemployment assistance or disability allowance as a result of the contributory rights they had built up when in employment.  The second complaint was that when recipients of non-contributory pensions were employed and they earned over a certain figure they lost part of their allowance.  I do not want to appear to be talking too much about what I <Col N="676" /> would have done but I must say that widows have a genuine case and I would like to have done something for them towards easing their situation.</P>
    <P>The allowances here are unlikely to benefit the widow who is confined to the house and who cannot accept employment.  The widow without dependants is likely to remarry but the widow with small children is not likely to remarry.  Any social welfare benefit that can be given to widows would be welcomed by all of us.  We lag very much behind the UK social welfare system.  They give a lump sum to a widow at the time of her husband's death.  We do not do anything like that.  As well as that, the UK give very generous payments for six months and then the widow goes on to the ordinary widow's allowance.  I thought the lump sum was very justifiable and I would like to have done something for Irish widows perhaps by giving them something at the time their husbands died. Widows could be given better assistance particularly during the first year after their husbands die or until some of the children cease to be dependant on them and are able to contribute to the family income.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I extended the age limit for dependants of widows from 16 to 18 years and up to 21 years if the dependants were still at school. That was a move in the right direction. When widow's dependants cease to receive an allowance they are put out to work too soon so that they can earn money which is needed so much at home.</P>
    <P>I have no quarrel with anything that is given in this section.  We are giving £1 here.  In the scheme which we announced before the election we would certainly have been very generous towards widows and their dependants. Any worthwhile widow's pension scheme should be considerably weighted in respect of widows with dependants as against widows without any dependants.</P>

In most cases they are under the charge of guardians and somebody draws the children's allowances in respect of them.  Will orphans who are cared for in institutions receive this allowance and the children's allowance?  This has always been a sore point with the people in charge of institutions.  Many of these institutions which are run on a voluntary basis, depend on the subscriptions they get from the general public and, perhaps, a subvention from the Exchequer through the Department of <Col N="678" /> Social Welfare and the Department of Health.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I still deprecate the fact that we have not introduced a measure of selectivity here other than the clawback system which takes back children's allowances from the unfortunate taxpayer.  If I interpreted correctly the motion before the House when the budget was going through, he is compelled to apply for children's allowances, and then it is clawed back in his income tax.  This takes only a few within the net and the limit set is not high enough anyhow.  We will still be paying children's allowances to fairly wealthy people and, if we were not, we would have money to give to the big families of poor parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thought our scheme was admirably based, as it was, on income limit and valuation limit.  Having examined <Col N="679" /> the report of the interdepartmental committee which looked into this whole question of selectivity, which was strongly pressed on me by the Labour Party in each successive year on the Social Welfare Bill or on the Estimate for the Department, I believe that, with the same amount of money, the Minister could have made a worthwhile breakthrough for the large families of poor parents.  It would not have involved any physical investigation of means.  There would not be an investigation officer.  The scheme we selected was based on land valuation and income valuation as determined by the Revenue Commissioners.  Since the pay related benefit scheme depends on the revelations of the Revenue Commissioners, we could easily have applied these principles to the payment of children's allowances on a selective basis.</P>
    <P>Many people quite openly confessed to me that to them children's allowances were only a nuisance.  They are not a very big section of the community. Now they have to vouch in their returns for income tax under the clawback system which the British have been using, it becomes a positive nuisance.  If the Minister has not already done so, he should provide that people can say: &ldquo;We do not wish to apply for children's allowances&rdquo;, and opt out of applying.  If I understood correctly the motion before the House during the debate on the budget, they must apply and then they lose it in their income tax or they lose some of it.</P>
    <P>This is a very feeble attempt at selectivity.  It does not get through on a selective basis at all and I do not approve of it.  The improvement in children's allowances and the improvement in old age pensions and widows' pensions are the most welcome improvements in this year's scheme, even though they may not have come up to what the people were led to expect.</P>

      <P>I am not taking credit for it.  Large families have been getting a maintenance support to their incomes.  Our scheme, as worked out on a selective basis, had the merit that the upper income limit and the upper valuation limit which we were imposing operated in respect of the number of children in the family. Like the means test for widows, if there were a number of dependants the limit went up.  Basically, the amount being paid was not disturbed. I thought it was an excellent scheme. It is a pity that the Coalition did not put their pride in their pocket and say that the Fianna Fáil scheme was excellent and adopt it.</P>

      <P>I do not want to repeat myself.  I have already put a question. Before I say anything on section 6 I should like to have &ldquo;apprentice&rdquo;<Col N="681" /> defined.  I have a case in mind of a young girl who will be finishing school and who will then have an opportunity of taking up part-time employment as an apprentice computer programmer, as a typist, or a shorthand typist, and I want to know does she come under this category?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with some of the points raised.  Deputy Brennan said he knew some people who regarded children's allowances as a nuisance. All I can say is that it must be nice to know such people.  I do not come across too many in that category and the response I have had to the proposed increases in children's allowance has been, to say the least, very favourable.  One great advantage it has which has been acknowledged generally is that it helps where help is most needed.  It helps large families and gives the type of financial assistance that is welcomed by these people.  The question arises not only of the increases but also the extension of the qualifying age from 16 to 18 years for various qualified children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wyse is interested in one category, a child in full-time education, in full-time apprenticeship, or a child who is so physically or mentally handicapped that he cannot pursue a normal occupation.  On the question of defining &ldquo;apprenticeship&rdquo; and whether one would qualify under this scheme, &ldquo;apprenticeship&rdquo; was included because it is, in fact, an educational process.  A person attending a recognised school, or technical college or university, in the normal course of events, is pursuing a career.  He is acquiring knowledge in order to qualify to engage in a career.  Apprenticeship is exactly the same process. One is not in the labour bracket but, in fact, acquiring the knowledge necessary to qualify as an experienced tradesman or tradeswoman. The Deputy could take in the broad sense that if the person he has in mind is engaged in learning a recognised trade that person would qualify.  It is difficult to be more specific than that at the moment but if the Deputy will give me more details, now or later, I will be only too glad to look into the <Col N="682" /> matter.  The Minister for Finance pointed out that in the majority of cases the figure of £2,500 will be considerably enhanced before the clawback operates.  The clawback, in other words, operates only in respect of the increase.  That does not apply in either Northern Ireland or Britain where children's allowances are subject to income tax.  This should be recognised for what it is, a very significant help where larger families are concerned.</P>

No change is being made in the present means limit of £351.75 per annum, which applies in these cases, as it is considered that the raising of the upper means limit in the case of the non-contributory old age pension will mean that the majority of those applying for the allowances will, in fact, qualify for the old age pension.</P>

      <P>This allowance was introduced in 1970 to cater for persons in receipt of a pension from the Department whose yearly means were just outside the upper limit for entitlement to a non-contributory old age pension. The allowances are payable to such persons who are so incapacitated as to require full-time care and attention and who have residing with them for the purposes of providing that full-time care and attention a prescribed relative.  The allowance is at the same rate and is payable under the same conditions as the prescribed relative allowance, which is payable to incapacitated pensioners over the age of 70.  The upper means limit was set at a figure of £52 a year above the maximum applicable for the non-contributory old age pension.</P>

      <P>I will give a concrete case of an insured person compelled to give up employment to look after an aged relative.  That person may have been contributing to social welfare for 20 years.  The old age pensioner gets an increase in pension to maintain the person who has given up employment to look after him or her at home.  Continuity is maintained all the time by reason of the fact that the old age pensioner is receiving the extra money for the person <Col N="685" /> who is remaining at home.  This person is still insurable.  Why then is she prevented from drawing unemployment benefit?  Apparently the Act provides that to draw unemployment benefit one must be available for work and because this person is looking after an old person she is not available for work.  Yet she is being deprived of unemployment benefit after contributing for, perhaps ten, 15, 20 or 30 years to social welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wyse can bring this up on Report Stage if the Ceann Comhairle does not permit him to deal with it in detail now.  The point he is making is that the person who has the wholetime care of one or both parents, who would otherwise be alone, should be eligible to draw unemployment benefit.  This was not possible because if, for instance, a mother received £3 a week extra in respect of a daughter who had stayed at home to look after her she got it because she was able to show that she required the wholetime care and attention of the daughter.  Therefore, the daughter could not certify she was available for work if, on the other hand, she was certifying that she was available wholetime for the care of the parent.  Last year we qualified these people for credited contributions. Deputy Wyse was one of the people who was always pressing me on this.  Without having legislation to make a change, we provided that such a person should have credited contributions which qualifies her if and when she is released from <Col N="686" /> the obligation of looking after her parents.  I should like an assurance that this prescribed relative's allowance is also increased and by how much.</P>

      <P>It is frequently confused with the home care scheme. Many people refer to it as the home care scheme.  It is a different scheme. Only about a hundred people in Ireland benefit under the home care scheme and very few people know anything about the scheme anyway. The prescribed relatives allowance scheme is an excellent one.  One of the most useful schemes that can be operated in Social Welfare is one that enables an old person to enjoy life at home and save him from going into an institution.  No matter what we do for old people there is nowhere they will enjoy life better than at their own firesides.  The home care scheme and the prescribed relatives allowance scheme are designed to enable them to stay at home.  Like every other social welfare scheme the prescribed relatives allowance started off in a small way.  It grew and it has proved to be one of the most important schemes.  To keep an old person in a home at present costs as high as £25 a week.  I often had in mind that an allowance should be offered to any household which would be prepared to take somebody from a home to live with them, to adopt an old person from a home, that they should be allowed something generous, say half or even a quarter of the amount it would cost to keep them in the home.</P>

      <P>I want to support Deputy Brennan on this because for some time I had been talking to him about this scheme.  I do not think sufficient emphasis is placed on it.  I am asking the Parliamentary Secretary to give a lot more attention to this. This scheme is saving the State <Col N="687" /> thousands of pounds if not more by keeping people in their own homes.  It is the wish of every old person to end his days at his own fireside.  This is being made possible by relative's and being backed up by voluntary work. Voluntary associations are coming to people with meals-on-wheels, home nursing, <i>et cetera.</i> Anything the Parliamentary Secretary can do in this respect is worthwhile because it is saving the State an amount of money. Recently I checked with an institution about an old lady of 83 and they told me that it was costing £24 or £25 to keep her.  That is not the place for old people but their own homes. We have certain obligations to help families to keep their parents in their own homes.  Wonderful work is being done.  It must be backed up by this service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In the opening speech reference was made to this.  It was stated that the ordinary tests of inability for employment would be applied and it is only natural that they should.  One of the most important aims of any party or Government is to achieve full employment.  We must accept that every employment agency operating in this country, and the <Col N="691" /> manpower service at the Department of Labour, have a big list of vacancies for female workers.  There is a shortage of female labour in this country.</P>
      <P>Deputy White can verify that in his home town of Ballyshannon a factory was, at one time, short of as many as 200 female workers.  The question of work being offered to females by the employment exchanges is a very important factor in this service.  I shall speak on another occasion on what is likely to happen between the employment exchanges and the manpower service.  The employment exchanges may feel that they have no longer a duty to offer employment to people. This was the purpose for which they were set up.  Vacancies existing in an area should be frequently made known to those who are applicants for assistance.  This does not necessarily disqualify them because the question of distance and suitability in regard to the state of their health and age comes into the reckoning in deciding whether they should be deprived of benefits when they refuse the work.</P>
      <P>There are sufficient opportunities for female workers and a shortage of them.  In making it possible for them to easily obtain benefits the Parliamentary Secretary, in his opening speech, said that these tests for availability would be applied and I agree with him.  I agree with this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to explain this section.  In regard to this £160 per annum that is disregarded in old age pensions, where did it apply before?  I did not come across it quite a lot in my time.  The first £25 of savings is disregarded for old age pensions, and the next £75 is assessed at 5 per cent per annum, and the remaining of £400 at 10 per cent.  This £165 was disregarded in the case of married couples when one was an applicant for a pension and the other was over 69.  Why was this discontinued <Col N="692" /> and why was it there in the first instance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessary now.  It was necessary when the limit was £273 for full pension.  The limit of £4 per week as opposed to the ten shillings per week embraces the £165. It is an unnecessary provision now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I thought but I do not agree with it. In the case of a married couple, where the £165 was disregarded one of the spouse had to be 69 or some qualifying age.  It was a saving, a funeral saving, and this incentive to save is removed.  With regard to the figure of £25 I used to be accused of not increasing that amount.  I notice the Parliamentary Secretary has not done that this year either.</P>
      <P>The £25 of any savings of an old age pensioner is disregarded.  It was said that this amount was originally intended to be for funeral expenses. That amount would not go very far now because, even though the pipe and the snuff have gone out of fashion, the funeral costs have soared since then even in the most frugal circumstances. I was frequently asked to raise that limit of £25 upwards.  One of my stock replies was that this £165 operated in the case of married couples in certain circumstances and that it could be regarded as a funeral saving.  The Parliamentary Secretary has not raised the £25 limit of capital and has ignored this matter.  He also wiped out the £165.  The people concerned are definitely losing out in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In this section which reduces the age to 69 we have the same problem as that in section 2 in regard to the abolition of the means test.  I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to state honestly and tell the people of the country that he regrets the Coalition Government were unable to honour a promise they made in this regard.  The promise was made that the age would be reduced and 65 was the age that was bandied about from every Fine Gael platform in the country.  Deputy White used that figure in my constituency.</P>
      <P>I reduced the age to 65 in respect of contributors in the form of a retirement pension.  This retirement pension is not the same as the old age pension.  It differs inasmuch as that when the retirement pension recipient resumes work he loses the pension, but if an old age pensioner resumes work he continues to draw his pension. Nevertheless, it was the exact same as the old age pension and the recipient could earn up to a certain figure in uninsurable employment.</P>
      <P>Having brought down the age for contributory pension to 65, and the very definite statements made on television and in the newspapers, and from the election platforms, that the age was being reduced the people had a right to believe it.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The people accepted that the age was being reduced.  This is another broken promise.  It was misleading one of the most deserving sections, the old age pensioners.  I agree that the age should be reduced.  It is great that someone should get the pension one year sooner but one year is not five.  I am not saying I would have reduced the age to 65, nor did the Fianna Fáil Party say it before the election when announcing their scheme.  However, I have frequently stated in this House that this is the direction in which we must move.  I <Col N="694" /> had hoped that the age would have been reduced to at least 68 if not directly to 65.  The people believed this also and they have been disappointed.</P>
      <P>The people on the other side and not on our side must live with this broken promise.  Not to have reduced the age at all would have meant disaster for the Government and the reduction of one year was merely an attempt to acknowledge that a promise in this regard had been made.  I am tempted to divide the House again on this point as a protest against the use of the older members of our society in a very dishonourable attempt to win their votes at election time.  This is disgraceful.</P>

      <P>Before Deputy Brennan divides the House, I would welcome the opportunity of appraising him of some of the facts.  One of the objectives of this Government is the elimination of the means test.  Deputy Brennan states that had there not been a change of Government he would have reduced the qualifying age in respect of old age pensions to an age lower than 69.  I think he mentioned 68.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently, Fianna Fáil were not so committed since 1908, the year in which the qualifying age of 70 came into operation.  I cannot hold the Minister responsible for what happened since 1908 but surely it would be fair and reasonable to hold him responsible for what happened or did not happen during the 16 consecutive years of Fianna Fáil Government even if we ignore the other years they have been in office since the foundation of this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it annoying to hear Deputy Brennan try to latch on to this issue as if it were a political confidence trick that we played on the people. What was spelled out in specific terms by the now Taoiseach in a speech at Rathmines in regard to social welfare during the general election campaign has been honoured to the full.  It is and will continue to be the goal of this Government to achieve a comprehensive scheme that will not involve a <Col N="695" /> means test.  I find it difficult to apologise for having achieved in three months one-fifth of what we set out to achieve when Fianna Fáil could not even get off the ground in these matters. I can assure the Deputy that before Fianna Fáil drain the Shannon we will have brought the qualifying age for the old age pension down to 65.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I take exception to is the promise to reduce the qualifying age and then not to honour that promise.  Three years ago we reduced the age to 65 in respect of contributory old age pensions.  It would be my hope that every person would be put on a contributory basis.  In this way I had hoped to eliminate the means test. There are four times more widows in receipt of contributory pensions than there are in receipt of non-contributory pensions.</P>

      <P>The Deputy does not know what he is talking about.  These people on contributory pensions may go abroad or work, if they wish, while continuing to draw the benefits.  The means of reducing the old age pension qualifying age to 65 would be to put everybody on a contributory basis. However, the important point is that we did not make a promise which we did not honour.  Let us remember, too, that in 1908 the average life expectation was much lower than it is today. At 70 today, a man is only young.  There are many such persons on the other side and they are like young fellows.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The social insurance limit is, perhaps, the most controversial part of this Bill.  I am prepared to give the Parliamentary Secretary all Stages today if he will give us reasonable assurances in relation to some of the changes in respect of the application of benefits to certain sections of the community and if he will let me know <Col N="696" /> whether he has yet fixed a date for the coming into operation of these changes.</P>
      <P>We abolished the limit but we could not fix a date with the Department of Health.  Maybe a date has now been fixed.  If so, perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would enlighten me in this regard when he is replying.  I have had representations from some trade unions regarding the application of this scheme.  The Transport Salary Staffs Association want to know why it is proposed not to apply the scheme to their members.  The intention was to include everybody who was employed but this very big section are to be excluded. Maybe they are wrong in their interpretation of what is intended. They say that in the circumstances the Minister is to be asked to extend the provisions to encompass all non-manual staffs in the Republic.  They say that, on making inquiries, they found that their members who are in statutory employment would not benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another part of the scheme in respect of which nobody has done his sums right, as far as I am aware, is in relation to persons who are paying voluntary health insurance contributions. From my estimation of and probing into the overlapping of these financial schemes, I was satisfied that there would be cases in which it would benefit one financially to go to hospital because he would receive more benefits than he had paid by way of contribution.  An insured person is entitled to certain coverage in respect of hospitalisation.  We are now to bring in a huge number of people who are already insured under the VHI scheme to the extent necessary to cover all hospitalisation costs and who, when they become insured within the new scheme, will only require the amount necessary to cover private room costs.  Will these people have their payments to VHI adjusted accordingly&mdash;in some cases, dropped altogether&mdash;or will they continue to pay both contributions and, consequently, be in a position to avail of the full benefit in respect of hospitalisation from both schemes?  Indeed, since the introduction of the £1,600 limit I have known of people who claimed that they were able to draw <Col N="697" /> both from the Department of Social Welfare and from the VHI in respect of hospital costs.  It is not a serious point but it is one that would require to be rectified.  There should not be overlapping, and this is one of the problems I felt I would have to meet, and I am sure it does not go away from the Parliamentary Secretary either.</P>

It is quite evident that many categories are being brought in who will never be entitled to unemployment benefit, who will never be entitled to disability benefit or sickness benefit.  Will their contributions be the same as for the persons who can draw all these benefits? In regard to people who are insured under the Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme, if they cannot draw benefits, will there be any concession in contributions?  It would take some time for the Parliamentary Secretary to give us the full picture, but I would like to have the full picture of contributions, all the benefits which these people, say, gardaí, teachers, civil servants, TDs, would be entitled to. Will TDs, for instance, be entitled to a scheme running side by side with that into which we are paying at the moment?  There are many other cases, but I do not want to take up the time of the House asking all the questions which this conjures up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said on the Second Reading, section 14 deals with the increased rate of employment contribution.  I have a suspicion which the Parliamentary Secretary refuted in his closing speech on the Second Reading&mdash;that the Department of Finance have succeeded in extracting from him on the Estimate more than their normal amount and that they will not have to contribute to the social insurance fund the 33? per cent approximately which they contributed in the past.  The real information can only be ascertained in retrospect by asking a question at the end of the financial year and the Minister's Estimate now will be caught up with whatever the factual position will then be.</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to the increase of last year but this year there is no greater strain.  About two years ago we gave a £1 across the board increase, the same as the Minister is giving this time, and there is no greater strain on the resources of the social insurance fund this year than there was then.  Why should the increase be greater now?  The Department of Finance will always seek to get the better side in all these cases unless the Minister is eternally vigilant.  I believe that the employer who is already mulcted with more than the usual portion and the employee, to the relief of the Exchequer, are coming to the aid of the social insurance fund this year through this amount being added to the stamp.  I put that assertion on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 14 deals with increases in contributions.  I want to bring to the notice of the Parliamentary Secretary a class of contributor against which I think there is discrimination.  A large volume of the country's shirt production is carried out in the northern part of Donegal. When married women who become unemployed apply for unemployment benefit they are refused in many cases. <Col N="701" /> I do not say it happens in every case but it has been my experience that if a shirt factory worker applies for benefit, especially if she is married, it is refused.  The argument is that there is no unemployment in shirt factories and that the reason she is not employed is not a shortage of work but because she has to look after a child or children. I, with other Deputies, attended meetings of shirt factory workers, especially married workers and as a result they, through us, requested that the Minister meet a deputation from them.</P>
      <P>In the shirt industry, which is a very skilled business where each girl is individually trained in a certain operation within the factory, it can and does very frequently happen that in some operations there may be a shortage of workers while in others there may be surplus workers and unemployment. Again, there is seasonal unemployment and part-time operation.  I know that some factories at present are operating three days a week.  Yet, if a married woman applies for unemployment benefit she is invariably refused.  I think they are being discriminated against, even more so now when the contributions they must pay are being increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a danger in regard to these contributions. There was no necessity this year to increase the contribution by worker and employer. If increases were given across the board contributions were also certainly taken across the board.  The middle income group suffers the impact of all this.  The increase could be dangerous particularly in the case of a small employer, a man employing 15 or 20 people and living from day to day.  He is saddled with this increase. I know small employers because I have worked with them and sometimes this type of increase can lead to redundancy where an employer will say: &ldquo;I cannot pay the extra amount; it means I must dismiss at least one worker&rdquo;. There is this danger. Personally, I am disappointed with the Parliamentary Secretary that he did increase the contribution this year because what the workers have got did not necessitate this increase.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Brennan said, it is only possible to judge the Exchequer contribution in retrospect. The basis on which the total estimate was made up did not anticipate any reduction in Exchequer expenditure. Whether this will be the fact can only be borne out by time. In regard to the proportion of the stamp being borne by the employer, I think I did say on the Second Stage that this only follows the normal established pattern in other EEC countries. Indeed, we would have to burden the employer substantially more than has been the practice if we were to come any way near some of the other EEC member countries.  If Deputies look at the situation realistically they will see that whether the employer be small or large the percentage of the stamp contribution of his total wages bill is very small.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not fair to make comparisons between a State which employs 350,000 people and a country with three or four million workers, with a country which has full employment in respect of the weekly mulcting of people for stamps.  The Parliamentary Secretary said the percentage of an employer's bill paid towards stamps is very small.  It is not. The contribution is at least £3.13 per week in relation to each worker, and there is a motion for discussion in the House to have the redundancy stamp increased.  I would remind the Parliamentary Secretary that £3.13 is about twice what road workers were being paid when Fianna Fáil came to power.  An employer who has five or six workers must pay £12 a week in stamp money. It is not skittles, as the Parliamentary Secretary says.  We do not object to the principle but I object to putting out the impression that we could not charge the employer enough, that the more we charge him the better.  We must go as easily and as carefully as we can with the goose that lays the golden egg.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>During the Second Reading I drew attention to injustices in regard to disability and unemployment benefits.  In connection with the latter, a dispute may arise between a worker and his employer and in the heat of the moment the employer might dismiss the worker who reports to the local exchange to be told that he cannot receive any assistance for six weeks while the case is being investigated. He could be a married man with a family.  Benefits should be paid while the matter is being investigated. After all, the man has contributed towards those benefits and may have been doing so for 30 or 40 years.  He has not abused the service. He has been accused by the employer and by inference by the Department who say he will not get his benefits until he has proved himself innocent.</P>
      <P>My other point is in relation to disability benefits.  A man falls sick and after a fortnight or three weeks he may be told by the Department that he is capable of work although his private doctor has said he is not and has given him a certificate to that effect.  His benefits are withheld and he and his family have to suffer until such time as the Department's doctor and the private doctor agree. The Parliamentary Secretary should see to it that while a dispute is going on between the officers of the Department and the worker that the benefits are paid until such time as the matter reaches finality.</P>

I am talking about a person who has contributed for, perhaps, 40 years and he is being asked to go on home assistance until some official in the Department decides he is entitled to benefits.  From the time a dispute arises between a worker and his employer or between a Departmental doctor and a worker's private doctor, the worker is victimised.  He is being deprived of assistance, he is regarded as being guilty and he and his family suffer.  It is a shame and I cannot see why the Parliamentary Secretary should point out that such a person is entitled to other assistance.  The only other assistance he is entitled to is home assistance and why should a man who has contributed for years have to seek that?</P>

I am sure also the Deputy will accept, while his thinking may have some merit, it is hardly possible to rectify all the injustices that operated under the past administration in a very short space of time.

Why do the forms which are used by committees and sent out as notifications to the claimants have written on them: &ldquo;Your case has now gone to the Minister for decision&rdquo;.

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is to meet a point raised by the Minister for Finance arising out of the abolition of the remuneration limit for social insurance. At present, any civil servant who is covered by the Social Welfare (Occupational Injuries) Act, 1966, is debarred by section 2 (3) of that Act from the benefits of the Injury Warrant, which provides a scheme of compensation under the Superannuation Act, 1887, for injury or death in the course of his duties.  The subsection in question was included in the 1966 Act <Col N="709" /> at the request of the Minister for Finance but it is now considered that it would operate unfairly in the altered circumstances brought about by abolition of the limit.  The Minister for Finance has, therefore, asked to have section 2 (3) of the 1966 Act repealed. The question of preventing double rights to benefit under the two schemes will be dealt with by him by way of amendment of the Injury Warrant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Briefly, the benefits in the Bill are very welcome.  Every single year for the past 16 years social welfare benefits have been improved. This year, by reason of the many campaigns which were conducted on referenda and elections, the people were not merely led to believe that they would get generous benefits but were told explicitly the benefits they would derive as a result.  We spelled out our scheme and so did the Coalition. The Coalition schemes, the £1 across the board benefits, were much the same as what we spelled out, except that we had £1 for adult dependants and the Bill provides 50p for adult dependants.  We had a selective scheme for children's allowances.  We were exceptionally generous to big families of poor parents.  It was a good scheme.  The recipients were led to expect a lot.  The EEC Referendum was sold to them on the grounds that the money made available would be used for social welfare purposes.  They must be sorely disappointed that the Government have not lived up to the <Col N="710" /> promises they made&mdash;the reduction of the pension age to 65 and the abolition of the means test.  To the old age pensioners this must be a grievous disappointment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The benefits given in this bill are welcomed by social welfare recipients.  I want to deal with a point made by Deputy Brennan, former Minister for Social Welfare, who has great experience in that Department.  When he was Minister and we were in Opposition, we brought to his attention the delays in his Department in dealing with applications. He referred here to the reduction of the qualifying age for non-contributory old age pensions.  He must realise at this stage that when you reduce the qualifying age from 70 to 69 you are in fact, processing two years' applications in one year.</P>
      <P>At no time was it stated by the National Coalition Parties in the general election campaign that the reduction of the qualifying age to 65 years would be achieved all at once. We must also realise that, as a result of the benefits in the budget, and the benefits in this Bill, those who are in receipt of non-contributory old age pensions at the minimum rate will automatically qualify on 6th July for the maximum pension plus £1.  There is a determined effort on the part of the Opposition here to confuse the people.  When the benefits become apparent to those who were so long neglected, they will realise the full benefits of the Bill, no matter what effort is made by Fianna Fáil to confuse them.</P>

I want to remind the Government that a week before ,he Minister for Finance announced his budget the Tánaiste Deputy Corish, announced that thousands of people were living in poverty.  It was only natural on hearing such a statement that the people in receipt of social services would be expecting something more than they got in previous years. We in Fianna Fáil committed ourselves in the EEC campaign, in the mid-Cork by-election, and in the recent general election&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Whatever argument the Coalition may wish to make to get out of that now, let us not argue about whether or not the commitment was made; there were too many thousands Who heard the commitment being made to argue about the fact now and Deputy Creed could usefully use his ingenuity in explaining away non-compliance.

      <P>The present section provides for an increase in the number of directors of CSET and enables the company to borrow in foreign currencies.  It eliminates the requirement that the company shall have a managing director and it also eliminates certain qualifications with regard to the Minister's financial interest in the company and the duty chargeable on sugar, which are no longer relevant.</P>
      <P>The 1933 Act requires that the number of directors shall be seven.  The Minister for Finance considered it desirable to increase the size of the board by increasing the number of directors from seven to ten.  He also considered it desirable to widen the range of interests represented on the board because of the variety of operations following the integration of the food processing operation with the other activities of CSET.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney General ruled in 1964 that reference in legislation to borrowing by State-sponsored bodies shall be taken as referring to borrowing in Irish currency only, unless otherwise specified. As a result of that, special provision for foreign borrowing has been inserted in amending legislation relating to a number of State-sponsored bodies, namely, the Air Companies, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, the Electricity Supply Board, Córas lompar Éireann, and NET.  It is proposed to do likewise now in the case of <Col N="715" /> CSET.  The company has just completed negotiations with the European Investment Bank for a loan, but this will not be a debenture loan.  However, it is important that the company should not be restricted by statute from raising debenture loans abroad where suitable opportunities arise.</P>
    <P>The 1933 Act specifies that the company shall have a managing director, but this requirement is too restrictive and, in any event, the company has not had a managing director for some years.  The present section removes this requirement.</P>
    <P>Under the 1933 Act the Minister's right to appoint directors and an auditor to CSET is subject to the conditions that he either holds not less than one-tenth of the share capital of the company or guarantees a company debenture or that the customs duty chargeable on sugar imported here is higher than the rate of excise duty on sugar manufactured here.  These qualifications were introduced because it was felt at the time there was a possibility that the State's interest in the company would gradually be sold off to the private sector.  This possibility now appears extremely unlikely and it is considered that the qualifications do not serve a useful purpose and should be removed.</P>

      <P>The section empowers the Minister for Finance to give guarantees in respect of borrowing in foreign currencies by CSET otherwise than by debentures.  Ministerial guarantees in respect of debenture borrowing abroad by the company are covered by section 2.</P>
      <P>The section also extends the Minister's power of guarantee to cover incidental expenses in connection with borrowing as well as principal and interest.</P>
      <P>The European Investment Bank as I have already announced has approved a foreign currency loan for CSET and the bank will require as a condition of the loan that it be guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  The bank will also require that the Minister guarantee incidental expenses in connection with the loan, viz. commitment fees (which applies to that portion of a loan which is sanctioned but not yet taken up) and any premiums on prepayments (i.e. repayments in advance of scheduled dates) that may arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subparagraph (c) provides a formula for converting the proceeds of foreign <Col N="718" /> borrowing to Irish currency so as to ascertain whether or not a guarantee could be given in any instance within the statutory limit on the overall amount which the Minister may guarantee. The amendment of the various subsections of section 5 of the 1962 Act&mdash;which relate to standard procedures governing guarantees&mdash;is necessary to take account of borrowing in a foreign currency. Similar provisions have been inserted in earlier legislation authorising Ministers to guarantee the foreign borrowings of State-sponsored bodies.</P>

      <P>Section 7 of the 1962 Act fixes a limit of £5 million on the aggregate at any one time of Exchequer advances to CSET plus guarantees given by the Minister for Finance in respect of borrowing by the company and any amounts owing to the Minister in respect of previous such guarantees.</P>
      <P>CSET has an existing Exchequer advance of £1 million but the intention is to convert this to share capital. The advance was made to the company in two instalments in 1964 and 1965 as a support for the food project and no interest or repayment terms were determined because of the continuing poor performance of the project.  Conversion of the advance to share capital would help to improve the capitalisation of the company.  Apart from this advance, CSET has no loan moneys from the Exchequer at present and the only outstanding guarantee given by the Minister for Finance is in respect of a debenture stock of £900,000 which is redeemable in 1974.  Nevertheless, it is considered prudent to double the existing limit of £5 million on Exchequer advances and guarantees because of the probability that in the years immediately ahead the Minister will be required to guarantee borrowings on a substantial scale, additional to the European Investment Bank loan.</P>

      <P>Section 10 (3) of the Sugar Manufacture (Amendment) Act, 1962, provided for a relaxation of section 4 of the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, 1893, in favour of Erin Foods.  Section 4 reads as follows:</P>
      <P>A society which may be registered under this Act (herein called an industrial and provident society) is a society for carrying on any industries, businesses or trades specified in or authorised by its rules whether wholesale or retail, and including dealings of any description with land.  Provided that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  No member other than a registered society shall have or claim any interest in the shares of the society exceeding two hundred pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10 (3) of the 1962 Act made it possible for Erin Foods to exceed the £200 limit imposed on membership of co-operative societies provided its shareholding in any society did not exceed 50 per cent of the total nominal value of the shares of that society.  The limit of £200 has since been raised to £1,000 by the Credit Union Act, 1966. The purpose of this concession was to enable Erin Foods to participate in local co-operatives engaged in food production and subsequently Erin Foods took up to 50 per cent of the shareholdings in three co-operatives : Fastnet Co-operative Society Ltd., Skibbereen; Errigal Co-operative Society Ltd., Glencolumbkille, and Kerry <Col N="720" /> Foods Ltd., Causeway.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Colley's intervention on the need to explain matters.  As this section is so brief it is only fair to explain what is involved.</P>
      <P>Section 10 (2) of the 1962 Act provides in relation to an approved subsidiary company of CSET that (i) no change shall be made in its memorandum or articles of association without the prior approval of the Minister for Finance, given after consultation with the Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries and Industry and Commerce and (ii) its audited accounts shall be submitted after the end of each accounting year to the Minister for Finance who shall have copies laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. An `approved subsidiary company' is defined in the 1962 Act as a company formed by CSET with the approval of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Erin Foods is the only approved subsidiary company of CSET and it is most unlikely that CSET will set up another such company in the foreseeable future.  Erin Foods is now a dormant company and, following the enactment of the present législation. <Col N="721" /> it will be divested of all its holdings in other companies.  It is no longer appropriate, therefore, that it should be subject to Ministerial supervision in relation to its memorandum and articles of association and the company will not prepare annual accounts. Consequently, it is considered that the obligations imposed on it by section 10 (2) of the 1962 Act should be removed.</P>
    <P>There is no reason to believe that the proposed status of Erin Foods after the enactment of the present Bill will be altered significantly in the foreseeable future.  Erin Foods might possibly be used by CSET at some future date merely as a vehicle to hold shares in some concerns&mdash;though nothing such as this is now envisaged&mdash;and in that event it would not be appropriate that the Minister for Finance should be obliged to lay its accounts before the Oireachtas or that changes in the company's memorandum and articles of association should require the approval of Ministers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section introduces a standard provision on Oireachtas membership which is included in all new legislation dealing with the establishment of State-sponsored bodies and also in amending legislation relating to long-established bodies, where the provision does not already apply.</P>
      <P>Subsections (1) and (2) of the section relate to membership of either House of the Oireachtas by directors and staff of CSET while subsection (3) disqualifies a person who is entitled to sit in either House from becoming a director or a member of the staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Staff are being treated somewhat differently from directors.  While a director would cease to hold his position as soon as he is nominated either as a candidate for election to either House or a Member of the Seanad. the position of a member of the staff would not be affected until he actually became a Member of the House, at <Col N="722" /> which point he would be seconded from his employment for the duration of his membership of the House and would during that period be ineligible to receive his normal wage or salary. Directors are usually part-time and have no pension rights.  As policy maker and final judge on loan applications it is considered inappropriate that the director should continue in office if he becomes a candidate for either House of the Oireachtas.  Staff, on the other hand, are in most instances permanent and pensionable and it would be unfair to require them to interrupt their employment in advance of being assured of a seat in the Oireachtas and the income therefrom, such as it is.</P>

On each occasion on which I have done so, both in this House and in the other House, there have been objections, I think, from all sides.  By that I am not saying there were objections by many people but there were objections by people on both sides of each House who took the view that the thinking behind such sections was wrong and was in some way reflecting on membership of either House of the Oireachtas. There are arguments for that view, but on balance I certainly am of the view that what is in this section is in the public interest.  Since I have brought in such sections before, I certainly would not oppose this one.  I believe, on balance, it is in the public interest, although I think I should draw attention to the fact that that is not a universal view in either House of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having studied the breakdown of the £7½ million investment in the modernisation of plant in the four factories over the next four years and having seen that only £250,000 is to be spent on the Thurles factory, I consider this to be a blow to the people of North Tipperary and to the long term prospects of the factory as the major industrial centre in Thurles town. Some years ago the credibility of the future prospects of the sugar factory in Thurles was badly shattered when CSET decided to transfer the computer with its staff of 40 people to Dublin.  This move meant the departure of 150 people from the town.  This blow was considerable to the economy of the town and no good economic reason was given why such a move was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The credibility of the company was <Col N="724" /> further shattered, in my view, when it was stated that Thurles, which over the years proved to be such a strong factory in the sugar company concern and whose workers proved second to none in the field of labour relations, was to suffer by reason of the unequal distribution between Carlow, Mallow, Tuam and the Thurles factory.  While the Minister promises future prospects for the Tuam factory there is very little mention of prospects for the Thurles factory and the North Tipperary area in general.</P>
    <P>In Thurles there is an advance factory which has been empty for two years and is waiting to be filled by some industrialist.  Having read the report of CSET of last year which stated that one of the objectives of the company would be to diversify, something the company has already done in the food processing and farm machinery line, I appeal through the Minister to CSET to offset this sharp lack of confidence in the sugar industry in Thurles by acquiring this vacant factory to give work to people who are badly in need of employment.</P>
    <P>I agree that the sugar factory has given good employment over the years but when one reads in the long term investment programmes that the factory is low in priority, irrespective of the remarks in the report to the effect that the equipment in the factory is satisfactory, it is seen by workers and local people as a lack of confidence in the industry.  I appeal to the Minister to try to persuade CSET to avail of the advance factory and thereby give back confidence to the people of the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Deputy has said.  I would like to give an assurance that there is no intention on the part of CSET to downgrade Thurles and there is no lack of appreciation on the part of CSET of what is being done in the Thurles factory and by the producers in the Thurles catchment area.  The Thurles plant is the most efficient and most up-to-date in the whole network.  The only reason why there now seems to be a greater preference for other locations is simply to bring the equipment in the other plants up to the standard which already exists in Thurles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" /> The Deputy, and his colleagues, in the Tipperary area need have no worries whatsoever about the anxieties of CSET to maintain this Thurles plant at full production.  If the same degree of interest and endeavour was exhibited in all the plants CSET would have very few worries today.  It is indicative of the enterprise which is apparent in Thurles that, unlike the number of plants where the employment has fallen in recent years, the employment in the food processing industry in the town has risen.  CSET is most anxious to maintain the Thurles plant.  They are satisfied that the investment which they propose to make will maintain the high degree of efficiency and production which has obtained in Thurles up to now.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate the Deputy's anxiety to see any idle plant in Thurles taken over by CSET.  As I mentioned on the Second Stage, CSET are most anxious to expand their activities in the whole food processing industry and any viable proposition will receive careful study.  As the Deputy realises, in the industry at the moment there is probably over-capacity.  If we could find the markets it would be possible to generate sufficient activity but we must, first of all, find the markets or have a reasonable prospect of having the markets.</P>
    <P>A great deal of the losses that were generated over the last decade arose oui of over-production and non-availability of markets.  That is not going to be to the benefit of the solid possibilities which are available in the food processing industry.  I am sure the board will consider sympathetically what Deputy Ryan has offered here tonight.  I should like, again, to assure the Deputy that there is no reason for fear, or anxiety, as far as the future of Thurles is concerned.  Thurles is ready to avail of the opportunities which can open to Ireland, and the southern region in particular, in the whole food processing industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo; This Bill was prepared by my predecessor and piloted by him through all its Stages in the Seanad.  To all intents and purposes, therefore, it might be described as an agreed measure.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the incorporation of charity trustees and makes special provision in relation to charities that are established or regulated by statutes or by charters.  It also provides for a number of amendments to the Charities Act, 1961, in order to deal with certain difficulties&mdash;brought to attention by the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests&mdash; that have arisen in the administration of the 1961 Act and in the administration of charities themselves.  I should mention that all the proposals contained in the Bill are being made in agreement with the charity commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> The Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests, referred to in the Bill as &ldquo;the Board&rdquo;, are a statutory body who owe their origin to the Charitable Donations and Bequests (Ireland) Act, 1844.  The jurisdiction and powers of the board, as set out in the Charities Act, 1961, include power to advise charity trustees as to the administration of trusts, power to sue for the recovery of charitable gifts improperly withheld, power to institute legal proceedings in a charity matter and to certify cases to the Attorney General with a view to his instituting such proceedings, power to accept gifts for charitable purposes, power to frame schemes applying charity property <i>cy-près</i>, and power to appoint new trustees of a charity.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the provisions of the Bill, I should like to explain that the legal meaning of &ldquo;charity&rdquo; is not the same as the ordinary meaning. A charity in law may be said broadly to mean a gift of land, property or money for the advancement of religion, the advancement of education, the relief of poverty, or other public purposes such as paintings to the National Gallery or historical objects to the National Museum.  A charitable gift has certain advantages over an ordinary gift, namely, a gift in perpetuity for a charitable object does not fail, and property given or donated is not subject to income tax, legacy duty or succession duty.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 and 3 of the Bill provide for the incorporation of the trustees of a charity and the vesting of the charity property in the body corporate by means of a scheme framed by the board.  This provision is designed to mitigate the inconvenience and expense caused by the necessity of revesting trust funds in new trustees on the death or retirement of the existing trustees.  At present, on the death or retirement of charity trustees, the property of the charity must be vested by separate instrument in the new trustees.</P>
    <P>Under section 34 of the Charities Act, 1961, the board may authorise <Col N="728" /> charity trustees to make certain dispositions of charity land&mdash;namely, to sell it, to exchange it, or to surrender a lease of it&mdash;and to invest the proceeds for the benefit of the charity. However, this section does not, in terms, allow the board to exercise their powers where the sale, et cetera, or investment might be in contravention of a statute or a charter establishing or regulating the particular charity. The board are anxious that provision should be made to allow a charitable trust, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any statute or charter governing the particular trust, to sell, lease, mortgage, charge, exchange or surrender a lease of any of the trust property.  At present four charitable trusts wish to avail themselves of such a provision, namely, King's Hospital, governed by charter and by section 113 of the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act, 1840, Waterford and Bishop Foy Endowed Schools, governed by statute, Wilson's Hospital, Multyfarnham, governed bv charter and the lveagh Trust, governed by statute.</P>
    <P>The lveagh Trust is an endowment for homeless men and all the other trusts are educational trusts.  It is proposed in section 4 of the Bill to give the board power to authorise trustees of these charities to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of their property, and to apply the proceeds for the benefit of the charities.  There is a special proviso that in the case of educational trusts the proceeds may not be applied by the trustees for any purpose other than such as are, in the opinion of the board, for the furtherance of education.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill also makes special provision for extending to both sexes the benefits of an educational trust; for the merger of two or more charities for a common charitable purpose and, in the case of a charity the trustees of which are required to be members of a particular religious denomination, for the appointment of trustees of another denomination.</P>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill will enable the board to re-transfer to the appropriate dioceses a number of Catholic churches which were vested in the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and <Col N="729" /> Bequests under section 15 of the Charitable Donations and Bequests (Ireland) Act, 1844, which was repealed in full by the Charities Act, 1961.  The board are anxious to transfer the churches concerned back to the appropriate dioceses, but they have no power to do so.</P>
    <P>The board have brought to attention a problem in relation to disused national schools and teachers' residences held under leases, or at nominal rents, granted under the Leases for Schools (Ireland) Act, 1881.  Under section 5 of the Act, certain covenants are implied as if expressly inserted in the lease. These include covenants to the effect that the premises shall not be used for any purposes other than those expressed in the lease and that, if the premises continuously cease for a period of three years to be used for those purposes, the lessor or his successors in title may re-enter.  In a number of instances leases contain an additional covenant that the lease shall determine if the premises cease to be used for the purpose for which the land was granted.</P>
    <P>There are now some 500 national schools and some 200 teachers' residences held under leases granted under the 1881 Act which are no longer required for the purposes for which the leases were granted.  More than 100 applications have been made to the board with a view to the sale of the property in question.  However, in a large number of cases it has proved impossible to ascertain the successors in title to the original grantors.  In other cases, where the identity of the successors in title has been ascertained, it has not been possible to trace their whereabouts.  In all such cases the board have ruled that they have no power to sanction the sale of the property until a waiver of the covenants has been executed by the person entitled to the freehold.</P>
    <P>A similar problem has arisen in connection with a plot of ground at Ballinacurra, Limerick, which was leased to the Society of Friends&mdash; the Quakers&mdash;for use as a cemetery. The lease contained a covenant to the effect that, if the plot should cease to be so used or. be used for any other purpose, it should be held upon <Col N="730" /> trust for the benefit of the heirs, executors and assigns of the lessor. The Society now wish to use part of the plot to build a meeting house, but they feel that this covenant in the lease prevents them from doing so. Extensive efforts have been made to trace the heir of the original grantor but without success.</P>
    <P>Section 6 of the Bill will enable the board to vest the properties concerned in trustees upon charitable trusts, freed and discharged from the restrictive covenants.  However, in the case of a lease made pursuant to the Leases for Schools (Ireland) Act, 1881, the land shall not be vested in trust for any purposes other than educational purposes.  On the vesting of the property, land comprised in leases made pursuant to the 1881 Act may be sold with the consent of the board and the proceeds applied for such educational purposes as the board may specify.  In the case of the plot of ground in Ballinacurra, Limerick, belonging to the Society of Friends, the Society will be free to build a meeting house on it if they so desire.</P>
    <P>Section 7 of the Bill enlarges substantially the <i>cy-près</i> jurisdiction of the board under section 29 of the Charities Act, 1961.  Application <i>cy-près</i> arises where the charitable objects for which property is given cannot be achieved because, for instance, the mode of achievement is unlawful or impractical. To take a simple example, if a person leaves money for the building of a church in a particular district and, if on his death such a church has already been built, the money will be applied <i>cy-près</i> for the repair and upkeep of that church.  The expression <i>cy-près</i> comes from the French and although there is some doubt as to its exact original meaning it has now, by professional usage, come to mean ' as near' or `as possible'.  The idea is to apply the charitable gift as closely as possible to the original intention of the donor or testator, where those intentions cannot otherwise be carried out. At present the board's powers to frame schemes applying property <i>cy-près</i> are limited to cases where the property comprised in the charitable gift does not exceed £5,000 in value.  In cases <Col N="731" /> of more than that amount the charity has to bear the cost of having a <i>cy-près</i> scheme framed by the High Court. Having regard to the continuing decline in the value of money and the increase in legal costs, it is proposed to increase the present limit from £5,000 to £25,000&mdash;a figure which has been agreed with the board.  The figure was originally £300 under the Charitable Donations and Bequests Act (Ireland), 1871; it was increased to £2,000 in 1955 and was increased further to £5,000 in 1961.  Section 7 of the Bill also extends the board's power under section 29 (4) of the 1961 Act to include a power to revoke a court scheme for the application of a charitable gift in part or to amend it.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned already, section 34 of the Charities Act, 1961, enables the board to authorise charity trustees to make certain dispositions of charity land.  The board consider that this section is unduly restrictive and they are anxious that their powers under the section should be extended to cover dispositions of land by (1) surrendering a tenancy of it, (2) accepting a surrender of a lease or tenancy of it, or (3) mortgaging or charging it. At present the power to mortgage charity land under the 1961 Act&mdash;section 37 &mdash;is confined to purposes connected with improvements to the land, for example, erection of new buildings, repair of existing buildings, <i>et cetera.</i> The board are of the opinion that there should be a general power to mortgage charity land where that would be advantageous to the charity.  The board's proposals in regard to the disposition of land and in regard to mortgages are reasonable and it is proposed to give effect to them in section 8 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under section 34 of the Charities Act, 1961. the board may authorise dispositions of charity land only where they are satisfied that the dispositions would be advantageous to the charities concerned.  In practice, the board act on the basis that this section requires that property be sold at full market value.  The board consider that they should be given power to authorise the trustees of a charity to <Col N="732" /> make a disposition of charity property at less than full market value if the property is to be used for a public charitable purpose.  Section 8 of the Bill proposes to give the board the power sought by them.</P>
    <P>Section 35 (1) of the Charities Act. 1961, provides that, in the case of land out of which a periodical payment is payable for the benefit of a charity or applicable to charitable purposes, the board may, on an application to them by the trustees of the charity concerned, authorise the sale of the periodical payment to the owner.  It is proposed, in section 9 of the Bill, to give the owner of such land a corresponding right to apply to the board for authority to redeem the periodical payment.</P>
    <P>Under section 37 of the Charities Act, 1961, the board have power to authorise the trustees of a charity comprising land to grant certain leases of the land and, where the board are the trustees of a charity comprising land, to grant such leases themselves.  The section restricts the letting of land to lettings &ldquo;on building, repairing, improving or other leases, or on leases for working any mine&rdquo;.  The board have represented that this restriction is obsolete and they have asked that the provisions of the section should be extended to any letting of land belonging to a charity. Section 10 of the Bill provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>The board have power under section 43 of the Charities Act, 1961, to appoint new trustees of a charity and to vest the property of the charity in the new trustees. However, this power is confined to charity property comprising land.  It is proposed under section II of the Bill to extend the power of the board to allow for the vesting of any property.  Section II of the Bill also revises the periods of notice which the board are required to give of (a) their intention to make an order appointing new trustees of a charity and (b) the actual making of such orders.  The periods at present prescribed have been found to be unrealistic. Provision is also being made to allow the court discretion to extend the time for appeal against the making <Col N="733" /> of an order of the board. This is normal practice.</P>
    <P>Section 12 of the Bill provides that where the board order the bill of costs claimed by a solicitor on account of business transacted by him on behalf of a charity to be taxed and ascertained by a taxing master, the solicitor concerned will not be entitled to any costs other than those so taxed and ascertained.  The board have represented that at present there is no means of ensuring that a solicitor will comply with the board's order and that he will receive no more than the taxed costs.</P>
    <P>The last section of the Bill to which I would like to refer is section 13. This section reverses the present rule &mdash;contained in section 52 of the Charities Act, 1961&mdash;requiring personal representatives to publish advertisements of charitable devises and bequests contained in wills of deceased persons unless exemption is granted by the board under section 20 of the Act.  In practice, the board, on receipt of evidence of payment, grant exemptions in all cases where the aggregate value of the devise or bequest does not exceed £2,500.</P>
    <P>The board have recommended that there should be a general exemption from publication of advertisements except where the board require notice to be published.  I might add that this has been the position in Northern Ireland since 1964.  There is no requirement for publication in England, Wales or Scotland.  Section 13 of the Bill provides that the board may require evidence to be produced, within certain time limits, by personal representatives to show that property comprised in a charitable devise or bequest has been transferred to the charity specified or that the trustees are aware of the devise or bequest.  Alternatively, the board may require the personal representatives to publish advertisements of the charitable devise or bequest and to produce evidence of such publication.</P>
    <P>I believe that the provisions of section 13 of the Bill will be welcomed by charities, particularly the smaller charities for whom the change will mean a substantial saving.  The change will also result in a significant reduction <Col N="734" /> in the work of the board's offices.</P>
    <P>The Bill before you is of a specialised character and I trust that I have been successful in elucidating its various provisions.  I also hope that the explanatory memorandum that has been circulated will be helpful to Deputies in examining the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention that, if the Bill passes Second Stage, I intend to introduce on Committee Stage some amendments to the Bill now before you.  These amendments, which are mostly of a drafting nature, arise out of comments and suggestions made by Senators during Committee Stage in the Seanad and subsequently by the Charity Commissioners.  The only amendment that calls for special mention at this stage relates to the investment of charity funds.  Under the existing law, unless there is a free power of investment, charity trustees must invest their funds in a limited range of Irish securities specified in section 32 of the Charities Act, 1961. This restriction has been found to be burdensome to charities in the inflationary times we have been living in of late, and it is proposed that they be allowed to invest in a wider range of securities, including non-Irish securities.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1961 the High Court had a wide inherent jurisdiction over charities. However, section 32 of the Charities Act, 1961, took away from the High Court the inherent power in charity cases to vary investments, including the power to permit investment in non-Irish securities.  The Government consider that section 32 of the 1961 Act should be amended to restore to the High Court the power that it had prior to 1961 to authorise changes in investments of charity funds.  They also propose that the Charity Commissioners should be given powers similar to those of the court in the case of charity funds.  A consequential amendment of section 33 of the 1961 Act will also be necessary.  I need hardly say that the court and the board will exercise their discretion carefully in choosing the investments that will be authorised.  A point worth noting with regard to this amendment is that our membership of the EEC may mean that we may soon have to lift restriclions  <Col N="735" /> of this kind on investments under the provisions of the Rome Treaty allowing for free movement of capital. Moreover, beneficiaries of full age may alter an ordinary trust in any way they like and irrespective of any restriction in the law as to the investment of trustee funds.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I should like to express to the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests my appreciation of the very valuable work they do.  They are an unpaid body who devote a considerable amount of their time to what are very important functions in the life of the community.  We are all very much in their debt.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Bill will meet with the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally I support this Bill, having promoted it originally and brought it to the other House, and I certainly will not delay it.  I want to start by the few brief remarks I shall make by joining with the Minister in his concluding remarks in relation to the commissioners and, indeed, by repeating what I myself said in the Seanad in connection with their work, because these are busy and able men. They are men whose time is valuable, and they give, perhaps more so than many voluntary bodies, a considerable amount of that time to doing work which is difficult but which is extremely important for many people in this country.  It was only when I went into the Department of Justice that I realised how frequently the commissioners meet, because it appears they meet at least once a fortnight and sometimes even more frequently than that.  The nature of much of the business which they transact is of a complicated type and their meetings must often last for several hours.  The amount of time, therefore, in a given year which is devoted by the commissioners to doing this very valuable work which is of such benefit to so many people is considerable, and it is something for which all of us are very much in their debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to say anything much about the provisions that were <Col N="736" /> in the Bill that was before the House, because it is, of course, the Bill I originally introduced myself containing the amendments which I introduced to the Seanad.  I do not think there were any amendments by Members of that House, although there were some suggestions which I thought had some merit in them made by Senator Alexis FitzGerald and Senator Michael O'Higgins.  I cannot help noting from reading and listening to the Minister's speech how extraordinarily similar to mine his style has become, because I do believe there are two sentences in it which were not in my Second Reading speech, until we come to the last page where the Minister tells us about an amendment which he proposes on Committee Stage here, with which, I may say, I am in full agreement.  However, there is one point in relation to the question of the wider powers of investment of charity funds which are suggested by the Minister here about which I would have some reservation. that is, the extension of the power to invest in non-Irish securities.  I can see why, say, in the years prior to 1961 that power was necessary, but I have some doubts as to whether there is now an insufficient variety of securities in this country to enable charity funds to be beneficially invested.  I think there is now sufficient choice here to enable the wider sort of investment which I think we would all welcome, to be carried out effectively.</P>
    <P>The problem which has been adverted to several times is that if at a time like this charities are confined to investing in Government securities which are at fixed interest rates, rates of interest tend to go up from year to year with the result that the capital value of the investment tends to depreciate.  Even if it did not depreciate on the face of it, the value in real terms of the investment naturally falls as inflation continues and money values fall. There are, unfortunately, charities and also private trusts which were comparatively wealthy 20 or 30 years ago but through the inability of the trustees to invest in what are broadly termed equities the real value of the trusts has fallen.</P>
    <P>We should put this problem in its <Col N="737" /> proper context less Members of the House or members of the public would think that all charity or private trust funds have to be invested in fixed interest securities or in the securities set out in section 32 of the Charities Act, 1961.  This is so only if the instrument setting up the trust, whether a will or a deed or something else, does not give specific powers of investment. In 90 per cent of cases, perhaps, that specific wider power of investment is given in practice.  Any one drawing a will or a deed who did not give as wide as possible power of investment to the trustee, whether charitable or private trustee, would, in my view, be failing in his duty to the testator just as much as to the potential beneficiaries under the trust.</P>
    <P>The number of cases actually covered by this proposed amendment is much smaller than many people would think.  Yet, it is a type of amendment I welcome subject only to the reservation that I feel that between now and the time the Minister puts down the amendment he should consider whether it is necessary to include non-Irish securities.  I believe we should endeavour to keep as much of our money as possible at home.  The Irish money market, such as it is, has significantly improved in the last few years.  It is not as large or significant as we would wish it to be but there is scope for an investment of the type that is necessary on behalf of charities. There are many good, solid public companies with a record of continuous improvement in the price of their shares in recent years that has not only kept pace with but in many cases considerably outpaced the decline in money values or the rate of inflation. I do not think, therefore, that charitable trustees are faced with the sort of problem they may have been faced with 15 or 20 years ago in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>Subject to that reservation and prompted by my anxiety to increase investment to the maximum in this country, I would welcome the amendment to which the Minister refers as being one he is likely to put down.  I appreciate that there is the difficulty that under the EEC Treaty this type <Col N="738" /> of provision may at some future time be no longer possible.  This may happen but equally it may not happen for a number of years.  We should not neglect the opportunity to increase investment at home by allowing trustees a very free and unfettered opportunity to invest their funds abroad.</P>
    <P>I have confined my remarks to the Minister's proposed amendment because his remarks in relation to the Bill itself as it stands are essentially the same as my own and, naturally, having introduced the Bill and piloted it through the other House I am in favour of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have reason to refer to section 34 of the Bill.  In another paragraph the Minister mentions schools given for charity.  I should like clarification of this because I have not a legal mind and I am asking the Minister to clarify the position.  If a site was given free by diocesan trustees to build a school, what is the situation when the school is sold, whether Catholic or Protestant or non-sectarian?  I know a case where such a school was sold by the parishioners and because of section 34 of the 1961 Act the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests refused to allow the people to use the money&mdash;the property was sold at its full market value&mdash;for the purpose they had in mind, the renovation of the local church.  It was pointed out to them that the money could only be used for educational purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies may smile but many of us tried to make the point that when a priest gets up into the pulpit on a Sunday, even though it may be sectarian, it is a form of education and that, therefore, the purpose was educational. A number of moves were made and we would have approached the Minister on the matter but we understood legislation was being introduced and I presume this is it.  I want to know if that type of situation is covered.  I have not the legal mind necessary to interpret the document before me and I am seeking information. Several schools are being sold throughout the country and if the money can be used only as the commissioners say&mdash;that may be correct: <Col N="739" /> they quote section 34 in support of this view; I read the letter&mdash;for educational purposes, I should like to know if that is correct and I should like the Minister to clarify the point.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that in a large number of cases it has proved impossible to ascertain the successors in title to the original grantors. What I want to know is, in cases where the successors of the original grantors are identifiable and where the schools and teachers' residences have not been used for their original purposes and where the successors of the original grantors have taken possession of their residence or school, what affect will this Act have on them?  All I want is elucidation from the Minister.  This has happened in a number of cases and I want to know will they be affected at all.  I endorse what Deputy O'Malley has said about investments.  If the Treaty of Rome denies us this reservation in regard to our securities later on, let us wait until they do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There is only one aspect of this matter I wish to refer to and it is investment.  I think it is well for us to bear in mind that a lot of the charities now in existence are of long standing under old deeds and instruments where the investment clauses are restricted.  Many of these charities have a good national reputation and have done good work, and I think it would be unfair that they should suffer a handicap, whereas modernly drawn trustees for newer charities should have an advantage. We are all well aware of the effect of inflation over the years, the effects it has had in eroding the value of investments particularly those in Government securities.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows the case of the 2½ per cent War Loan and 3 per cent Consols.  They are a tragedy in so far as the investments and trusts that held them have still got them. They are useless from the point of view of realisation.  They may have notionally kept pace with a certain dividend but as a value to the trust fund they are useless, practically a write-off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="740" /> Therefore, I welcome any move as far as charities are concerned that would give the Charity Commissioners power to remedy or at least to stop the rot in the erosion of the value of capital in charities.  I also welcome this move as a very significant piece of modern thinking in this House by any Minister, because I see this as a start&mdash;it is a small thing but it should not be allowed to pass without notice&mdash;of a new process of thinking in legislation in this country whereby trustees will be accepted as having wider powers of investment, that they will be trusted by virtue of their office to have wider powers and discretion to place investments under their management and control, thereby preserving the entity of the funds for which they have responsibility.</P>
    <P>To date too often one has heard of cases where trust funds have become belittled by virtue of the constant march of inflation, and this thinking might well be extended to such matters as wards of court and court funds and court investments.  This Bill shows a start and I as a Deputy, and outside the House as a legal practitioner for the best part of 25 years, very much welcome this new step. I would hope it is the first of many more in so far as legislative reform and properties and trusts are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful to the House for the reception given to the Bill and for their appreciation of the advances it makes in the field of charity law.  To take first the point made by Deputy O'Malley in regard to the widening of the investment powers of charitable funds in regard to which there is no adequate power built into the trust deed, I sympathise with him to some extent. However, I think it was illogical for him to say &ldquo;90 per cent of charities have carefully drafted instruments setting up the charities which gave the trustees all the power of investment they require in regard to both internal and external investments and this is a good thing,&rdquo; but at the same time to deny to the remaining 10 per cent of charities the opportunity of obtaining similar wide power.  As a matter of <Col N="741" /> practice, the Commissioners, and I am quite sure trustees, would go for a suitable Irish investment and I do not think we should inhibit the Commissioners or the trustees, as the case might be, in their choice of investments. This is a matter which we will be dealing with in more detail on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Callanan, the difficulty is that the premises which he mentioned were donated for a specific purpose, namely, for the advancement and the benefit of education.  It would be contrary to the legal principles of charitable donations and bequests if that property were to be used for any other purpose, albeit religious.  Deputy Callanan may feel that the priest giving his sermon or the minister lecturing his congregation is performing an educational function.  That may be so in practice but in the eyes of the law relating to charitable matters it is a different charitable object and that is why it would not be possible to apply the proceeds of the sale of that school to non-educational purposes.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson made a point about successors in title to the grantors of leases for the erection of schools, where these successors were identified and could show their title and on the cessor of the use of one of these schools had re-entered.  In that case the successors in title had perfected their title and nothing could be done about them.  To do so would mean retrospective legislation and that would be unconstitutional. Those who have been able to show their title have acquired repossession of the schools in question and that is it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Dublin Central):</i> When the Dáil adjourned last week I was discussing the situation of the telephone service in this country and this city.  I had pointed out that we seemed to be making no headway in respect of the backlog.  At the moment there are in the region of 32,000 applications for telephones lying with the Minister and it is quite obvious that the telephone is no longer considered to be a luxury.  It is taken in the same context as a car or the other amenities to which the average person deems himself entitled.  This in no small measure is due to increased prosperity and the higher standard of living especially in this city of which I have particular experience.</P>
      <P>A serious look will have to be taken at the supply of telephones and the telephone service generally.  It is becoming increasingly difficult to make a telephone call without interruptions. Anybody using the telephone services of this House must be well aware of the difficulties we encounter.  I hope during the coming year and the Minister's term of office that he will seewhat progress he can make with regard to the backlog in the telephone service.</P>
      <P>In the capital programme this year the Minister has been allocated £19 million but I doubt if this will be sufficient to meet the demands placed on his Department.  This section of the capital programme always seems to give a fair return on capital.  The telephone capital programme has shown a reasonable return on capital.  In various years it has been £8.9 million. £7.7 million and, indeed, in 1971-72, £6.4 million.  Any investment in the telephone service shows a reasonable return.  It is quite obvious that the demand for telephones will far outweigh the funds available to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope some improvement will be made with regard to telephone kiosks <Col N="743" /> in this city.  Any city Deputy must be appalled at the amount of vandalism which takes place in regard to public property.  It is a disgraceful state of affairs to see gangsters destroying the telephone kiosks which play such an important part in the life of people nowadays.  The people who have private telephones are not affected but there are many people residing in some of our corporation schemes who depend on the public telephones to make urgent calls at night time in the event of any emergency.  When they go to a local kiosk they usually find the telephone is out of order.  It has usually been smashed by some of the vandals patrolling the city.</P>
    <P>A fortnight ago I asked the Minister for Justice a question about vandalism and I was told that crime in this city is decreasing.  Anybody who has seen the vandalism in this city would find it very hard to believe this but those are the statistics from the Department of Justice.  I hope there is a closer scrutiny of vandalism and crime in this city.  Telephone kiosks, which are so important to the lives of everyone should be protected from vandals.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in the budget, announced substantial increases in the postal and telephone services.  The cost of a local call is to go up from 2p to 3p, which is an increase of 50 per cent.  I know the Department must pay their way but I hope when the Minister is looking for increases that he carries out the same investigations as ordinary businesses have to carry out when they seek increases in the price of their commodities.  The postage stamp on an ordinary letter is to go up from 4p to 5p, which is a 25 per cent increase. If any business firm in the city applied to the Minister for Industry and Commerce for permission to increase the price of their commodities the Prices Section there would tell them to have another look at their costings to see where economies could be effected.  They would also be told to increase productivity. The same type of investigation should be carried out in all Government Departments <Col N="744" /> to see where economies could be effected.</P>
    <P>Every section of the economy, including CIE and the ESB, come within the ambit of the Prices Commission. When they wish to increase the price of their commodities they have to go to the Prices Commission. I was glad to see that the Minister for Industry and Commerce did not sanction the increases which CIE wished to make in their fares.  He said he would have a look at it.  It remains to be seen whether that was a good reason.  Some say that he took that view because the Presidential Election was taking place but I do not propose to make any comment on that.</P>
    <P>The Minister will collect approximately £8 million in a full year from the additional charges in the postal and telephone services.  When this is passed on to industry it will have inflationary tendencies.  The charge for trunk calls has been increased by 20 per cent and this is quite a substantial increase to any industrial firm which has to make numerous trunk calls to various parts of this country and abroad.  The increases in telephone and postal charges will have a serious effect on the costings of companies. The postal charges here are much higher than those in Britain and Northern Ireland so it might be more beneficial for a company to have a subsidiary in Northern Ireland where they could take their letters to have them posted.</P>
    <P>When the increases were first mentioned I would have conceded that it would be very hard to bring a halfpenny into operation in the telephone service, but when increases were to be made in both the postal and telepone sections one penny should have covered the lot.  The Department should then have tried to see what economies they could effect in the Department.  If they had to go before the Prices Commission they would be told to see what economies they could make.  The Minister for Finance took the decision in the budget to increase the postal and telephone charges and the taxpayers will have to foot the bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="745" /> There is another aspect of the telephone service to which I should like to refer.  I wonder how effective the three minute service is in the coin boxes.  If you are waiting to make an urgent call and somebody is occupying the kiosk, the three minutes or five minutes which are allowed do not seem to work very effectively.  This can be very annoying if certain types of people are using the telephone.  On some occasions the call can last from five to ten minutes.  I do not know whether this is prevalent throughout the city, but I have had experience of having to wait. Let us hope that there will be an improvement.</P>
    <P>The important thing is to give a service.  If you charge, by all means give a service.  To increase prices and give a bad service is deplorable.  I am afraid that is what is happening.  I would separate the postal service from the telephone service in that regard. The postal service in this city is excellent. I would not hesitate to pay the additional postage charge because the service is good, but I cannot say the same about the telephone service which is very poor.  Where I live in Terenure there is no need for telephone tapping.  It is not unusual to pick up the telephone and hear a conversation taking place between two people.  I have no interest in what they are talking about.  My only interest is to make my telephone call.  I am sure the Minister is aware that this has taken place on several occasions.  It is due to overloading in the different parts of the city.  We cannot cater for the number of telephone's people are looking for.</P>
    <P>In business today a telephone is of vital importance.  No one can start a business today, irrespective of whether it is retail distribution, or a factory, or what have you, without first having installed a telephone.  The Department must give top priority to people who are earning their livelihood in a business in which a telephone is necessary. If we are to have increased productivity and more industry starting, we must ensure that telephone applications are processed immediately.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke at length about <Col N="746" /> RTE.  Practically everybody has his own ideas about television and who should run it.  I can appreciate that this is a very sensitive area.  People in public life are sensitive about it, and about the balance which should be maintained.  I do not envy the Minister the difficult role he has to play in this regard.  The duty of RTE is to inform and entertain and, if at all possible, to educate.  We must ask ourselves have they played their part in the field of entertainment down through the years.  I would say they have. taking into account the amount of money available to them.  You can only get what you pay for and that is true throughout all the sectors of our economy.</P>
    <P>The amount of money given to RTFis very substantial.  We must look at RTE in that context and against that background.  Will that be sufficient when we come to the challenge of multi-channel television which the Minister spoke about after his London visit recently?  Will the performance which RTE have been putting or over the past couple of years be sufficient to meet the challenge of other television stations?  Before we open up this country, we must lake a close look at our own television station and ensure that, when there is complete freedom, and a choice of television, we will have established our own identity, and our television station will be able to compete with any of the cross-channel television stations if they are available.</P>
    <P>We are rather vulnerable in this regard.  I am speaking strictly from my own experience in Dublin where we on the cast coast have the amenity of cross-channel television.  We will have to improve our programmes and ensure that the public are attracted to our native programmes, irrespective of what programmes will be available in five or ten years' time.  We must ensure that whatever expertise our people have is used.  We must ensure that the Minister has a proper staff in RTE.</P>
    <P>I do not know what problems this would involve.  It is certainly important that we should develop our own native culture.  There are programmes on RTE that are attracting the attention of the viewing public.  I refer specifically to &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo;.  I believe that a <Col N="747" /> programme like &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo;, irrespective of what stations are available whether BBC or UTV, will attract Irish viewers.</P>
    <P>We have also the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;.  Here are two programmes which are attracting the Irish audience. We must develop along these lines. Although people might be under the impression that &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo; is rural-oriented this is far from true. People in the city-and I would be anxious to know what the TAM rating is-are just as interested in &ldquo;The Riordans&rdquo; as any rural viewers.  We must develop this type of programme and develop our own identity.</P>
    <P>As some Deputy mentioned last week, irrespective of the competition from foreign newspapers, you will always take your own newspaper to read first.  This is very true of anyone who is abroad on holiday.  If you can put your hands on your own native newspaper you will buy it.  Unfortunately, when you go abroad you can only pick up an English newspaper.</P>
    <P>If we develop television along these lines we will be able to overcome the challenge of foreign television.  Certain programme times could be changed.  I refer to the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo; on Saturday nights in the winter.  This programme usually starts after the 10 o'clock news.  I know what men view at that time.  The housewife's feeling is that she would like to see the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;.  Where men are concerned it would, however, be very difficult indeed to get them away from &ldquo;The Match of the Day&rdquo; and, once more, we have a conflict.  I know from experience that the men invariably demand &ldquo;The Match of the Day&rdquo; instead of the &ldquo;Late Late Show&rdquo;.  If the timing were changed both programmes could be enjoyed.  The same argument applies to the ten o'clock news.  This conflicts with the news from Thames. I do not say we should change just for the sake of getting the British programmes, but an intelligent adjustment would make it possible for people to listen to the news from both stations. The news from Thames is of a much more international character and it <Col N="748" /> should have a particular interest for politicians.  Some adjustment would be an excellent idea.</P>
    <P>The current affairs programme can be very enlightening.  It can also be very sensitive and someone invariably complains of being misrepresented.  I have not been on this programme myself and, because of that, I can perhaps judge the programme more objectively. These programmes are very interesting and I should like more of them.  The public are also very interested and people would be quite willing to listen to more of these programmes.</P>
    <P>We should also have programmes which would inform the younger people and educate them in how to spend their leisure. From now on they will have more leisure and Telefís Éireann, a powerful media of communication, could play a role in advising them as to their function in society and how they should spend their leisure.  There could also be practical programmes, such as demonstrations in woodwork, which would help the youth to develop their talents.</P>
    <P>There is unfortunately too much violence on television.  I hate to see my children looking at pictures in which violence is portrayed.  Such pictures should only be shown late at night when children are in bed.  One can understand the attitude of young boys and girls who take violence as a matter of course almost because these pictures have an impact and some effort should be made to move away from them.  It is difficult to fill up programme time and, if these pictures cannot be avoided entirely, then the only solution is to put them on very late at night when only adults will have an opportunity of viewing them.</P>
    <P>I should like to see voluntary organisations projected on our screens. Plenty of publicity is given to wrongdoers.  Surely we could portray the silent army which works day and night for the good of the community. They are never projected.  If they were it would be a great boost to their morale and it would also encourage young people to join these organisations once they became acquainted with the role these bodies <Col N="749" /> are playing in our society.  I should like to see these organisations brought to the forefront and recognition given to their work.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a statement recently about communal aerials.  I have always held the view that limiting the number to 500 was not practical economics at all and the Minister is now apparently moving towards eliminating this limit of 500. Indeed one aerial to cover the entire city would be the ideal solution.  The most recent report states clearly that the limitation is wrong.  Why it should be wrong now but not wrong initially is something I do not understand.  The sooner every aerial is removed from the rooftops the better it will be.  This ugly forest of aerials is a disgusting sight.  I trust that in the course of time all these aerials will disappear.  I believe that is on the cards.</P>
    <P>The Department plays an important role in the life of the community.  It has an employment content of 23,000. Its progress and development is of vital importance.  Every worker in the Department, from the highest to the lowest, makes a contribution to the social and economic life of the country and harmony in the various branches is essential for the smooth operation of the Department.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister every success. Problems are bound to crop up.  I know that he Is having second thoughts about section 31.  Something will have to replace the section because someone must have the final control.  There must be autonomy from the point of view of the day-today working of Telefís Éireann, but the Minister must have the final responsibility and he must, therefore, have some control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>My remarks will be diffuse: rather than concentrated.  I shall follow haphazardly the Minister's speech.  I will start by referring to the rural delivery service.  The new rural motorised delivery service is very good, very quick and very efficient. In fact, the rural service at the moment is better by one day than the urban service.  I find that Saturday delivery very useful.  It enables one to deal with correspondence at the <Col N="750" /> weekend and one does not have to wait until Monday morning to get most of one's letters.  I know that some other Deputies have requested the Minister to grant a five day week in rural areas and in so far as the convenience of the workers is concerned I, too, would like to see them having a five day week.  However, I would still like to see the six day service continuing and, if it can be arranged by rota or by paying overtime, it is an amenity of rural living we can do with.</P>
      <P>I should like to endorse the complaint made by Deputy Fitzpatrick about the raising of the price of the postage stamp.  Letter writing as an art has suffered a great deal.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs used to use a little sentence from Burke on his personal notepaper at one time.  It was something about people not being judged as friends by the frequency or infrequency of letters as the case may be.  Many old people have kept up the art of letter writing.  The postage stamp now costs 5p and this is rather severe on old people.  Women generally write more letters than men and mothers of families, particularly mothers of families whose children have gone abroad, write a great deal of letters.  If one takes three letters per week to sons or daughters over a period of 52 weeks it is a substantial sum of money, now that the stamp costs five new pence.  It would add up to a normal week's food money in a household. It should not be taken for granted that people are capable of paying whatever is demanded for postage stamps. If at all possible the price should be pegged at five new pence.  There seems to be a tendency to raise the price of the postage stamp on every possible occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to national savings, for which the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is responsible, I often thought a little more imagination could be shown by that section of the Department.  It should be possible to make arrangements with large co-operative creameries and the new cattle marts that have superseded the old fairs and markets, under which a <Col N="751" /> percentage of the money taken in sales could be transferred automatically to the Post Office Savings because this money is very useful and used for productive purposes.  This type of arrangement with marts, that are now handling huge sums of money, and creameries would increase the amount of money in the Post Office Savings account.</P>
    <P>The question of the telephone service has been pretty well covered.  One has to experience the rural telephone service to realise in what a parlous position it is.  I am sure the Minister has scores of letters each day from Teachtaí asking him to install telephones here, there and everywhere.  I have sent a quota of such letters to him since I came to this House.  I have also sent many letters asking for the erection of telephone kiosks in various places.  I think I understood the Minister to say that he was looking for a larger sum of money later on for the telephone service.  This sum of money, I take it, is not included in the Estimate but is from an extraneous source. I hope the overall plan for telephones is a good one and that there will not be duplication, crossing and so on.  If a large sum of money is to be spent reasonably soon on the development of the telephone service an overall engineering plan is essential so that the best possible value can be got for the money.</P>
    <P>In his introductory speech the Minister referred to something in which I have a particular interest.  He said that many uneconomic services are provided by the Department on social grounds.  I invite the Minister, in his reply to the debate, to state his criteria in this regard.  Is a case responded to just because the Minister responds personally to it, or has he a set of criteria on which to judge when something which may be uneconomic but very valuable on social grounds will be granted in a particular area?  I wrote to the Minister requesting the installation of a telephone on the Shannon Bridge in West Cavan.  It was not entirely a matter of granting it purely on social grounds, because this is a developing <Col N="752" /> area for tourists.  The Shannon River rises in that area, quite near where I wanted this telephone kiosk, and numbers of people come there to see the source of the Shannon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity of raising this very important question and I am glad that the Ceann Comhairle saw fit to allow me raise it.  Before I talk about the community school in Clonakilty which was the subject matter of my question&mdash;Question No. 33 of 12th June&mdash;1 should like to take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister on his new appointment as Minister for Education.  This is my first opportunity of doing so.  I know the Minister well.  I have no doubt but that he will prove to be a most able and effective Minister.  It can be said that he operates the Department with a certain amount of panache.  I hope he will continue to operate it as effectively as he has done up to now.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with everything the Minister does.  The question of a community school arose at Clonakilty over 12 months ago.  We, on this side of the House, have no objections in principle to community schools as such. In some contexts they are a good idea. In the case of Clonakilty the idea of a community school is not so good. I will endeavour to explain to the Minister why I think this is so.</P>
      <P>There was a report on the <i>Cork Examiner</i> on 10th May, 1973, of a meeting that was supposed to be private, where the Department's officials and the headmasters of three schools took part in the discussions. There was a leakage of information from that meeting.  There were banner headlines in the <i>Cork Examiner</i> which read: &ldquo;Anger over shelving of Community School&rdquo;.  The report read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Plans to build a new £400,000 Community School at Clonakilty have been shelved because one of the three secondary schools involved in <Col N="753" /> the area has refused to take part in the scheme.  A meeting between Department of Education officials and principals of the three schools in the town this week was told for the second time within a year that the all-girl Convent of Mercy was not willing to take part in the community school project.  The decision of the Convent of Mercy is known to have angered some sections of the community.  A meeting at which it is expected the heads of the other two schools will be present is to be held in Clonakilty within a week. Let us hope it goes on to form a committee.</P>
    <P>The <i>Cork Examiner</i> say they are quoting from a &ldquo;reliable source&rdquo;.  When I read that report I was dismayed and outraged that there should be such an anti-clerical headline and an attempted villification of the nuns of the Convent of Mercy who have given long, proud and unbroken service to the people of Clonakilty.</P>
    <P>The <i>Cork Examiner</i> have been unwittingly used to promote the aims of somebody or something.  It speaks of &ldquo;an angered community&rdquo;.  If they describe the community as being angered because of the article they printed, they are correct; but there was no anger because of the shelving of the community school.  We all know that the Convent of Mercy nuns have a rich, educational tradition in the town. They are not acting selfishly or without concern for the interests of the boys and girls of Clonakilty.  Pillorying of this kind of this respected community must cease.  The injustices done on them should be undone.  Facts should be accurately reported, and not as some people would like them to be reported.</P>
    <P>The officials of the Department of Education and the heads of the post-primary schools met.  There were other observers at the meeting.  It was a private meeting, and still we had people divulging what happened.  We find it hard to understand why they did so. It was not done because of interest in the children or parents of Clonakilty. I believe this was a deliberate attempt to foster hostility between the nuns and people of Clonakilty.  It was a meanminded <Col N="754" /> attempt to denigrate the tremendous, trojan work the nuns have been doing in the area.  I know that Deputy John L. O'Sullivan will agree with me when I say that the people of Clonakilty have the highest esteem for these nuns.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to adopt the guttersnipe tactics, used against the nuns, against the perpetrators of this offence.  Very many parents have come to me to ask my support and unstinted backing to have the secondary school at the Mercy Convent retained.  The reasons are easy to understand.  It is an outstanding school.  It gave a wonderful education to several generations of Clonakilty people.  It is a community school in all but name.  If a wide curriculum is suggested as a reason for a community school, it must be seen to that this convent school has such a broad curriculum.  It also provides extra-curricular activities.  It is also providing adult education.  The quality of the education provided is excellent.  The school has continued to expand each year.  No sleight-of-hand methods by any individual or group can disprove that.  The nuns have laboured lovingly and well for the people of the town.</P>
    <P>Certain troublesome questions arise. Who was responsible for the leakage of information from the meeting?  Why was the information leaked?  I do not wish to enter the realm of conjecture, but my opinion is that the information was leaked by somebody with a vested interest and not with an interest in the children.</P>
    <P>A community school is a relatively good idea but I have been somewhat disquieted for some time about the management of these schools.  I know that moneys from the World Bank are available to the Minister for immediate investment in community schools. but there are strings attached lo this type of investment.</P>
    <P>I do not think that we should have any outside body dictating to us the type of schools we should have in this country.  I would be nervous that this form of concept of community school and management of these schools could have a de-christianising effect on our educational system generally.  That <Col N="755" /> might be considered an old fashioned thought and might not be in line with some of the liberals, or pseudoliberals who are floating around the educational scene, but it is true.  As a parent I am anxious that the Christian atmosphere, and the Christian bend to our education, are retained.</P>
    <P>Everything possible should be done to facilitate the boys at Clonakilty.  I do not think this will create any problem given the goodwill of the Minister. The amalgamation of the vocational school and the secondary school, St. Mary's, which has between 200 and 300 pupils, could be brought about quite easily.  Then the town would have two very effective schools operating within close proximity of each other, utilising common facilities and indulging in all the activities a parent would wish them to indulge in.  There is a great urgency about the establishment of a boys secondary school in the town.  I do not think that there would be any difficulty about a site and I think the Minister, by establishing such a school, will be satisfying 90 per cent of the people of the town.</P>
    <P>As public representatives we must take account of the wishes of the people and we must not shove down their throats something they do not desire.  This school is important in a town like Clonakilty, an expanding town with a very strong rural community. The town is developing industrially and benefits considerably from tourism.  It is of vital imortance to an expanding town that there should be adequate educational facilities to cater for an ever increasing population.</P>
    <P>The school for boys which I envisage would have all the benefits that arc available in the community school concept.  The matter was discussed recently at a meeting of parents and teachers and which was attended by an official of the Department of Education.  This official, Mr. Moloney, did an excellent job under very difficult circumstances and is deserving of praise.  He pointed out the advantages of a community school project but, at the same time, did not shy away from the fact that everybody in <Col N="756" /> the hall might not have agreed with him.  Even that official could not have gone away from that meeting with any thought other than that the parents of Clonakilty want a post-primary school for the boys and want the secondary school for girls retained.</P>
    <P>I do not think that it is an irrelevance to ask which is the more efficient from the pupils' point of view. Does the Minister consider that it would be better to have two schools accommodating 400 and 300 pupils each, compared with one school accommodating a total of 700 pupils? I would prefer to see my children going to a school where they would get personal attention rather than attending one where they would be a mere number.  There is no need for the Minister to tell me that this has not happened.  It has happened and many people whose children are attending community schools are having second thoughts about the effectiveness of these schools.  I know of one parent in Dublin who has taken his children away from a community school because he considered they were not receiving the type of attention, or education, that is so imperative now.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister cannot wave a magic wand and produce the money out of the air for such a school but I believe that Clonakilty is a special case.  Why not have a community of schools rather than a community school?  I do not see any basic difference in the concept but I do see a lot of advantages in retaining the present structures.  It is easy to pull something down and say, or do, something destructive but it is harder to construct something in its place and say, or do, something constructive. The Minister should not hesitate on this matter which is of vital importance to the people of the town.  The quicker the Minister reaches a decision on the matter the sooner this type of banner headline which is appearing in the newspapers will cease.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the Minister's anxiety to ensure that every part of the country has the best education facilities. If the Minister sanctions <Col N="757" /> the erection of a post-primary school for boys in Clonakilty he will be fulfilling his wish in that regard in this town.</P>

      <P>The question raised concerns the Clonakilty post-primary éducation situation. Clonakilty was one of the centres named in a list published by my predecessor, Deputy Faulkner, of those places in which the establishment of a community school was under consideration.  At a meeting organised by the Department in Clonakilty on 9th May, 1972, my predecessor's proposal that a community school be established in Clonakilty was discussed. The representatives of two of the schools involved, the vocational school and the lay secondary school, accepted I lie proposal in principle as did the representatives of the two teacher organisations. The representatives of the third school, the girls' secondary school, rejected the proposal and the result was that no agreement was reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of discussions which my predecessor had with the Conference of Major Religious Superiors some time before he left office, the representatives of the religious put forward the alternative proposal that post-primary education in Clonakilty should be organised on a two-school basis-the convent secondary school for girls to continue as it is and the <Col N="758" /> other two schools to be amalgamated as a mixed vocational school.  I would remind Deputy Crowley that all of this happened before the present Government came into office.</P>
    <P>Given the situation as I found it when I came into office, the House will appreciate that it was necessary to consult the other interests concerned&mdash;the County Cork Vocational Education Committee, the proprietor of the lay secondary school and the teachers in these schools, all of whose interests were affected by the alternative proposal as much as by the original proposal to establish the community school.</P>
    <P>As a member of the vocational education committee concerned.  Deputy Crowley will, I am sure, agree that it was right and proper that these interests should be consulted.  Accordingly, a further local meeting of all the school interests involved was called by my Department and held in Clonakilty on 8th May, 1973.  As Deputy Crowley has emphasised rightly, this was a private meeting and it is unfortunate that the proceedings were leaked to the local and national newspapers.  However, I must say that the complaints about the way in which this was presented in the Press would be more properly addressed by those who are aggrieved to the Press than to me. My Department have suffered more than their fair share of this kind of thing and sympathise with any other interest which suffers in the same way.  There is, however, nothing which I, as Minister, can do about this as Deputy Crowley knows well.</P>
    <P>A public meeting organised by a committee of local teachers was held in Clonakilty on 30th May, 1973.  My Department were invited to be represented at that meeting as were each of the three schools involved.  My Department's representative presented an outline of the situation as the Department saw it and answered questions from members of the public present.  No attempt was made to push any particular solution and it was made clear that no decision had as yet been made by me in this case.</P>

      <P>We must acknowledge also the contributions which have been made by the County Cork Vocational Education Committee and the Dineen family who have run the boys' secondary school in Clonakilty. Nobody should be more aware than Deputies on the opposite side of the House of the fact that all rationalisation proposals involve change in existins; structures and that community <Col N="760" /> school proposals, in particular, involve existing school managements coming together to share control with one another and with parents.  None of this is intended by my Department or by me to belittle the achievements of existing school authorities.  Proposals for change arise solely from our desire to provide for our children, now and in the future, the best possible opportunities.</P>
      <P>I would like now to refer to some remarks made by the Deputy in regard to the World Bank.  My predecessor, Deputy Faulkner, spent a good deal of energy rejecting allegations made about strings being attached to the loan which the previous Government negotiated with the World Bank.  It 's surprising, therefore, to hear repeated again this evening these well-worn and unfounded allegations.  No outside body will dictate educational policy to me and, indeed, in fairness I must say that the same was true of my predecessor.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government the number of flats and house units being constructed by Dublin Corporation; the number of flats planned for the future in Dublin; if there are any proposals to build local authority houses in the city centre areas; and if he or Dublin Corporation have any plans for the development of the traditionally residential areas such as City Quay and Ringsend.</P>

      <P>At 31st May, 1973, Dublin Corporation's local authority housing construction programme comprised a total of 17,383 dwellings to be built or sites to be developed, including 2,094 dwelings under construction, 4,605 dwellings at tender or at various stages of planning, and 10,684 sites already available or intended for acquisition. This programme included 262 flats under construction; 722 flats at various stages of planning, of which 242 are at tender stage, and a further 893 flats tor which sites have been acquired or are listed for acquisition.  I am informed by the corporation that they are continuing the investigation of certain city sites to accommodate an on-going programme of approximately 200 flats per annum, and that the provision of houses in lieu of flats in certain city centre areas is also being considered.</P>
      <P>The corporation state that in the development of areas such as City Quay and Ringsend their objectives will be to accommodate within these areas all those persons who will be displaced by necessary urban renewal and other corporation activity, and, if possible, some other families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They say that referencing is proceeding for compulsory acquisition purposes of an area in the City Quay district with a view to comprehensive development, including housing. The Deputy will be aware that, where compulsory purchase is involved, I, as Minister, am required to act in a quasi-judicial capacity, and intervention by me in such cases would be inappropriate.  I understand from the corporation that they also intend to <Col N="634" /> take steps for the acquisition of housing sites in Ringsend.</P>
