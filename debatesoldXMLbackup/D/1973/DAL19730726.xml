      <P>It is proposed to take Business in the following order: Nos. 1, 2, 4 to 24, 25 and 26, in 26 Vote No. 3.</P>
      <P>I understand that as the Seanad is meeting next week and there is a time factor involved in the Finance Bill, it will be necessary to get all Stages of it today.  It is suggested that Questions should be taken from 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. and again from 6.30 p.m. until 7.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>The Business as outlined is satisfactory as far as we are concerned except in regard to the Finance Bill.  I understand that there has not been any agreement between the Whips on the question of finishing the Bill today.  As far as we are concerned, if this can be done we would be anxious to do so but the Taoiseach will appreciate that because of the nature, length and complexity of the Bill and the Schedules it is not possible for us, I think, to agree at this stage that this would happen.  Am I right in thinking that while it would be desirable it is not essential that it be finished today?</P>

There is the other factor that it has to be law next week and the Seanad will have to meet.  Subject to that, of course, some of the Stages could be taken tomorrow but with those limitations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In subsection (2), page 7, line 23, to delete &ldquo;or was&rdquo; and &ldquo;whether&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>At this point, I wish to explain that somewhere in the course of transmission from my original draft to the version which was communicated to the office a word was omitted but I wish to make it clear that this was not due to any fault on the part of the office. However, as drafted originally by me, the amendment proposed to delete the word &ldquo;before&rdquo; in addition to &ldquo;or was&rdquo; and &ldquo;whether&rdquo;, in other words, that the relevant portion of subsection (2) would read:</P>
      <P>... on tax for the transmission of which an employer is liable on or after such date.</P>
      <P>The intention behind this amendment is fairly clear.  It is to ensure that there would not be applied retrospectively what, in effect, is a form of penal provision. I think it is now being recognised on all sides of the House as a sound principle that penal provisions of this kind should not be applied retrospectively.  Because the amendment does not include the proposal to delete the word &ldquo;before&rdquo; it does not achieve what it was intended to achieve but if the Minister accepts the principle, I do not think we will have any problem in adjusting the wording.</P>

      <P>There is no disagreement in principle.  This would apply from August, 1973, onwards and will not be retrospective.  Of course, there could be interest already outstanding on payments due and payable.  Obviously, the debts could be in existence before August but there is no question of the provision applying in respect of any previous outstanding amounts of interest.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> Obviously, this minimum penalty clause of £5 will apply only to small businesses.  A large manufacturer or any business in which there were a considerable number of employees would not be affected by it.  The amount of money concerned must be small when the penalty is so minimal. I do not consider it fair that this charge should be introduced because it will be directed at a section of the community who find it difficult to make returns, for instance, small business people who have only three or four employees.  A situation could arise at any time whereby such an employer would fall ill and would not be able to prepare accounts in relation to PAYE and to submit them on a given date.  Although the amount is small, the principle is wrong because it will hit small business people directly.  These people have to deal with VAT and this additional penalty could be quite substantial so far as some of them are concerned.  We know it would be of no significance to a big concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure whether I understood the Minister to say earlier that he had no objection in principle to the amendment.  Did he say that he is prepared to accept the amendment as suggestedly amended across the floor of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  What I was saying was that Deputy Colley had made the point that there should not be a new penalty now applicable to old debts and we are in agreement there. I am saying that this minimum interest will not apply except in relation to money which is now owing.  Whether that money was due in the month of August or the month of July or June, and so on, makes no difference if it is now owing.  It is only a minimum interest <Col N="2017" /> provision.  If there is money owing on the relevant date in August this minimum interest will become payable and it would not matter whether the tax due was a small or a large amount.  If there was a large amount of arrears then the interest would be more than £5.  If it is less than that, all that happens is that this £5 would be the minimum.  The money would still be outstanding in August but the minimum interest provisions will only operate from August on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give the House a very brief example of the circumstances in which this charge would operate?  The Revenue Commissioners love this sort of legislation, of course.  They want preference every time over the private individual and in this regard private rights are often lost sight of.  Therefore, I should like the Minister to give a clear example or examples, as the case may be, of the circumstances in which this charge would be incurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, we should get everything into correct context.  PAYE money is money deducted by an employer from an employee's pay packet to which the employer has no entitlement whatsoever. It is not the employer's money; it is the employee's money in the first instance and the employer, having deducted it, has simply to pass it over to the State.  That is a clear obligation and employers should not be encouraged to or assisted in holding on to that money which is not theirs, which is the employee's contribution by way of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that the 1967 Act imposed an interest charge of 1 per cent per month on employers who failed to remit PAYE deductions within the time limit specified in the regulations.  The time limit is nine days from the end of every income tax month.  An income tax month is from the 6th of the month to the 5th of the following month, so that employers are required to pay it in any month by the 14th of that month. In the case of many employers who make small deductions from employees and delay payment, the present <Col N="2018" /> PAYE provisions give rise to numerous small interest charges.  A minimum interest charge of £5 is, therefore, necessary to secure effective and prompt payment of small PAYE liabilities.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, this is doing no more than applying to PAYE the obligation and the same interest provisions as already apply in respect of persons who are under an obligation to collect value-added tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As a former Minister for Finance, basically, I go along with the thinking the Minister is expressing although he and I, probably, are the only two Deputies who do agree with this because we realise the importance of what is involved.  Nevertheless, I have some reservations on the basis of what appears to be the application of retrospective penalty.  I know there is always room for argument on what is retrospection and what is not but it seems to me from what the Minister said that if money is owing on, say, 1st August, if that is the appropriate date, no matter how far back it is due, whether it is due from just a month or from a year, under this section this, in effect, penal provision will apply.  That seems to me to be applying retrospectively the penalty which is involved here.</P>
      <P>I had thought that what the Minister was conveying was that this penalty would apply only to money accruing due after the appropriate date in August but from what he said subsequently it is clear that that is not so. Would the Minister not agree, then, that in effect what the section is doing is applying the penalty retrospectively in the sense that it is applying it to money which may be due as of now and remains outstanding at whatever is the appropriate date in August and does he not think that the correct approach would be to provide that this penalty would apply to moneys which accrue due after the appointed day in August, the date of the commencement of the operation of the Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As it stands, sub-section (2) says that, on the passing of the Act, the minimum charge will apply to any interest chargeable in <Col N="2019" /> respect of any month or part of a month commencing after the passing of the Act, regardless of the period in respect of which the tax on which the interest is chargeable was due.  If I may give an example, the Finance Bill has to be law by 4th August.  The £5 minimum interest charge will apply in respect of interest chargeable for any income tax month or part of a month commencing on or after the 6th August, 1973.  In other words, the first interest to come within the scope of the new provision is interest for August, 1973, but interest in August, 1973, can arise in respect of PAYE tax due to be remitted (a) on 14th August, 1973, and (b) tax due to be remitted for earlier months but in respect of which interest for the month of August now arises and a £5 minimum charge would arise in both these cases.  That, I think, is the fair and proper position.</P>

      <P>As I understood him, Deputy Fitzpatrick expressed concern for the small trader.  I imagine he has in mind the elderly person with the confectionery shop and one assistant. It could be the case that as a result of some problems or difficulties such a small trader would find himself or herself liable to an interest penalty of, say, £1.  It is between £1 and £5 for the small trader that I have in mind, especially in the old Dublin area, whose trade has been built up over the years.  The difference between that, what would normally be charged against him, and what is provided here can be very serious to the small trader.  That is the point Deputy Fitzpatrick was making.  I do not think the Minister has answered it; perhaps he would say something more on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say any more.  The arguments that have been <Col N="2021" /> advanced can be made with as much validity against the £5 minimum interest applicable to VAT.  It already exists in relation to VAT.  We must come back to the essence of all this: it is not the trader's money or the employer's money; it is the State's money and this money is already taken from the employee; it does not come out of the employer's pocket.  It is deducted when the employee gets the pay packet.  All the employer has to do is transmit it to the Revenue Commissioners. Even if there are difficulties about making calculations, these are supposed to be made when the money is deducted.  It is only a question of sending on the money.  The Revenue Commissioners never penalise anybody if there is some discrepancy and if there is some discrepancy and if there is any overpayment they make a refund. This is a provision which Deputy Colley accepts as necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, and I as Minister and a human being reluctantly propose it.  The whole system of PAYE and of VAT would break down if there was careless remission of money due to the State because both traders charging VAT and employers deducting from pay packets are holding money for the State and are not entitled to retain it.  There can be no question of undue hardship or taking money out of the trader's pocket.  Particularly in relation to PAYE it is the employees' money and the employer is obliged to remit it. The penalty does not arise if it is paid within the appropriate time which is up to the 14th of the following month. This obligation has always been there.</P>

      <P>The Minister is saying that the mechanics for the operation of this section will be tightened up and it will be made simpler for the civil servants to administer.  I am concerned about the people earning an income so small that it will not be liable for income tax and who get in an assistant occasionally because of age or for some other reason and who, at some stage as a result of sickness or ill-health, become liable to a fine of <Col N="2022" /> 50p which now becomes 500p.  I am thinking of the human aspect as distinct from the mechanics of making it simpler to collect.</P>

      <P>No.  It is not back dated.  It will only apply if the money is outstanding after the Bill is passed in August.  All this is for the relief of the general taxpayer because if the Revenue Commissioners have to spend, as they often had, enormous sums collecting multitudinous amounts, the cost is charged against all taxpayers.  This is simply an incentive to ensure payments are made punctually and, if they are, no difficulty arises.  While I appreciate the arguments from the opposite side I did not hear anybody opposite when on this side of the House advance one of these arguments last year when similar provisions were made in regard to VAT.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister agrees with me that this penalty provision is necessary but we are both reluctant to apply it.  We accept that it is necessary.  The thing that is of main concern to most people is the possibility that this penal charge could become available in circumstances where for the average person it would be a grave hardship.  Is there any provision in the general law relating to the powers of the Revenue Commissioners which would enable them to exercise some discretion in cases in which they believe there is a genuine hardship occurring?  On the face of it, the wording of this does not allow such discretion but I suspect that they may have one.  The Members of this House would be reassured on this matter if they felt that the Revenue Commissioners did have some discretion in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Within the ordinary powers of the Revenue Commissioners they may not apply clauses of this kind where there are cases of genuine hardship.  However, as the House appreciates, the Revenue Commissioners must apply the law.  If they, in any case, consider circumstances are such as to create undue hardship and exercise a discretion in favour of the person so affected, they have to report the relief given by them to the Comptroller and Auditor General who has the right to say whether the Revenue Commissioners did right or wrong.  The power is there and the Revenue Commissioners are not unmindful of the genuine difficulties and genuine hardship cases which can arise.  It is better to provide the law in this way so that there will be no loophole and to allow this discretion to be exercised when genuine cases of hardship arise which can be justified.</P>

      <P>As indicated on our list of amendments, we are opposed to this section.  However, before I go into more detail in this regard there are two points I should like to raise. On Second Stage I referred to the wording at the end of this section, on page 9, lines 3, 4 and 5.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify the points I raised in that regard before I proceed further so that we will know what we are talking about.</P>
      <P>The other point I should like to raise is that on the radio this morning there was an interview with an inspector of taxes, he may have been a chief inspector of taxes, concerning the administration arrangements made by the Revenue Commissioners in pursuance of this section, that is, of the operation of this section, the clawback arrangements regarding increases in children's allowances.  I do not object to a competent official explaining, and this official did explain clearly, the circumstances in which certain operations of Government Departments are carried out.  This sometimes can be very useful to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I do object, and object very strenuously, to this happening before this House has even considered the section.  To have an official explain, however clearly or admirably, on the radio the administration arrangements in relation to a section of a Bill which has not even been considered in this House, is, I submit, at the very least undesirable and might well be a contempt of this House.  I think it is appropriate that we should record our objection to this.  I hope the Minister agrees with the view I am expressing and will ensure that this <Col N="2026" /> kind of happening will not occur again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, this provision is already law by reason of the Financial Resolution passed on the day of the budget.  I consider it most appropriate that there should be available to the public somebody to explain the operation of the decision taken by this House.  If there is any amendment made in the course of this Bill, or subsequently, I consider it necessary that the people should be advised of any change.  When a Financial Resolution of the House gives the authority to do something, I think it is most desirable that the procedure should be explained to the public.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to hear Deputy Colley suggest that it is wrong that this explanation should be given to the public. If the gentlemen in the media consider that a matter is of such interest as to require an explanation to the public and the House has already taken a decision on the matter, I think it is very proper that the people should get the necessary clarification of any difficulties or doubts which may exist in their mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

      <P>The Minister will agree that the Financial Resolution passed by this House will terminate very shortly and that the question of whether these arrangements are to apply or not depends on whether section 3 of the Bill, as it stands, becomes law having been passed by this House and the Seanad.  I do not know whether the Minister heard the interview or not but if he did hear it he would know that the references that were made were not to any decision of this House but to section 3 of the Bill which we are about to discuss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that the Minister, if he reflects on this a little, will agree that it is inappropriate that this should happen and that there should be an automatic assumption that this House, and the Seanad, will, without any amendments, adopt section 3 and that that assumption should be the basis for a public interview by a civil servant. On the basis of this it appears to me very unsatisfactory.  I am surprised that the Minister does not take the <Col N="2027" /> same view as I do.  It is not enough to say that we have passed a resolution. That, as the Minister knows, is a conditional situation merely holding the position until the House discusses this Bill which it is now doing.  The question of whether section 3, which was referred to in the interview, will be the law under which the income tax authorities will have to operate depends on the outcome of the debate here and in the Seanad.  The principle is clear and the Minister should maintain the authority of both Houses of the Oireachtas in this regard.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw Deputy Colley's attention to Financial Resolution No. 1 passed on the day of the budget, paragraph 2 of which provides:</P>
      <P>It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>

      <P>The effect of that is to make this operable from 6th April last, even prior to the date of the budget, and, in those circumstances, it is not only desirable, but, indeed, necessary that the machinery be put into motion to give it effect. If the Dáil on this or any other financial matter should have a change of mind, all that would be required would be the issue of new certificates giving credit in respect of any excessive deduction made, but nothing has happened here which is exceptional or which anticipated the decisions of the Dáil, as it were, because the Dáil had already made its decision on 16th May when it passed the Financial Resolution and had confirmed the authority for doing this.  In a case of this kind, or even in any other matter, it is, I think, highly desirable that people should get the explanation at the earliest possible date and, if the Deputy reflects, he will probably recall occasions on which guidance has been given to people in the past before all Stages of the Finance Bill were discharged through both Houses.</P>

      <P>I can recall many occasions when preparations were made by the Revenue Commissioners, such as the preparation of certificates for tax free deductions, and so on, and I think it is correct that this should be done, but I do not think it is correct that they should operate them and issue notices such as this, which has been handed to me, or that they should appear on radio and spell out what will be done under section 3, which this House had not considered. The Minister, as I have already said, is correct in referring to the Financial Resolution, but I am also correct in saying that that is provisional; it is designed to lapse and the law, if it is to be applied, is to be applied under section 3, if we decide to enact section 3.  It may seem to the Minister that this is unnecessary carping, but I think it is important that both sides should be careful in this matter because, if we are not, we will end up without any authority in effect.  If we do not accept the possibility that the Bills before the House can be amended, then we are striking at the root of the authority we are supposed to have and even at the very basis of democracy. I have made my protest.  I do not want to spend the whole day on this.</P>

      <P>In reply to Deputy Colley first, subsection (4) is the sub-section which ensures that a surtax payer will not be refunding the income tax allowances twice.  He will already have refunded through the income tax, the children's allowances received, if he is liable for that refund; but, unless this subsection was put in, it would mean that a person would be paying back more than he received and we are making it perfectly clear that nobody will pay back more than he receives.  That is the only purpose of the clause.  It does not work to the advantage of a sur-tax payer.  It simply means he will not repay twice.</P>

      <P>I am very glad Deputy Colley opposes this section and I hope he will oppose it all the way through.  What the section provides&mdash;it was presented differently on the radio this morning&mdash;is that, where a husband decides that his wife can collect the children's allowances, she will get the increase in those allowances but the husband will pay for that increase.  The Minister in his budget statement said that the result of this adjustment is that it will yield £1 million in the current financial year and £2 million in a full year.  The situation seems to be that the Minister is claiming credit for increasing children's allowances and, at the same time, making a profit on the deal.</P>

      <P>The allowances under the income tax for each such child will be reduced in the case of taxpayers with incomes exceeding £2,500. This will yield £1 million in the current financial year and £2 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>That suggests to me that the Minister expects to make a profit of £2 million as a result of giving increased children's allowances to people earning in excess of £2,500 a year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one section in which I have a continuing interest and I again urge on the Minister that what he is doing is not right.  The Minister speaking here on 17th July, as reported, at column 1074 of the Official Report, referred to people with an income in excess of £2,500 as being in the upper income bracket.  He charged me with hypocrisy because I pleaded that people in that income bracket are poor, however strange that may seem, or however strange it may sound.  Having met all their commitments, people in that income bracket are not as free to visit places of entertainment, or to take the same type of holiday, as some people in lower income brackets, who get supports of one kind or another, and whose standard of living is not <Col N="2031" /> nearly as expensive as that of the group to which I refer.</P>
      <P>The Minister indicated his unpreparedness to show any sympathy for people with a net income of £2,600. Last night, speaking about the Attorney General who would get a sum of £7,312 in accordance with the Devlin Report, the Minister made a case for giving an additional £600 per annum to that gentleman.  I do not want to say anything which would bring into this debate the character which attended yesterday's debate, but I suggest that the case I am making is a reasonable one.  I am quoting the Minister's respective statements.</P>
      <P>The one great thing about money is that it is a constant factor.  Money is as necessary to one type as to the other.  Money does not change.  People in one category or one profession are no different from others.  Politicians, whether they are Ministers, or Parliamentary Secretaries, or Deputies, legal people, whether they are Attorneys General or judges are no different from other people.  The Minister should show consideration for people in this city.  I understand there are 40,000 families in the country who are endeavouring to pay their way, who are practising industry and thrift, who are not in receipt of any social welfare assistance, who are not a liability on society in any way and are being encouraged by the Minister to put themselves into debt.  If they do that, they can get consideration for the interest they pay to the bank which will reduce their gross income below £3,500 and thereby qualify them for the additional £70.  If the Minister makes the case that the Attorney General cannot live on £7,312 and should get an additional £600 per annum, I cannot see how he can also make the point that somebody who has a net income of £2,600 should be denied children's allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomJFitzpatrick" hpid="Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central) Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick (Dublin Central)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I agree with Deputy Tunney.  We must be realistic about money values today.  Nobody can tell me that a man with an income of £2,500 is a wealthy man.  The Minister was wrong in deciding <Col N="2032" /> on the figure of £2,500.  We are dealing here with the type of people who are purchasing their own houses.  The repayments of a man in this income bracket who is purchasing his own house can run from £8 to £12 per week.  We have created a very unfair distinction.  A man with four children earning £2,400 per year, living in a municipal house or a local authority house, will qualify for the additional children's allowance, while a man with £2,600 who is trying to purchase his own house, and who is paying substantial rent every week, is not entitled to children's allowances, even if he has ten children.</P>
      <P>As I said in other debates, if the figure was in the region of £3,500 I would not criticise it but I do criticise the figure mentioned in the Bill.  I know a substantial number of people in Dublin who are in the income bracket of £2,500 per year and they are barely making ends meet.  There are people in this House who were living on £2,500 per year for the past number of years and it was quite obvious that they were in dire financial straits.  The Minister is depriving this section of the community of this additional benefit which he is giving in the budget.  He is also putting additional tax on every other section for footwear, light, heat and electricity. This section of the community are worse off after the budget then they were before it was introduced.</P>
      <P>A man with a wage of £2,550 with eight children is not entitled to children's allowances.  If I were that employee, I would go to my employer and ask him to reduce my salary by about £80.  Why should I, for the sake of £50 a year, or so, sacrifice the benefit I would get if my salary were reduced by £50 or £60 a year?  In my opinion an employee would be mad if he did not ask his employer to reduce his salary.  That is a bad situation. Whether they like it or not, the Revenue Commissioners will come up against this difficulty when a man feels he is losing a considerable amount of money.  This is an anomaly and I see difficulties in regard to returns of salaries and wages where the situation is as close as that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2033" /> You would not need an awful lot of commonsense to know what benefits you would get by reducing your salary so that you would qualify for the additional money you would get per week if you had seven or eight children.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley is right in opposing this section.  The figure mentioned is entirely inadequate in today's situation. We are approaching a national wage agreement.  There are a considerable number of people who earn more than £2,500 at present and when the agreement has been negotiated it will put thousands more outside the limit for children's allowances.</P>
    <P>The Minister should reconsider the figure.  It is certainly too low in the light of today's costs.  It is impossible for a man with seven or eight children earning £2,600, to meet his commitments. We know how the cost of living has spiralled over the past couple of months.  We can see from the Central Bank report issued yesterday that inflation is rampant.  The figure of £2,500 will be completely unrealistic at the end of this year when the national pay agreement has been negotiated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was considering this section, I gave serious consideration to the drafting of an amendment and ultimately decided that it was not possible to do so and that the only way for us to deal with this matter was to oppose this section.  It was not possible to do so because the whole concept behind this section is such that no amendment of it would be effective in my view in getting a satisfactory result.  What one has to do is simply to scrap the section and start again to get a satisfactory result.</P>
      <P>Deputies on this side of the House have indicated a number of objections to the section.  I have other objections but my basic objection to this section is that here we have a section which is dealing with the necessary income tax arrangements arising out of the children's allowances system and the increases in children's allowances introduced in the budget, and yet the section is so designed as to ensure that above the given limit of a statutory income of</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2034" /> £2,500, and it does not matter for this purpose what the level is, but above a given level, no account is taken of the number of children in a family.  In other words, at the level taken here if the statutory income of a man is £2,400 and he has one child, then he will benefit but if his statutory income is £2,600 and he has ten children, then under this section the clawback arrangement comes into operation.  It is clear to everybody that a man with ten children and £2,600 a year is far worse off than a man with one child and £2,400.  The whole basis of the children's allowances scheme is the recognition of this fact and the effort by the State in some way to take steps to go towards redressing this imbalance.  That is the whole basis of the children's allowances scheme and yet that fundamental principle is swept aside in the thinking behind this section. That is my most fundamental objection to this section and to the thinking behind it.</P>
    <P>In addition, I feel that the administrative difficulties being created are enormous.  It is unjust and will, in the course of time, lead to great trouble and difficulty to have a situation in which people will automatically have increased income tax charged whether they have applied for the additional children's allowances or not.  There are cases known to many Deputies of people who, for one reason or another, have not applied for children's allowances.  As I understand the position, whether they apply for the increased children's allowances or not, they will be subjected to the increased deduction of tax.  That seems to me to be wrong in principle, and in practice it will be a very difficult situation.</P>
    <P>There is another practical difficulty arising out of this.  I cannot say I blame the Minister for this but we should not close our eyes to the problems that will arise from it.  In the vast majority of families it is the wife who receives the children's allowances, whereas it is the husband who pays the income tax by deduction from his wages or salary.  The effect here is that the husband is having substantially <Col N="2035" /> increased tax applied to his earnings while the wife is having her income increased.  I am not blaming the Minister for this but let us not blind ourselves to the consequences. There will be a great deal of trouble in a great many homes because of the practical operation of this.  Too many people will not be aware of the fact that the additional income tax is being charged to them because of this.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what the correct answer to this one is but it does seem to me that a completely different approach to the whole matter would be far more satisfactory, an approach which would apply, whatever limit was decided on, on the basis of, say, a family with one child and then that that statutory limit ought to increase by a fixed amount in respect of each qualified child thereafter so that one is making some effort to recognise the fundamental fact which is inherent in any scheme of children's allowances, that a man with a large family is considerably worse off than a man with a small family, if both have the same income.</P>
    <P>This is my fundamental objection to the section.  I believe the whole concept is wrong and flies in the face of what is required when one is dealing with a children's allowances scheme.  It is a misconception and it will produce a number of very grave problems.  The whole approach involved in this arises out of certain preelection promises which were not properly thought out and which, in the course of the current financial year, will produce many problems which I suspect the Minister never anticipated and would not have wanted to occur.  They will occur.  I tried to consider the drafting of an amendment to this section that might cure the defects and I did not find it possible to do so.  I do not think there is any possible way of doing it except by scrapping the section and starting again with a completely different concept, one which relates the statutory income, which operates as the bar, to a sliding scale depending on the number of children in the family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I endeavoured to indicate that, as has been borne out by the contribution by Deputy O'Brien, the policy of the Government apparently is to encourage people to go into debt.  A salary earner whose net income is £2,510 is not entitled to the children's allowance but if he will have a consultation with his bank manager and mortgage his house and commit himself to interest repayments of £100 a year he will then qualify.  This is the new philosophy being preached to the people.</P>
      <P>I said before and I repeat that we are all dependent upon that section of the people who are thrifty enough to generate the excess which can be distributed to those who are less well off but if we are to continue to encourage all sections to put themselves in debt then, obviously, the day of disaster cannot be far away.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the way the Deputy lives.  It is not the way I live and I do not think it is the way anybody should live if at all possible. There is another aspect of this matter which I would regard as being socially very undesirable.  I refer to that section who are finding it difficult to make ends meet, the section to whom Deputy Fitzpatrick referred, who put on a veneer of affluence, keep the best side out and try to pay their way and who have to pay the increased cost of living and are denied this assistance, the spirit of which, as Deputy Colley said, was to aid persons having <Col N="2041" /> the responsibility and bearing the cost of rearing children.  The fact that such families will be denied the allowance will have the effect of forcing the lady of the house to go out and take employment. I do not think that is desirable.  On the contrary, every encouragement and financial help should be afforded to mothers who are prepared to stay at home and look after their children.  By doing so they save the State expenditure on reformatory schools, places of detention and other expenditure arising from deliquency which often occurs because of the fact that children are not afforded the protection, the love and the care of a mother because the mother is forced to go out and earn money in order to keep the house going.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Brien, in an effort to defend the situation, did not refer to the point I made in respect of the case made yesterday by the Minister for the Attorney General who, under the terms of the Devlin recommendation was to get £7,312 per annum&mdash; £7,312 per annum for the Attorney General and for the Fine Gael Party and for their just society.  It was not enough.  The Minister spent a considerable amount of time here yesterday justifying an additional £600 per annum for that one gentleman. Spokesmen for Fine Gael would tell me that the rest of the community, more ordinary mortals, who are obliged to rear families of six or seven children on £2,500 a year are overpaid and are in the upper income bracket.</P>
      <P>Where is the consistency on the part of the Government?  For one family £7,312 per annum is not adequate; a case must be made to give an additional £600 per annum or £12 a week and, on the other hand, in respect of families where the total income per year is £2,500 the case is being made for denying them, in the case of a family of five children, £85 per year in respect of children's allowances. I would ask the Minister to fill in the gap between the different approaches.  If he does so I shall be happy to accept the section.  Otherwise it will be my intention to vote against it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>There are very important issues involved in the section. First of all, there were the promises made before the election by the National Coalition Parties, promises that were never costed, promises that were not given deep thought, promises made to an unsuspecting public.  At last, they have come home to roost. Because of these thoughtless promises made in order to try to buy the electorate we find ourselves now in the position where the most hard-pressed section of the community, the middleclass people, are getting the allowance on the one hand and it is being taken away from them in greater amount by way of taxation.</P>
      <P>We realise that the Minister, in his budget, has a vested interest in encouraging people to live beyond their means.  He has a vested interest in eninflation. If inflation does not occur to a tremendous degree then the Minister will not get the type of money that he is looking for.  Because of the confusion created before the election by the promises that were made, the middle-class person is now being asked to pay the piper.  I would strongly suggest to the Minister that instead of taxing those people whose burdens of taxation are already too great, he should go much more strenuously after those who are avoiding and evading the tax net.  It is all very well for the Minister to say that he going to do it but it is some time since the budget was introduced and I should like to know from the Minister what positive steps he has taken since the budget to go after tax evaders.</P>

      <P>It relates to the fact that these unfortunate people are being given children's allowances and are having them clawed back by the Revenue Commissioners.

If this job was done properly the Minister would not have to face two ways at the one time on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have previously endeavoured to show Fianna Fáil's lack of decency in dealing with this matter.  I could use other words which would be more precise but then I should be accused of arrogance.  Let the facts speak for themselves.  First, the first time the income tax system was used in order not to extend the benefit of children's allowances was in 1969 when the Fianna Fáil administration provided that every income tax payer in the community, including people on paltry £14 and £15 a week incomes, were not to get the benefit of increases in children's allowances.  That was only four years ago.  There are many people who should not be paying income tax but the question of relieving them has been so long postponed that the burden of giving relief now is a colossal one.  Yet it is one I shall take upon my shoulders and endeavour to relieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Another vague promise by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Four years ago the income tax system was used to deny all income tax payers benefit.  Apparently, that was tolerable in Fianna Fáil's gospel then; it is now intolerable that people with incomes up to and over £3,000 might, as a result of our system, not get the benefit of the increases even though they will continue to get the existing allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Next I want to deal with the alternatives, because they are important. The effect of our children's allowances scheme and the use of the income tax <Col N="2044" /> system in this very limited way is that out of a total of 352,676 families, 40,000 will not get the total benefit of these children's allowances this year but 312,676 will get the full benefit of these most generous allowances which now exceed children's allowances payable in Britain and Northern Ireland. That is a gigantic achievement for this little State, one about which we should shout from the rooftops and be proud of.  These allowances are massively greater than those paid in Britain and Northern Ireland and in many cases will still be greater when the British allowances are improved next November. The contrast between what we have given and what Fianna Fáil proposed to give is this: 312,676 families are getting these increased children's allowances without deduction; the Fianna Fáil scheme was to give children's allowance increases to only 170,000 families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    <P>We have given these massive increases, greater than a wealthy country like Britain is at present giving, from 1st July, to 312,676 families.  Those who have dared to criticise on the opposite side are entitled to do so and to express their disappointment that we did not find it possible to give the increases to 352,000 families but we did give them to 312,676 families.  One can understand why I find it difficult to accept that there is much sincerity in the criticism offered by people whose alternative was that spelled out by <Col N="2045" /> their own Leader and when at meetings they held, they declared their policy in September last.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as the figures came from us I have no quarrel.  We do not wish to delay this Bill unduly. We have stated the objections we see to the Bill and the Minister and Deputy O'Brien have endeavoured to answer them.  The record will speak for itself.  It is notable that the Minister, in replying, referred to the numbers of families to which benefit under one scheme or another would accrue but he did not attempt to deal with the basic criticism which we, and I in particular, made of this scheme represented by this section 3. That is, that a children's allowances scheme should be related to the number of children.  The Minister did not even attempt to answer that criticism. Particularly at present, in my view, a children's allowances scheme should be directed as far as possible to assist those in greatest need, who have suffered most from inflation.</P>
      <P>One of the categories of persons who are in greatest need and suffering most from inflation are the father and mother of the large family.  This is why children's allowances are so important as a method of redistribution of income and so important at the present time.  Essentially it is the most important.  In fact, it is the only weapon open to the Minister for Finance to effect any real redistribution of income in an effective way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The answer does not lie in the number of families who benefit.  The answer lies in the situation of the families who benefit.  Are they the families who are in greatest need? This is the basic criticism I have been making of this section and the Minister did not attempt to answer it.  To determine need in relation to a family one must have regard to the number of children in that family.  This <Col N="2046" /> scheme does not.  Once one reaches the statutory limit it does not matter how many children there are in that family.  We do not propose to continue to repeat these arguments in this regard.  We have made our arguments and they are on the record.</P>
    <P>There is one further technical matter to which I should like to return.  The Minister will recall that I stated earlier that I could not find section 523 (1) (a) of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  The Minister said that there must be something wrong with the edition of the Act I had.  I took the opportunity of sending across my copy of the Act to the Minister's official who very kindly indicated to me that section 523 (1) (a) of the Income Tax Act, 1967, was inserted by section 10 of the Finance Act, 1967, and subsequently amended.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when I see that subsection (4) says that; &ldquo;Section 523 (1) (a) of the Income Tax Act, 1967 shall have effect as if&rdquo;, <i>et cetera,</i> and then when I go to the Income Tax Act of 1967 and find that section 523 has no (1) (a) one will understand my perplexity.  I now understand why but surely the Minister will agree that this is a totally unsatisfactory situation to which I did draw his attention on the Second Stage.  I would urge him, in the interest of anybody who has to interpret this section, to redraft sub-section (4) to make it clear how you find the particular reference when you go to look for it.</P>
    <P>We feel very strongly on this section. Deputies on this side have put forward our point of view.  We could, and perhaps some people might feel that we should, spend a great deal more time in arguing our point of view on this very important section but, having regard to the business still before the House, we do not propose to pursue it further.</P>

      <P>The Minister will recall that on the Second Stage I asked him to spell out in more detail what is involved here and make it clear whether the effect is to give a greater or a lesser repayment of tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 154 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, deals with the case of a person for whose benefit any income is accumulated under the terms of any will or settlement, contingent on his attaining a specified age or marrying.  The section provides that after the happening of the contingency the person may, within six years from the end of the tax year in which the contingency happens, make a claim to a repayment in respect of the income tax which was paid by the trustees in respect of the income <Col N="2049" /> which arose during the period of accumulation.  The amount repayable is the amount which would have been repaid to the person concerned if the income had been his as of vested right during the years of accumulation by reference to his personal allowances and reliefs for those years.  The amendment of section 154 is to the effect that for the purpose of the repayment under the Section no account is to be taken of any tax paid in respect of income for 1973-74 or any subsequent year.  In other words, in relation to any settlement, when the contingency is fulfilled and the child becomes entitled to the income tax repayment in respect of personal allowances, it will only be in respect of years up to and including 1972-73.  No repayment will be due for 1973-74 or any subsequent year.</P>
      <P>Claims arising under section 154 are running at about 15 a year, the average amount of the repayment in each case being about £400.  With the increase in levels of affluence, however, there is a greater tendency to make these settlements.  In many cases, practitioners are approaching the Revenue with draft or newly-executed settlements and asking for Revenue agreement that the interests under the settlements are contingent.  The purpose of seeking such agreement is apparently to ensure that the settlor parent will still be entitled to child allowances for tax purposes and that the child will, on fulfilling the contingency, be entitled to tax repayment. The dividing line between a contingent interest and an interest which is vested, but liable to be divested, is not well-defined, with judicial decisions falling on one or other side of the line in a manner which is difficult to reconcile.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The modest saving by reference to repayment claims is not the main purpose of the amendment, but to remove an obvious anomaly which his capable of being abused, and there is reason to believe is being abused, by well-to-do parents, who because of surplus income and wealth can create these situations and thereby avoid paying tax and creating the situation in which the children of such wealthy parents can apply for and obtain a refund <Col N="2050" /> of tax when the contingency is fulfilled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for that explanation.  As of now I have no particular view for or against the section.  Am I correct in understanding that what the Minister said was that under settlements of the kind envisaged in this section, the parent concerned can claim the child allowance and, on the happening of the contingency, the child who is the person benefiting under the settlement can claim the personal allowances which the child would have been entitled to if he were receiving the income over the period in question? If that is the position, is the Minister saying that he regards that as a reprehensible situation in which people are getting benefit twice and that is why he is introducing this section? Is that the reasoning behind the section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is a situation in which benefit is being obtained twice.  It is obviously a benefit which can only be obtained by people of substantial wealth who are able to create the situation.  I do not think it can be socially justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that and, for that reason, I am inclined to support the proposition.  Nevertheless, it seems from something the Minister said earlier, that this situation which the Minister has described has existed for a considerable time and has not heretofore been regarded as an abuse, but that an indication of an increase in the number of these cases is what is concerning the Minister and is, if you like, what has triggered off the thinking behind this section.  On the face of it, I agree with the Minister that it seems to be something that should be done, but it is our duty to consider whether it is, in fact, an abuse and, if it is, was it not considered so in the past.  Is the reason for introducing this section the fact that more people appear to be about to avail themselves of this benefit, and that it was tolerable when only a small number did it, but that it becomes intolerable when a larger number attempt to do it?  There seems to be something wrong with the <Col N="2051" /> logic involved in this.  Perhaps the Minister could elaborate a little further on it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was never intended to be used in this way.  It arose out of the general entitlement of a person on attaining his majority at 21 years of age to apply for a refund of the tax which had been deducted from his property during his infancy.  It is now a device which is being used by people who see it as a way in which they can devote income which is surplus to their own requirements to investments for their children, to get tax allowances in respect of those children.  Tax is payable on the income, but as soon as the child attains his majority, or whatever other condition is required, he can then apply for a refund.  Incidentally, I think it is worthy of note that in 1969 in Britain they took remedial measures to close this gap and the Chancellor at the time said something which I am sure we can all endorse. He said: &ldquo;This is an anomaly which even the most single-minded devotee of tax loopholes would find it difficult to defend.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The purpose of this section is to remove a legal doubt as to the validity of assessments to income tax, including surtax, made on the executor or administrator of a deceased member of a partnership in respect of his share of the partnership profits arising or accruing prior to the date of death.  I suspect that a number of Members will be surprised to find that this matter should ever be in doubt but, apparently, some doubts have arisen and the purpose of the amendment is to remove them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister extend the explanation of section 6 <Col N="2052" /> by giving an example of the type of partnership which will be affected by the section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any partnership. Section 211 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, authorises the making of assessments on the executor or administrator of any deceased person in respect of profits or gains which had arisen or accrued to that person before his death.  Subsection (4), however, said that this provision was not to apply in the case of a partnership.</P>
      <P>The reason for the exclusion was due to the fact that, prior to 1965, there were special rules for the making of assessments of partnership profits.  Under these rules the profits of a trade or profession carried on by a partnership were to be assessed by way of a joint assessment in the partnership name.  In consequence, the death of a member of a partnership made no difference to the form of the assessment on pre-death profits.</P>
      <P>Part VIII of the Finance Act, 1965, introduced new rules for the making of assessments on the profits of trades and professions carried on in partnership. As and from 6th April, 1965, the share of the profits or gains arising to a partner were to be assessed as if they arose in a trade, carried on solely by that partner.  No longer, therefore, is there an assessment on the partnership as such, nor responsibility for tax on the pre-death profits of a deceased partner and the Revenue must, therefore, look to the deceased partner's executor or administrator for tax on the pre-death profits of the partner.  It could be argued that the power to assess the executor or administrator conferred by section 211 does not, by virtue of subsection (4) apply in the case of a partnership, and the Revenue Commissioners have, therefore, been advised that there is an element of doubt in the matter which the draft section is designed to remove.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that this is not imposing any new obligation on a partner or the next-of-kin of the deceased partner to pay tax.  All it is doing is ensuring that no opportunity will be used arising out of any weakness in the law or any doubt in the <Col N="2053" /> law to avoid paying the tax.  I am sure that will commend itself to all conscientious Members of the House.</P>

      <P>We would support any necessary enactment to ensure that the correct liability for income tax was applied to the correct person and give the necessary machinery to the Revenue Commissioners to do so. However, there is one aspect of the Minister's explanation which requires to be elaborated on a little further.  He did describe the change in the method of dealing with income tax of a partnership which took place in 1965.  The Minister will note that the subsection which is proposed to be deleted is in the 1967 Income Tax Act.  The question in my mind is why was subsection (4) enacted in 1967 after the change which the Minister has described had taken place in 1965.  Why was that enacted after the change and why is it now proposed to delete subsection (4) <Col N="2054" /> which was enacted in the knowledge that the system had changed?</P>

      <P>It does.  It means the the remuneration in the last year of service.  Under section 229 of the 1967 Act a retirement benefit scheme must be approved by the Revenue Commissioners for the purpose of income tax if it complies with certain conditions.  One of these conditions is that the total amount of benefit accruing on the death in service of a member which may be paid in lump sum form is not to exceed, <i>inter alia</i>, one-and-a-half times the member's final remuneration.  The purpose of the proposed section is to increase, with effect as and from April 6th, 1972, the limit of one-and-a-half times the final remuneration to four times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recall that on Second Stage I referred to this section and said that on the face of it it appeared that this section would be worth a great deal of money to a surtax payer, a great deal more than it would be worth to an ordinary taxpayer.  The fact that it is proposed to have effect as from April 6th, 1972, made me wonder if, in fact, the Minister had in mind some special cases where there was a particular tragedy involved and where, perhaps, the House would be agreeable that in those circumstances those cases should be covered.  I did, however, suggest that if this is what the Minister had in mind he ought to try to narrow down the concession in some way to confine it to such cases.  On the face of it, it would appear that it is a blanket proposal here, the effect of which would be to give very substantial benefit to surtax payers. Perhaps the Minister would care to elaborate a little more on the thinking behind this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is desirable for Deputy Colley to suggest that this is for the benefit of sur-tax payers as such.  It is not.  What we are doing here is correcting a little omission in Deputy Colley's Finance Bill of 1972.  The reason for making the increase is that Chapter II of Part I of the Finance Act, 1972, introduced a new code of tax legislation for pension schemes and under this code the limit on lump sum death in service benefits is four times the final remuneration. This was Deputy Colley's provision.  Pension schemes approved under the old code which will lapse after April 5th, 1980, have the option of remaining under the old code until April 5th, 1980.  In the meantime, however, some of them wish to enjoy the new limit of four times the final remuneration. Representations for the increase have been made by a number of persons, by insurance companies and other companies that transact pension business.  Under section 229 (2) the Revenue Commissioners have discretionary powers to approve schemes even though the rules may allow lump sum benefits at a higher rate than <Col N="2056" /> one-and-a-half times the final remuneration. If any such lum sums are paid, the excess over the statutory limit must be charged to income tax at the full rate.  There are a very small number of open cases, not more than a half dozen, in which a charge to tax for 1972-73 would fall to be made by reference to a limit of one-and-a-half times the final remuneration.  By making the four times limit retrospective to April 6th, 1972, the question of a tax charge in these cases will be obviated.  The amount of tax involved is insignificant.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 9, before section 8, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>(1) Section 246 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, shall not apply to any expenditure incurred on or after the 24th day of July, 1973, and before the 1st day of April, 1975, on the purchase of a new ship.</P>
      <P>(2) This section shall not apply to any expenditure incurred under a contract entered into before the 24th day of July, 1973.</P>
      <P Just="Right">&mdash;An tAire Airgeadais.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment is intended to suspend operation of the 40 per cent investment allowance in favour of ships during the period when free depreciation and the 100 per cent initial allowance is available.  Under sections 8 and <Col N="2057" /> 16 this period has been extended to 31st March, 1975.  The date as and from which expenditure will be affected will be 24th July, 1973&mdash;this should now be 26th July&mdash;that is, the date on which the amendment is being moved.  The special benefit of an investment allowance, by contrast with the initial allowance, is that the investment allowance is not taken into account for the purpose of wear and tear deductions so that 140 per cent of the capital expenditure is written off against profits.  This special provision was made available in respect of the purchase of new ships because of the particular needs of shipping companies which operate in a highly competitive field.</P>
    <P>Since shipping companies generally are not in a profit-making position there are no or insufficient profits against which the generous capital allowances available can be set off. This situation has led to the development of arrangements under which one of the banks buys a ship and then leases it to the shipping company.  The bank will then claim the benefit of the capital allowances on the grounds that it has incurred capital expenditure on the provision of the ship.  It has been argued that the shipping company set a benefit from the allowances by way of lower leasing charges but it cannot be denied that a substantial part of the benefit of these allowances goes to the bank.  The statutory provisions governing initial allowance and wear and tear deductions provide specifically for the granting of those allowances to a lessor of plant and machinery, which would include a ship, but there is no corresponding provision relating to shipping investment allowance.</P>
    <P>It has been argued, however, that notwithstanding the absence of a special provision to this effect, the allowances can be claimed.  It has been decided now that the shipping investment allowances should not be granted during the period when free depreciation and the 100 per cent initial allowance is available since the full cost of the ship can be set off against profits in the first year if there are sufficient profits for this purpose.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2058" /> The period of operation of these reliefs has been extended to the 31st March, 1975 by sections 8 and 16 of the Bill and the amendment provides that shipping investment allowance will not be available in respect of capital expenditure incurred up to that date in the provision of a ship.  There is a saver in subsection (2) for expenditure incurred already under a contract entered into before the 26th July, 1973.  This protects the position of a large shipping company, for instance, the B &amp; I, who have entered into a contract already with one of the banks for the financing of two ships, the expenditure in relation to them extending over the period July, 1972, to March, 1974, on £1 million investment, and in the period October, 1972, to June, 1974, on £2 million investment.</P>
    <P>Under section 246 (2) expenditure is regarded as having been incurred on the day when it becomes payable.  But for the saver now provided the amounts payable between 24th July, 1973, and the 31st March, 1975, would lose the benefit of the investment allowance. As the financial arrangements agreed between the two parties were based on the understanding that the investment allowance would be available, their position is being protected. Of course, the saver will apply in any other case where a contract has been made already.</P>
    <P>Briefly, the purpose of this is to ensure that what was intended as a tax benefit to shipping companies will not be availed of by others to give a tax benefit to them.  If shipping companies require State assistance our view is that State assistance ought to be given openly for the purpose of shipping rather than that we should continue to have a tax provision which can be used by people outside the shipping industry to give a tax benefit to themselves, a benefit that was never intended in the legislation, which was introduced to assist the shipping industry but not financial institutions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have grasped the substance of what the Minister is doing here.  I am not sure whether I agree with him.  As I understand it, what the Minister is saying is that certain arrangements have been entered <Col N="2059" /> into.  I am familiar with one such case where a State company, the B &amp; I, entered into an arrangement with a bank whereby the bank purchased a ship from its own resources and entered into a leasing arrangement with the B &amp; I and was able to do so on terms that were very attractive to the shipping company.  This was because the bank was able to claim the allowance that the Minister is referring to.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Minister is saying that we are making provision whereby any such agreements made already can continue on that basis but that we are ensuring that there will not be such agreements in future, that the benefits will not accrue to a bank which enters into such arrangement in future.  Am I right so far?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, what is raised here is the question of whether the Minister is right in principle in the approach he is adopting.  I have no doubt that on first view, he would appear to be right but it is better on the face of it that arrangements of this kind, if they involve some form of subsidy, should be open and should be seen to be open.  On the other hand, there are many precedents in the income tax code for allowances of this kind and there is something to be said for a situation which results in a shipping company and, in particular, a State company, being enabled to acquire ships on favourable terms without having to use their own resources or to call on the Minister for Finance for sums which in all cases are very substantial, which would be in millions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the provisions in the income tax code&mdash;provisions that have existed for a considerable time&mdash;the shipping companies do not find it necessary to call on the Minister in those circumstances that we are discussing here.  These provisions apply also to many other kinds of businesses and companies.  If what the Minister is saying is that the banks, in the kind of situation we are visualising, are gaining some extra advantage which they <Col N="2060" /> should not gain, I could sympathise more with what the Minister is doing, but as I understand the position, the effect of the banks getting this allowance was that the B &amp; I company were, in effect, getting that benefit and consequently, were enabled to acquire ships which they might not have been able to acquire at the time and certainly not as soon as they acquired them.</P>
    <P>I am not sure that the practical effect of what the Minister is proposing is one that he would desire to bring about.  The Minister may say to us that in cases of this kind the banks are gaining an advantage over and above what they are passing on to the company by way of special terms.  If that is so, I would be more sympathetic to what the Minister is doing but perhaps the Minister would let us know if that is his view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is reason to believe that the banks are getting some cream-off.  I would not wish to be precise because one knows the difficulties involved in interpreting accounts. However, there is good reason for believing that the tax benefit does not accrue <i>in toto</i> to the issuing company. The reality is that it was never intended that there should be a 140 per cent allowance in one year.  The original investment allowance for ships which was 40 per cent has existed since 1957.  but it was only in 1971 that the initial allowance was increased from 60 per cent to 100 per cent.  Of course, this applies to more than ships.  This created an anomaly which was not thought of in time, as a result of which we ended up in the position of giving 140 per cent allowance.  I do not think it was ever really intended, even in 1971 or, indeed, since, but it is there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept all that Deputy Colley has said.  It is repetition of what I am saying. It may be very necessary to give assistance to the shipping companies and we would be most anxious to ensure that they would get all the assistance necessary so as to be highly competitive and attract all possible trade and keep their fleet in the best modern condition but it is better that <Col N="2061" /> that should be done as a direct subsidy by the State rather than that the tax system should be used to provide a concealed benefit for people who are not directly engaged in the shipping industry.  This is a situation that we will continue to keep a careful eye on and if we get any representations from the shipping industry we will be more than sympathetic to ensure that their position is in no way worsened. We also want to ensure that anything we do for the shipping companies is not something that will be taken advantage of by financial institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the approach the Minister has outlined. I must admit I still have certain reservations.  I imagine that the Minister for Finance is now long enough in office to have learned for himself that if he had twice as much available in the way of capital resources as he has he would still have competing demands for those resources which he would not be able to meet no matter how deserving they were. That being so, there will come a time when a State shipping company will find that it cannot acquire a ship or will have to postpone, perhaps for a year or more, the acquisition of a ship simply because there is a limit to the amount of capital resources available to the Minister and to the State.  When that happens what will be the consequences? The Minister will know that in the shipping business very often time is of the essence; the acquisition of a ship at a particular date may be vital to the profitability, the obtaining of certain contracts and so on.  If such possible profitability has to be foregone because simply of the non-availability of resources for every good purpose, then in such circumstances it may well be that there would be some regret that we had passed this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am assuming that the Minister has gone into this thoroughly and, on balance, has decided that this is the right way to do it.  I have reservations as to whether it is the right way to do it but on the basis that the Minister has assured us that this matter will be kept under review and that the Minister will ensure that the passing of this amendment will not operate to the <Col N="2062" /> detriment of shipping companies, I would be prepared not to oppose the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to emphasise that the 100 per cent initial allowance remains and all we are doing is saying that we are withholding the 40 per cent allowance while the 100 per cent initial allowance remains until 1975.  Then we will have to have a look at the whole position.  I accept the validity of what the Deputy has said but there is no reason why ships would not continue to be built.  If that means that the hire charges are increased because of this 40 per cent removal of investment allowance, the State will obviously have to take up any loss that may accrue.</P>

      <P>The matter is one which I mentioned in the budget <Col N="2064" /> debate.  It is the question of the purchase of mobile homes.  I am not interested in the purchase of a mobile home as a second residence or seaside home.  I am concerned about the very many people who purchase mobile homes for themselves and their families.  A man may buy a mobile home and site it near his father's cottage, planning permission having been obtained.  His method of purchase is probably hire purchase.  I understand he is not allowed to include the interest element of the hire purchase repayments for the purposes of income tax allowance.  This would appear to be an injustice to a married man with children buying his home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have some sympathy for the idea Deputy Fitzgerald has put forward.  There are great difficulties.  The difficulty he raises is whether or not an income tax allowance should be given in respect of hire purchase debt because that comes back to the nature of the debt which arises where one is purchasing a mobile home.  If the purchaser borrowed the money from the bank, allowance would be given under <Col N="2065" /> the income tax code in respect of interest paid on the overdraft.  Where the mobile home is acquired under a hire purchase agreement, it takes the same status as the hire purchase of a motor car or television set which does not get that tax concession.  There is something to be said for the person buying shelter which is more fundamental than a luxury item but there would be considerable difficulties in administering what the Deputy proposes. I am not unsympathetic and I shall consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept there may be difficulties in administering it but surely there is injustice in not giving this allowance to such an individual as against the man buying a motor car or television set.  There are difficulties in administering any piece of legislation, including the different sections in this Bill, but despite those difficulties we must endeavour to eliminate any injustices that might be created.  During the budget debate I was interrupted by one of the Minister's backbenchers saying that this was arising because adequate houses had not been provided, which was utterly stupid.  This is not the case.  I am sure the Minister is well aware that there are many of those homes, not, perhaps, in the Minister's constituency but in the Dublin suburbs.  It is not easy for these people &mdash; and may be impossible &mdash; to get a bank loan.  They may be able to get hire purchase with guarantors but, if so, they must make heavy repayments over a short period and are not allowed in their income tax for the interest paid.  I earnestly ask the Minister to consider the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the plea of Deputy Fitzgerald.  There is an anomaly in the whole income tax code as regards an allowance being made in respect of interest paid on an overdraft and no allowances in respect of interest on a hire purchase agreement. Without opening up the whole area, I think in the case of the item Deputy Fitzgerald mentions, a mobile home in which a man resides not merely as a summer residence, there is an extremely strong case for relief. I think the Minister accepts that but <Col N="2066" /> I want to point out that there were difficulties in another connection relating to mobile homes and distinguishing between those used for summer residence and those which were genuine, full-time homes, if I may so describe them.  My recollection is that those difficulties were overcome.  The Minister might find that the machinery, or the substance of it, required in order to do what Deputy Fitzgerald urges may well exist already.</P>

I asked if the Minister could tell us how many companies would have been involved before now and whether the effect of this section is to give relief for British investors in such things as office blocks.  I should be glad if the <Col N="2067" /> Minister would let us know if that is not so.  On the face of it, the section does not very clearly indicate what I think it is doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not know how many companies are involved but we have had representations, as I am sure the Deputy had in his day, from accountants and others saying that the 75 per cent provision was causing difficulty and so this relief is being provided. This amendment is a consequence of the change made in Article VII (2) of the agreement made on 18th May, 1949 by the protocol signed in May this year.  Under section 357 (3) an Irish company which receives a dividend from a company in Northern Ireland or Great Britain in which the Irish company beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, not less than three-quarters of the ordinary share capital, is entitled to credit against its Irish income tax in respect of so much of the United Kingdom corporation tax on the profits out of which the dividend is paid as cannot be allowed against corporation profits tax.</P>
      <P>The requirement that there should be a holding of three-quarters of the ordinary share capital corresponds with that embodied in Article VII of the agreement made on 18th May, 1949.  A protocol signed on 2nd May, 1973, replaces the requirement in Article VII by the condition that the recipient company should control 10 per cent of the voting power in the paying company.  The necessary change in section 357 (3) is achieved by substituting the words &ldquo;controls, directly or indirectly, not less than 10 per cent of the voting power in&rdquo; instead of the existing words &ldquo;beneficially owns directly or indirectly&rdquo; not less than three-quarters of the ordinary share capital of...&rdquo; The change made by the protocol of 2nd May, 1973, is effective in respect of dividends paid on or after 6th April, 1973.

      <P>Section 386 of the Income Tax Act of 1967 grants exemption from income tax and corporation profits tax in respect of the profits of a company from certain mining operations in the mining of non-bedded minerals.  Normally, a company is entitled under section 456 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, to deduct income tax at source from dividends paid by it but there is a special provision (in section 387, subsection (2)), which provides that a mining company is not entitled to deduct income tax from any dividend (or part of a dividend) which it pays out of profit exempted under section 386. This is to secure that the exemption enjoyed by the company is passed on to shareholders.</P>
      <P>Where, however, such a dividend is paid without deduction of tax to a shareholder which is a company, the latter company, when paying its dividends, may under existing law deduct income tax on the whole of such dividends, even in the case where the dividend is paid out of tax-free dividends from a mining company.</P>
      <P>To remove this anomaly, the proposed section provides that such a holding company will be subject to the same restrictions as a mining company in deducting tax from dividends paid out of exempted income. In other words, the benefit of the mining tax exemption will be passed on to the ultimate individual shareholder.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recall that when I spoke on this section during the Second Stage I asked him to spell out in more detail, as he has done, what was involved and I asked <Col N="2069" /> whether it meant more special relief for surtax payers, for instance, people who had shares in a holding company which controls a mining company.  The reason I asked that question was that paragraph (c) of the new subsection (4) specifically refers to surtax.  On a quick reading of it it does not appear that that is simply balancing out a similar provision in regard to income tax; it seems to be a special provision in regard to surtax. Could the Minister enlighten us a little further as to why that reference is necessary in paragraph (c).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position in law at the moment is that a dividend of a mining company is exempted from tax whether it is income tax or sur-tax. There is no special treatment of surtax payers.  The dividend is free of tax.  It is worth mentioning that this provision is similar to the provision which already applies to export tax relief.  Where export tax reliefs are given the dividends are not subject to income tax or surtax but a device has developed whereby the ultimate shareholders could be denied the benefit of this tax relief by the formation of an intermediate company which would receive the dividend from the mining company without deduction of tax and then could pay out the dividend to its own individual holders deducting tax from it because, theoretically, it was not a mining company.</P>
      <P>That, obviously, is contrary to the intention of the legislature to encourage people to invest in mining, and the purpose of it then is to bring the law in relation to mining into line with that which applies in relation to export tax reliefs, and to provide that the dividend would be given without a tax deduction of any kind.</P>

What I am questioning may largely be a question of drafting.  The Minister will notice that paragraph (c) relates to the amount to be included in respect of the dividend in <Col N="2070" /> any return for the purpose of surtax, <i>et cetera.</i></P>
      <P>On the face of it, paragraph (a) does not appear to be the corresponding provision in relation to income tax.  It may be so, but I am not clear why this special provision is made in regard to surtax.</P>

      <P>This section is linked with section 19 which extends &ldquo;charity exemption&rdquo; to bodies of persons whose objects are the promotion of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Implementation of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The present section secures that annual contributions made under covenant by any person to such bodies for periods exceeding three years will be recognised for income tax purposes. Under existing law, income tax may be deducted from such annual payments, and because of the tax exemption now being accorded to these bodies, they will be able to claim a refund of the tax so deducted.</P>

      <P>A point was raised by Deputy Haughey in this regard. Deputy Haughey said that it seemed to be proposed to give bodies coming within the terms of this section both the benefit of the covenanting arrangement and the benefit of being treated as a charity, and that this was going beyond what is done for what might be regarded as similar bodies.  Would the Minister care to comment on that point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is wrong to think that there is any particular preference being given to these organisations named in the section.  This benefit in relation to covenants to subscribed funds can only be given to organisations which are regarded as charitable organisations.  We have been very careful to ensure that it was only bodies that were regarded as reputable that would receive this benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The truth is, it may be a sad truth, that the amount of subscriptions and donations given for the promotion of human rights and the protection of fundamental freedoms are not very great.  I think that the tendency of people to give assistance towards relief of physical and mental hardship is much greater.  The tax involved in this section I would consider to be negligible but we are party to the Universal Declaration of Human <Col N="2072" /> Rights and to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</P>
    <P>This is just a small but, nonetheless, important contribution by us which we hope might encourage some people to make generous contributions towards the achievements of the aims of these organisations and of these very reputable covenants and principles. It is a very sad thing that since these were first written by mankind in the last quarter of a century the number of people known now to be denied their rights appears to be greater than ever before.  I am not for one moment suggesting that covenanted payments are going to rectify this very sad state of affairs, but we thought it worthwhile to give this slight encouragement to people and to the organisations acting in this somewhat thankless, but nevertheless very important, field.</P>

      <P>I should like to raise another matter in this connection.  I will preface my remarks by saying that I realise the difficulties the Minister may have in answering this point. I am trying to get some idea of the kinds of bodies which might be involved in the benefits we propose to confer here.  The Minister's difficulty is, I know, the fact that the determination of a particular body would be a matter for the Revenue Commissioners and the Minister does not wish to be in a position in which he appears to be prejudging whether a particular body should be in or out. I appreciate that fully, but I wonder could the Minister mention even one, preferably more than one, which might consider applying to the Revenue Commissioners in order to benefit under this section and under section 19.  I am putting it that way because I think that does not commit the Minister to anything.  Could he give us one body which might reasonably consider applying for the benefit?</P>

      <P>For myself, personally, reading the constitution of individual societies and forming an opinion on it, I should not like to express an opinion here, but the safeguard that is written into the Bill is contained <Col N="2073" /> in section 19, which requires that any organisation must have consultative status with the UN organisations or the Council of Europe in order to benefit.  Both these organisations have very complicated procedures and lay down very stringent conditions, all of which must be fulfilled before any organisation is given consultative status with them.  First of all, the Revenue Commissioners will have to satisfy themselves that any applicant for this relief is an organisation which has consultative status with either of these bodies and then a look will have to be taken at their objectives to ensure that these are in keeping with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights or the European Convention.  It can probably be taken that the organisations in question would not affiliate to or be granted consultative status with these organisations unless they were satisfied they were organisations legitimately pursuing the objectives of both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention.</P>

      <P>There are a number operating here.  I have no official list because it has been decided the proper thing to do is to let these be dealt with by the Revenue Commissioners.  We have laid down the principles.  When the system gets under way I shall be only too happy to give the House an indication of the organisations regarded as coming within the ambit of the section.  We have the safeguard that spurious organisations will not get benefit because such organisations do not get consultative status with these international organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that a spurious organisation would be very unlikely to benefit, but it would be helpful if we could visualise the kind of body to which we propose to give benefits. There seems to be some kind of mystery about the kind of body.  I cannot think of an Irish organisation which would benefit under this.  I understand <Col N="2074" /> the Minister's difficulty and I framed my question in a particular way: I asked the Minister if he could tell us the names of any bodies with consultative status with the United Nations or the Council of Europe because that is a matter of fact.  It has nothing to do with benefiting under this.</P>

      <P>A point was raised on Second Stage by Deputy Haughey as to whether the relief given here would be only in respect of the lump sum payment and not any sums which might be paid by way of annual income. Perhaps the Minister could elaborate on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this section is to exempt from income tax all payments in the nature of income, made to or in respect of Irish children deformed tragically as a result of the drug thalidomide by the foundation which was set up under statute <Col N="2076" /> by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany.  It also secures that income payments from the foundation will not be reckoned for the purpose of computing a child's income for the purposes of a claim made by the parent for the tax allowance for a child.</P>
      <P>This section provides that payments from the German foundation are to be disregarded for all the purposes of the Income Tax Acts.  This will secure that such income will be exempt from income tax and surtax and will not be reckoned as part of the income of a child for the purposes of a claim to child allowance by the father.  The payments will be made from the German foundation which was established under Act of the Parliament of the Federal Republic of Germany on 17th December, 1971.  The monthly payments are to be, we understand, not less than 100 DM, or about £13, and not more than 450 DM, or about £60.  Under existing law a person with no other income would not pay tax on an income of £449, or nearly £38 a month.  The total number of Irish thalidomide claimants was originally about 84 but there were subsequent tentative claims bringing the total number to about 150.</P>
      <P>This provision is being made because, if it were not, Irish families with thalidomide children would find that the benefit accruing to their unfortunate children would be subject to tax.  It should be noted that such payments are not subject to tax in Germany.  It would be invidious if our unfortunate children were put at a disadvantage compared with children in Germany or any other countries where similar payments might be made.  There is nothing in this section affecting any other income to which the children might be entitled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise another matter.  One of my colleagues, Deputy Nolan, wanted to raise it and I suggested that this might be the most appropriate section on which to do it.  The question which is causing some concern is: in a case where a workman is injured and receives a sum in compensation, the sum, or a portion of it, would be assessed in such a way that he could invest it and get an income therefrom to compensate for the loss of earnings which he would not be able to make as a result of the accident.  The problem appears to be that, in such a case, the payment which he receives, is, of course, subject to tax, but he is not entitled to claim an earned income relief in respect of this because it is coming from an investment.  In fact, the investment represents compensation for his loss of earnings.</P>
      <P>If he had been earning he would have been able to claim the earned income relief.  He is unable to earn because he was injured and the compensation fund designed to give him an income in place of what he was earning is taxed fully without any earned income relief.  Deputy Nolan wanted the Minister to consider making provision to ensure that in such cases earned income relief would be granted.  I realise that there are considerable difficulties involved.  Assuming the Minister accepts the principle, primarily, the difficulties would be to distinguish between investment arising in the circumstances I have described and other investments.  This is a valid point which deserves full consideration and I would ask the Minister to give it that consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not unsympathetic to the moral of the argument.  As a lawyer Deputy Colley knows that when settlements are arrived at or when compensation is being awarded, an assessment is made of an injured party's likely loss of income as a consequence of the injury.  In assessing the payment, account is taken of that person's income tax liability in whatever <Col N="2078" /> sum might be awarded.  The Deputy will recall that any actuarial report invariably contains a statement of anticipated earnings, if the worker did not suffer injury, less income tax, and a sum is then calculated as being the appropriate amount.  If this is to carry on its income an income tax liability, this is also deducted.  These figures are taken into account before the figures are struck.  Maybe there are some occasions when people overlook that but the legal and actuarial advisers take account of it.</P>
      <P>As I am sure Deputy Colley appreciates, having had the onerous responsibility of being Minister for Finance, once you entertain compassionate grounds as a reason for not applying a more severe discipline of income tax, once you give a concession on compassionate grounds you open the floodgates. You would end up in a situation in which it would be very hard to distinguish between a person who was unable to work because of an industrial accident, a person who is chronically ill, or a person who was even feigning illness.  That is the difficulty.  It is much better to deal with the situation which Deputy Nolan and Deputy Colley adverted to by ensuring that when compensation is being assessed for an injury full account is taken of potential tax liability and compenstion is increased accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the difficulties mentioned by the Minister. Deputy Nolan did not say to me what I am about to say.  Possibly the problem has arisen because of certain recent legal decisions in regard to the manner in which compensation for loss of earnings is given and the relationship of income tax liability to it.  I must admit that what I am saying is rather vague.  I believe there were certain decisions recently in the Irish courts in this regard but if I get further evidence of this perhaps I could submit it to the Minister.</P>

It is a matter in law exclusively for the commissioners and the commissioners and their staff had to consider the various applicants in competition with each other.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Proceedings for compulsory acquisition were instituted in November, 1959.  The court proceedings were finally concluded by the striking out of an appeal of the owner in October, 1972.  Possession has not yet been handed over.  The Land Commission may have to take further action in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lalor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the proceedings went on for so long was due to the fact that the owner was prepared to avail of every legal subterfuge open to him and his absence from the country compounded the situation because there were adjournments granted to enable him to attend. He got, perhaps, leniency from the tribunals over which the Land Commission would have no control. The Land Commission now will not tolerate any further delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Lands available for letting by the Land Commission are normally offered in lots suitable to the requirements of the local smallholders. The general practice up to now has been to let the lands by auction so that all interested parties can have an opportunity of bidding for the lots in which they are interested.  I have, however, asked the Land Commission to have another look at the system particularly in relation to the needs of small holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is the policy of the Land Commission to let land by public auction, thereby enabling the well-to-do man to acquire such land?  Is there not a <Col N="2086" /> social side to the policy of the Land Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the policy of the Land Commission to set these lands by public auction.  The reason behind that policy is to ensure that the best price is obtained.  However, the policy is not a rigid one and varies from area to area, depending on the estate in question and on the amount of congestion in the area.  In many cases estates are split into lots so as to suit smallholders. I am aware personally, that in many areas local smallholders have got together and have taken entire lots of land at a price satisfactory to them, notwithstanding the policy of the Land Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HughGibbons" hpid="Dr. Gibbons Dr. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister suggest to the Land Commission that in some ways the staff would decide who should be best entitled to those lands and recommend that the lands be let at an economic price?  Eventually, the Land Commission must decide on the person to whom land is to be allotted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the situation in Monaghan, I would be surprised if it should differ from that which obtains anywhere else in the country and that there would not be co-operation on the part of the Land Commission staff in dealing with any situation which would require a divergence from the official policy.  If the Deputy has knowledge of any particular lands which he believes are being set in bulk but which should be set in lots, I have no doubt that the Minister will be sympathetic towards any such case.</P>

Perhaps there is a little selfishness in this, in that someone else might benefit as a result.  The need for commonage is disappearing.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the money provided for land drainage during the past 20 years has remained at approximately £1 million?  Industry in the west is encouraged and is subsidised but a vote of £1 million for 20 years for land drainage is no encouragement for land productivity in that area.  Would the Minister consider this matter and endeavour to ensure that industrial development would be equated with land productivity and that more money be given for land drainage in the west?</P>

May I finally ask the Minister whether in all future cases there will be an immediate effort by our Government on <Col N="2098" /> behalf of our citizens to find out the circumstances of any injury or death caused?  This information should be sought immediately and public protest should be made about these things instead of waiting until the authorities there have killed the matter by the lapse of time.

      <P>In view of the number of tragic deaths of our citizens in Northern Ireland at the hands of a wide variety of people, it is difficult to say what action we would take in any particular circumstances.  Where the death is attributable to the authorities in Northern Ireland, as in this instance, at least there is an authority with which we can deal and from which we can get a response.  In the majority of cases we do not have any authority to refer to and means of acting are very limited.  I am sure Deputy Blaney would wish us to be equally concerned about the deaths of innocent people regardless of who kills them.  In many cases we have no recourse at all.  Where the authorities in the North are involved, we are in a position to take the action which seems appropriate in each case.  But there is a very wide variety of cases in a very complex situation and I cannot give a blanket reply to a rather hypothetical question.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 21 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is co-operating with the other member States of the EEC in the formulation of the Community's policy on relations with Greece and Turkey.  Ireland became a party to the Community's association agreements with these countries, subject to the necessary transitional measures and adjustments, by virtue of Article 108 of the Act concerning the conditions of accession and the adjustments to the treaties.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, because of political developments in Greece, the application of the Community's association agreement with Greece has been &ldquo;frozen&rdquo;. that is, it is confined to routine business on trade matters.  The Deputy will recall that the spokesman of the Commission reaffirmed the Community's position on Greece in the European Parliament on 6th June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidThornlet" hpid="Dr. Thornley Dr. Thornley">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Thornley</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the European Parliament for the moment and a member of the Committee on Relations with Non-Member Countries, may I ask the Minister if he shares my abhorrence of the regimes operating in Greece and Turkey? Could he give me some guidance as to whether in the event of my being invited to visit the said countries I should accept that invitation and in the event of my accepting such invitation and expressing my abhorrence of these regimes, I can expect the backing of the Irish Government?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>The Government's attitude in regard to Greece is wellknown and, indeed, that of the Community. In that debate on 6th June, Sir Christopher Soames on behalf of the Commission made the point that, <Col N="2100" /> as he said, we are further away than ever from a return to democracy in Greece.  On the question of where the Deputy should go for his holidays, I leave it to his conscience but would point out to him the limitations imposed on us by virtue of our being a non-nuclear power in any attempt to protect him if he gets into trouble.</P>

      <P>Mr. George Thomson, the Commissioner for Regional Policy, visited Dublin on 22nd/23rd February, 1973, when he had discussions on Community regional policy with members of the then Government and Opposition.  He had hoped to visit other parts of Ireland, including the west, in July but his visit has been postponed until a later date. The itinerary for this visit has not yet been established.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister state who decides what regions will benefit under the EEC regional policy?  As far as I am aware, it is the national Government.  Also for the record, would he state how much we will get from the regional fund in the current financial year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>One must distinguish between the initial decision as to which areas of the Community are those to which the application of regional policy is appropriate.  That is a decision the Community can make in the light of the views expressed by the Irish Government.  The Deputy will be aware that in relation to a related matter, that of competition policy and State aids, the Community has decided that the whole of Ireland should be a peripheral area and a similar outcome is to be anticipated <Col N="2101" /> in regard to regional policy, I believe.  As regards the provision of funds, it is up to us in this country to seek the support and assistance of the regional fund for projects and as the whole country is a peripheral region for the purposes of the fund, those projects could be in any part of the country but the policy of the Government is to seek particularly the development of the west and north-west and, therefore, the bulk of applications will probably relate to those regions.  It is a matter for us to put forward projects and seek assistance from the fund when established.  As regards the amount of money this year, the fund has not yet been established. The Deputy will know that the European Commission met yesterday and, according to newspaper reports, took a decision on proposals to be put forward to the Council of Ministers. I am not yet aware what these proposals are; they will come up for decision by the Council later this year.  The policy will be put into effect, as I understand it, on 1st January next so that within the present calendar year there will be no assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Was this not discussed at the Council of Ministers' meeting last Monday?  There has been a good deal of press speculation about Ireland not getting a fair share of this fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Deputy is confused about this.  What happened was that on the occasion when the Council was meeting Press reports in this country suggested that a proposal being put to the Commission on Wednesday after the Council meeting would be in some way unfavourable to Ireland.  I was in Brussels at the time and thought it proper to issue a Press statement making quite clear in advance of the Commission's meeting what the Irish attitude would be, should there be any truth in the Press reports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seemed to me that that should be made clear, even in advance of the Commission meeting.  The Council itself was not dealing with this problem in any form.  It dealt with related matters <Col N="2102" /> of the social fund and agricultural fund but not this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether it is now clear that, whatever may be the decision in regard to the amount of money from the fund, it will come to this country through the Government agencies?  Does the Minister's statement mean that there will be no more emphasis on the development in the west and north-west relative to the more prosperous parts of the country in the past?  What I want to know is whether the Minister's Government, with the aid of the moneys which may come from the regional funds of the EEC, will give greater emphasis to the development in the west and north-west than has heretofore been accorded to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt at all about the desirability of the Commissioner and other officials visiting the west and the north-west.  There are two stages in this, however.  The first is to decide on the size of the fund and the share coming to the region which in our case is the whole of the country.  Secondly, it is a matter for us then to apply for assistance from the fund within any limits that may be set.  There may be no limits set for this country but it will be a matter for us to ensure that those applications are designed primarily <Col N="2103" /> for the benefit of the west and north-west. With a view to ensuring a fuller understanding by the Commission of the need for favourable response to these kind of applications, we would regard it as important that the Commissioner and his officials should be familiar with the conditions in the west and north-west.  Indeed, some of those officials have already been in those areas.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for decision.  There are three factors.  One is the projects which arise in these areas, the proposals put forward by people in these areas for work to be done there that would be beneficial and give employment; secondly, the support of the Government of the day for those projects and, thirdly, the decision of the European Community institutions as to the value of particular projects.  All these three elements are necessary and I stress that because it would be unfortunate if the impression got around that the people in the west and north-west can sit back and wait for the money to come.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the kind of supranational <Col N="2104" /> institution which he envisages will deal with monetary union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The existing Community committees in the economic and monetary field are the Monetary Committee, the Short-term Economic Policy Committee, the Medium-term Economic Policy Committee, the Budgetary Policy Committee and the Committee of Central Bank Governors.</P>
      <P>A decision has recently been taken to create a European Monetary Co-operation Fund which will have the task of contributing to the progressive establishment of economic and monetary union between the member States. There has also been created this month a group, representative of the member States and the Commission, to assist the Committee of Permanent Representatives in its work of preparing the consideration by the Council of the move to the second stage of economic and monetary union.  This is not a permanent Community body but rather an <i>ad hoc</i> one established in response to the need to take into consideration the inter-relationship between all relevant elements including, of course, social policy, regional policy, industrial policy and so on in moving to the second stage.</P>
      <P>Progress towards economic and monetary union has been a priority of the community since the meeting of heads of State or Government in Paris in October, 1972.</P>
      <P>The Community is at present considering concrete measures for passage to the second stage of the union on the basis of a communication from the Commission. It is, as yet, too early to say what institutions or bodies in the monetary field, supranational or otherwise, may be necessary, in addition to those I have mentioned, to bring about economic and monetary union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be made clear, however, that, in the view of the Government, a substantial modification of the present institutional arrangements of the communities, involving the introduction of effective democratic control by a directly-elected European parliament, is an essential prerequisite <Col N="2105" /> of the establishment of a full economic and monetary union.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply looks full but it does not really answer my question. My question arises out of the statement in the Minister's Estimate speech when he said that a supranational body would have to be established to control the fund.  Is this 6th of April committee which was established relevant at all to total monetary union?  The Minister in his Estimate speech referred to the hazards of the common agricultural policy because no system on fixed parities had been settled upon and I cannot see any progress in that so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not quite clear what I have not answered.  There are two separate items here.  One is the technical institutions required to implement economic and monetary union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the supranational institution I am concerned about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>All of these institutions are part of the supranational institution of the EEC although some of them, which are committees of representatives of governments, are more inter-governmental than supranational. But the institutions which are committees of the Community itself are supranational in character.  I think that what the Deputy may have in mind, although I cannot trace the reference immediately, is the concern I expressed in my speech that if we were to move towards economic and monetary union there should be full democratic control of these institutions which does not now exist.  The last paragraph of my reply reiterated that in the most forthright and specific terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister then depend upon the European Parliament solely for such control?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that that would be a fair inference.  The first thing is to achieve democratic control by a directly elected European Parliament but to achieve that in a relationship to the other institutions.  The relationship between Parliament and the other institutions will thereby be modified and their rules will be modified. It is not simply a question of Parliament itself.  I do not think that <Col N="2106" /> any of us at this stage have a clear view as to what is the best way to tackle this problem.  It is something which concerns the Government and the Government is consulting other governments about it with a view to seeing how this problem can best be tackled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think that one of the strong Members of the EEC, France, would agree to the establishment of a supranational body to promote monetary union?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot speak for the French Government but this Government would not be able to agree to a full monetary union of the kind that has been spoken of unless there was full democratic control of the institutions. I believe that this is clearly understood by other governments.  It is something that will be thought out in the years ahead between us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 28 and 29 together.</P>
      <P>The number of recorded complaints about the telephone service&mdash; written and oral&mdash;received by the Department in the three months to 30th June last was 5,000 approximately. This figure does not include fault reports, requests for assistance in connection with service difficulties, <i>et cetera</i>, unless the person concerned made a specific complaint.</P>
      <P>Each complaint is investigated with a view to prompt remedial action where possible.  It is replied to by letter or in certain cases dealt with by telephone or by interviewing the person concerned.  The matters which give rise to subscriber complaint, for example, delays in answering by exchanges, difficulties in making calls over the STD system, the incidence of faults in the larger exchanges, are monitored more or less continuously on a sampling basis and the information obtained is analysed quarterly in order to identify the causes and extent of difficulties affecting the service. The main result of these analyses in relation to the present quality of service may be stated briefly as emphasising the need for extra equipment, trunk lines and other facilities on an extensive scale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2108" /> I am very conscious of the need to improve the service.  I stated in reply to the Estimate debate that equipment to the value of over £25 million was already on order.  Much of this is in course of being installed in exchanges in Dublin and elsewhere, more is in course of manufacture. Further substantial orders are being placed and various development schemes are in advanced planning stages.  The telephone system is at present under considerable strain because of mounting demands being made on it.  The position will be relieved according as the additional equipment is brought into service. Plans to cater for further necessary improvements and developments over the next few years are in preparation and I shall give full details when the new Telephone Capital Bill is introduced in the autumn.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in my reply to the Estimate debate, many of the present difficulties are due to past under-capitalisation and, in particular, to stringent cuts in the capital provision made in the year 1970-71.  The then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs rightly pointed out at that time that the damaging effects of these cuts would be felt in the telephone service for years to come, and they are being felt now.  My Department are making every effort to improve the situation.  As telephone development is essentially a matter of good advanced planning it takes some time for the effect of decisions, good or bad, to be reflected in the standard of service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>In rural areas kiosks are provided only in replacement of public call-offices in sub-post offices which are used to a fair extent. The order of priority of places to be included in the annual kiosk programme is determined by the use made of the call-office in each case, as indicated by the receipts.  In areas close to cities, towns and other centres which already have kiosks, it is the practice not to provide extra kiosks unless they are likely to be used sufficiently to cover fully the annual costs involved. In assessing the prospects of this condition being met, account is taken of such factors as distance from existing kiosks, the number of private telephones and rented public coinboxes in the area, the number and kind of houses in the area <i>et cetera</i>.  Exceptionally, kiosks may be provided, in advance of the stage where they are likely to pay their way, in new housing estates where there are prospects of extensive development.

I should like to make the Minister aware of that fact and I would ask him if he would consider making further arrangements.  It takes approximately two hours to call any of the major cities from Ballinamore.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Dr. Cruise-O'Brien Dr. Cruise-O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand there was serious delay in trunk calls to and from Ballinamore up to the end of June last.  This was due mainly to a temporary shortage of switchboards <Col N="2113" /> and trunk outlets at Carrick-on-Shannon, the trunk control exchange for the area.  Nine additional switchboards were brought into service in Carrick-on-Shannon on 29th June which brought the total number of switchboards to 23.  There is still some slight delay.  This is my official information but I am, of course, quite prepared to consider representations from the Deputy on calls to and from Ballinamore during peak traffic periods.</P>
      <P>Three extra Carrick-on-Shannon/ Ballinamore circuits are expected to be provided about the end of the year. The provision of further circuits will require a major cabling scheme in the area.  Unfortunately, at this stage I cannot give the Deputy any reliable estimate as to when this can be undertaken. Representations on this matter have been received and met to a very considerable extent.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That section 18 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister said before Question Time that he was sympathetic to the proposal which I discussed with my colleague, the shadow Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley.  Some time ago I submitted a question to you, Sir, on this point and you said that it would be better to leave it until the Finance Bill was being discussed in the House. I accepted your ruling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All sides of the House are sympathetic <Col N="2114" /> to those who are physically or mentally handicapped either from birth or as a result of an accident. We know that accidents happened ten or 15 years ago and people were awarded a certain sum of money.  I am not a lawyer, but I presume the decision of the court was that this sum of money invested would give to the person an income per week which would be equal to what his pay was prior to his injury.  Unfortunately, under our income tax code a person who has money invested and gets interest on it, does not get the equivalent of what an employee gets by way of earned income relief.  He pays the full rate of unearned income tax on the interest of the investment.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a lawyer and he has the back-up staff to do what I am asking him to do which is to give to those people earned income relief.  The courts decided that the interest on the money invested would be the income of the person who was injured.  I want the income tax code to be amended so that this person will qualify for something similar to earned income relief.  It is earned income because the person was injured at work through no fault of his own.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that the Minister is sympathetic to this.  He was not sympathetic to a lot of things which were said in the House over the past few days but just before Question Time, he said he was sympathetic towards this.  I do not want him to say that he will amend the Finance Bill now, but I hope that in the future he will sympathetically consider these people and give to the handicapped, some of them in wheelchairs as a result of injuries, a similar concession to the concession workers get in earned income relief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Nolan said that I had not been sympathetic to some cases made in the House in the past few days.  He will realise that that was because I did not consider that they had merit.  I am sympathetic towards meritorious claims.  I explained before Question Time that, where compensation was paid to people in respect of injuries received <Col N="2115" /> in industrial accidents, such compensation ought to take into account the appropriate income tax liability and, in fact, does in most cases, unless the legal advisers or the actuarial advisers were lacking in professional skill.</P>
      <P>In all cases where there is an assessment of loss, the assessment takes into account income tax liability on earnings if the person continues to work, and on income if the person does not continue to work but receives a capital sum.  It is important to bear that in mind because a certain amount of emotion can develop understandably around a person who receives a capital sum, but it should be borne in mind that the capital sum, if paid in compensation, ought to have taken into account income tax liability thereafter.</P>
      <P>I mention that as a first consideration which has to be borne in mind before you would consider any relief. The difficulty in giving relief is a difficulty which I am sure Deputy Colley will understand.  If you give relief on compassionate grounds for one ailment or disadvantage, you may well open the floodgates to demands for compassionate treatment on many grounds, some of which would be worthy, but others of which could well be fabricated. I do not think any Member of this House would want to make it easy for people to avoid making their proper tax contribution on the basis of a fabricated claim.  I am not suggesting that this is so in relation to the claims which Deputy Nolan has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In summary, what I said before Question Time was that I am sympathetic to the idea that the disadvantaged should not be treated in the same way as income earners.  I am also sympathetic to the idea that the disadvantaged should not be treated in the same way as people of substantial wealth who need never work because they have sufficient income from their capital.  Finding a remedy for this is fraught with many difficulties.  I want to assure the House that I will endeavour to overcome these difficulties, but we must be terribly careful that, as we try to alleviate the hardship of the kind of <Col N="2116" /> case Deputy Nolan has in mind, we do not open the floodgates to those people who are experts in using every loophole in the tax law to make immense gains for people of substantial wealth.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nolan, Deputy Colley and the rest of the House can be assured that we are in agreement on the principle and, if I can find some way to meet it, I will certainly put it into operation.  I am deliberately pointing out that the cure is not an easy one to find.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  This point has come to a head now because of the fact that 20 years ago somebody was injured in a workshop, a quarry, or somewhere else, and a capital sum was allowed to him.  He was advised that it was sufficient to provide for his wife, his family, and himself, for his lifetime. We all know about inflation, and the interest he is now receiving does not compare with its value 20 years ago.  I want him to get some relief.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has said he will consider it sympathetically and try to find a way around it.  Anything the Minister does for the handicapped, the poor, or the sick, involves difficulties. Take the case of the free television licences and the free travel. People are availing of these schemes who were not intended to when they were originally introduced.  The same will happen when the Minister introduces a regulation, I hope, to give some sort of relief to the people I am talking about.  Due to the hardship involved and the concession the Minister would be giving to the handicapped, if a few people got in who should not have got in, I would not have any objection, and I am sure the Minister would not.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this section is to grant to the bodies mentioned <Col N="2117" /> in this section the same exemption from income tax as is granted to charities.  Bodies of persons or trusts established for a charitable purpose only are entitled to exemption from income tax on income from dividends, interest and annuities in so far as such incomes are applicable and applied to charitable purposes only. This exemption would now apply to the income of the bodies mentioned in the section.  In certain circumstances the profits of a trade carried on by charities may also be exempted from income tax under section 334, but it is unlikely that bodies of the kind contemplated will be carrying on a trade.  Technically, a trade could be held to exist if they engaged in the sale of literature and made a profit from this activity, but in the light of their objectives it is not expected that such sales would be at a price which would give rise to chargeable profits.  This section is linked with section 14, as I mentioned earlier, which provides for the recognition for income tax purposes of covenanted subscriptions by persons to bodies which have consultative status with the United Nations or the Council of Europe.</P>

At the moment I understand that beneficiaries of the covenanting procedures are substantially educational bodies; there are certain others but many of them are educational bodies.

      <P>I did mention this <Col N="2118" /> morning that I personally had not read the constitution of Gorta and, therefore, I would not like to express a view upon it.  I do not know whether Gorta has consultative status with these international organisations, but the House can be assured that this will be interpreted in the most liberal fashion.  It may well be that Gorta would be entitled to consultative status but has not yet applied for it. It may have; I do not know, but in order to ensure that no spurious organisation claiming to serve the cause of human rights should receive relief, we have felt it desirable that the safeguard of acceptability to an international organisation ought to be built in.  This is desirable not only from the point of view of ensuring that no spurious organisations are involved but also in order to ensure that international organisations would also see that Ireland is taking active steps to subscribe to and implement the principles contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention.</P>

    <P>Section 20 permits a deduction in computing the profits of a trade in respect of the payment made by a trader to an Irish university for the purpose of enabling it to establish a chair or to promote research in marketing or industrial relations or other approved subjects.  It has been represented that a deduction should also be permitted where a like payment is made out of the profits of a profession.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out, this section enables a person carrying on a trade, with the addition now of a profession, to claim a deduction in computing profits for tax purposes in respect of any payment by him to an Irish university for the purpose of enabling him to establish a chair or to promote research in marketing, industrial relations or subjects approved by the Minister for Finance.  I would suggest that the terms of the section are too narrow and that the Minister might consider extending its scope to include all institutions of higher education.  If he were to do this, he would make a very worthwhile contribution to Irish education through ensuring further and more rapid development of the technical and technological side of education.  This would very considerably help us to achieve the aims we have in relation to education, that is, to secure a better balance in our educational system.  If this were to be done, it would be very much to the benefit of the individual student and the community as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I also suggest that the terms of the section should relate to any moneys made available for educational purposes?  I believe that if this were done industrialists would contribute much more than they do to the development of educational projects. I think it is worthy of comment that the sums of money being made available for sporting events are huge in comparison with the rather puny amounts of money made available by industrialists and others for educational <Col N="2120" /> purposes.  I appreciate that firms make money available in these circumstances for advertising purposes, and they might feel they would not gain the same value from promoting educational projects as from financing sporting fixtures.  However, it is not beyond the ingenuity of man to devise a system whereby they would get the type of return they require. If, on top of this, they got a worthwhile taxation concession, I believe this would tilt the scale in favour of educational projects.  This would have a most beneficial effect on the whole cultural and economic development of the community.  Those who are not closely involved in educational matters might feel that, considering the huge sums spent on education over the past few years by the State, a few thousand pounds from outside sources would make little difference. The facts are, of course, that despite the very large sum being made available by the State there are areas of the educational field, very worthwhile in themselves, which for one reason or another are low on the priority list and which would benefit greatly from such a system.</P>

      <P>Deputy Faulkner has been relating his remarks to the section.  I am anxious to ascertain whether the amendment is accepted.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 20 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>On the section, would the Minister confirm that the phrase in subsection (1) (a) &ldquo;Irish university&rdquo; means a university anywhere in Ireland, North or South?  I take it that is what is meant.  I would also like to ask whether the wording of subsection (1) (a), which refers to a sum for the purpose of enabling the university to undertake research would include the kind of operation which is quite frequent where a university gives a grant to an individual to carry out certain types of research. The wording of the section seems to confine it to the university undertaking <Col N="2121" /> research.  Does that include a university undertaking research by way of a grant to an individual to carry out that particular kind of research?</P>
      <P>In regard to subsection (2) (c), which is a wise provision allowing for the inclusion in the benefits of this section any other subject than those mentioned which is approved for the purposes of the section by the Minister for Finance, I should like to inquire in that regard whether there are any criteria which should be applied by the Minister for Finance in approving a subject?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is so drawn that if provision is made for a Chair in any university on this island it will carry the appropriate benefit so that both Queen's University, Belfast, and the new University of Ulster would both gain if Chairs were to be established as a result of contributions envisaged by this section.</P>
      <P>In relation to any future proposed donations we are providing that the Minister for Finance of the day would have the right to adjudicate upon whether or not they should get this tax concession.  This is the most appropriate way of dealing with it although it does impose upon the Minister of the day&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the personal difficulty of having to make a decision and, perhaps, bringing on himself criticism because he failed to give a concession for a project which the proposers considered to be a worthy one.  I share Deputy Faulkner's anxiety that this should be interpreted as liberally as possible. Having regard to the fact that the tax burden is about one-third, at the most half, of possible tax liability, people are unlikely to be enticed into giving donations for educational purposes when the ultimate consequence is that they still have to meet two-thirds or half of the cost, the balance being carried by the Exchequer. I am aware that many useful contributions have been made in <Col N="2122" /> the field of education and scientific research in recent times which might not have been made if the fiscal incentive was not there and society has benefited as a consequence because sometimes if you do not give the fiscal incentive the only alternative assistance you can give is a 100 per cent charge at the expense of the Exchequer.  I would hope that this would be liberally and generously interpreted.  I do not think it will lead to any extravagance because universities are unlikely to take unto themselves the responsibility of establishing Chairs and disciplines in their own universities simply for the fun of it and because some wealthy <i>entrepreneur</i> wants to spend money to advertise himself.  As Deputy Faulkner said, there appears to be more money spent on the promotion of sport because it attracts the attention of hundreds of thousands of people who attend the sports events together with a greater number who might be looking in on television.</P>
      <P>I would hope that this small relaxation might lead to a situation in which we would have some new Chairs established in our universities which would be in keeping with the demand of the 20th century because, without in any way diminishing the immense and continuing contribution which must be made to our human welfare by some of the humanities, I think the time has come to encourage universities and people who can benefit from university education through their own economic activity to make contributions towards university education and research.  That is the whole purpose of this amendment and if it is sensibly used by myself, as long as I hold the office of Minister for Finance, and by my successors, I am sure considerable benefit will accrue to the universities, to their students, to industry and to education generally with the least possible expense to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>(<i>Dublin Central</i>): I think other useful research could and should be carried out.  I would like to see traders and industrialists promoting research into drugs, alcoholism, <i>et cetera</i>.  This is something to which business people could contribute. Recently one company contributed a substantial amount for research into alcoholism.  This should be encouraged. Nobody wants to promote alcoholism. There is no concession given here to a company or trader who contributes in this way.</P>
      <P>There is also the question of drugs. I am sure there are people who are genuinely interested in the carrying out of research which might enable us to find a way of overcoming the problems of the increasing use of drugs.  Therefore, I suggest that we broaden the scope of the section.  Contributions made to a hospital, for instance, might be as important or more important than contributions to a university. Research of this nature would benefit our society as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the section. It is not before time that people who have extensive business interests and who have never thought of subsidising projects of this nature, were reminded and encouraged to do so.  I refer in particular to companies who have large business interests in Ireland and in other countries but who have aided educational projects in other countries only.  Some years ago, in a trade union context in which I was involved.  I spoke rather severely on this question because it seemed to me that the promotion of educational research was being confined to strong economic units, to places where it would have the greatest impact by way of advertising, <i>et cetera</i>.  Therefore, if this section results in giving a prod to companies of the type I have in mind, it will have done a good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2124" /> I am wondering how comprehensive is the term &ldquo;trader&rdquo; as used in the Bill.  Would it cover our own semi-State companies?  How many of these companies are paying tax?  I agree with what Deputy Faulkner said, that is, that most contributions of the type we have in mind seem to be directed towards sport.  I suppose it is a reflection on our society that companies see in sport the best means possible of advertising their products and that, consequently they invest in horse racing or golfing for example.</P>
    <P>What Deputy Fitzpatrick said is important.  I would suggest extending the facility to cover places of education other than the universities, for instance, places of education for the mentally or physically handicapped and where much research must be carried out so that the results of activities in other countries can be co-ordinated and applied at home.  It might be possible to extend it beyond the mere field of the universities&mdash; not that I am complaining in that regard because the more research we can have in those institutions the better.  I would like the Minister to answer my question in relation to semi-State bodies which, laudably enough, have realised in recent years that the promotion of science projects is important.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some semi-State bodies engage in trade: for example, the ESB, CIE and Aer Lingus and, consequently, would qualify under this provision.  Bord Fáilte do not engage in trade and, so, would not be covered.  I accept the criticism that it applies only to universities but I am not saying that this is the last word on this.  The provision is an innovation and a worthwhile one.  It comes at the behest of a number of organisations and commercial enterprises who indicated a readiness to provide money to found new Chairs and courses.  If other proposals arise which we consider to be worthwhile, we can deal with them, if possible, within the ambit of this legislation&mdash; that would apply only to universities&mdash; but if they should arise in relation to other institutions of higher learning it will also be desirable to extend the <Col N="2125" /> provision to cover them.  However, we ought to crawl before we run and that is what we are doing here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very good research unit at St. Patrick's Training College.  That is the type of institution that could be helped by a provision such as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not opposed to that concept but at the moment we are dealing with the universities.  We are acting here in response to a number of proposals that have been put forward and if we hear of any worthwhile offer being made to any other institution, we can make provision to deal with it but I do not think there would be any great loss if we had to wait another 12 months to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the necessity for extending the provisions in 12 months time or so, could be overcome by his inserting some such phrase as &ldquo;Irish third level educational institutions&rdquo; rather than the phrase &ldquo;an Irish university&rdquo;?  The institute I have in mind primarily is that at Limerick which is analogous to a university and which is a modern concept of a university. It seems strange that such an institution and, indeed, the research unit at St. Patrick's Training College should be excluded when the universities, in the old sense of the word, are included.  I do not consider it logical to pick out a certain section of our third level educational institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the views expressed by other speakers on this side of the House and also to advocate that the provisions be extended to cover, for instance, the dairy research centre at Moore Park in County Cork where work of great importance is being carried out in relation to the dairy industry.  Like many other research institutions, they are suffering from a chronic lack of money and, consequently, are curtailed to a certain degree in their work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I suggest that the Minister extend the facility to cover any <Col N="2126" /> body engaged seriously in research that is to the benefit of the country. We would be utilising to the maximum capacity the excellent staff at Moore Park if we could help them in this way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason why I suggested that it might be worth while considering the inclusion of third level institutions other than the universities was because there is a serious imbalance in our educational system. Basically, this is because of historical reasons.  It is heavily weighted towards the academic side of education while in other countries in the European Economic Community it is heavily weighted in favour of the technical side of education.  The Minister has said that the monetary aspect of this section might not prove to be exceptionally attractive.  Nevertheless, if he were to include the other third level institutions, many of which deal with the technological and technical side of education, it would have a very worthwhile psychological effect and would give a considerable boost to the efforts that have been made to correct the imbalance in our educational system.  This would prove advantageous to the general educational situation and particularly to economic development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should briefly explain that there is no statutory recognition of third level education.  There is a statutory recognition and understanding and formula for university education.  So, we are making a beginning this year.  To date no proposals have been brought to the notice of my Department indicating an anxiety on anybody's part to make a contribution towards research in any of the other excellent institutions that have been mentioned here today.  I would give this personal assurance to the House: if we get some proposals affecting these other institutions, we will take a look at them and we will be only too happy between now and next year's Finance Bill to take whatever remedial measures might be necessary to give life to any such proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, apparently even the seed has not been sown yet for this.  I <Col N="2127" /> regard all these suggestions as being worthy.  If the seed is sown now, the plant can come over the ground next year and we will be ready by next year's Finance Bill to provide the sunshine in which the plant can ripen to fruition.  I accept what has been said.  Let those who have these good ideas generate the same ideas amongst those who may be benevolent towards the institutions they have in mind.</P>

In passing, may I suggest to the Minister that what he has just heard from this side of the House is merely a short preview of the headaches in store for himself and his successors under sub-section (2) (c)?  I want to reiterate a point that was lost sight of in the course of the discussion.  I asked the Minister whether he could say that the wording in subsection (1) (a) relating to any sum paid to a university to undertake research would be deemed to cover the case where a university made a grant to an individual or group of individuals to undertake certain aspects of research; whether that would mean that the university was undertaking the research.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

In proceedings, under section 131 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, for the recovery of an amount of tax, a certificate signed by an officer of the Revenue Commissioners stating that a certain amount of tax is due and payable by a defendant is accepted as evidence, until the contrary is proved, that the stated amount is due and payable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is to cover the situation in which somebody fails to make a return.  Obviously, the only way in which the Revenue Commissioners can in such circumstances secure an order of the court is to provide an estimate.  The effect of this would be that if a person is avoiding payment of tax and receives an estimate in excess of his liability, the defaulter is more likely then to present the true account and as a result of that the estimate can be put aside in favour of the actual figure, but unless we have this it means that many people can avoid meeting their responsibilities until proof can be produced as to what the actual liability is.</P>

      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 22 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the legislation contained in the section is the prevention of the abuse of the income tax relief available in respect of life insurance premiums on short-term policies.  The insurance policy normally met with is an endowment policy, that is, one securing the payment of a capital sum at the expiration of a fixed term of years or at death should that occur previously. Such policies are a combination of <Col N="2130" /> investment and insurance against risk. In policies running for long terms the risk element predominates but where the insurance matures at the end of a short period the cost of the risk insurance, particularly for young lives, is relatively small and the greater proportion of the premium is really an investment or saving.  The broad effect of the section is to deny income tax relief in respect of premiums on policies taken out on or after budget day for a period of less than ten years.  Subsection (1) applies the new provisions to endowment policies taken out on or after budget day and to policies issued before that date if they are altered after that date to increase the benefits or to extend the term of the insurance.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) defines an endowment policy to which the new provisions are to apply.  It excludes from the new provisions industrial assurance business which does not lend itself to the abuses which the new provisions are designed to eliminate.  Sub-section (3) provides, in effect, that income tax relief will not be given in respect of premiums unless the policies are qualifying policies within the meaning of the First Schedule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could explain the position in regard to policies taken out by purchasers of dwellinghouses.  A person purchasing or erecting a dwellinghouse may take out a policy on himself to cover a period while paying off his mortgage.  He may want to protect his widow or dependants should he die.  The policy proceeds would help to pay off the mortgage or debt on his house.  Will a person taking out such a policy be entitled to income tax relief?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The section is only concerned with policies of a lesser life than ten years.  The kind of policy the Deputy has in mind would usually be for life or for the period of the mortgage and if the mortgage were over ten years the policy would be in no way disadvantaged by this section.  What we are anxious to curb is the kind of policies generated recently by financial institutions <Col N="2131" /> which had an insignificant risk element.  They were available to people of considerable wealth who could use them and it was used as a form of tax avoidance.  The genuine policy-holder who takes out a longterm policy to cover genuine risks will suffer no disadvantage as a result of this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with this section but I would like to ask one question.  Very often older people are not able to get life insurance, perhaps, for longer than ten years.  They may be trying to provide something for their death.  For instance, a person aged 61 might find that no insurance company would give a policy maturing at over age 70.  This would cause a certain amount of difficulty.  Does the Minister envisage any way out for such people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesBMcDonald" hpid="Mr. McDonald Mr. McDonald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McDonald</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister clarify the First Schedule under the heading (c) which states that the total amount of premiums payable under the policy in any period of 12 months must not exceed (1) &ldquo;twice the total amount of the premiums payable in any other such period....&rdquo;  Is the Minister just ensuring that these policies will apply to ordinary people who will pay a regular contribution? Further down under (d) it is provided that the policy must guarantee that the capital sum payable on death will be equal to three-fourths at least of the total premiums, <i>et cetera</i>.  Looking at the capital growth rate and what some companies especially foreign companies, offer&mdash;capital gains up to 40 per cent and so on&mdash;does the Minister think that a guarantee of three-fourths is adequate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is.  I am alert to the dangers the Deputy has in mind but I am certain that we have constructed this so that the genuine policy-holder who takes out a policy against genuine risks has nothing to fear.  This has the effect of closing off the kind of investment advantage that was being taken and which had very little to do with insurance as such but was purely a system of acquiring <Col N="2132" /> capital.  I am not unmindful of the point Deputy Crowley raises.  It is difficult to provide some scheme to cover such cases.  I can see there are occasions when elderly people are in difficulty in getting a genuine life insurance when they want to provide themselves with some protection.  One could possibly draft an amendment to provide that these restrictions would not apply where an insurance policy was taken out to cover the life of a person over the age of 56.  There are great difficulties in trying to adjust this but my mind is not closed to the Deputy's point.</P>

      <P>I should like to make clear that we certainly support the principle behind this section.  I am aware that certain financial institutions were availing themselves of a loophole in the law and if they had been allowed to continue it would distort very substantially the whole structure of financial institutions.  It is, therefore, necessary to have a section on these lines.  Nevertheless I think Deputy Crowley's point is important.  I suggest that the kind of problem he has envisaged could occur where a farmer was taking out insurance to assist him in meeting possible death duties.  In such a case the man concerned could be relatively elderly and would run into the difficulty we are considering here.  I do not think the Minister can at this stage&mdash;if he can, well and good&mdash;produce an appropriate amendment, but if he can produce any amendment that would go some way to guard against the dangers envisaged so much the better. Perhaps the Minister would assure the House that he will keep an eye on developments that arise as a result of the enactment of this section and, if <Col N="2133" /> necessary, bring in amendments to this Bill without waiting for next year's Finance Bill if the kind of dangers that are mentioned here should appear to be looming up and that this section is not satisfactory in dealing with them.</P>

      <P>The Opposition are in a more generous and kindly mood now than they were in last night and if they would accept an oral suggestion from me we might be able to provide for this now.  I should like to provide for it.  I would suggest that on page 12, line 37, the first line of section 22, we could meet the point by inserting the words &ldquo;made on the life of a person under the age of fifty-six years&rdquo; after the words &ldquo;This section applies to any policy of life insurance...&rdquo; Thereafter the section would read as it stands at the moment.</P>
      <P>This would have the effect of offering the protection against the genuine policies taken out by senior citizens to cover the kind of eventuality in relation to old age, estate duty and so forth.  Of course, with the likely replacement of estate duty in the not too distant future, this becomes less of a need than heretofore.</P>

      <P>The Minister is now four months in office and he must have experience, as a result of being in office for that period, of how world trade is promoted.  He is suggesting in this section that we, in Ireland, should give a lead to the world in the promotion of trade in such a way as is not done in the United States, Japan and Western Germany.  I have a feeling that this section might interfere with the expansion of our business potential.

      <P>As far as this side of the House is concerned we support <Col N="2135" /> the idea behind this section.  Any action which can be taken to prevent tax avoidance, although it is almost close to tax evasion that is involved here, and without at the same time creating injustice or unnecessary difficulties will have the support of this side of the House.  A certain amount of clarification may be required and I would ask the Minister does he not consider that there may be a certain lack of definition in regard to the proposed rules regarding expenses such as entertainment.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that under Schedule E the rule which governs expenses necessarily incurred for salary employment would not of itself extend naturally and without any amendment, to expenses necessarily incurred for a business under Schedule D.  We cannot just transfer the rule from one to the other.  I assume that some thought has been given to this by the Revenue Commissioners and presumably some advice has been offered to the Minister as to how it is proposed to implement this section in practice.  The House would appreciate if the Minister would elaborate on what is envisaged as to how this section is to operate.</P>

      <P>The present code uses the words &ldquo;wholly and exclusively&rdquo; and the word which we are now seeking to import is &ldquo;necessarily&rdquo;. The purpose of the section is to strengthen the powers of the inspectors of taxes in dealing with tax avoidance by way of claiming as business expenses rather lavish entertainment of business customers or allegedly potential customers.  We ought to realise that a great amount of so-called business entertainment is being conducted at the expense of the general taxpayer because it would not be on as lavish a scale as it is if the provider of it was not comforted by the fact that half of his bill will be borne by the general taxpayer because he will not have to pay tax on it; it does not seem to me socially justifiable that those with wealth should be able to entertain themselves and their friends lavishly at only half cost to themselves leaving the unfortunate pool of taxpayers to make up the loss in taxation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Carter referred to the possibility of having a differential between entertainment spent on natives and that spent on foreigners.  Legislation was introduced in Britain in 1965 to the effect that no deduction whatever would be given for expenditure on business entertainment, including hospitality of any kind, except, subject to certain conditions, entertainment of overseas customers.  I suspect this is the kind of case Deputy Carter has in mind.  The legislation being introduced here is not as restrictive as that of Britain in so far as it does not seek to disallow completely expenditure on business entertainment. In Britain, all home business entertainment is excluded.  What we are proposing to do is to apply an additional test, namely, that the entertainment expenditure was incurred, not only wholly and exclusively, which is the test under existing law, but also &ldquo;necessarily&rdquo; for the purpose of the trade.  In any case of disagreement as to whether or not expenditure is necessarily incurred for the purpose of the trade there will be the usual right of appeal to the appeal commissioners and to the court.  The legislation, I might add, will have effect only from 16th May onwards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2137" /> A certain worry arises in the minds of Deputies because of the rather tight way in which the word &ldquo;necessarily&rdquo; has been interpreted under Schedule E, but the two interpretations are not comparable.  The disadvantages of &ldquo;necessarily&rdquo; under Schedule E are that they are related not so much with the word &ldquo;necessarily&rdquo; as with the words &ldquo;in the performance of the said duties&rdquo;&mdash;of the employment.  The most restrictive element in the Schedule E rule is the fact that the expenses must be incurred in the performance of duties.  It may be necessary for an employee to incur many expenses for the purpose of his employment which did not arise in the course of the employment&mdash;for instance, travelling to work, the use of a phone, the purchase of technical journals, indeed the very garments he wears.  But if these expenses are not incurred in the performance of the duties, relief is not allowed.</P>
    <P>The concept under Schedule D which we are now dealing with is different. Here the test is that the expenditure be wholly and exclusively laid out or expended for the purpose of the trade or profession.  The criterion is whether the expense is for the benefit of the business and this is determined by the principles of ordinary commercial trading and practice.  This is in contrast to an employment where the duties are prescribed by the employer.  What is laid out for the purposes of the trade is very wide and what section 23 proposes is that an expenditure on entertainment must be necessarily laid out for the purposes of the trade.  Of all the expenditure incurred in the carrying on of a trade only that relating to entertainment is being subjected to the new test, the objective being to impose some curb on the allowance for tax purposes of rather lavish sums claimed under this heading, which could not really be justified as expenditure warranted for the purpose of maintaining or expanding business.  I can understand the anxiety of Deputies about an unduly restrictive use of this which could damage business prospects either in relation to the maintenance of existing business or the possibility of getting new opportunities, but I think <Col N="2138" /> the wording we have used and the way in which the Revenue Commissioners will use it will not work in the way in which Deputies may fear.</P>
    <P>Some arguments have been advanced, not here but elsewhere, that this would inhibit the giving of Christmas candles&mdash;not, indeed, that there are that many given nowadays by traders, but there are other benefits of a small kind which might not be allowed.  The Revenue Commissioners operate the old principle of not being bothered with things which are <i>de minimis</i> and it would not be worth their while to chase after the Christmas candles, the box of cigars, or anything else that might be given to show goodwill.  Quite clearly, however, where, and many cases of this have come to light, many hundreds and thousands of pounds are spent in providing &ldquo;entertainment&rdquo; I think the time has come to curb expenditure of that kind and I gather from what the Deputies opposite said they are not in disagreement with us in our effort to curb extravagance in this field, an extravagance which in many cases is not related to the genuine promotion of business.  I accept all the worries of Members opposite.  These things have concerned me for some time past, but I think we have arrived at a formula.</P>

      <P>As the House is probably aware, I spent many years as a full-time commercial traveller and I am well aware of what business expenses are and I am well aware of having to justify any expenses incurred to one's managing director, expenses incurred in trying to further business.  Deputy Colley spelled out in great detail my little worries about this particular section and how it will be interpreted.  Deputy Crowley asked a question which is unanswerable. What exactly is a business entertainment? About a week ago I was watching a TV programme on BBC 2.  It involved a pharmaceutical manufacturing company which installed a computer; the managing director admitted that he and his co-directors had made a great mistake in installing the particular computer.  He said that what happened was he and his co-directors were subjected to high-pressure salesmanship and they believed the computer would do the job but they discovered it would not.  After some years they had to remove it and install a different type of computer.  Now, if you wish to promote business, particularly in high-priced items like computers, entertainment expenses are a must and very few managing directors of big business concerns will negotiate with you unless you wine them and dine them in a first-class hotel, and pretend they are the most important people in the world.  This Bill provides income tax relief for Irish inventors.  You can invent anything you like but it will be no use to the economy or to the inventor unless the invention can be sold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An employee who works in the precints of this House invented the easy release of plastic covers off cigarettes. He got 500 cigarettes for this suggestion from the Imperial Tobacco Company. About four years later this suggestion was used and the patentee probably made £½ million.  To invent something is not enough; it is worth only a few cigarettes.  No matter what you invent or what tax relief is given to the inventor, it is no use unless <Col N="2140" /> you can promote the sale of the item. If you are dealing with international companies you are expected to entertain them in the most expensive hotels and provide the most expensive meals and this expenditure should be tax free.  If you give tax relief to the inventor you must also give tax relief to the person who promotes the sale of the invention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike my colleague, Deputy Lemass, I am not too worried about people being able to justify to the Revenue Commissioners that they have necessarily spent money on entertainment. I am more concerned about what exactly is meant by &ldquo;business entertainment&rdquo;.  We have become a member of the European Economic Community.  That is not too far from Asia and other Continents where &ldquo;business entertainment&rdquo; might have a completely different definition from ours.</P>
      <P>I assume that business entertainment here is taking somebody out for a meal, as Deputy Lemass said, and giving him the best in the best hotels. To ensure that the two words &ldquo;business entertainment&rdquo; are not abused they should be clearly defined. For instance, in certain countries it is a <i>sine qua non</i> of any operation that they are brought to see pornographic films.  That could be defined as &ldquo;business entertainment&rdquo;.  It is important that the Minister should spell out for the House exactly what he and the Revenue Commissioners mean by business entertainment lest there be further abuses of the expense account saga.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to follow a little further on what has been said by Deputy Carter.  We should differentiate between entertainment expenditure with the aim of selling goods in this country and selling goods for export.  We give concessions in many fields: for instance, profits made on exports by companies are free of income tax.  It would be logical if we were to introduce a system whereby those who must expend money on entertainment to sell abroad would have something over and above those who engage in business here.  The <Col N="2141" /> competition is more keen and incentives are more necessary.  It would be an incentive if the Minister would give this concession.</P>
      <P>There are two types of expenditure. First of all, there is the entertainment of people who come to see our products and to make business arrangements. Secondly, there are those people who are energetic and far-seeing who go out looking for markets and who meet their customers outside this country.  We should give them a concession over and above what the Minister may have in mind.  We should differentiate and thereby give our business people, people who are dealing with the Common Market countries, and people who are trying to sell outside the Common Market, some decent facility by way of entertainment expenses.</P>

      <P>Deputy Colley agreed with this section.  I believe it goes quite a considerable distance towards endeavouring to identify the cases in which entertainment expenses should be granted.  Subsection (4) deals with sums paid for the purpose of defraying expenses incurred in providing business entertainment.  Subsection (5) provides:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this section &ldquo;business entertainment&rdquo; means entertainment (including hospitality of any kind)...</P>
      <P>Subsection (6) provides:</P>
      <P>This section shall apply in relation to the provision of a gift as it applies in relation to the provision of entertainment.</P>

      <P>In this section&mdash;</P>
      <P>a reference to expenses incurred in, or to the use of an asset...</P>
      <P>a reference to a trade includes a reference to a business or profession.</P>

I should like to have clearly defined in some schedule what exactly business entertainment means or the limits to which business entertainment should be permitted to go.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If you prepared a schedule of business entertainment, it might be an encouragement to some people to misspend their lives, and, also, having set out a recital of things either permitted or prohibited, you would undoubtedly generate thoughts in other people's minds as to how they might escape from the particular disciplines which were set out in that schedule.  You obviously cannot do this.  One man's entertainment is another man's boredom.  One man's appetite is another man's indigestion. The more you try to define this the more difficulties you create.</P>
      <P>The House may take it that in relation to the application of this rule under schedule D, it will be used by the Revenue Commissioners to permit every legitimate expense which can arise in relation to the promotion of one's business, but it will also be used to curb the kind of expenditure which not infrequently arises where people engaged in business take one another and their wives out for entertainment, on yachts, on holidays and so forth.  There is undoubtedly an abuse which would not exist if people had to pay the full cost of the entertainment themselves, but where they think they can make the revenue pay &mdash;and that means ultimately the taxpayer, and that means the poorest of the poor carrying part of the burden &mdash;they do not hesitate to have expensive meals, expensive nights and perhaps holidays in the very best hotels and in various other forms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that is socially justifiable. We are bringing in a code here which is not unduly restrictive but which will make it possible for any reasonable enterprise interested in stimulating business to engage in so doing.  I do not think it will have any dampening effect upon enterprise or the promotion or obtaining of business. <Col N="2144" /> I should like to say this about the difference between domestic business and foreign business.  On the domestic plane, you can, of course, have far more abuses than in relation to the occasional visits of possible trading partners or purchasers from abroad.  You may take it the Revenue Commissioners will look with a more careful eye upon entertainment within our domestic environment than they will on entertainment offered to foreign purchasers and potential foreign customers, because they are not around all the time, whereas our neighbours are, like the poor, always with us.</P>
    <P>If we seem in business to be entertaining them on a rather lavish scale, then it is only proper that the Revenue Commissioners should have sufficient machinery available to them to scrutinise whether or not such entertainment is genuinely for the purpose of promoting business, and where it is not for that purpose, then it is time we called a halt to the entertainment of one another at the taxpayers' expense, and that is what I think has been occurring.  That will be carefully examined, and if any evidence comes before us which indicates that this is unduly restrictive, we shall be only too willing to make amends.  But remember this, the Revenue Commissioners will not be the people to make the final decision in this matter.  It will be open to any person who feels the Revenue Commissioners have been unfair to him to go to the Appeal Commissioners and ultimately to the court.  If a person has a genuine promotion, is expending money on entertainment of potential purchasers, then they ought to be able to prove their case, at least at some point, either at the local tax inspector level, at the appeal commissioner level or in court.  If a person cannot get through to one of those three institutions then there is every reason to feel they have been expending money which it is beyond all decency to allow to them.</P>

In practice, however, I think the Minister is right in saying that to attempt to define this too closely would almost certainly lead to more problems than it would solve. As far as we on this side of the House are concerned, I want to reiterate what I said earlier, that we are fully in support of this section and what it is aiming to do.  My objective was to try to get the Minister to spell out in greater detail how the Revenue Commissioners propose to administer this as compared with how the analogous position is administered under Schedule E.

      <P>I totally agree with what is in the section but I am a little worried about the interpretation of the section by the Revenue Commissioners. I visualise a situation in which some of our progressive business establishments or manufacturing concerns, having revamped or extended the business, hold a reopening function. They may invite the Minister for Finance and many others along for the reopening and may have very heavy overhead expenses in relation to this entertainment.  I do not suppose that if the Minister for Finance was there the Revenue Commissioners would seriously object to the entertainment expense but if other personalities were invited, like Gay Byrne, the Revenue Commissioners might decide it was not necessary in relation to the business. It might be a good public relations job, and I would like to get it on the record that the Minister would be of the opinion that that should be looked upon as a legitimate business promotion by the industry concerned.</P>

      <P>While I agree with the principle behind this I see certain difficulties.  Indeed, I think it will be absolutely impossible for the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners to define absolutely what is a legitimate expenditure on entertainment.  The Minister mentioned a yacht.  We Deputies are given a certain allowance in relation to our business which is agreed between the Minister and the Revenue Commissioners, as far as I am aware, in consultation with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  For instance, I am concerned with a multi-national company that I am trying to persuade to establish in this country.  When those people come here to investigate sites and to discuss matters with the IDA I, as an individual Deputy, feel obliged to make sure they are entertained in the manner to which they are accustomed.  Deputy Donegan and Deputy Byrne have probably tried to promote in the same way on their yachts.  This section lacks one thing &mdash;a definition of what is justifiable expenditure.  The Minister says you can appeal to the courts.  You spend £30 or £40 entertaining business people if you are a Deputy to try to attract them to come to the country and, if you are an inventor, to try to get a company to manufacture and market your product.  If you bring your wife along the Minister suggested: &ldquo;We scratch her out&rdquo; so that you pay for her meal yourself.  Even though the managing director of the company has brought his wife along.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In this year's budget speech I indicated that the Finance Bill would contain a measure which would have the effect of restricting the amount of capital allowance in respect of motor cars used by business and professional people to the allowances appropriate to a maximum price of £2,500 for each car.  As will be apparent from this section, the new provisions are not retrospective.  They operate only from budget day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Motor cars used for business purposes are eligible for wear and tear allowances to the extent they are so used.  They are expressly excluded from initial allowances.  When a motor car ceases to be used for business purposes any deficiency or excess in the wear and tear allowance granted, after account is taken of any proceeds of sale, insurance, <i>et cetera</i>, is adjusted by means of a balancing allowance or balancing charge.  The normal rate of wear and tear on motor cars <Col N="2148" /> which is given on the reducing balancing basis is 20 per cent.  Under existing law there is no limit on the cost of a motor car which may be taken into account for the purpose of calculating the wear and tear allowances and balancing allowances or charges in respect of the car.  Sections 24 to 28 are aimed at ending this position by confining the allowances in the case of expensive cars to what these allowances would have been if the car had cost £2,500.</P>
    <P>Apart from the provisions for relief in respect of capital expenditure on machinery and plant, there is provision for the allowance as a deduction, in computing profits, of non-capital expenditure on the suppy of implements, utensils and articles employed for the purpose of a trade or profession.  Some items coming within this description might also qualify as machinery and plant, but in respect of such items the taxpayer may claim the deduction just referred to instead of capital allowances.  In practice it is found convenient in some cases to extend this alternative form of treatment known as the &ldquo;renewals basis&rdquo; to machinery and plant generally.  In such cases capital allowances are not given but when the machinery or plant comes to be replaced the net cost of replacement, that is the cost of the new machinery or plant, less anything received from the old machinery or plant, excluding any amount representing additions or improvements, is allowed as a deduction.  Where the renewals basis is applicable in the case of expensive cars the restrictions provided for in section 25 will apply.</P>

      <P>I agree with the idea the Minister has here.  As the sum is specified, and quite properly so, at £2,500, the Minister should bear in mind the increasing cost of such items. It is highly unlikely that you would get a car which costs £2,500 at present for that figure in 12 months time.</P>

      <P>When the Minister read this out on the budget I interjected that we would have a nation of minis because that is what we will be paying for a mini soon.  I think the smallest car on the market now costs <Col N="2149" /> £986.  Unfortunately, I am only an honorary member now of the Irish Commercial Travellers' Federation because I am not engaged to a sufficient extent in salesmanship.  I know some people like to call themselves company representatives and executives but they are commercial travellers, strictly salesmen.  In my days as a commercial traveller, I found it necessary to travel up to 600 miles in a week because the type of business with which I was concerned involved dealing only with one major store in any one major town.  We were not interested in having more than one account in towns smaller than, say, Cork or Galway.</P>

      <P>It is by international standards as also is Dublin by the same standards.  Most people engaged in the profession of commercial travelling are supplied with cars.  Most companies insist that their representatives drive cars that are respectable and that they stay in first-class hotels and not in guesthouses because companies know that if they do not keep up a good appearance, their representatives will meet with poor reaction in selling the product concerned.</P>
      <P>A book published not so long ago on the art of salesmanship and which has become the manual of commercial travellers in America advises a commercial traveller to have a gold watch strap which he should wear below his wrist, to ensure that he had his car keyring in his hand when seeking business and to make sure also that the car he is driving is a big one.</P>

      <P>I acted as an agent for a Scottish wool firm and for Deputy Crowley's information, I sold some of the wool in Cork.  At that time instead of using my modest Anglia which has been referred to by the Press, I hired an Austin Princess for my week's business in the country because I knew if in a small car, I approached the people with whom <Col N="2150" /> I wished to do business they would have no respect for the product I was trying to sell.  I can assure the House that the sales I made more than made up for the cost of the hired car.  The Minister is small-minded in relation to some matters, I agree with his intention in relation to the last section but there is no point in his bringing in restrictive legislation that will prevent the people of Ireland, who are already behind in the European marketing situation, from promoting business.  The representative of an international firm could not be taken down the country in a Mini Minor. One would need to use a Princess or a Rolls Royce for him.</P>

      <P>I have long been of the opinion that there are many people travelling in fancy cars who cannot afford to have such cars except at the expense of other taxpayers who cannot afford to buy tyres for their bicycles.  It is time we had a healthier society than that and that people using fancy cars simply because they can charge half the cost to the taxpayers should be told that they will not be justified in continuing that kind of conduct.  If it is necessary for <Col N="2151" /> one to travel in an Austin Princess in order to sell shirts, he must be offering very poor value.  I do not know of any businessman who would be prepared to buy goods merely because the representatives arrive in a car that cost £5,000.  However, if that is the position, it is no wonder that inflation is so high in some parts of the country.</P>

      <P>Obviously, only in some.  It is not a problem in West Cork.  I accept what Deputy Brugha said earlier about the need for keeping a careful eye on the ceiling of £2,500.  The increases in the cost of cars have been much greater than the minimum increases in the cost of running cars.  I would hope that it would be possible to adjust the figure so as to keep the situation in line with what we have at present.  In striking the figure of £2,500 we had two things in mind.  One was that the figure would be reasonable even in respect of cars that would be used for the purpose for which Deputy Lemass has in mind and also to ensure that no damage would be done to the Irish car assembly industry.  So far as I know, there are only three cars assembled here which cost more than £2,500 and all others are well below that figure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it from the Minister that there is no question now of a Minister of State driving a Mercedes which would cost about £6,000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that it is necessary for a Minister to have a substantial car while engaged on official duties because it is important that a Minister be able to travel at speed, safely and in some comfort. Therefore, he would be justified in having a Mercedes or a better car, than those provided at present which are only four-seaters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, there is the <Col N="2152" /> commercial traveller whose living depends on his being able to travel quickly, safely and in comfort but he is to be confined to a car that is not capable of covering great distances. This concerned me greatly because for about 12 years I travelled the highways and the byways of this country endeavouring to sell products ranging from ladies' frocks to plastic bottles.  The type of business in which one is involved determines largely the distances and the territory one must cover.  For instance, the man who is selling cigarettes from one shop to another might not find it necessary to travel outside a particular area, but the man whose firm has an account only in the major towns will need a car that would be in the £4,000 price bracket.  At present I am driving a Daimler and not a modest Ford as the Press reported but I bought this car, secondhand, for less than £500.</P>

I find it necessary to have a car of some substance to convery me to these places.  In my view the figure of £2,500 which the Minister has chosen is narrow and will prove to be counter-productive.  I should like the Minister between now and Report Stage to have another look at it.  In certain cases £2,500 is fine but in other cases it is restrictive and counter-productive and repressive of the economy and of trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not entirely disagree with the Minister in regard to this section.  I am surprised that he says there are only three cars <Col N="2153" /> assembled in Ireland the cost of which exceeds £2,500.  I would have thought that there were many more cars in that range.  It is important that the taxpayer should not be asked to subsidise Princess driving or Mercedes driving.  I appreciate some of the arguments put forward by Deputy Lemass. Presentation is a very important part of selling and, perhaps, a car could be defined as part of that presentation.</P>
      <P>I am much more concerned about the fact that we discriminate in the people that we allow to claim tax allowances in respect of cars.  An executive or business director can claim his tax deductions in respect of a car but an ordinary employee who has to drive a considerable distance to work does not get any tax allowance from the Revenue Commissioners in respect of his car.  I would have thought that the Minister in this Bill would have given some consideration to the many workers who have to use cars in order to go to and from their place of employment.  This is a phenomenon that will increase.  We make a big song and dance about the depopulation of the countryside.  We must take positive action to ensure that people remain in rural areas.</P>
      <P>For instance, in my constituency, there are people who used to live in West Cork but because employment was available only in the city they had to take up residence there.  If there were a tax allowance in respect of a car used by employees it would be an incentive to people to remain in rural areas and to drive into the city every morning.  At least it would be an incentive to them to return to the rural area at the weekend.</P>
      <P>Five or six years ago I raised this matter in the Dáil and the Minister's party and the Labour party, then in Opposition, and the present Minister for Local Government in particular, supported it to the hilt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not yet suceeded in getting the allowance but, perhaps, the Minister would give very careful consideration to those persons who are being discriminated against, without any justification that I can see.  He would be taking a positive step towards his just, or more just, society <Col N="2154" /> if he would allow the same privileges to the ordinary workingman as he allows to the executive or director. This is a very important issue.  The Minister should give it his fullest consideration with a view to easing the lot of the ordinary workingman.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to express complete agreement with the last speaker.  There are people living within a radius of Galway city who want to live at home but who have to go to work in the city, for which purpose they must have a car.  These are the people for whom I would like some tax relief in respect of a car. If a director wants a big car the taxpayer should not be expected to subsidise him and in his case the figure of £2,500 is correct.</P>
      <P>People living on small farms require off-farm employment to subsidise their income.  It is recognised that the income from a small farm is not sufficient to maintain a family and that the small farmer must have outside employment.  It is socially desirable that these people should live at home and I would very seriously ask the Minister to do something in their case in respect of a tax-free allowance in respect of a car.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have tried to explain some of the psychology of salesmanship and the way to impress a buyer. When I hired that Princess I went to Cootehill where there is a modern textile factory in which I think the Government invested far more than they should have and which is closing down.  The managing director at the time was an Englishman.  The Princess that I had hired was assembled in Ireland and was hired from an Irish company.  I drove the manager to the hotel in order to entertain him there. He said to me: &ldquo;You know, they do not make them here like they make them in England&rdquo;.  I did not disillusion him.  This is the psychology of selling. When I was trying to explain that psychology the Minister opposite said: &ldquo;There is your answer.  Cannot you hire a Princess in that type of situation,&rdquo; but the Bill goes on to section 26 where it says that you cannot, if the car cost more than £2,500 at the time <Col N="2155" /> it was assembled.  It seems to me that the Minister has not read his own Bill or else he is trying to mislead me. Section 26 clearly lays down that you cannot hire that Princess for the purpose of sales psychology.</P>

      <P>I should like to support what Deputy Crowley has said in respect of workers who drive short or long distances to work.  The Minister must be aware, as every Deputy and Senator is aware, that one of the complaints about the recent budget was that there was no relief by way of tax-free allowance of this kind for workers. A worker who gets an increase of £2 per week finds that 50p of that goes in income tax.  I cannot understand why a worker who has to drive 10 or 15 miles to his work cannot get a tax-free allowance in respect of his car.  He must have a car in order to get to his work. In the left-hand corner of the tax form that every worker receives there is an item &ldquo;Expense allowance, £8 per annum&rdquo;.  That is the expense allowance given in the case of a worker who has to provide overalls and tools for his work and a car to enable him to get to his work.  I want to support Deputy Crowley on this and ask the Minister to consider sympathetically points made by Deputy Crowley and others.</P>

      <P>No.  I appreciate there is difficulty in understanding the scope of some of these sections.  The Deputy has shown a certain skill in getting around the restrictions of Parliamentary procedure.  We are dealing only with people who have cars and claim income tax allowances in respect of them where they are in excess of £2,500.  I am grateful for the manner in which most Opposition speakers have accepted £2,500 as being the proper ceiling.  On the point <Col N="2156" /> which Deputy Lemass took up and on which he endeavoured to challenge my colleague and me, the procedure is that in respect of the higher charge of hiring the Austin Princess he could set off, for income tax purposes as much of that as would be attributable to a car of £2,500 in value but if the price of snobbery goes above £2,500 it is appropriate that people should carry that can themselves without charging the price of that snobbery to the taxpayer and we make no apology for that particular notion.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if the people of Cootehill would have been disappointed if it was a car of lesser status than an Austin Princess and I doubt if the sale would have been any less effective. On Deputy Crowley's other question about income tax relief for people travelling to and from work, there are two elements here to be considered. The executive who has a car allocated to him by a company does not receive total tax free allowances in respect of that car.  The Revenue Commissioners only allow a percentage of the cost of running that car in respect of the business.  You can ask any person who has a company car and you will find they have not a very flattering opinion of the Revenue Commissioners who allow only a certain percentage because they say a percentage of the cost, the operation and capital cost, is attributable to moving to and from the executive's home and personal use at week-ends and so on.  People should not think there is any difference in principle between the treatment given to an executive and to a worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the point of view of a person who has not a company car and is travelling some distance, I have often heard the argument advanced when I was in the Opposition benches but could never go the road with those who said there should be an allowance for a variety of reasons.  There are great benefits in having one's home in rural pastures and those of us trapped in the concrete jungle would much prefer to have a home in rural <Col N="2157" /> pastures where the environment is more benign and rents and housing costs tend to be lower.  CIE is operating at a loss this year of about £12 million and it would seem to be in conflict with public policy to provide an incentive to people to purchase their own cars to travel in competition with CIE.  I am not saying which mode of transport is the right one but, ultimately, we must come to a decision as to whether, for commuter activity, the private car or public transport is the appropriate way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am aware of all that but it is suggested that we should meet that case.  You cannot meet any case under tax law without meeting all cases on the same principle. If there are anomalies and what people consider to be inequitable circumstances in tax law, it is because principles are applied and you can only apply the principle of providing tax relief in respect of the cost of getting from your home to your place of work and that must apply to everybody, including the person using public transport. You cannot give tax relief to a person who uses a private car but not <Col N="2158" /> to a person using public transport.  If you use public transport because it is available, you are probably a better citizen because you are not choking up the roads.  I would ask Deputies not to get into a dissertation on this because it is not particularly relevant.  I have thrown out some of the other arguments which I think are worthy of consideration before one jumps to a conclusion about what might seem to be the unanswerable case for tax relief in respect of the cost of operating a car to and from work.</P>

      <P>We are now getting down to matters of detail.  In the time available I do not think we can deal with the multitudinous problems arising on the desk of any Revenue Commissioner or tax inspector when he comes to deal with particular tax problems.  If a person buys a car at a lower price than most other people we may say more luck to him but we should remember that the depreciation and other advantages, if we may call them advantages, and other allowances would be related to the price he pays.  If he gets a car for only £2,000 his depreciation will be less than if he gets a car for £2,500.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must know that there are many cases in which the Revenue Commissioners, by statute, can construct an artificial price related to the market value where this is necessary.  I do not expect, since this is a new section, that the Minister would necessarily be able to give a clear cut answer at this <Col N="2160" /> stage.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because the Deputy must surely be aware, and I do not wish to jump to any assumption but I am stating my own beliefs, that probably most cars are not bought at the list price.  This happens for a variety of reasons.  The principle one is that a car is bought against a trade-in and the ultimate figure that the Revenue Commissioners can look at is the actual trade-in price, compared with allowances of depreciation which were given to a purchaser during the time of having a car.  Here we are getting into an area of great administrative detail and I am not going to be the tax adviser to Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe I misunderstand the situation but does that mean that a person with an Austin Princess now who trades it in for another Austin Princess, which will only cost him £2,500, is still likely to get the same treatment as somebody buying a much smaller car?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>What Deputy Crowley is overlooking is that if a person trades in a car against another car, even against this Austin Princess, the car that is being traded in would be considered as part of the purchase price. Even though the net cash passing is only £2,500 the value of the Austin Princess, or whatever other car is being purchased, would have to be added to that.  I think the Deputies can take it that the Revenue Commissioners are not going to allow themselves to be hoodwinked in this. They are going to be very just and if people do not like their form of justice they can go to the Appeal Commissioners, and, ultimately, to the courts, if they want justice at a different level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of the section is that an Irish resident, who is entitled to payment of the tax credit, as provided in the agreement made on 2nd May, 1973, shall be chargeable to Irish income tax and surtax on the amount of the tax credit.  This will be done by adding the tax credit to which he is entitled to the amount of the dividend he has received and charging the total to tax under Case III of Schedule D.  Up to the present the position has been that an Irish resident received a British dividend net after deduction of British tax and was entitled to claim repayment of the British tax that had been deducted from the gross dividend.  The charge to Irish tax was made on the gross dividend.  To maintain the same position under the new arrangements the Irish recipient of a British dividend will be charged to Irish tax on the dividend and the amount of the tax credit he is entitled to under the agreement made on 2nd May, 1973.  This is achieved by providing that the charge under Case III <Col N="2164" /> of Schedule D shall be on the full amount of the dividend together with the amount of the tax credit to which the recipient of a dividend is entitled under the new amending agreement. As the new agreement is confined to dividends paid on or after 6th April, 1973, and not later than 5th April, 1975, the operation of the section is restricted to this period.</P>
      <P>The section is subject to the provisions of sections 76 and 77 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, which lay down the basis period for the charge under Case III of Schedule D, that is, the preceding year's income or current year's income as the case may be.  Where the recipient of a dividend is a company which holds 10 per cent of the voting power of the company paying the dividend, the recipient company is not entitled to payment of tax credit under the terms of the agreement and such a company will be assessable to Irish tax only on the amount of the dividend received. The section provides that the income to be charged to tax under Case III of Schedule D is to be computed by making an addition to the dividend received of the amount of the tax credit for payment of which provision is made in article 1 of the new agreement.  As a company holding 10 per cent of the voting power in the paying company is not entitled to payment of the tax credit there cannot be any addition to the amount of a British dividend paid on or after 6th April, 1973, and not later than 6th April, 1975, for the purpose of assessment under Case III of Schedule D in the case of such a company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section deals only with income which is a dividend within the meaning of article 1 of the agreement set forth in the Schedule to the Act.  In that article &ldquo;dividend&rdquo; is defined as including any item which under the law of the United Kingdom is treated as a distribution of a company.  The term &ldquo;distribution&rdquo; has a very wide meaning under the Tax Acts of the United Kingdom.  It can include items which would not normally be regarded as dividends and may also include payments which would not be chargeable to Irish income tax.  The new provision does not bring into <Col N="2165" /> charge to tax any payments or other items which under the general law would not already be chargeable.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this section, and its accompanying Schedule, is to charge to tax&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  profits arising from exploration or exploitation activities carried on in this country's area of the Continental Shelf and profits arising from dealing in rights arising from such activities; and</P>
      <P>(b)  certain emoluments of employees working on the shelf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Paragraph (a)  defines &ldquo;exploration or exploitation activities&rdquo; as activities carried on in connection with the exploration or exploitation of the seabed and its subsoil together with their natural resources, whether situated in the State, that is within its territorial waters, or in a &ldquo;designated area&rdquo;, <Col N="2166" /> which is defined in paragraph (c), that is, the area of the Continental Shelf over which the State has rights.</P>
    <P>Under existing law the profits from such activities carried on by a person or company non-resident in this country would be chargeable to tax only if the activities were carried on through a branch or agency.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that the definition includes a reference to natural resources generally, a term which covers not only petroleum deposits but gas and all other resources as well.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (b)  defines &ldquo;exploration or exploitation rights&rdquo; as rights to assets generated as a result of exploration or exploitation activities as defined or rights to an interest in such assets or rights to the benefit of such assets.  This definition is intended to relate, for example, to the case of an exploration concern which carries out prospecting surveys and searches in the State's Continental Shelf area and which then sells the information, which it has gathered, to another concern for development.</P>
    <P>If the sale is made under a contract executed outside the State, by, for example, a foreign prospecting company to a foreign development or mining company, the profits on the sale would not be chargeable to tax under existing law.  The section, however, will bring such profits into charge.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (c)  defines &ldquo;designated area&rdquo;, a term which is used in the Continental Shelf Act, 1968, under which the Government have power to make orders to designate areas outside territorial waters in which the State has exploration or exploitation rights.  Under the International Convention on the Continental Shelf concluded at Geneva in April, 1958, the areas of the Continental Shelf to be allotted to each country were agreed. It is understood that two such areas have been designated.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (d)  which defines &ldquo;tax&rdquo; and &ldquo;for tax purposes&rdquo; is, I think, self-explanatory.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2) provides that any profits or gains from exploration or exploitation activities carried on in a <Col N="2167" /> designated area of the Continental Shelf, or from exploration or exploitation rights, are to be treated as profits from activities in the State; in other words, an activity such as mining oil on the Irish Continental Shelf will, for the first time, be treated in the same way as if it were carried on in the State, so that, in effect, the State's jurisdiction for tax purposes is extended to include the Shelf areas.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that profits from exploration or exploitation rights are not qualified as regards the place where the underlying transactions take place.  It is intended that dealings in such assets created as a result of activities connected with resources in the Irish Shelf area will be chargeable to tax, regardless of the locus of the contracts.</P>
    <P>Subsection (3)  provides that profits or gains arising to any person not resident in the State from exploration or exploitation activities carried on in the State &mdash; that is, in Irish territorial seas&mdash;or in a designated area of the Continental Shelf, as well as profits derived from exploration or exploitation rights, without qualification as to place, are to be treated as profits of a trade carried on in the State through a branch or agency.</P>
    <P>This procures that the profits of non-residents in relation to the activities and dealings mentioned will automatically be chargeable within this country.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4)  is intended to provide the assessment machinery for the purposes of the tax charge.  Section 200 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, provides that a non-resident may be charged in the name of any agent, in like manner as the non-resident himself would be charged if he were resident. Under the present subsection (3)  the profits or gains of a non-resident from activities on the Continental Shelf are chargeable as if they arise from a trade carried on through a branch or agency here.  In the case of a holder of a licence issued under the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960, it may be taken that there will be an agent or some authorised person in whose <Col N="2168" /> name an assessment may be made. Where, however, the licence-holder employs another non-resident company to do the actual exploration work, the latter might have no ties whatever with this country and there might be no agent in whose name an assessment might be made.  In these cases, the subsection deems the licence-holder to be the agent for purposes of assessment.</P>
    <P>I mentioned this extensively because it is a very unique and, I believe, effective way of capturing, for the benefit of Ireland, profits which can be made from marine exploration within Ireland's territorial waters and the Continental Shelf.</P>

The content of this section and the Third Schedule is the logical consequence of the allocation by international agreement of areas of the Continental Shelf to this country and their exploration and, hopefully, exploitation in the near future.  I take it that what is involved in the section and the Third Schedule is the laying down of the framework by which income tax, surtax and corporation profits tax are to be levied in respect of activities within our area of the Continental Shelf but outside the area of the State.</P>
      <P>I take it that there will be and there is thinking at the moment in regard to the manner in which profits derived from exploration of our resources on the Continental Shelf will be taxed.  It is conceivable that, in some cases, there might be exemption from tax for a certain period, or that there might be tax at particular rates, depending on the outcome of the studies being carried on in relation to this matter which, in turn, will be affected by the extent to which the exploration is successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point I wish to clarify is that I am assuming that what is contained in this Bill is laying down the legal framework by which tax could be levied but that it is possible that, in future, arrangements could be made to exempt certain activities for certain <Col N="2169" /> periods from the current rates of income tax, surtax and corporation profits tax, or to apply different rates to such activities if this were thought necessary.</P>

      <P>As this type of taxation from our point of view is completely new in the sense that we are endeavouring to impose income tax, surtax and corporation profits tax on some developments which will more than likely take place outside the State, and especially on parts of the Continental Shelf, I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary how the amount of oil struck at a given place will be evaluated and what check have we that the strike as given by the company who make it presents the true facts?  In an ordinary domestic case there are checks, but this strike will be so far out in our territorial waters that I should like to know who is the competent person who will be employed by the State to ensure that the amount of the strike returned for tax purposes is correct.</P>

      <P>I did not expect to intervene in this debate.  In reply to Deputy Crowley, I cannot see that there is any inherently greater difficulty in dealing with this problem than there would be in assessing the reliability of anybody else's tax returns.  If a company deriving their profits from exploiting the Continental Shelf turned in a figure which the Revenue Commissioners might have reason to suspect, they would refuse to accept it in the same way as they would refuse to accept a return which they suspected from anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit it will probably involve the State in an instance like that in the use of Revenue cutters of a kind not known since the days of brandy smuggling. I do not see that there is any essential inherent difference between one kind of tracking of the profits and another. If there is a problem at all in this section&mdash;and I am not saying there is&mdash; in an academic way I would be interested to know from the Minister what machinery the State has in mind in order to enforce Revenue claims against companies operating on the <Col N="2170" /> Continental Shelf because the extent of national rights over the Continental Shelf&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If there were a problem at all in the section, which I do not admit, it would not be so much the question of satisfying oneself as to the accuracy or honesty of returns, as the question of revenue enforcement.  There are very severe and sharp weapons at the disposal of the Revenue Commissioners for enforcing income tax demands within the State.  Obviously an operation on a different scale altogether would be needed in the case of, perhaps, a foreign company with installations, and perhaps even floating installations, very many miles out at sea.</P>

      <P>He mentioned the case of an Irish company holding a licence and said that if that company were to part with their licence to an outside exploration company, the new proposals would apply to the new company.  In layman's speech that is more or less what he indicated.  I am aware that a company holding an exploration licence on the Continental Shelf have already handed over their rights to another company. Will the legislation proposed here cover arrangements already made?</P>

However, we are at least stopping any gaps there may now be.  As regards what sanctions are available to the State to enforce this, there is a very simple one, that is, that nobody can operate in those areas without a licence from the Department of Industry and Commerce. Therefore, if any licensee fails to pay the tax due, he gets no licence in the future.</P>

They have their rights of inspection and so forth, and if the need arose, the Revenue Commissioners would not hesitate to put their own inspectors on the site in order to ensure there was no loss of revenue, just as they have their own inspectors in every distillery and brewery in the country.  If liquid assets are being produced anywhere, even on the high seas, you can be certain the revenue will be there to keep an eye on the situation.</P>

      <P>I did raise a point on which I would appreciate a view from the Minister: am I right in assuming that what is contained in this legislation is the legal framework for the levelling of income tax, surtax and corporation profits tax, but that nothing in this legislation will prevent the operation perhaps by the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Industry and Commerce in conjunction with the Minister for Finance of what are considered to be the necessary and appropriate tax arrangements having regard to particular developments on the Continental Shelf?  In other words, it would be possible, despite what is here, to visualise exemption from tax or tax at different rates from the standard rate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am quite certain this does not inhibit the possibility of giving some preferential treatment to encourage development which might not otherwise take place.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 33.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 33 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 33 is a section to which I would draw the attention of the House because it is a most significant section which I believe will have far-reaching beneficial effects in stimulating research and development <Col N="2173" /> in this country.  One of the possible disadvantages from which we have suffered as a result of particular disciplines we applied in industrial development over the last couple of decades is that is was of a kind that did not encourage research, development and inventiveness in Ireland.  We tended rather to accept into Ireland, and apply here a certain amount of research and inventiveness elsewhere.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this section is to exempt from income tax, surtax and corporation profits tax income derived from patent royalties arising to individuals or companies resident in the State where the work in connection with the devising of the patented invention is carried out in the State.</P>
      <P>We have every reason to believe that as a result of this we shall be able to bring to Ireland a great deal of research and development activity which otherwise would not come here. That would be the kind of research and development activity which other countries are engaged in because the parents of many of our own industries are operating there, but it will also have the most significant advantage of encouraging Irish people to engage in research and inventiveness at home and also, indeed, having done so, to ensure that they make their own inventions available to Irish industry. It will also discourage them from selling to foreign countries their own particular research.</P>
      <P>The definition of &ldquo;a qualifying patent&rdquo; is intended to restrict relief to income from patented inventions where the work on the devising of the invention is carried out here.  In theory, it could be said that there might be difficulty in establishing whether this work was carried out here, for example, in cases where detailed study and research was carried out in libraries outside the country into works of reference not available here and where tests under particular climatic conditions were made.  It is proposed, however, to adopt a liberal attitude in relation to such tests in cases where the spirit of the section is fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Income from a qualifying patent&rdquo; includes all such income whether arising <Col N="2174" /> at home or abroad.  The definition of &ldquo;resident of the State&rdquo; excludes a person who is also resident elsewhere. As in the case of the exemption in favour of writers, composers and artists under the Finance Act, 1969, the exemption for patent income is being confined to persons solely resident in the State.</P>
    <P>If an individual were, say, resident in Britain as well as in this country, the exemption of income from Irish tax would merely confer a benefit on the British Revenue at the expense of the Irish Revenue with no benefit whatever to the individual.  As the exemption will be available to companies as well as to individuals the term &ldquo;any person&rdquo;, which includes a company, is used in the definition.  A company must, therefore, be managed and controlled in the State in order to qualify for the exemption.  A company not managed and controlled here will not qualify for the exemption.  It is unlikely that the work in connection with the devising of an invention by such a company would be carried out in the State but, in any event, any benefit flowing from an exemption from Irish tax would, as in the case of the &ldquo;doubly resident&rdquo; individual, normally flow to the Revenue of the country of management and control, at the expense of the Irish Revenue and not to the company itself.</P>
    <P>Subsection (2)  grants relief from income tax in respect of income arising on or after the 6th April, 1973, from qualifying patents, regardless of the point of time at which the patents were registered.</P>
    <P>Section 92 of the Patents Act, 1964, enables the State to make use for the service of the State of any patented invention in return for the payment of compensation to the patentee&mdash; fixed, if need be, by arbitration.  In connection with such use there may be no formal document corresponding to the licence referred to in the definition of &ldquo;income from a qualifying patent&rdquo; in subsection (1).  Subsection (3)  brings any such compensation within the definition of &ldquo;income from a qualifying patent&rdquo; and the exemption is accordingly extended to the compensation. <Col N="2175" /> Subsection (4)  is a technical provision designed to secure that the &ldquo;single source&rdquo; provisions governing the basis of assessment under Case III of Schedule D will not be affected by the disregarding for tax purposes of income from qualifying patents.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5)  is designed to meet the case of an &ldquo;inventor&rdquo; who submits accounts showing income, of which, say, half came from qualifying patents, credited and various expenses debited.  If half of the income were to be disregarded but none of the expenses, a position might arise in which he could claim that the accounts showed a trading loss in respect of which he could claim relief against other income.  The subsection ensures that in such cases, there will be an apportionment of receipts and expenses.  I trust that this statement may be of some assistance to Members in understanding the section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement by the Minister is very valuable and will be of considerable assistance not only to us but to people outside this House.  I would also like to say that in our view the object of this section is entirely laudable but speaking for myself I must say I have certain reservations about the method by which it is being done.  These reservations I touched on the Second Stage debate.  The Minister may recall that I referred to the fact that there was a lot to be said, if one wanted to assist business or companies of this kind, for giving them a straightforward subvention which would be seen by everybody and could be measured rather than doing it by way of tax relief which could not be measured in advance or, indeed afterwards even when it is in operation, could not be measured except by the person or company and possibly the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, there is another aspect of this that troubles me somewhat. I do not know whether the Minister has yet had the experience, but if he has not he certainly will have the <Col N="2176" /> experience, of meeting people who will complain bitterly that they, who are earning quite a small income, are paying tax deducted by way of PAYE on every eligible penny they earn, whereas there are people who are very wealthy and who are not paying tax on their incomes on foot of the exemption to which the Minister refers, brought in by my predecessor for writers and artists.</P>
    <P>Again, in that case the object was very laudable but there is no doubt that the approach to this problem on the basis of the 1969 Act and the basis of this section does present numerous problems.  I do not want to be too specific in this regard but I recall vividly when I was Minister for Finance meeting a deputation of people who are currently engaged in an industrial dispute.  The matter which they were seeing me about concerns the matter in connection with which the industrial dispute now subsists. They were seeking special income tax allowances because the nature of their work was such that it was of tremendous value and importance to the public, and it was, and they argued very strongly that from the social point of view their contribution to society, for which they were quite poorly awarded, was at least as valuable as that of writers, artists and others.  I had to resist that argument. I am pointing this out to the Minister because I believe that the extension that is involved here, although for absolutely laudable purposes, is perhaps going to lead to demands for further treatment of this kind, other very desirable and acceptable purposes, and I am sure the Minister can see the road on which we are going if we do this, a road which could well lead to a revolt by ordinary taxpayers who cannot see why they should have to pay tax in full while people who may be very well off, and certainly much better off than they are, are exempt from tax. I want to make it quite clear again that I agree fully with the objects of the section but I am concerned at the possible consequences.  I have been concerned, quite frankly, at the consequences of the provisions in the 1969 Act, but the situation is made <Col N="2177" /> more difficult when there is, in effect, an extension of this principle.  I am sure the Minister will appreciate the reasons for my concern.  I do not expect him to say, even if he shares my concern, that he will do anything about it in this Bill.  This would be unreasonable to expect.  I do think it important to point out at this stage the dangers which can arise if we follow on the road on which this section represents a further step.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on this section.  It is a highly laudable and worthwhile section. There are two methods one could consider here.  There is exemption from income tax, surtax and corporation profits tax or, as Deputy Colley suggested, the direct cash subvention. Such a subvention would certainly be an incentive but I believe tax relief is better.  Where a patent would be working it would be paying for itself, and it would be able to prove itself a success.  If it were proving itself worthwhile it would be of benefit to the person and it would entitle him to tax free allowances.  In that way the Exchequer would benefit and the person who has patented the invention would also benefit.  On both scores I believe the tax-free allowance would be better than the subvention.</P>
      <P>This section is highly laudable because this country will have to gear itself in the matter of technological and scientific developments.  We have got our regional technical colleges.  We are becoming much more technically minded.  This will benefit people who will be using their talents in this country and helping to keep people in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this idea. It is, to a considerable extent, a logical extension of the various types of tax relief projects of a somewhat similar nature introduced by this party, when in power, in budgets over a period of years.  Personally, I would tend to agree with Deputy Colley in relation to a grant though I certainly would not rule out the exemption from income tax as well.  A grant might meet the case better here because one of the <Col N="2178" /> problems, particularly in relation to individuals rather than companies, is that you can have individuals who have brilliant ideas and no capital. For that reason, such persons would never be able to develop their ideas and bring them to fruition.  I realise, of course, that people in this category would need to be able to convince the Minister that they were working on a worthwhile project before he could decide to make any money available to them.  I notice that in the explanatory memorandum it specifies work in connection with the devising of a patented invention carried out in the State.  Does this apply also to the country in which a patent is first taken out?  I remember when Deputy Haughey was speaking either on the budget or during the general debate on the Financial Resolutions he said he understood that in America a patent was not acceptable unless it is patented there in the first instance.  As America, obviously, would provide the most lucrative market for a patent, an inventor would wish to patent his invention there first.  Can the Minister say whether the patent would need to be taken out here first so as to entitle the inventor to the reliefs envisaged in this proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hardly necessary to say that this provision is timely and one which we hope will be useful. My first question is one to which there is simply a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; answer, that is, whether there is provision in existence or being introduced in this legislation that will exempt from tax the expenditure that any individual or company might incur in the pursuit of some invention that never came to fruition, in other words, is the cost of an abortive invention free from tax?  If not, that is where we should begin because in that way we would encourage those who wish to pursue any brainwaves they may have but who might not have the means to embark on that course of action.  Although any such ideas may prove in nine cases out of ten to be useless, there should be tax relief for whatever expenditure might be incurred. If there is no such provision I suggest that the matter is deserving of <Col N="2179" /> serious consideration so that no opportunity would be lost in regard to viable projects although these may only comprise I per cent of all projects embarked on.</P>
      <P>My second question relates to the first clause of subsection (1) of the section where a qualifying patent means:</P>
      <P>a patent in relation to which the research, planning, processing, experimenting, testing, devising, designing, developing or similar activity leading to the invention which is the subject of the patent was carried out in the State.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the Minister is not creating untold difficulties in relation to this very laudable section because in many cases experimental work in regard to inventions may have to be carried out abroad if, for some reason, it cannot be done here, or it may be that certain materials may have to be used which cannot be produced here.  From the wording of the section it would appear that unless the entire work was carried out here, the benefits would not apply. Can the Minister assure the House that any necessary work carried out abroad in respect of an invention would not disqualify persons from entitlement under the section?  In some instances the carrying out of certain work abroad might only entail a fraction of the cost that would be involved in carrying out the same work here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to give the assurance, as I have given it already in my introductory statement, that the Revenue Commisioners propose to interpret these clauses very liberally.  In a country such as ours, which has the lowest rate of investment in research and development in the western world, there are a great many skills and facilities for research and development lacking but a small country like Ireland is particularly suited for research and development and we have far more graduates in science and far more people skilled in technology leaving our universities and institutions of higher learning <Col N="2180" /> than we ever had before but, because of the rather depressed state of research and development, the prospects for their employment here are less than they ought to be.  So, we are most anxious to make it attractive for these people to get off the ground, as it were, so that we would develop our own research and development here because there is no doubt that we have, of course, quite rightly and usefully relied to a great extent on foreign investment and foreign interest here but that is not necessarily the kind of investment and interest and economic development activity which you keep in times of great international stress or economic stress.  It is much better to have your own indigenous industry, based upon your own research and development of your own resources, and that is what we are most anxious to develop.</P>
      <P>As people proceed with that research and development here and make their own inventions they will certainly have to make investigations abroad and, perhaps, get some of their work processed abroad because of the lack of laboratory facilities and skills here.  We propose that where it can be shown, as we believe it can be in most cases, that the work is done by Irish residents and is governed and controlled and effectively operated from and substantially done here, those people will get the full benefit even if some part of the work has to be done abroad.  Every case has to be considered on its own merits.  The Revenue Commissioners, I am satisfied, will take a liberal attitude, realising that the purpose of this is to stimulate research and development in Ireland by Irish people.</P>
      <P>On the point that Deputy Faulkner made, if I understood him correctly, he was wondering whether the benefits would be available to anybody who first registered their patent in Ireland.  Am I right?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, the benefit will not be available to anybody who simply registers in Ireland for the first time because we have to be satisfied that the research work was done here.  We are not concerned if people register their work elsewhere because, for a variety of reasons, including, I am sorry to say, the inability of our own Patents Office to register patents as quickly as other places, even Irish inventions and Irish patents are sometimes more expeditiously registered elsewhere but if the work is done here and the person remains in Ireland the profit from any royalties on those patents will accrue to the Irish person and we will be giving the advantage to the Irish person.  We are, of course, most anxious to get Irish patents and Irish inventions registered first in our Patents Office and my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, is taking steps to try to improve the Irish Patents Office.  Its principal difficulty is one in relation to staff and it is a difficulty that affects not merely the Irish Patents Office but, indeed, many other offices in the public sector which have to be staffed by professional people, that the rates of remuneration offered to them there are often not comparable with the temptations offered in the private sector.  Quite clearly, if we are to avail to the full of the skills and the research facilities, the enterprise and the initiative of our own scientists and technologists, we ought to be improving all this area of research and development and the application of science and technology here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is one of the purposes of this. I am alive to the dangers that Deputy Colley raised.  I identify the dangers he spoke about in relation to similar reliefs in relation to other activities but these will have to be looked at. We have made this as tight as is necessary.  We have also made it as liberal as it should be to get the most benefit out of it.  I do not regard any of these arrangements as final, as permanent.  We will take a look at the situation as it develops but we believe that this is a most useful encouragement to research and development in this country and that <Col N="2182" /> the benefit will accrue not merely to the inventors but also to Irish industry which must inevitably be the principal beneficiary if we can encourage Irish inventiveness to develop in Ireland.</P>

Every case must be looked at on its merits.  You would have to see within what period the losses and profits were made.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 38 together.  At the end of June there were 585 applications on hands in the Lucan exchange area.  There is a shortage of equipment in the exchange serving the area.  Additional equipment, which is being installed, is expected to be in service in about two months' time.  A substantial amount of cabling work, which is necessary mainly to serve the new housing estates in the area, is in hand.  Seventy of the orders on hand will have attention over the next few weeks and about 150 further cases will be dealt with progressively over the next six months.  It is expected that most of the remaining applicants will be quoted terms before the end of the current financial year.</P>

I sympathise with the residents. Provision of these facilities at a cost of about £300 per household with the precedent that would set for uneconomic installations elsewhere would, I fear, deter any Minister in present circumstances from providing such service.</P>

      <P>I quite appreciate that but I still want to know if the Minister will be good enough to consider whether or not, in view of the social need that would be fulfilled, the cost of £300 per house in the Black Valley would not be money well spent and to hell with the precedent.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Cruise-O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy really means &ldquo;to hell with the precedent&rdquo;; he means &ldquo;Set the precedent&rdquo; because he thinks it could be beneficial to his constituency which is fair enough from his point of view, but we are dealing with the allocation of scarce resources and I could not justify provision of these facilities at this cost either in the Black Valley or other parts of the country.  We hope technological developments will make this kind of development possible at less than prohibitive cost but I fear the present cost is prohibitive.

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the average delay in the delivery of second class mail; if he has received any complaints about undue delay in this regard and, if so, the action taken in the matter.</P>

      <P>In normal circumstances, second class mail gets much the same standard of service as fully paid letter mail; that is, about 90 per cent of correspondence posted in time for the outgoing despatch at the place of posting to addresses within the State are due for delivery by the following working day.  The remainder would be due for delivery on the second working day after posting. However, under the Post Office Acts, 1908 to 1969, it is permissible to defer the handling of second class mail if it is necessary to do so in order to avoid delay to first class mail.  In practice, this power is seldom resorted to at present to any extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy recently brought to my <Col N="2192" /> notice a case of delay to a batch of circular matter posted on Friday, 29th June last.  I find that, around that date, the necessity to defer handling of a certain amount of second class mail, including the circular matter in question, did arise as a result of exceptionally heavy postings apparently made in anticipation of the increases in postage rates from 1st July and some unexpected staff absences. I am communicating with the Deputy in this matter.</P>

In answer to a previous question from the Deputy, I informed the Dáil on 8th May that the Government would view with favour the formation of a National News Agency, provided it were to become clear that such an agency would have the requisite support from the Irish newspapers and <Col N="2193" /> media, as well as from the journalistic profession in Ireland.  I added that if there were indications that such support would be forthcoming, the Government would be prepared to co-operate with the Press and media towards the establishment of such an agency.  Up to now I have not received such indications, and there the matter rests for the present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The heavy investment in a State airport in Donegal with necessary aeronautical facilities and the high cost of operation would not be justified by the prospective traffic and in view of the heavy Exchequer investment in the existing State airports, which are required to cater for our international scheduled air services, I could not see my way to proposing the construction of such an airport in Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, there is a fund entitled the Special Regional Development Fund under the aegis of the Minister for Finance which is used in certain circumstances <Col N="2202" /> to promote economic projects in the underdeveloped counties.  Applications for grants from this fund towards the cost of private aerodromes are considered on their merits, the principal criteria being suitability of site, local sponsorship providing at least half the cost of the provision of an aerodrome with minimum facilities and a reasonable expectation that the operation will be viable.</P>
    <P>My Department will assist promoters of private aerodromes by providing technical advice on aeronautical aspects.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister take into account the fact that, while the residents of north-west Donegal in particular contribute fully and completely to the provision of rail services for the rest of the country, and air services for the southern half of the country from Dublin across to Galway and southwards, we do not have any of these facilities in Donegal and that, in view of the isolation of the county by virtue of geography on the one hand and the artificial Border on the other hand, a special effort should be made?  Will the Minister check again on the figures from which these deductions have been made because I believe they are erroneous? In checking them, will he ascertain whether the likely volume of passenger traffic from an airport sited in Donegal would be at least equal to that of the airport sited in his native Cork and would not be in competition with anything nearer than Aldergrove in Belfast?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be sympathetic to the siting of an aerodrome in Donegal but this would come under the aegis of the Department of Finance who would be primarily responsible.  I do not think it would be possible even if, as the Deputy says, the prospective volume of traffic would be equal to that in Cork.  As the Deputy may know, Cork Airport lost a considerable amount of money last year.  Obviously, if another airport were sited in Donegal the possibility is, if the Deputy is correct, that that would also lose money.  I would prefer to see a small airport there something on the lines <Col N="2203" /> of the Castlebar airport if local participation was available for it.  If the Deputy can get a number of people in his county together to put such a scheme before me, I will be very glad to advance it with the Department of Finance for him.</P>

      <P>There are no statutory regulations governing night flying over cities.</P>
      <P>For many years past, Aer Rianta at the request of my Department, have actively discouraged the night flying of jet aircraft at Dublin Airport.  This arrangement has resulted in the virtual elimination of scheduled flights of jet aircraft in and out of Dublin Airport between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. During the summer months, however, some charter flights operate up to 1 a.m.</P>

I have not got the figure here for how many flights have come in, but my recollection is that it was not an excessive number.  The Deputy may like to know that at the moment discussions which are going on with my Department should result in no jets flying in and out of Dublin Airport from 9 o'clock at night until 7.30 in the morning.

      <P>I have been informed by Bord Fáilte that the implications for the Irish tourist industry of the fall in the value of the US dollar will depend on the reactions of the potential American visitors to Europe.  The recent fall is in relation to certain European currencies and it will make <Col N="2205" /> holidays in those countries more expensive for North Americans.  This may lead to a change in destination by American visitors to countries where the relative values of the local currencies and the dollar have remained virtually unchanged.

      <P>At the last stock taking date, 1st July, 1973, stocks were equivalent to over 100 days consumption.  This includes the stocks held by the Gulf Oil Company at Bantry, which by agreement with the company, would be made available for use in this country in the event of an emergency.</P>
      <P>Stock levels may vary from time to time.  As a member of the European Communities we are at present obliged to hold stocks equivalent to 65 days consumption.  As from the 1st January, 1975, this requirement will be increased to 90 days consumption. The position is at present under consideration in my Department with a view to the preparation of legislation which would ensure the maintenance of stocks at least equivalent to the EEC limit at all times.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider the advisability of such a venture on the north-west coast, particularly as this would be the European transhipment link with the Continent of America?

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this was examined on four or five occasions since the foundation of the State and on each occasion there was no support. On one occasion the answer that came back from an inter-departmental committee was that when they canvassed support for such a project there seemed to be no support for it.  It was ruled out on all those occasions for this reason, and I understand the position is no different today.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not take into consideration that things are very different today?  Indeed, information that is being sought on a later question here today may throw some light on this particular bay, because there is a very live proposition that will create a great deal of shipping up there by way of a proposed oil refinery, which is only the beginning of the development there.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The recently announced plans of a motor vehicle manufacturer to set up a new plant to manufacture motor vehicle components also involves the phasing out of the assembly of that manufacturer's vehicles by two Irish assemblers. In reply to Dáil questions last month, I set out in some detail the arrangements that had been made <Col N="2211" /> last year by my predecessor with the manufacturer in question.  Under these arrangements it was provided that the workers who would be displaced from motor vehicle assembly would, if they so wished and were suitable, be given reasonable opportunity of getting employment in the component manufacturing plant and that the manufacturer would cooperate fully in their retraining.  The arrangements for setting up the new plant are still at the preliminary stage and arrangements have also to be completed relating to the phasing out of assembly in the two firms concerned.</P>
      <P>At this stage, therefore, it would not be possible for me to indicate the possible level of redundancy that may arise in the next few years among the assembly workers.  Neither would it be possible to indicate the employment prospects for any disemployed workers but I will do all in my power to help in providing suitable alternative employment for any workers disemployed as a result of this development.</P>

At present active discussions are proceeding between the owners of the mill and an Irish firm with a view to restarting the mill in Creeslough.

      <P>Is the Minister not aware, from information in his Department, that this industry was not closed on the basis of economic difficulties, but that it was closed, by a company who only took it over a few years ago allegedly on the basis that the trouble in the Six Counties was interfering with it?  Since this company, the parent company of the associate that ran this mill, and closed it down and threw workers out, have other business concerns in this country, should the squeeze not be put on them, because they have done the workers down in that area in a very thriving industry that is now paying better all over the world than ever before?</P>

      <P>I have had no representations from manufacturers of plastic products about difficulties as a result of the present shortage of raw material.  Recent Press reports have indicated, however, that some Irish firms are being affected by this shortage.</P>
      <P>The shortage of raw materials is a world-wide one, and I understand that it is unlikely to be remedied until there is a significant increase in the production of crude oils from which the raw materials in question are produced.</P>

      <P>I cannot give an informed answer to the Deputy but I think the idea is certainly worth looking at.  It may be economic, it may not be.  It depends on the size of the individual lumps that you would have to collect.  I do not know the answer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce the features of the environment in the context of pollution control which are dealt with in his Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have no specific statutory function in relation to the prevention of pollution, I am concerned with the control of environmental pollution related to industrial and mining development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree, in view of the proposed dumping of chemicals by a Danish firm 200 miles from the southern coast of Ireland, that there is now a greater need than ever to have pollution and pollution control dealt with by a separate agency, a Department of the Environment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not prejudge the most appropriate organisation, whether it would be a Department of the Environment or some other structure, but I do share the Deputy's concern and I agree with him that in the whole area of environment protection and pollution control we need to strengthen the existing mechanisms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reasonable reply but would he not agree that the effort to control pollution, both nationally and internationally, <Col N="2219" /> is disparate; it is spread over too many departments, too many areas?  Would he not agree that there is a greater need than ever for a central control agency?  I would suggest a Department of the Environment as a matter of extreme urgency. It is becoming a more urgent problem every day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the urgency of the matter and that, perhaps, as the situation has evolved, we have not been dealing with it as vigorously as warranted.  I do not wish to prejudge what would be the most appropriate structure for dealing with the problem but some such structure is necessary.  However, whether that would take the form of another department is something I am not certain of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say whether, under the existing legislation and regulations, there are any discussions in progress between the various bodies concerned so as to ascertain what immediate action might be taken in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a good deal of vigorous activity in relation to the general question of pollution control but, as Deputy Andrews pointed out, this activity is scattered between a number of organisations.  While I do not have a statutory responsibility in this regard, I have responsibility for the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards which, in their own way, have made an important contribution to the control of pollution and to the setting of standards as well as providing a monetary service, particularly in relation to water and also in respect of other types of atmospheric pollution. I visited the institute recently and indicated to them my conviction that it is important that the work should be done more vigorously.  I do not think there is any disagreement on that score. There is a need for bringing together the separate bits of our pollution control effort in a more coherent way.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister urge his Government to make a protest to the Danish Government, even at this late stage, in connection with the dumping of matter 200 miles off our coast in view of what has been stated since I raised this matter on the adjournment the other evening?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JustinKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that there is at least confusion in the report.  Some reports have told us that the matter is seriously dangerous while others say it is innocuous.  I wish to get as near as possible to a neutral and objective opinion as to the seriousness of the matter.  Then, if we are convinced that it involves serious danger I will urge the making of a protest to the Danish Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 19, line 7, to delete paragraph (a) and to substitute the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) section 15 of the Stamp Act, 1891, and subsections (2) and (3) of section 68 of this Act,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Subsections (2) and (3) of section 68 of the Bill charge interest on the stamp duty which is imposed by chapter II of Part IV of the Bill in relation to transactions of capital companies.  The amendment of paragraph (a) of section 34 is necessary to ensure that this interest is treated for income tax purposes in the same way as interest is treated on stamp duty chargeable under the 1891 Act and on income tax and value-added tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of income tax and corporation profits tax there is a prohibition on deducting interest in calculating income tax liability. There is no such prohibition in relation to these items and the purpose of the exercise is to bring them all into line so that payment of interest which arises due to default in payment cannot be set off against income tax by liability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say it is due to an oversight.  At that time there was not thought given to it, if I might put it that way.  Obviously, all these matters should be brought into line because in the present situation one can reduce one's income tax liability because one is in arrears in paying other tax liability.</P>

      <P>Yes, and of course now that there are so many individual payments under the VAT code, there are several cases in which people are claiming this interest as a set-off.  A number of people also have made claims to the effect that parking fines should be regarded as part of the ordinary expenses of business on the grounds that the fines concerned commercial vehicles parked on the public street.  Revenue has never been able to accept that a penalty imposed can be set off against profits.</P>

      <P>The purpose of section 35 is to extend for a further period of one year the temporary exemption from corporation profits tax hitherto accorded to certain public utility companies, building societies and the Agricutural Credit Corporation.  The latest period of exemption expired on December 31st, 1972.  It has been the practice to extend this from year to year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection is that there have been these extensions for a few years past.  My recollection is that the reason it was done this way was that it was a temporary arrangement pending the settling of what would be the proper extension of trustee status. I may have this wrong but there was something of this nature involved. Perhaps the Minister could enlighten us as to what is pending while we extend this and how soon we may expect finality in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy and the House know, the whole question of building societies and public utility companies is under examination at present and this examination is being conducted by the National Prices Commission and it would not be proper or, indeed, sensible for me to anticipate what time they will require to complete their inquiries nor, indeed, can we anticipate their recommendations. In the meantime, we consider the appropriate thing to do is to maintain the <i>status quo</i> and that is what we are doing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is giving protection to building societies.  Could this not be nullified by the fact that a certain proportion of building society money has been channelled for purposes other than those for which they were originally designed and for which their charter provides, namely, the construction of private houses? In a recent reply to a question addressed to the Minister for Local Government we were informed that a portion, be it 5 per cent or 10 per cent per annum, was being channelled to other purposes.  Would that break the charter and, consequently, affect exemption from income tax and corporation profits tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the matters being investigated at the moment is the manner in which building societies are applying their funds.  I do not think the application of funds to purposes other than house building for private occupation reaches the proportions the Deputy has mentioned but it is proper that people should realise that building societies have to keep a certain proportion of their funds in reserve to meet demands which may be made upon them for cash and often this finds itself channelled into other forms of investment which can be more readily realised than houses.  It is obvious that where a building society has lent money on a mortgage on a house for private occupation that asset is well-nigh incapable of being liquidated except by causing considerable hardship to the mortgagor but in any case if the mortgagor is maintaining payments and complying with the terms of the mortgage there is nothing that the society can do about it.  A proportion has to be kept in assets other than actual houses as such.  One of the conditions imposed by the Government before they gave this recent subvention to building societies was that they would keep to an absolute minimum the investment of money in anything other than private house building.  We are satisfied that there <Col N="2312" /> has been an improvement in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. P. Burke Mr. R. P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>It was the Minister for Defence who answered for the Minister for Local Government and who informed us that the subvention would be given only if the total funds of the building societies&mdash; not a minimum amount &mdash; were channelled to the sources that most of us understand was in accordance with the spirit of the legislation if not the letter of the legislation, that is, the lending of money for the purpose of private houses.  This seems to conflict with what the Minister is saying, that the subvention is being given even if some building society money is being channelled into purposes other than private houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I should not like anyone to get the wrong impression from what I have said.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. P. Burke Mr. R. P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. P. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have made it clear that all available resources of building societies must be allocated towards the financing of houses for occupation by the purchasers. I am saying now, with my financial cap on, that building societies must reserve a certain proportion of their assets in liquid form. A certain misunderstanding has arisen in the public mind.  Where a building society's accounts have shown that a certain proportion of assets is not, in fact, invested in private residences, the Government are insisting that this be kept at the minimum necessary to ensure liquidity.  That is entirely necessary because we must get the confidence of investors in building societies.  If they want their funds back they must be able to get them on demand and it is only if a certain proportion is kept in assets other than private dwellings that that would be possible.  This is being kept to the bare minimum.  What we have discouraged is the use of their resources for investment in industrial and commercial properties.  That is what we need to stop while at the same time we will, as we must, allow building societies <Col N="2313" /> to keep a certain amount back for liquid requirements.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 36.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 36 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 30 provided for charging to income tax the British tax credit recoverable under the new agreement with the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>This section provides that companies which are entitled to payment of the tax credit shall be charged to corporation profits tax on that tax credit in addition to the British dividend which they receive and to which the tax credit relates.</P>
      <P>A company is charged to corporation profits tax on its profits by section 52 of the Finance Act, 1920.  Where these profits include a dividend from a British company, the amount which has been included in respect of the dividend has hitherto been the gross amount before deduction of tax.  The company would have received the net dividend after deduction of British income tax and under the residence agreement would have been entitled to claim repayment of the British income tax so deducted.  Under the new arrangements in the United Kingdom income tax will not be deducted from dividends but residents in Ireland will be entitled to get payment of the tax credit appropriate to the dividends.  To maintain the same position as existed before 6th April, 1973, the section provides that a company which is entitled to payment of the tax credit from the British revenue is to be charged on the total of the dividend and the tax credit. This corresponds with the former charge of the net dividend plus the refund of tax deducted under the residence agreement.</P>
      <P>The section will affect only those companies which have less than a 10 per cent stake in the British company paying the dividend.  Companies holding 10 per cent or more of the voting power of the paying company are not entitled to the tax credit under the new agreement, and they will be charged to corporation profits tax only on the dividend received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2314" /> The section deals only with a dividend within the meaning of Article 1 of the agreement set forth in the Schedule to the Act.  In that article &ldquo;dividend&rdquo; is defined as including any item which under the law of the United Kingdom is treated as a distribution of a company.  The term &ldquo;distribution&rdquo; has a very wide meaning under the United Kingdom Taxes Acts.  It can include items which would not normally be regarded as dividends and may also include payments which, or part of which, would not be chargeable to Irish corporation profits tax. The new provision does not bring into charge to tax any payments or other items which under the general law would not already be chargeable.</P>
    <P>The section is limited in its application to dividends paid in the two years from 6th April, 1973, to 5th April, 1975, to correspond to the period to which the new agreement relates.  As I mentioned earlier it is proposed that a new agreement will be negotiated to cover the period from April 1975 onwards.</P>

      <P>This section is related to the protocol signed on 2nd <Col N="2315" /> May, 1973, which is set out in the Fourth Schedule and which contains an agreement between the Irish and British Governments for amendment of the agreement signed on 18th May, 1949 which is contained in the Fifth Schedule to the Finance Act, 1949. The new arrangements are in the form of a protocol which was adopted at the request of the British revenue authorities in order to enable them to give legal effect to the amendment by order rather than by specific legislation.  The safeguard contained in the phrase &ldquo;subject to confirmation by the United Kingdom Parliament&rdquo; which is used in the section is necessary because the agreement contained in the protocol could not come into effect until it was also passed in the British Parliament.</P>

      <P>Section 38 and the Fifth Schedule contain provisions to counter tax avoidance by means of a device known as loss-buying.  The device operates as follows: a company making substantial profits acquires the shares of a run-down company which has been carrying on a similar trade and which has accumulated large losses or unused capital allowances. Under existing law, trading losses, and unused capital allowances, may be carried forward and set against future profits of the same trade.  The profit-making company purports to have revived the trade of the loss company &mdash; which is similar to its own &mdash; and claims the set-off of the accumulated losses against the profits of the revived trade.  What has happened, however, is that the profit-making company has transferred part of its profit-making activities to the loss company so as to reap the benefit of the accumulated losses.  The result of the scheme is that the profit-making company obtains tax relief on its own profits by means of this loss-buying transaction.  There is a growing tendency to adopt this device as <Col N="2316" /> may be gathered from the advertisements seeking companies with losses in particular trades, and also advertisements offering for sale companies which have nothing to offer except accumulated losses.</P>
      <P>The present section and related schedule propose to counter the tax avoidance device by refusing to allow the carry-forward of trading losses, or unused capital allowances, of a company where, in association with a change in ownership, there is a major change in the activities of its trade or, at the time of the change in ownership, the company's trade is near dormant.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;major change&rdquo; in the activities of the trade includes, of course, the transfer of part of the profit-making trade to the run-down company against which the old losses would be offset.  Legislation of a similar nature was included in the British Finance Act, 1969.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recollect that on Second Stage I expressed some views on this section. In so far as the device known as loss-buying can be counteracted, it should be counteracted where it consists solely of avoiding liability for tax.  I pointed out to the Minister that there were dangers in what was being done and that the section should be looked at more closely to try to ensure that it did not operate to prevent what would be very worthwhile activities especially in the present condition of our economy where we are emerging into free trade and where we have companies struggling in this free trade era, companies which, with an injection of capital and know-how, could be successful.  I suggested it might be advisable to provide that this kind of operation would not be prohibited on certain conditions, one of which might well be the maintenance of employment in the run-down or running-down company.  Certain other conditions strike one as being possible of application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand this section and the Fifth Schedule copy the English legislation, whether word for word or very closely, I do not know, but there is a <Col N="2317" /> very close resemblance between them. I also understand that in Britain as a result of this legislation some genuine cases of reconstruction were caught. This is the very fear I expressed in regard to this section.  It seems that some safeguards are required which do not appear to exist in the section at present.  Presumably the section is designed solely at the moment from the point of view of the Revenue Commissioners which is, perhaps, legitimate in a Finance Bill, but there are other considerations entering into these transactions. It seems as if there is a case, as I have indicated, for exemption from the provisions of the section of such transactions where certain conditions such as maintenance of employment are fulfilled.  Alternatively, there is a case for some authority &mdash; offhand I suggest some State body such as Fóir Teoranta or the ICC &mdash; being given the duty and the authority to examine cases of this kind and recommend exemption from the provisions of this section where it seems clear to them that the proposed takeover &mdash; to use that word &mdash; of the rundown company is a genuine reconstruction effort with reasonable prospects of success and in particular with reasonable prospects of maintenance of employment.</P>
    <P>There are factors other than revenue ones involved in this and while I have no desire to assist in any way the avoidance of taxation by the device of loss-buying, I believe we must be very careful, perhaps even more careful than the situation would require in Britain.  Our circumstances are more difficult and we are more likely to have companies genuinely in difficulties and genuinely potentially viable.  I have the greatest fear that the operation of this section, and the Fifth Schedule, may well prevent the saving of companies of this kind, and the saving of the employment which they give.  This is a very serious matter and, for that reason, I will be glad to hear that the Minister examined this closely and had some proposals which would ensure that this section, and the Fifth Schedule, would not operate in the way that I fear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>I have similar thoughts <Col N="2318" /> on this section to those expressed by Deputy Colley.  One could take the case of a company which, for example, is running at a profit at one end while the other is running at a loss.  Such a happening could occur in a wholesale or retail business, for example, grocery and hardware.  If the grocery was failing to make a reasonable profit and the company was in need of money it could be decided to seek money and expertise. This might mean the co-option, in certain circumstances, of a director, or two, to the board of the company.</P>
      <P>The company would be doing this, firstly, to make a profit and, secondly, to preserve employment and to keep the business going.  Would the terms as outlined in this section not cross lines with circumstances so described? Deputy Colley was right to point out that there are certain dangers in this section even though the Minister has the best intentions.  We all know of the loss buying and of the shell trading and of the major concern moving in and taking over a company which is in difficulty.  This major concern advertises the fact that the company is in difficulty through the community especially if it is a public company.  I have more in mind a private company.</P>
      <P>At any rate, we know the tactics employed in this regard.  We know that in order to get the public interested the Stock Exchange has to be worked up and the share values raised.  No one would find fault with the section in regard to what it does in this direction but there is the danger that it could impinge in the direction which I have described.  I would be grateful for the Minister's observations on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much alive to the matters which concern the Deputies opposite, but I think we have to consider this.  As far as I know there is not, for instance, in Britain, any company comparable with our Fóir Teoranta.  This company is available to come to the rescue of companies in difficulties.  A great deal of the help given by Fóir Teoranta is not merely on a financial basis but is also an injection of <Col N="2319" /> management which helps to get tottering companies on their feet.</P>
      <P>They often do it by arranging amalgamation. We consider it better that if money is needed in such a situation that it be given outright by the State with Fóir Teoranta doing that kind of operation.  We believe that this is preferable to continuing in the kind of situation which has come to light. I do not like giving particular instances because they might be capable of identification, but some cases which I can give to the House illustrate the kind of thing that is happening at the moment without any benefit to the employees in the companies that have the trading losses, without any increase in economic activity, but at considerable cost to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>One company which had losses of nearly £½ million was purchased by another company which had immense profits for a price of about £50,000. This gave the company that had the immense profits a tax saving of over £¼ million.  There was no maintaining of employment because the losing company had virtually no employees left; they were located in an area far away from the company which purchased them and there was no transfer of the few employees left but the tax gain to the successful company was immense and there was no additional employment generated good, bad or indifferent. To the ordinary taxpayer, as a result of that particular device which was a legitimate one and would remain a legitimate one as long as we leave the law in its present ineffective state, there was a loss of over £¼ million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not seem to me that that is the correct thing to do.  Another company, with losses of £271,000, was acquired in a not dissimilar situation; it did not maintain employment or generate new employment.  The Deputies can calculate for themselves what the probable loss in tax was, something over £100,000.  Another company which was acquired had accumulated losses of nearly £1 million before it was acquired by another company which put those losses against its <Col N="2320" /> profits to avoid the tax that it ought to have paid to the public generally.</P>
    <P>That clearly is not something that can be justified and I do not think that the Members opposite are justifying it. Maybe I should read out some of the samples of advertisements which have been issued.  Members may have seen them.</P>

      <P>We may waste time if we go on but the Minister may take it as common ground between us that in the kind of cases which he described we want to ensure that this kind of thing does not go on.

What we would like to know is, has the Minister any ideas as to how we can ensure that this section will not operate to bring about the kind of results we envisage?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Fóir Teoranta is the system to provide the life saving services.  Fóir Teoranta, as the House knows, is concerned with employment. In other words, if Fóir Teoranta considers that an industry, or an activity, is not going to be viable, either by itself or in association with somebody else, they say: &ldquo;Sorry, there is no point in helping you.&rdquo;  As long as we leave the present system there these losses will be used by companies which will not maintain or increase employment. I do not think that is right.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is repeating what we have been saying in relation to where continuity of employment can be guaranteed.  I think this would overcome any misgivings we have about the whole thing.  We agree with the whole concept of what the Minister is trying to do but, at the same time, it would be ironic if we had a company prepared to come in and invest and lend its technical know-how and expertise to make it a survival company and then we may have to come along later and inject money from other State sources by way of grant and loan to keep the company going.  We could easily get over this difficulty if we could put in some clause which would guarantee continuity of employment for a certain number of years and have some sort of retrospection whereby they <Col N="2321" /> would not gain the value of the tax loss until such time as they had proved they were <i>bona fide.</i></P>

      <P>Members on this side of the House have expressed complete agreement with the principle the Minister has in mind, namely, the protection of the State in this kind of situation.  I would like to ask the Minister are Fóir Teoranta, as presently structured, geared to do what the Minister has in mind? Would they have the manpower and the capacity to adjudicate on what will happen in these kinds of mergers and in the kind of situation to which the Minister referred?  We are trying to protect employment in industry, which has been going down, with the possibility of a takeover.  With an injection of capital and expertise there is the possibility of protecting employment and even generating more jobs. Would Fóir Teoranta have the manpower to do the job properly?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have not got the dynamic expertise and experience in this industrial field and, from that point of view, Fóir Teoranta are really the people to do it.  As I pointed out recently, they are increasing their work force in order to provide additional management skills so that they will be able to put in really goahead managers into situations where obviously what is needed is simply a decent bit of modern management. We are satisfied Fóir Teoranta and the IDA are in a much better position to control these situations.  We discussed the matter with them before we brought in this section.  They are the people to manage these situations. Naturally enough, everybody likes to push as much as possible on to the Revenue Commissioners and that would be fair enough if, in the end <Col N="2322" /> result, the community benefits.  I think Deputy Crowley thought that it might sometimes be cheaper to use the tax device rather than give a direct subsidy.  Because of the quantity of known tax losses which have arisen the State has been deprived of money and the time has come to say that these devices will no longer be available. If, as a result of this, we can stop the losses that have arisen by the use of this system we will have ample money available to bolster up those companies that can maintain employment. It is important to realise that, as far as the Revenue Commissioners know and as far as those of us in our own professions and private experience know, in most companies that have sold their tax losses there has been no maintenance of employment. That is one of the tragedies and, so long as we leave this loophole there, we are facilitating the running down of companies and the acquisition of them by people who have no obligation to keep on the employees.</P>
      <P>Deputy Burke asked could we not write in a provision to the effect that the tax concession would be available only if employees were kept on.  We could do that but how would you enforce it?  If, after a year, two years or five years, the management of the concern are able to establish that it is necessary to bring about redundancy in order to go on surviving, who could say at that stage: &ldquo;You have broken your undertaking to keep people in employment and you are now, therefore, going to suffer the tax losses&rdquo;?  That would be the ideal, but in practice it would be extremely difficult.  We are aware of all the dangers to which Members have alerted us tonight and I can assure the House we will keep a very careful watch on the situation and I will be the very first to want to change it if I consider it is working to the disadvantage of employment and of industries which would remain viable if this tax arrangement had been maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarter" hpid="Mr. Carter Mr. Carter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has answered the question by suggesting more or less semi-State enterprise.  I do not believe Fóir Teoranta are capable <Col N="2323" /> of either restructuring a company or of management of a company. When one wants expertise and money one has to look to the private sector.  That is my point and this is where the lines cross.  The Minister has evidently great faith in Fóir Teoranta; I would not have as much faith in it or in any other semi-State company.  Neither Fóir Teoranta nor the IDA have the expertise or the manpower to undertake such work.  I have had evidence of that in my dealings with them as an ordinary Deputy. One has to go deeper.  One has to go where the money is.  If the owner of a company is prevented from doing that in a genuine effort to survive &mdash; I am not now speaking of that which the Minister condemns, because we all agree with him there &mdash; Fóir Teoranta are not the answer.  You may have a company, one end of which is making a loss and the other end of which is making a profit; the company may want to restructure by coopting one or two people on to management; if the answer is to send these people to Fóir Teoranta, I would not approve of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as we are concerned, we want to see this section enacted to deal with the cases in regard to which the Minister has given us some details.  We have explained what our reservations are and we have suggested two possible lines of approach which might meet the situation. The assumption is that we enact the section with the proviso suggested by Deputy Crowley, that a company which sought to gain the advantage of loss buying would, as I understood his proposal, get the tax benefit on a delayed basis; in other words, they would not get any tax benefit until after a specified period had elapsed and they had established over that period that they had maintained or increased employment, depending on the condition laid down. That is one approach.  The other one is the Fóir Teoranta one which I will come to in a moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing that is quite clear, and the Minister adverted to it in something he said, though not in quite the <Col N="2324" /> same sense, is that it is the job of the Revenue Commissioners to protect the revenue and to administer such enactments as this.  It is not the job of the Revenue Commissioners and neither are they equipped to assess the commercial viability of companies or the genuineness in the commercial sense of a proposition to benefit from a tax loss as against a purely tax avoidance device. The Revenue Commissioners are not competent to do this.</P>
    <P>Unless one can write a specific condition into the Bill which would apply to any case where this section would not operate, the alternative method we suggested might be considered, the giving to a competent authority the power to recommend to the Revenue Commissioners that, in any individual case referred to them, exemption from this provision should be granted, because the proposition was a genuine, commercial one which was designed primarily to maintain and, if possible, generate new employment.  It seems as though Fóir Teoranta might well be the competent authority in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister will recall that when we dealt with some other legislation recently, I referred to the fact that I had some discussions with the board of Fóir Teoranta when I was Minister for Finance on the question of the recruitment of managers employed by Fóir Teoranta to be put, on a secondment basis, into industries which were ailing. I will not go back over the ground as to why it was necessary to do it that way.  The Minister was kind enough to write to me since to tell me that Fóir Teoranta are recruiting staff for this purpose, something I was very pleased to hear.  I believe that Fóir Teoranta could be the competent authority in this area.  By implication from something the Minister said I think that the experience in Britain under similar legislation was unsatisfactory, but we have Fóir Teoranta which they have not got in Britain and, therefore, our experience need not be unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Competent as Fóir Teoranta may be in this matter, I do not think they are the complete answer to the problem.  I can visualise a situation in which Fóir Teoranta are involved and in which, by virtue of the circumstances <Col N="2325" /> obtaining, a tax loss benefit would be a far more attractive proposition than any assistance Fóir Teoranta might give in the normal way.  I understand that the normal way for them to give assistance is by investment or loan capital.  In such a case the complete abolition of the possibility of loss buying would mean that a weapon which would be available to Fóir Teoranta to induce a competent company to take over a failing one would be missing from their armoury.  There is another situation in which Fóir Teoranta play no part, that is, where there is a failing company who have made contact with a company which would be competent to take them over, and competent to maintain or expand their activities and employment and Fóir Teoranta are not involved in any way. The inducement which exists for the failing company to bring this about is the existence of the loss-buying device.</P>
    <P>I want to make this clear to the Minister.  We say with the Minister that this device should be abolished, subject to its being usable under control exercised either by the Revenue Commissioners on the recommendation of Fóir Teoranta or, alternatively, to its being available for use on the basis of a condition which would be written into the section along the lines suggested by Deputy Crowley.  These are alternative lines of approach.  While I accept unreservedly the Minister's concern in this regard, and his desire to keep an eye on developments in this situation, I am afraid that once we enact this section and the Schedule, and abolish the loss buying weapon, whatever may happen in the future, that will never become available, even under the control of the Government, exercised in whatever way is envisaged.</P>
    <P>In certain circumstances it is a very potent weapon which should not be lightly thrown away.  It is a weapon which in some circumstances could be more valuable than any other form of assistance which the State could make available and, as Deputy Crowley suggested, a weapon <Col N="2326" /> which could well be cheaper in many cases than any other weapon available to the State.  Although I do not rely entirely on that argument, it is a true argument.  There are circumstances I can visualise in which it would be a more attractive one to achieve what is involved, even if it were not a cheaper one for the State.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to accept that this device should be controlled rather than abolished, controlled by the Minister in one of the ways we have suggested, because it provides a weapon which could be very useful in the circumstances in which we find ourselves, and which I described earlier.  We would be foolish to throw that weapon away rather than hold on to it to be used under the control of the Government in circumstances where it would be appropriate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>From our information it appears at a rough calculation that the State is probably losing ten times more by the continuance of the present system than it would cost to give genuine direct State subventions to companies which were in genuine difficulties and would maintain employment. We have looked at several devices such as those mentioned here. It is not unlikely that if we give the authority to anybody else, Fóir Teoranta, the IDA, the Department of Industry and Commerce or any other group, they will end up by saying: &ldquo;Let the Revenue Commissioners carry the can.&rdquo;  We doubt very much that we would get the care in studying the situation which perhaps ought to be given to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hope that, as a result of this, we will collect far more revenue which is being lost to people who do not require it and that the State, getting that money, can afford to be more generous to Fóir Teoranta.  I have not as little faith as Deputy Carter in Fóir Teoranta.  They are a fairly new organisation.  They are only developing.  They are increasing their management and their experience. Deputy Carter seemed to visualise that possibly new management on the board of a company might imperil the company's situation which, of course, it would not.  This <Col N="2327" /> section of the amendment we are making applies only if a company is taken over and it is a question of a change of ownership.</P>
    <P>Some of Fóir Teoranta's greatest successes have been in the arrangement of marriages between successful companies and companies which were in difficulties, plus making available for the short-term management skills and appointing directors on the boards of companies which, because they had become stale and inward-looking, had lost the capacity which they had to make a profit.  I would not wish Deputy Colley to think I was saying that in Britain the stopping of this device meant that there were such losses.  I do not say that.  I am saying that, even if that were a danger, the situation in Ireland is not the same as in England because we have this built-in service to ensure that such losses will not arise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FlorenceCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>We all accept that what the Minister says is true.  I still think, as Deputy Colley said, that this is a very handy device to have available to us in the event of an ailing company.  Like Deputy Carter, I am afraid I have not got a great deal of faith in Fóir Teoranta.  I have had experience of Fóir Teoranta in one place only, and I must say that they did not satisfy my examination of their operations.  I must concede that perhaps I am not a qualified person to examine how effective or ineffective they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the future composition of Fóir Teoranta and the recruitment of managers to it, maybe I am old fashioned, but I believe a semi-State employee is not as effective in an industry as a private enterprise man who is depending on this business for his livelihood.  A manager who is taken into Fóir Teoranta has a certain guarantee of employment either as a civil servant or as a semi-civil servant, whereas the <i>entrepreneur</i> has got to make a go of that business; otherwise, he is out of business.  We have a very valuable device to use, maybe on rare occasions.  The Minister would do well to consider some way of shutting out the type of people we all want to shut <Col N="2328" /> out in the section, but at the same time leaving an opening there, maybe with the sanction of somebody in the Department of Industry and Commerce, so that, if a suitable firm came along to give a guarantee of employment over a certain period, first of all, we would have the people kept in their jobs and secondly, we would, perhaps, have it made into a profitable business. I would not measure it either.  I know the Minister for Finance must measure it in monetary terms, and certainly the Revenue Commissioners are, naturally, only interested in money.  I do not accept the Minister's calculation that if we get rid of this section we shall have ten times more revenue than we would otherwise have coming into the Exchequer.</P>

That is something you cannot evaluate in money terms.  Anyway, I do not think the Minister has his mind made up.  He is being very reasonable about it, and I think he would do well to give it further thought.</P>

I just want to say two things to him in relation to it: First, would he ensure, not alone as far as he is concerned but as far as the Revenue Commissioners are concerned, that the fact that we pass this legislation does not mean we have finally abolished the loss-buying device, that we are considering the possibility of re-introducing it, much as this may seem heresy to the Revenue Commissioners, under a controlled situation.  The door should not be closed on that possibility.</P>
      <P>The other matter I want to bring to the Minister's attention is something that impressed me very considerably in this context and I imagine it might impress the Minister, too.  A few years ago the late Con Smith, who was then the President of the FII and, as the Minister knows, died tragically in the air crash in London, urged me very strongly, indeed, as Minister for Finance to consider closing this loophole but applying control of some kind to bring about the kind of situation we have been trying to describe.  He felt it was something that could be very valuable to Irish industry.  He knew the problems of Irish Industry and was very dedicated to solving them.  I am not saying that this was the Gospel, but I do know the Minister will accept that when a man of that calibre was urging this there must be some value in the idea and it is well worth pursuing.</P>

      <P>Of course, the Revenue Commissioners cannot be asked to give any such undertaking; we are the legislators.  I am giving the undertaking that as far as I am concerned, and I am Minister, I shall certainly keep an open mind, and I shall be quite ready to introduce this under a system of adequate safeguards.</P>

      <P>I would point out to the Minister for Finance and to the ex-Minister for Finance, who seem to <Col N="2330" /> have great faith in State effort&mdash;no doubt it is very useful&mdash;that there is a very important principle involved here.  I do not want to delay the Bill &mdash;I want to give it to the Minister&mdash; but when one encroaches too far on business enterprise one may well wind up worse than one began, in the sense that Fóir Teoranta is a young organisation recruiting personnel.  When will the personnel be trained?  When will the personnel have the experience of going through the mill like those who have to earn a living in business?</P>
      <P>No doubt the Revenue Commissioners are interested in extracting tax from the company if it is successful. That is the extent of the interest of the Revenue Commissioners.  That is their job and they are doing a good job.  However, I cautioned at the outset that lines should not be crossed too much.  It is an area in which one could work in compartments and I am asserting now that there is no substitute for well informed private enterprise when it comes to running a business.  That is as we know it up to now, apart from the semi-State companies which we have here.  I am not finding any fault with that effort, but when it comes to this area, the Minister should be selective in applying the provisions of this section other than to loss-buying, which is blatant and well known.  If that takes place, he is fully entitled to press home all the provisions in the section.  But in doing so in another direction he could trample on the toes of those who would make better progress if left to the workings of private enterprise.</P>

      <P>This is to deal with a tax avoidance device whereby certain contrived transactions enable the cost of an industrial building to be written off for tax purposes at a greatly accelerated rate.  I would not normally describe how tax avoidance can be engaged in but when we are about to stop it I suppose there is no harm.  Avoidance can be achieved by the claiming of a balancing allowance under section 265 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, on a sale of the relevant interest in the building where the value of the interest has been artifically reduced.  For example, a company who have incurred expenditure on an industrial building may grant a long lease, say for 999 years, of the premises to an associated company and merely retain the reversion.  The reversion is of little value and the company may then sell the reversion at its very low market value to another associated company and by so doing they can claim a large balancing allowance by reference to the original cost of the building, less the proceeds of sale and the tax allowance already granted.  Some cases of this kind have come to notice. They are probably an imitation of what has happened in Britain on an even larger scale and it is of interest that in the U.K. Parliament they cured the loophole in their Finance Act of 1972, and if we do not do it soon this will become a prevalent tax avoidance practice.</P>

      <P>We have no objection to this section.  The only comment I want to make is that it seems to me that some of the drafting of it is rather loose and unlike the kind of wording one usually gets in a Finance Bill.  It may be because of the nature of the problem being dealt with that it is necessary to do that.</P>
      <P>The only specific point I wish to bring to the Minister's attention is on page 23, line 12 which begins:</P>
      <P>it appears with respect to the sale or the grant of the inferior interest, ...that the sole or main benefit...</P>

      <P>This section is intended to put an end to a tax avoidance device which enables certain benefits in kind to escape tax liability by virtue of their being provided not by the employing company but by an associated company.  Section 117 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, provides broadly that where a body corporate <Col N="2334" /> incurs expenses in providing for its directors or employees certain benefits in kind, living or other accommodation, entertainment, domestic and other services, any part of the expense which the director or employee does not pay for is treated as an endowment of his office or employment. A number of companies have got around this by not providing the benefit themselves but by having the benefit provided by an associated company and in that way have been able to escape the impact of tax.  This proposes to cure that situation.</P>

      <P>Chapter III of Part V of the Income Tax Act, 1967, now contains the provisions, originally enacted in 1958, under which the value of certain benefits in kind provided by a body corporate for the benefit of directors or employees are included as income for tax purposes. In the case of employees, the provisions apply only where the emoluments exceed £1,500.</P>
      <P>Section 121 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, provided that the provisions were not to apply in the case of any body corporate unless it carried on a trade or its functions consisted wholly or mainly in the holding of investments or other property.  It has come to light that some of these non-trading bodies are providing employees with benefits in kind, for example, motor cars, and there is no reason why these employees should not also be subject to a tax charge in respect of such benefits, in the same way as employees of trading bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the present section is to secure that section 121 of the Finance Act, 1967, will cease to have effect as from 1973-74.  The result will be that benefits in kind provided by non-trading bodies such as semi-State bodies, charities, trade unions, professional associations and any other concern not carrying on a trade will be charged to tax in the hands of the employees in the same way as <Col N="2335" /> benefits in kind provided by trading companies.</P>
    <P>Bodies which will now come within the scope of the legislation include semi-State bodies such as Bord Fáilte, Bord na gCapall, Bord na gCon and Córas Tráchtála, and certain other non-trading bodies such as professional associations.  The repeal of section 121 has effect from the year 1973-74, inclusive.  In other words, what we are doing is once again putting everyone on an equal basis.  If other people are charged with these items, we see no reason why people in any particular situation should be exempt.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this section is to make the penalties for non-compliance with the PAYE regulations more effective by (i) extending the scope of section 128 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, to cover failure to remit PAYE deductions to the Collector-General and (ii) by imposing a separate penalty of £20 on the secretary where the person failing to comply with the regulations is a body of persons.</P>
      <P>Section 128 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, imposes penalties for non-compliance with requirements, under PAYE regulations, to send returns, statements, <i>et cetera,</i> or to make PAYE deductions.  The penalty prescribed is £20 plus £20 per day where the non-compliance continues.  These penalties will now apply also to failure to remit to the Collector-General the tax so deducted as will also the new additional penalty of £20 on the secretary where the defaulter is a body of persons.</P>
      <P>The effect of this is to ensure that deductions which are made from the employee's pay-packet, and having been made, do not belong to the employer, that they be remitted to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>There is only one point I wish to raise on this section. So far as I know, on Second Stage, Deputy Haughey raised a question in regard to the provisions of paragraph (b), that is, the making liable of the secretary for a penalty and he pointed out, rightly, that in many cases the secretary of a company is a clerk or a typist in a solicitor's or accountant's office.  If that is so it seems unwise, <Col N="2337" /> to say the least, to provide for what appears to be a mandatory penalty on the secretary.  I can understand that some individual should be liable but surely it is not right to say that this person shall be the secretary.</P>

      <P>I must emphasise that the penalty is not capable of being imposed by the Revenue Commissioners. This will arise only in the case of a person being prosecuted for failure to pay in respect of which the court might impose a penalty.  In practice, the Revenue Commissioners do not institute proceedings against people for delay in paying tax unless they are in continuing default.  Therefore, this penalty is not one that would become applicable to the overwhelming majority of tax payers who, for various reasons, might be in delay. The penalty would apply only where there is culpable and obvious default in payment.</P>

They must prosecute, apparently, both the body of persons and the secretary because where the body of persons is in default, the secretary shall be liable to a separate penalty.  That is how I read the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have a discretion as to whether they should prosecute.  They could decide whether to prosecute one or both.

The Revenue Commissioners are not too responsive to requests for refunds.  I would suggest that the Minister should give at least to the 20th of the month instead of the 6th, which would give roughly 14 days in order to prepare the returns.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> This is the fourth section in this Bill where the Minister is imposing additional penalties on people who collect PAYE and return it without being paid for it.  The Minister has stated several times that this is money that belongs to the State and that it should be returned as soon as possible. Admittedly, this should be done but <Col N="2340" /> it is not always possible for traders to do so.  I am not sure that the best way to get the co-operation of traders in returning PAYE is to put additional penalties on them on every possible occasion.  This is not the first Finance Bill that I have criticised in relation to the same matter.  This is tackling the situation in the wrong way.  In the next section the same thing happens.  It is the wrong approach.  The majority of traders are returning the money promptly and the number who are falling down on their commitment is very small.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 26, before section 44, to insert the following section:</P>
      <P>Section 335 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, is hereby amended by the addition thereto of the following subsections:</P>
      <P>(2)  A registered friendly society shall not be entitled to exemption from tax under this section in relation to any year of assessment, being the year 1973-74 or any subsequent year, if the Revenue Commissioners determine, for the purposes of entitlement to exemption for that year, that the society does not satisfy the following conditions:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  that it was established solely for any or all of the purposes <Col N="2341" /> set out in section 8 (1) of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, and not for the purpose of securing a tax advantage;</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>(b)  that, since its establishment, it has engaged solely in activities directed to achieving the purposes for which it was so established and that it has not engaged in trading activities, other than by way of insurance in respect of members, with a view to the realisation of profits.</P>
    <P>(3)  In making a determination under this section in relation to a registered friendly society, the Revenue Commissioners shall consider any evidence in relation to the matter submitted to them by the society.</P>
    <P>(4)  In any case where a friendly society is aggrieved by a determination of the Revenue Commissioners under this section in relation to the society, the society shall be entitled to appeal to the Appeal Commissioners against the determination of the Revenue Commissioners and the Appeal Commissioners shall hear and determine the appeal as if it were an appeal against an assessment to income tax and the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1967, relating to the rehearing of an appeal and the statement of a case for the opinion of the High Court on a point of law shall apply accordingly with any necessary modifications.</P>
    <P>This amendment substitutes a new section to take the place of section 40 of the Bill.  That section is an antiavoidance provision designed to prevent the tax exemption in favour of friendly societies from being used so as to provide tax-free profits for wealthy members of such societies resulting from trading transactions.  The profits from these transactions are exempt from tax in the hands of the societies and the funds of the societies could be distributed among the members either during the life of the <Col N="2342" /> society or on a dissolution.  The accumulated tax-free funds so divided would be a distribution of assets and would not be chargeable to tax in the hands of the members.</P>
    <P>Section 40 proposed to counter these avoidance arrangements by treating any distribution of funds to members as a receipt by them of income chargeable to income tax.</P>
    <P>It is understood, however, that it is proposed to escape this charging provision by ensuring that the surplus funds of the societies will not be distributed to members but will come into their hands by way of loans which will never be repaid.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, it is thought that a more satisfactory approach to the problem, which would be much simpler and more effective, would be to attach specific conditions to the exemption provided for under section 335 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  This is what the new provision to be substituted for section 40 proposes to do.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes to add two new subsections to section 335 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, which is the section providing the exemption in favour of friendly societies.</P>
    <P>The new subsection (2) is intended to restrict the exemption to <i>bona fide</i> cases.  It is to be noted, however, that the exemption will apply unless the Revenue Commissioners make a determination in relation to a society that it has not satisfied the conditions&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  that it was established solely for the purposes set out in section 8 (1) of the Friendly Societies Act, 1896, and not for the purpose of securing a tax advantage, that is, the exemption under the section.</P>
    <P>The purposes set out in section 8 (1) of the Friendly Societies Act are listed here and I can indicate them, if Deputies wish.</P>
    <P>(b)  that, since its establishment, the society has engaged solely in activities directed to achieving the purposes for which it was established and has not engaged in trading activities, other than by way of insurance in respect of members, with a view to the realisation of profits.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2343" /> In the avoidance cases, which have come to notice the objects of the societies are, as specified in their rules to provide by voluntary subscriptions of the members, with or without the aid of donations, for&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  insuring money to be paid on the death of a member, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the endowment of members at the age of sixty (60) years.</P>
    <P>The statutory limits for insurance, namely £50 a year by way of annuity and £1,000 by way of gross sum, are written into the rules.</P>
    <P>These societies which apparently are to engage in the buying of property worth millions of pounds and the investing of similar amounts of money in associated companies by way of debentures could not validly claim that these activities were directed to achieving the objects specified in their rules, bearing in mind that there are only seven or eight members to be covered by the modest insurance provided</P>
    <P>It is to be noted that the exemption is to apply unless the Revenue Commissioners determine, after consideration of any evidence submitted by a society, that the conditions specified have not been satisfied by the society, this procedure of determination is similar to that provided in respect of the &ldquo;artists' exemption&rdquo; under section 2 of the Finance Act, 1969.  A determination can only be made for the current year 1973-74 or any subsequent year but there is no provision as to when it is to be made, since this ought to be done only when the Commissioners had received, from the society concerned, particulars of its activities.  A society set up for tax avoidance purposes is, however, unlikely to be forthcoming about its activities and there could be considerable delay in obtaining the necessary information.  In that event, the Commissioners could make a determination, on the basis of the available evidence, the number and identity of the members of the society, which may consist of a wealthy businessman and his wife and four or five assistants in the solicitor's or accountant's <Col N="2344" /> office that the society did not satisfy condition (a), namely, that it was established solely for the purposes of the Friendly Societies Act and not for the purpose of securing a tax advantage. The Commissioners are not, however, the final arbiters of a society's title to exemption since provision for appeal is contained in sub-section (3).</P>
    <P>Subsection (3) provides that any society aggrieved by a determination of the Revenue Commissioners may appeal to the appeal commissioners who will then hear and determine the appeal in the same way as they would hear and determine an appeal against an assessment to income tax. The consequential appeal provisions, namely, a re-hearing by the Circuit Court judge and an appeal to the High Court on a point of law also apply.</P>

      <P>I was under the impression that the general loopholes through which it had been found friendly societies were escaping the tax net had been closed a few years ago and yet what the Minister is saying does not appear to be a recent development.  Could he possibly give an example of the kind of case that is arising at present and that will be caught and prevented when this section is enacted?  Are these friendly societies&mdash;they seem to be from what the Minister said&mdash;engaged in the purchase on a fairly extensive scale of property&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not like to give details because the House has always very properly observed confidentiality but I can tell the House what is happening. A small group of people noted for their personal wealth can put £10 million into a friendly society&mdash;which is not the kind of money the traditional friendly society would acquire. The friendly society can then engage in trade, building, purchasing land and so on.  All the property becomes the property of the society and at <Col N="2345" /> some future date the friendly society can dissolve and distribute its assets among the members which is a very simple device for making money without paying tax.  Since I announced in the budget my intention to close this gap it has become apparent that the way they propose to avoid it is not to make a distribution but to make a loan to an associated company. The members of the associated company can then break up that company or collect the money because the money has been given out on indefinite loan which need never be repaid because it would be merely repaying oneself.  The obvious way to present this dodge is to provide that the exemption will apply unless the Revenue Commissioners certify that it would appear on the basis of the evidence that it is not a society which was set up for genuine objectives for which friendly societies were first envisaged.</P>

      <P>Is the section so wide that it will create difficulties for a genuine friendly society?  One of the phrases that strikes me in the whole new section is that it has not &ldquo;engaged in trading activity&rdquo;.  The Minister did not read out the list of objects envisaged for a friendly society by the Friendly Societies Acts but surely trading activity in some form is included? I am frequently confused as to the difference between a friendly society and an industrial and provident society.  Am I right in thinking that many co-operative creameries are friendly societies in some cases and industrial and provident societies in others?  If that is so, will this provision not cause a great deal of difficulty for them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act of 1896 which governs friendly societies will, I think, show something of the difference between its objectives and the way friendly societies are being used or, perhaps, misused.  It says that a friendly society is a society for the purpose of providing by the voluntary subscriptions of the members thereof with or without the aid of donations for</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  relief or maintenance of the <Col N="2346" /> members, their husbands, wives, children, fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, nephews or nieces or wards being orphans, during sickness or other infirmity, whether bodily or mental, in old age, which shall mean any age after 50, or in widowhood, or for the relief or maintenance of the orphan children of members during minority; or</P>
    <P>(b)  insuring money to be paid on the birth of a member's child or on the death of a member or for the funeral expenses of the husband, wife or child of a member or of a widow or a deceased member or, as respects persons of the Jewish persuasion, for the payment of a sum of money during the period of confined mourning, or</P>
    <P>(c)  for the relief or maintenance of the members then on travel in search of employment...</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly the kind of people with £10 million to throw around are not the people who require relief and maintenance while &ldquo;in search of employment, or when in distressed circumstances, or in the case of shipwreck, or loss or damage of a boat and so on.&rdquo;  It goes on dealing with cases of quite considerable personal grief.  These societies were devised at a time when there was no State welfare code to provide for matters of this kind.  The number of friendly societies is diminishing.</P>

      <P>I was about to ask the question which Deputy O'Malley <Col N="2347" /> asked.  I was very worried because I thought co-operatives were friendly societies.  When co-operatives are formed it is essential that they should go into other business and they form another co-operative and take shares or loans in this society.  I was worried as to whether these would be caught in the Minister's net.  I agree that evasion of taxation should be prevented but these co-operatives are for the benefit of the country as a whole and they are widespread.  I am not an expert on finance but I would like to have the point made clear.  I understood co-operatives were friendly societies.  I was worried that they might be caught in this provision to prevent tax evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  If the Deputy looks at the amendment he will see that it is proposed that existing exemptions will apply to all societies except those in respect of which the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that they were established and operated for tax avoidance purposes, but would not apply to genuine societies of the type the Deputy has in mind.  The certificate that a society was a tax avoidance device would be given in the case of a society such as I have spoken about, where millions of pounds are handed over so that profit can be made without carrying tax liability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say whether at present there is a maximum amount beyond which a friendly society may not lend money?  I thought that the maximum was something in the region of £200 to £300.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is why I am anxious.  The loan would not be made to the members of the friendly societies, since what friendly societies can lend to a member is less than £1,000.  However, there is nothing to stop friendly societies making the loan to somebody else other than a member.  What is apparently now developing is the proposal to lend the money to an associated company.  There is nothing to prevent the members of this associated company being the same people who are members of the friendly society.  So they would simply take the <Col N="2348" /> money out of one pocket and put it into the other.  That is the practice.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to engage in a re-hash of the budget debate, but I do not want to underline the fact that this section represents one, and only one, of the many new taxes imposed in the budget.  These taxes amount to a very substantial sum but, most objectionable of all from our point of view, and from the point of view of the ordinary taxpayer, is the fact that a considerable amount of the new taxation being imposed, including the taxes being imposed under this section, is, in our view, being imposed unnecessarily.</P>
      <P>One of the purposes for which taxation is being raised is the relief of rates on office blocks and other commercial properties.  This is a proposition we do not agree with and never did agree with it.  We object to the ordinary man-in-the-street being taxed to contribute to the relief of rates on office blocks and other commercial properties.  For that reason we oppose this section.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> I agree with Deputy Colley.  I do not think that these additional taxes were due, especially in respect of beer. There is no doubt that we do not consider beer a luxury any more and that the Customs and Excise are taking a considerable portion, over 50 per cent, in revenue today.  As Deputy Colley has pointed out, the working man will have to contribute a part of this to defray the additional cost which it will take to reduce the rates on office blocks and various other kinds of commercial enterprises.</P>
      <P>For this reason I believe that this was a bad decision.  I do not think it will help tourism.  We are going away out of line as regards other countries in relation to taxation, and the policy of the Government to try to encourage tourists to visit this country.  I do not believe that with these additional taxes the Government are doing the right thing.  The Government were wrong in imposing this additional taxation.</P>
      <P>The reliefs given could have been given without these increases.  As we approach a new national wage agreement I feel sure that workers will take this additional taxation into consideration. There is no good in the Minister saying that they will not, because these are factors in the daily lives of people.  The Minister was wrong in introducing these additional taxes this year.  I agree with Deputy Colley that this was a mistake.</P>

      <Col N="2350" /> This situation has been brought about by the enormous increases in this year's budget in the duty on spirits and in the duty on beer.  The duty on spirits has been increased by seven old pence per glass and the increase on beer is 2.4 old pence per pint.</P>

      <P>This, unfortunately, was done at a time when, through circumstances which are beyond everybody's control in this country, the tourist industry here was going through a bad period.  The tourist industry needed every encouragement this year to let it get back on its feet again. Earlier in the tourist season there seemed to be good prospects but those prospects, unfortunately, do not seem to be working out as well as everybody had hoped.</P>
      <P>One major factor in the fact that they are not working out is that these increases were imposed by the Government. These increases were imposed deliberately by the Government to put up the cost of living, particularly, in a way that would do considerable harm to our tourist industry.</P>
      <P>This section is one of the three sections which is imposing this additional burden on the tourist industry.  It is one of the many sections in this Bill which deliberately puts up the cost of living.  It is a deliberate act on the part of the Government in an inflationary situation.  It seems to us to be an act of criminal lunacy to do it and, for that reason, we are opposed to this section.</P>

      <P>At the time of the budget debate Members on this side of the House consistently warned the Minister that the action he was taking by imposing these savage increases on the price of beer and spirits would set an inflationary tone.  The proof of this has been reflected in the report published in this morning's newspapers. We warned the Minister that the savage increases he was imposing would affect our tourist trade.  Anybody in this Chamber or among the general public who has met tourists from Great Britain has listened to them express the complaint that the price of beer was very high compared with their own country.</P>
      <P>We have warned the Minister about many aspects of this proposed increase but he has gone ahead, in my opinion in a very foolhardy fashion, and continued to press for these increases. The effect of this increase on the workers at a time when, as Deputy Fitzpatrick mentioned, we are coming up to a new national wage agreement is that there are bound to be justifiable calls for a substantial increase in wages.  The Minister has made a great error and it will not surprise me if this causes a snowball effect which will have repercussions on everyone in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing now with one of a number of increases provided for in the budget and it is one which has set the pattern. In today's papers there is a whole string of increases.  The cost of living has increased and, for good measure, so has the cost of dying; the price of coffins has gone up.  The Minister <Col N="2352" /> set out deliberately on a price spiral. These duties are already in operation. Previous speakers spoke about the effect on the tourist industry.  I come from a Border constituency and, God knows, we have plenty of troubles militating against the tourist industry and now the Minister and his Government create a situation in which one can walk into a supermarket in Belfast and buy beer and spirits cheaper than the publican can buy them from the wholesaler here.  This is a situation which never existed before.  It is a situation in which the Government are putting yet another nail in the coffin of the tourist industry.  There is nothing we can do about it now the duties are in operation.  We have the highest priced beer in these islands, higher than it is in Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland. We are at the top of the league. This situation is due to the action taken by the Minister and that action is causing a chain reaction.  Every day prices are increasing.  Some are sanctioned officially by the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  What about the unofficial increases about which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is doing nothing, except on paper?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be able to tell the House what, I am sure, Deputy Fitzpatrick knows.  Since the budget, beer shows great buoyancy from the point of view of sales.  Sales are above what they were last year and beyond what was anticipated without any change in tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure who is causing the despair; it is certainly not the Government of the day.  That shows the additional money people have in their pockets and it shows, to use a phrase the present President was very fond of, that the increase in tax had a nugatory effect upon consumption. <Col N="2354" /> Consumption is, in fact, higher. That, I think, completely dispels the arguments advanced by the Opposition.</P>
      <P>Some speakers referred to the price of beer in Dublin and Belfast.  Some Deputies only know about things when they read them in the papers.  What was said about the North shows how little they know about the North.  They only knew today when they read their papers that beer is cheaper in the North than it is in the South.  That has been the situation for a long time.  It is not a new development.  This is a fair indication of how little some people know about the North.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Coogan pointed out, the tourist traffic is on the increase and I am quite sure the decline in the past cannot be attributed solely to the price of beer.  I have no doubt inflation had a dampening effect.  Unfortunately, the really dampening effect is a tragedy beyond our control.  I would suggest that at this late hour, with so many sections still to do, we could, without injustice to anyone, get on with the job of dealing with this financial legislation which is so important.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides that from 17th May, 1973, the main rates of customs and excise duties on spirits shall be increased by £2.605 per proof gallon.  As a result, the increase in the budget duty element on a glass of spirits is 2.85p.  As I said earlier in relation to beer, I am happy to report that the sales are quite buoyant and everybody is in the best of spirits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This represents what can only be described as a savage increase, and despite the Minister's previous juggling with percentage figures, the fact is there never has been an increase of the same amount in spirits in the past.  If we were not under the time pressure that we are to deal with the whole of the Finance Bill we would be voting against this section, too.  In the circumstances, I merely wish to place on record that we have precisely the same objections to this section as we have to the previous one, but we do not intend to vote for the reason I have given.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly the same remarks as I have made in relation to the section on spirits applies to the section on tobacco.  Again, in different circumstances, we would have been voting against this section, but in the circumstances I have outlined we shall not do so.  I want to ask the Minister in relation to this section whether there is provision in the Bill, because it is not very obvious to me, for the easement for hard or plug tobacco which has now become traditional?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it does not.  As far as I am aware, tobacco, be it cut plug or hard pressed plug has been increased by 4p per ounce.  In previous budgets Ministers on this side of the House provided for a rebate for hard pressed tobacco, which is looked upon as the poor man's smoke.  Like Deputy Colley, I cannot see in this Bill that this special rebate off that 4p has been given.  In my opinion, cut tobacco has gone up 4p per ounce and so has hard pressed tobacco.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the base for each of the tobacco is different, there being a built-in advantage for the hard plug.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance in the past gave a rebate on hard pressed tobacco.  When the duty on tobacco was increased cigarettes went up, cut plug went up, but they gave a rebate on hard-pressed tobacco.  In this budget we are still getting the rebate but in this section of the Bill the Minister is giving no rebate on the 4 pence per ounce by which he has increased the price of hard-pressed tobacco.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister could tell us &mdash; on the last occasion, say, on which duty on tobacco was increased was there a special rebate introduced at that time in respect of hard-pressed tobacco or on the occasion before that on which the duty on tobacco was increased was there such a special provision introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been endeavouring to find the date of the origin of the rebate.  It was many years ago. This distinction is becoming of less importance because the number of people consuming hard-pressed tobacco is reducing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Irrespective of the merits or demerits we ought to get the facts clear in relation to it.  Is the Minister saying that on previous occasions when duty on tobacco was increased the same increase applied to, say, flake tobacco as to hard-pressed tobacco?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year or the year before there may have been an increase of one or two old pence on the packet of cigarettes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>This year there has been the biggest increase ever in tobacco duty.  A Government would have to get out of office if they had increased the packet of cigarettes by seven old pence which is the increase in the recent budget or if tobacco went up by almost two shillings a half quarter.  The reason why there was not a rebate given for hard pressed tobacco in the last budget, <Col N="2359" /> when there was an increase in duty, was I understand, due to the fact that it was a very small increase.  This time cigarettes have gone up by seven old pence and a half quarter of tobacco looked on as the old age pensioners' smoke, the poor man's smoke, the country man's smoke, has gone up by almost two shillings and the Minister gave no rebate on this hard pressed tobacco.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister explain the reasons that motivated him to apply across the board the increase on tobacco as distinct from what had become a practice over recent years, not applying it to the hard pressed, plug tobaccos?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some years ago there was a rebate given in favour of the hard pressed tobacco.  It is a long time ago.  Since then there have been increases in tobacco duties without giving a further rebate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not answered my question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We may as well get the figures.  The rebates granted to home manufacturers of hard pressed and other piped tobaccos continue to apply this year at the existing rates of £1.875 per pound and £0.225 per pound respectively.  That is the value of the rebate in favour of the hard pressed tobacco, which is fairly sizeable. I am not sure whether the Deputy was asking me why it is applied. It is applied because we are now getting into a situation in which the consumption of hard pressed tobacco is becoming negligible, and, having regard to the quite sizeable rebate which already exists, I do not think there is any need to increase it.  It is not, having regard to the considerable social welfare benefits, a matter of any significance in the budget of a hard pressed tobacco smoker particularly when he has the rebate which he has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must have been very hard pressed when he took the last ounce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I plugged for <Col N="2360" /> an increase.  Deputy Blaney asked me on the day of the budget whether I did it for revenue purposes or for health purposes and I answered: &ldquo;both&rdquo;.  It may be a matter of concern to the Minister for Health to know that since the budget the consumption of tobacco is increasing and the likelihood is that by the end of the year it may be above what we anticipated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has plugged his point and twisted it a little bit.  He stated that the amount of revenue coming from hard-pressed tobacco is falling because the consumption is decreasing.  That is all the more reason to give this traditional rebate to the poor people who smoke hard-pressed tobacco.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> There is a difference in the amount of tobacco that is in a tipped cigarette and the amount that is in a non-tipped one.  The content in respect of the tipped cigarette is much less than in the other case but in the budget there was an extra 3p imposed on a packet of either type.  Therefore, there will be a considerable gain to the manufacturers if they are allowed impose the 3p on both types.  Can the Minister say if any guideline has been given to manufacturers in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to answer that question, as I indicated on the budget debate, because there is such a variation both in the tipped and non-tipped types of cigarettes in relation to size, concentration of leaf, length of the filter and so on.  What is done is that the tax is imposed at what I might call the quantity level.  The quantity of tobacco in cigarettes is a matter for each manufacturer who, of course, must go through the ordinary procedures in relation to prices.  That is a matter for the Department of Industry and Commerce and for the National Prices Commission but it is not one for the Revenue Commissioners. They apply the tax on the tobacco.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 29, subsection (1), line 14, to delete &ldquo;subsection (2)&rdquo;, and to substitute &ldquo;subsections (2) and (3).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>With your, permission, Sir, I will deal with amendments Nos. 5 and 6 together.  Section 49 provides for an imposition of an excise duty at a rate of £0.627 a 1b. on all duty-paid stocks of manufactured and unmanufactured tobacco held by tobacco manufacturers at 5 p.m. on budget day, 16th May, 1973.  This level of duty is the same as the increase in rate applied by section 48 to tobacco on which customs and excise duty has yet to be paid.  The special duty led to representations from the smaller tobacco manufacturers who sought to have the duty payable on their stocks remitted. Their case rested largely on their contention that they would be unable to shift the increase to their customers in the immediate post-budget period.  The present amendments are the outcome of these recommendations.  I commend them to the House.  The cost of these concessions is approximately £5,000.</P>
      <P>It might be of interest to the hard-pressed brigade to know that the people who benefit mainly from this concession are the manufacturers of hard pressed tobacco.</P>

      <P>Under the Imposition of Duties Act, 1957, as amended by section 22 of the Finance Act, 1962, the Government may, by order, make changes in customs and excise duties and stamp duties.  Such orders must be confirmed by an Act of the Oireachtas by the end of the year following that in which they are made, if they are not to lapse.</P>
      <P>The following orders require to be confirmed by the end of this year:</P>
      <P>S.I. No. 162 of 1972 &mdash; Imposition of Duties (No. 199) (Excise Duties) (Firearms Certificates) Order, 1972 &mdash; this order increased the excise duty payable on certain firearm certificates; S.I. No. 220 of 1972 &mdash; Imposition of Duties (No. 200) (Customs and Excise Duties and Form of Tariff) Order, 1972&mdash;</P>
      <P>the effects of the order were:</P>
      <P>(i)  to convert the Customs Tariff nomenclature to that of the EEC Common Customs Tariff;</P>
      <P>(ii)  to introduce the Nimexe system of statistical classification for imports and exports;</P>
      <P>(iii)  to convert the units of quantity at a number of tariff headings to metric terms;</P>
      <P>(iv)  to eliminate the customs duty on coal;</P>
      <P>(v)  to make certain other changes in the form of Customs Tariff.  The order came into operation on 1st January, 1973.</P>
      <P>The remaining Orders mentioned in the section would not have to be confirmed until the end of 1974, but are included here for convenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>S.I. No. 4 of 1973 &mdash; Imposition of Duties (No. 201) (Customs Duties and Form of Customs Tariff) Order, 1973. This order restored the correct duty position of a number of items, namely, certain kinds of paper, building materials of asbestos cement, and hinges suitable for motor vehicles, on which the incidence of duty was inadvertently altered in the course of the transposition of our Customs Tariff nomenclature to that of the EEC Common Customs Tariff.  A number of minor editorial changes were also made in the form of Customs <Col N="2365" /> Tariff.  The order came into operation on 11th January, 1973.</P>
    <P>S.I. No. 68 of 1973 &mdash; Imposition of Duties (No. 202) (Customs and Excise Duties and Form of Tariff) Order, 1973.  This order extended the scheme of tariff preferences for developing countries to Western Samoa, Bhutan, Cuba, Fiji, Nauru, Oman Sikkim and Tonga.</P>
    <P>S.I. No. 71 of 1973 &mdash; Imposition of Duties (No. 203) (Customs Duties and Form of Customs Tariff) Order, 1973. This order provides for the correction of certain anomalies in rates of Customs duty arising from Ireland's adoption of the EEC Common Customs Tariff Nomenclature, removes the duty on newsprint and on motorvehicle fanbelts of Northern Ireland origin and makes certain consequential changes in rates of duty for the general scheme of tariff preferences applied to developing countries.  A number of minor editorial changes are also made in the form of Customs Tariff.</P>
    <P>S.I. No. 72 of 1973 &mdash; Imposition of Duties (No. 204) (Customs Duties and Form of Customs Tariff) Order, 1973. This order provided for the rates of Customs duty to be applied to certain goods of United Kingdom and Northern Ireland origin.</P>
    <P>S.I. No. 83 of 1973 &mdash; Imposition of Duties (No. 205) (Beer, Spirits, Tobacco, Hydrocarbon Oils and Wine) Order, 1973.  This order removed certain minor protective elements in the customs duties on beer, spirits in recognised medical preparation, tobacco and hydrocarbon oils in the case of imports from other EEC member states and (for hydrocarbon oils and for spirits in recognised medical preparations) from the following EFTA non-applicant countries &mdash; Austria, Iceland, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland.</P>
    <P>There is no home production of wine of the kind which is classified at tariff heading 22.06 and the rates in the tariff were aligned to reflect this position.  The order came into operation on 1st April, 1973.</P>

      <P>Could I just say to the Minister in relation to the first of those orders in that table &mdash; Imposition of Duties (No. 199) (Excise Duties) (Firearms Certificates) Order, 1972 &mdash; that that was made by the Government at my request in July, 1972, for security reasons and not for revenue-raising reasons.  We brought about a fairly drastic increase in the duty payable on a firearms certificate for all types of firearms other than shotguns.  We did it in that way rather than by a section in a Finance Bill because, hopefully, we envisaged its being not a permanent measure. Clearly, the security situation in the country at the moment would not warrant its repeal or even its amendment.  I mention this simply to tell the Government that our intention at the time was not to raise revenue from it.  Indeed, little or no extra revenue was raised from it because shortly after that order was made I called in all licensed guns above a certain calibre with the result that no certificates were taken out for them for the licensing year which began on 1st August, 1972.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, I am not suggesting that anything would be done at the moment to change what was done then.  I am just putting it on record now for the benefit of the Minister that at such time as the security situation improves he might consider then reverting, if not right back to the original fees, which were rather small, to lesser fees than now exist.  Representations were made to me by gun clubs and other groups of organised and genuine sportsmen that many of their members suffered considerable hardship as a result of these heavily increased fees.  I accepted that they did.  I have no doubt that a number of perfectly <i>bona fide</i> people suffered rather heavily as a result.  I did say to them at the time that it was done simply for security purposes, not to raise revenue; that if it did bring in revenue that was purely incidental <Col N="2367" /> and that we would certainly give consideration to a fairly drastic decrease in the fees even though it might not go back to the original figure when that time came.  It has not come yet.  I mention it so that the Minister could bear it in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have no doubt that when the Minister for Justice considers it appropriate to relax the extra costs and disciplines imposed on people by this order he will seek to have the order amended.  There are, of course, a large number of revenue collection items like this which are, in fact, more costly to the revenue than the yield in profit to the Revenue. I think I can speak for the Revenue Commissioners and, indeed, for all Ministers for Finance, when I say that they would be only too happy to be free of the responsibility of collecting and handling many of these licence fees but while they exist they have to be collected and, in accordance with the Constitution, they must go into the central pool.</P>
      <P>Recently there was a question in relation to dog licences and the cost of administration.  I made the point that they exist, not for the sake of collecting revenue.  I accept what Deputy O'Malley says here, that this order was made, not for the purpose of collecting revenue but simply to provide control. Nothing controls human behaviour as much as money.  That is, the principle underlying orders of this kind.</P>

      <Col N="2368" /> SECTION 52.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 52 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section imposes a new scale of rates of estate duty.  The new rates apply to the estates of persons dying on or after 16th May, 1973.  The existing scale is unchanged for estates over £10,000 in value. Estates under £10,000 in value will be exempt from duty since no rate of duty is prescribed for them.  When an estate exceeds £10,000, the entire estate will be dutiable at the appropriate rate.</P>
      <P>Raising the general exemption limit to £10,000 will have the effect of relieving approximately 530 cases from liability to estate duty each year.  The cost of this relief is estimated to be £330,000 in a full year and £160,000 in the current year.  The new exemption limit will not have statutory effect until the Act is passed.  It is necessary, therefore, to provide that any duty assessed on an estate, valued between £7,500 and £10,000, of a person dying between 16th May, 1973, and the date of the passing of the Act will be repaid.</P>
      <P>This is more in the nature of a notional provision than one which is really necessary because I doubt whether any estate has yet been administered in respect of a person who died as recently as April.</P>

The law in general prohibits registration of a trade mark if an identical trade mark is already on the Irish register in the name of a different proprietor in respect of the same goods or goods of the same description.

      <P>Particulars of annual life assurance and non-life insurance premiums collected in Ireland by Irish and non-Irish companies up to 1970 inclusive may be obtained from the Summary of Statements of Assurance Business published annually by my Department, copies of which are in the Library.

      <P>As regards investment here by insurance companies, only a part of the money received in premiums is available for investment and, accordingly, it has been the practice to calculate investments, not as a proportion of premiums, but as a proportion of the insurance funds.  While exact figures are not available, the proportion of funds invested in Ireland by Irish and British life offices is over 70 per cent in both cases.  Figures for non-life, which are, of course, much less substantial, are not known.  Investment by insurance companies in private housing in the four years 1969-70 to 1972-73 has been £6.77 million, £6.77 million, £7.91 million, and £6.86 million.</P>

      <P>Charges made by mortgage broking firms come within the scope of the Prices Acts and accordingly such firms are required under the Prices and Charges (Notification of Increases) Orders, 1973 to give me two months' notice of any proposed increase in their charges.  I have also power to fix maximum charges in respect of such firms.  I have no evidence to indicate that it is necessary to introduce legislation to control the activities of these firms or to provide for the disclosure of the information mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>They have stated in their report for May, 1973, that there would be technical difficulties in providing legislation to ban trading stamps and they recommend instead that the stamp company should be compelled to raise the cash sum for which a book of stamps can be redeemed and that my approval should be received in advance of any proposed increase in the number of books of stamps required for any goods.</P>

      <P>The nominal interest rates charged by the larger finance houses and by the licensed banks was 10½ per cent-11½ per cent in the four quarters up to March, 1973.  Because the amount lent is reducing over the repayment period the actual rate of interest is almost twice the nominal rate.  Information about the rates charged by the smaller companies is not available but as the rates are competitive they are unlikely to deviate very much from the market rates.</P>
      <P>I have power to control the rates of interest charged for hire purchase but these charges cannot be considered in isolation from the interest rates for other types of consumer credit and I am not yet in a position to say whether it would be desirable to control them.</P>

      <P>It has already been agreed that the existing boys' vocational schools in Ringsend and Mount Street be replaced by a new vocational school in Ringsend.  The project has been delayed because of site problems.  A feasibility study submitted by the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee is at present being examined in the Department.  This study proposes that the school should cater for girls as well as boys: this had not been envisaged in the earlier proposals.</P>
      <P>I shall have the matter brought to decision with the least possible delay.</P>

      <P>I am not quite clear as to what the Deputy has in mind.  The object of third-level courses in institutions other than the universities is to create a supply of persons with suitable education and training at that level to meet the requirements and demands of our economy.  I am confident that employment opportunities will be available to those students who successfully complete third-level courses at such institutions.</P>

I may add that my understanding is that increases in school fees are subject to the approval of the National Prices Commission.  The question of raising this &ldquo;ceiling&rdquo; figure beyond £165 is under consideration, in view of the claims from some schools that the increase in the cost of maintenance demands that a higher fee be charged.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are now approximately 220 full-time remedial teachers serving in national schools.</P>
      <P>Up to now the annual output at the special courses for remedial teachers in Orwell Road and at Cork Polio was approximately 50 teachers. This year arrangements are being made to have this number increased by the provision of a further course for 20-25 teachers in St. Patrick's Training College, Drumcondra.  I am also investigating the possibility of establishing further courses in other centres.</P>
      <P>At post-primary level there are at present 84 recognised teachers engaged in remedial education.  The Department has made provision for the training of a further 75 teachers during the school year 1973-74.  The Department has been engaged in such in-service training since 1971.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the need for more teachers who have received training in remedial education and as my reply indicates the number of teachers undergoing training in this area is being increased considerably.  Whilst a remedial teacher may be regarded as the person, on a school staff, with the main responsibility for remedial education, the remedial problem is, of <Col N="2252" /> course, the concern of all the teaching staff.</P>

      <P>A special school transport service operates from Clonkeen to Ballyvourney, which is the nearest post-primary centre.  The vocational school in Ballyvourney presents an adequate range of second-level courses for girls all the way to leaving certificate.</P>
      <P>Clonkeen pupils who choose to attend schools in Killarney have the facility of free transport on the Kenmare-Killarney public bus service which operates via Poulgorm Bridge. The morning pick-up time at Poulgorm is rather early, but it is not possible to alter it as the bus serves interests other than school children and makes a rail connection at Killarney.</P>
      <P>To remedy the situation, I have arranged that for the coming school year the pupils from the Poulgorm and Clonkeen areas will be accommodated on a special school bus which will leave Poulgorm Bridge for Killarney at approximately 8.00 a.m.  This will give a substantial improvement all round.</P>

      <P>The situation in summary is that until the new administrative bodies in the health field have reviewed how the basic considerations in the Fitzgerald Report might be applied in detail it would be premature to reach a decision as to the provision of a new hospital for a particular area.</P>

      <P>I recently replied to a number of questions about waiting lists for admission to hospital and about delays at hospital out-patient clinics.

      <P>The position broadly, with which my Department is familiar from close contact with hospitals, is that we have no problem of unduly long waiting periods either as respects in-patient or out-patient general hospital care and, in that situation, the interest of my Department has been in relation to pressing problems regarding particular specialties when they arise.</P>
      <P>For this reason the detailed breakdown of information which the Deputy seeks is not at present available and I believe the Labour involved in compiling such a detailed breakdown covering so many aspects of out-patient and in-patient services would not be justified.</P>

We are, therefore, precluded from paying a contributory and a non-contributory pension concurrently to the same person. However, a British retirement pension payable to a person permanently resident in this State is simply taken into account as means for old age non-contributory pension purposes and, accordingly, it is a fact that, subject to fulfilment of the other statutory conditions, the situation described by the Deputy could arise.</P>

      <P>Under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes, a married officer retiring after 12 or more years' service is eligible for a gratuity in addition to retired pay.  This gratuity is not payrelated but is based on rank and length of service.  However, a married officer retiring within four years of the age limit for his rank receives an enhanced gratuity.  The maximum gratuity which is equal to one and one-half years' pay is payable if retirement takes place within two years of the age limit.</P>

      <P>Since the Community has not adopted criteria for establishing the areas in which development measures may be assisted by the proposed Regional Development Fund, it is not possible at this stage to give a definitive answer to the Deputy's question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final communique of the Paris Summit contemplated that intervention by a Regional Development Fund <Col N="2293" /> in conjunction with national aids should permit, progressively with the realisation of economic and monetary union, the correction of the main regional imbalances in the enlarged Community, and particularly those resulting from the preponderance of agriculture, from industrial change and from structural under-employment. The Summit did not, however, determine or contemplate that these latter or other problems would be ranked in order of priority in the way apparently implied by the Deputy's question.  The approach of the Summit is reflected in the report of the Commission on the regional problems of the enlarged Community.  This report sets out the Commission's general views on the considerations which should guide the identification of the areas which should be eligible to benefit from the interventions of the Regional Development Fund.  The relevant extract from the report is given in pages 75-76 of the First Report on Development in the European Communities, to which I would refer the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The evolution of Community regional policy, although related to economic and monetary union, should be looked at as separate and distinct from progress towards that union, as was emphasised in a reply on 28th June to a question from the Deputy.  The principles which should, in the Government's view, be observed in the development of Community regional policy are set out in the section on regional policy of my financial statement on the budget, to which I would refer the Deputy. Those which are particularly relevant in the context of the Deputy's question are that the proposed regional development fund must be financed <Col N="2294" /> on a scale commensurate with the great tasks it will face, and that its resources must be concentrated on areas where the most severe problems exist.</P>

      <P>In June last, merchandise imports amounted to £89.8 million and merchandise exports to £70.9 million. As compared with June, 1972, imports were £21.2 million or 30.9 per cent higher and exports £14.8 million or 26.4 per cent higher.</P>
      <P>In the first half of 1973 imports totalled £540.4 million and exports £393.2 million.  These figures represent increases of 34.8 per cent and 35.4 per cent respectively over those for the first half of 1972.</P>
      <P>The trends disclosed by the recent trade returns are not a cause for concern. The buoyancy of exports to which both agricultural and industrial products have contributed is particularly gratifying.  On the other hand, much of the increase in imports is attributable to larger purchases of raw materials and capital goods which are necessary to sustain the high level of economic activity.  As an increase in net receipts from invisible items is anticipated I expect that the deficit in the balance of payments for the year as a whole, while likely to be greater than last year, will not be such as to cause concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy's question refers to newspaper comment on certain data contained in the July, 1973, publication of the OECD Economic Outlook.  Some newspapers <Col N="2296" /> erroneously reported the OECD as stating that prices here rose by 18 per cent between mid-November and mid-February, whereas the figure quoted in the review was simply the actual increase that took place, 4.0 per cent, which if converted to an annual rate would mean an 18 per cent annual rise.  The OECD figure being based on data for the three months to mid-February does not reflect current trends.  More up-to-date data, converted along OECD lines, would, in fact, show a halving of the rate of inflation in the three months ending mid-May.</P>
      <P>Even allowing for these qualifications however, it remains true that the OECD figures do show a higher rate of inflation here for the period concerned than in other member countries of the organisation.  To the extent that the comparison indicates a loss of international competitiveness of goods and services produced here, it emphasises the need for firm action to keep domestic costs under control. On the prices front, the House is aware of the far-reaching measures put into effect by the Government.  In the area of production costs, a crucial factor is the terms of settlement of pay-increases reached when the present national agreement expires.  Responsible decisions by the social partners in this sphere can make a large contribution to moderating the pace of inflation here, enhancing competitiveness, and promoting growth and employment.</P>

      <P>The criteria by which applicants, including those from Ireland, are appointed to the staff of the Commission of the European Communities are, in general, related to the suitability of candidates, in the light of their qualifications and experience for the posts to be filled.  More detailed information <Col N="2297" /> on the matter is contained in Articles 27-34 of the Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Communities and in an Information File on Administrative Questions and Remuneration prepared by the Commission.  The basic Staff Regulations are set out in a supplement to the Official Journal of the European Communities (No. C12) of 24th March, 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the salaries of Commission officials, I would refer the Deputy to the following documents: Articles 62-70 of the Staff Regulations; Regulation No. 2647/72 of the Council of 12th December, 1972&mdash;Official Journal <Col N="2298" /> (No. L283) of 20th December, 1972; Regulation No. 1301/73 of the Council of 14th May, 1973&mdash;Official Journal (No. L132) of 19th May, 1973.</P>
    <P>The documents mentioned are available in the Library.</P>
