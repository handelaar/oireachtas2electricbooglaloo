      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not available but I can give the Deputy a rough indication, though one which is somewhat out-of-date, which is derived from the 1961 census of population. At that time there were 26,294 schedules returned relating to families where only one parent was recorded as being present on census night and where there was at least one child under 14 years of age.  There were, in all, 58,827 children under 14 on these schedules.  These figures include, of course, instances where one parent was temporarily absent on census night.  At the same time they do not include other instances where a one-parent family may have been living with another family.</P>

The corresponding figures for 1971 were 24.11 million and 2.30 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 13 together.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to reply to the questions in detail at this stage as I have the general position regarding Irish thalidomide children under active consideration. In my study of the matter I will bear in mind the points raised by the Deputies in their questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have also arranged to meet representatives of the parents of thalidomide <Col N="51" /> children in the near future to discuss the position with them.</P>
    <P>One specific points raised in Questions Nos. 12 and 13 is the provision of medical treatment and appliances, free of charge, for thalidomide children, irrespective of family income.  I will, of course, fully consider this matter but I would like to point out that a high proportion of these cases are entitled to hospital and specialist services under the Health Acts and I understand that the &ldquo;hardship&rdquo; clause, which enables health boards to accept persons not normally entitled if circumstances are unusually difficult, was applied liberally by health authorities in the case of thalidomide children.  Chief executive officers of health boards were recently reminded of the desirability of continuing this liberal policy.</P>
    <P>When my predecessor met representatives of the parents of thalidomide children on 29th January last, parents undertook to furnish to my Department particulars regarding expenses incurred in the treatment of the children to enable the position to be considered. Parents were informed to this effect in a letter of 8 February, 1973, from my Department.  To date, four parents have submitted such details and these are being forwarded to the appropriate health boards for consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is a matter of importance to these people that they have this free medical service provided as of right because they were not responsible for the deformities of which their children are victims?  In the circumstances, and in view of the small number of cases involved, would it impose an enormous burden on the Exchequer that they be provided with this medical service free of charge irrespective of the family means?  Is the Minister also aware that many of these parents have had to go cap in hand to local health boards seeking the necessary financial aid and it has imposed a burden on them, irrespective of their occupation?  In the circumstances would he not state that he is making available to them the medical services under the Health Act, irrespective of family means?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that not all deformities of the type induced by thalidomide are in fact attributable to that drug and for this reason it will not be possible to supply the information requested until the scientific investigations at present proceeding of all children with such defects born in the relevant period will have been completed in the coming months.</P>

    <P>An additional 1,000 places are under construction or being planned at the special residential centres for the mentally handicapped.  About 300 of these places will be for children and about 700 for adults but the provision of these adult places will, in a number of cases, result in the release of accommodation designed for children but which is at present occupied by adolescents and young adults.  New places are becoming available each year.  An additional 380 places, mostly for adults, <Col N="56" /> were completed in 1972.  It is expected that a further 375 will be completed in 1973 and about 700 in 1974 and 1975.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 34, 35 and 36 together.  As regard Question No. 34, I presume that what the Deputy has in mind is the detailed recommendations in the FitzGerald Report rather than the basic considerations outlined in the report which call for changes in our acute care hospital system in order to ensure that fully satisfactory arrangements for patient care and treatment can be operated in these hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="64" /> These basic considerations have not been seriously challenged.  What has been a cause of concern in many parts of the country is the impact of proposed changes in particular cases on the availability of acute hospital services at local level.  No decisions have, in fact, been taken about the detailed recommendations for changes in the rural acute hospital system where much of the disquiet has been expressed.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the new structures of health administration, that is, the health boards and their county advisory committees, Comhairle na nOspidéal and the Dublin, Cork and Galway Regional Hospital Boards, has afforded an opportunity for reviewing how the basic considerations in the FitzGerald Report might be applied in detail having regard to all the different considerations, Social as well as medical, which arise.  I understand that some preliminary work is already under way in a number of these organisations in the development of proposals for the reshaping of the hospitals system taking account of the different factors involved.  When these studies are farther advanced, and the bodies concerned are in a position to make recommendations to me, I would then hope to be able to lay down an appropriate programme of hospital development which would reasonably meet the situation.</P>
    <P>Mallow Hospital is one of those which would need to be considered in conjuction with the total reappraisal of hospital needs in that area of the country and it would be premature to make any statement about it at this stage.</P>
    <P>As regards Questions No. 36, the particular hospitals referred to by the Deputy are listed in the latter part of Chapters 8.9 and 10 of the FitzGerald Report.  While there is a copy of the report available in the Dáil Library, I am forwarding a further copy to the Deputy for his convenience.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 to 41 together.</P>
      <P>Special provisions in relation to longterm conditions were made in the Health Act, 1970, as respects hospital care for children and the supply of drugs, medicines and appliances for both adults and children.</P>
      <P>The list of conditions for which hospital care is available for children, irrespective of their parents' means, is:</P>
      <P>mental handicap, mental illness, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, haemophilia and cerebral palsy.</P>
      <P>The list for the free supply of drugs for adults and children is:</P>
      <P>mental handicap, mental illness, for persons under 16 years only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, diabetes insipidus and diabetes mellitus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it would be practical for me to list all the chronic incurable diseases.  There are very many such conditions, varying in severity and not always well defined.  I understand that when the lists given above were drawn up, it was not intended to cover, at the <Col N="69" /> introduction of this scheme, all longterm conditions, bearing in mind that some can vary greatly in severity, that there can be problems of definition and that health boards have full discretion to deal with cases of hardship not otherwise eligible for the service.</P>
    <P>I intend to review the operation of this scheme and the lists of diseases.  In this review, special attention will be given to the conditions mentioned in the Deputies' questions.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that an arbitrary period of 30 days or some such figure is put on it by civil servants or public officials who have no knowledge whatever of the patient's condition and they decide that after a specific date if a patient is in hospital for an acute medical or surgical condition that they will take an allowance from that person's pension, irrespective of the fact that the person may have a medical card?  This is a terrible injustice.  A resolution was passed at the Eastern Health Board calling for the abolition of this discriminatory clause.  The Minister's predecessor ignored this and his officials still insisted that these people should <Col N="71" /> pay a portion of their pension despite the fact that they have a medical card which entitles them to treatment.</P>

It is now estimated that the cost of this scheme in the present year will exceed the original estimate by some what over £1 million.  It is not practicable to be more precise as some expenditure under this service represents merely a transfer of costs from other services, notably the psychiatric outpatient clinics, and not a real increase in costs.  Furthermore, as indicated in the earlier reply, some £500,000 of the increase is accounted for by inflation.</P>

If the Minister could introduce a new system, apart from the old Fianna Fáil cheap fuel scheme, it would be most welcome.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to (a) of the Deputy's question, statutory regulations made under the Social Welfare Acts, require that a woman, in order to qualify for a deserted wife's allowance, must, apart from waiting for a period of six months after desertion before completing the prescribed claim form, make reasonable efforts within the means available to her to trace her husband's whereabouts and to prevail upon him to resume living with her or to contribute to the support and maintenance of herself and her children.</P>
      <P>Each case is decided on its merits. In the circumstances envisaged in the question, a woman would, in the first place, be expected to invoke the aid of organisations, such as the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, her local clergy or social workers operating in this particular field.  Should such efforts be unsuccessful she might in some circumstances be expected to give consideration to the institution of legal proceedings but she would be expected to take such proceedings only if there was a reasonable hope that they would be successful and that there was no other valid reason why she should not do so.</P>
      <P>This is the position as at present.  I am not satisfied with the present arrangements and am having the whole question examined in my Department with a view to introducing appropriate changes in the regulations.

      <P>Go gceapfar an Teachta Séamus Ó Tonnaigh mar Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>Is maith is eol dom go bhfuil Séamus Ó Tonnaigh oilte go maith&mdash;is féidir liom a ráa, sár-oilte&mdash;chuig an post seo. Ní amháin go bhfuil togha na Gaeilge aige ach tá an-chleachtadh aige ar chúrsaí agus gnó an Tí seo ó ceapadh mar Theachta Dála é i 1969.  Ní dóigh liom go raibh sa Teach seo aon Teachta níos dúthrachtaí ná mar a bhí an Teachta Séamus Ó Tonnaigh agus táim cinnte, freisin, go dtabharfaidh sé cothram na Féinne do gach thaobh agus do gach Teachta má cheapfar é.</P>
      <P>I am proposing Motion No. 9 standing in my name, that Deputy James Tunney be elected Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I do so because I know that he is well qualified for this post.  His Irish is excellent; his knowledge of procedure by reason of his diligent attendance in the House since he was elected in 1969 is more than adequate for the post and by reason of his background I am satisfied also that he will give absolute fair play and cothram na Féinne, not only to each side, but to every individual Deputy in carrying out his functions.</P>
      <P>It was not my intention to do more than formally move the motion until the Ceann Comhairle indicated that Nos. 9 and 10 would be taken together from which I gather that the Government propose to vote against my motion and then propose their motion that Deputy Denis Jones be appointed Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  If the Government do this they will be, as they know, breaking completely with precedent. I, therefore, propose to speak at some greater length than I would otherwise have done on this motion.  I expect some members of my party will also have something to say about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been the invariable custom and practice of this House that when the Ceann Comhairle is nominated by and elected from the Government benches the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is <Col N="98" /> nominated by and elected from the Opposition benches.  There have been some changes in this inasmuch as that on a number of occasions the Ceann Comhairle happened to be a Deputy from the Opposition but on those occasions the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was then appointed from among Government-supporting Deputies.  I should have thought that on this occasion the same tradition and procedure would have been followed and that there would have been no objection to the nomination of a Fianna Fáil Deputy, Fianna Fáil being the only Opposition party comprising almost 50 per cent of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>On a previous occasion when the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's position was being filled I referred to the tradition which I have mentioned that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in the circumstances when the Ceann Comhairle is elected from the Government benches should come from Opposition benches.  As reported in the Dáil debates of 15th November, 1967, column 168, when Deputy Denis Jones was being nominated from the Fine Gael Party and Deputy Seán Dunne from the Labour Party, also from the Opposition, was being nominated, I said and I quote:</P>
    <P>It has been well established by tradition and invariable precedent that when the Ceann Comhairle has been elected from amongst the Deputies representing the Government side of the House, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is nominated from amongst Deputies representing the Opposition.  For that reason, my party have decided not to propose any candidate for this post and to leave the selection of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to the parties in Opposition.</P>
    <P>I might say that at this stage Deputy Corish objected to the fact that Fianna Fáil were not going to vote on the motion and by doing so were, in fact, voting to have a Fine Gael Leas-Cheann Comhairle at which stage Deputy Coughlan said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>It is about time the workers of the country knew that the two Conservative Parties were coming together.</P>

      <P>The procedures of this House and the standards we try to attain are governed in many cases by legislation and in most cases by what we know as Standing Orders.  We often have recourse to Standing Orders to ensure that we maintain the standards and observe the procedures laid down. But there are certain standards to which we all aspire and try to attain which are above legislation and Standing Orders and which I think are beyond and above being committed to legislation or to written Standing Orders.  One of these that is dear to us all is that the Chair should not only be fair but be seen to be fair and, therefore, the tradition that has been followed was, as I have already indicated, that in the event of the Ceann Comhairle being nominated from the Government side the Leas-Cheann Comhairle should be nominated from the Opposition side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That tradition and these standards have been honoured by time and I think we should be expected to conform to them.  We on this side of the House wish to conform to them.  To remove the element of fair play from the manner of election of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle or the Ceann Comhairle is, I believe, to remove it from the institution of the Chair itself. If the Government persist by reason of their admittedly slender and somewhat ephemeral majority in having my nominee defeated and their own nominee elected, I suggest that they are debasing the Chair and the standards <Col N="100" /> of fair play that we expect from the Chair.</P>
    <P>I realise that in a coalition there are problems about filling posts; that there is the usual scramble&mdash;I might even say sordid scramble&mdash;for positions but I did not expect that the sordidness would be allowed to develop to this point.  When the Ceann Comhairle himself was proposed we accepted his nomination as a man well fitted for the post.  We did not vote on it.  Normally these positions are not voted upon once we are satisfied of the qualities and impartiality of the nominee.  We did that in the expectation, if not in what I thought then was the knowledge, that a nominee for Leas-Cheann Comhairle from this side of the House would be equally acceptable without a division.</P>
    <P>I have the highest regard for Deputy Denis Jones.  Indeed, I should like to pay tribute to him here and now for the excellent manner in which he conducted himself in the office of Ceann Comhairle on those occasions upon which he occupied the Chair.  It is with a degree of sadness that I say now that I am surprised that he has allowed himself to be an instrument in this unhappy business.  As I said, there are certain standards in this House and there are certain degrees of co-operation expected of the Opposition. Certain goodwill, particularly in relation to the business of the House, is expected and is usually forthcoming from the Opposition.  Without that goodwill it would not always be easy to carry on effectively the business of this House and of the country.  In so far as the Coalition Government are now deliberately alienating themselves, and if they persist in voting against our nomination and defeating my motion, and voting in favour of their own nomination, if they persist in that way in alienating the goodwill to which I referred, then, sir, on their own heads be it.  We promised them that we will be a fair Opposition and that we will give them a fair chance. We will not be too carping in the beginning, if they feel they are entitled to a chance, but we do not want that flow of goodwill and co-operation thrown back in our faces, as it appears will be done today.</P>

      <P>The sentiments expressed by the Leader of the Opposition in regard to the Chair sound impressive and reasonable enough to those who may not be in possession of all the facts about the Chair and its occupation in this House. Deputy Lynch referred to the most recent occasion.  That was a quite inadequate account of the history of the Chair and the attitude of Fianna Fáil to the Chair over many years.  For the information of Deputies, and for the information of the public, I have to recall the Fianna Fáil attitude to the occupancy of the Chair in those years ante-dating the year to which Deputy Lynch referred.</P>
      <P>It was the custom&mdash;this was established both under the Constitution and by statute&mdash;that the outgoing Ceann Comhairle would be returned automatically in an election.  The first occasion on which the outgoing Ceann Comhairle was rejected was by the Fianna Fáil Party in 1932.  His successor continued as Ceann Comhairle up to 1948, when there was a change of Governmment. In 1948 we were on this side of the House and we accepted that the outgoing Ceann Comhairle, returned without election as provided under the Constitution and by statute, was entitled to be re-elected to the Chair.  That position continued until 1951 when, again, there was a change of Government. The outgoing Ceann Comhairle was a Member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  He was, constitutionally and statutorily, returned unopposed.  In 1951 he declined to accept renomination for the position of Ceann Comhairle. Why?  Because Fianna Fáil were short of Deputies and wanted to add his number to the Fianna Fáil total.</P>

In 1951 the late Deputy Hogan was elected Ceann Comhairle and he continued in that position.  He was not opposed by Fianna Fáil and he continued in the office of Ceann Comhairle until he retired on health grounds.  Deputy Breslin was subsequently elected Ceann Comhairle, having been Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and continued in that office.  As far as we were concerned, he was acceptable to us and would have been accepted by us, had he been allowed by the Fianna Fáil Party to stand. That is the complete history.</P>

If there is any doubt about the impartiality of the Chair&mdash;I accept quite freely that Deputy Lynch is quite bona fide in this matter&mdash; whatever influences were at work, Deputy Breslin, who is in good health, just as good as it was before the election, did not offer himself for re-election and, if there is any situation arising in this House over the office of Chair, the only party responsible for that situation is the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

In those circumstances, I submit it is not open to Fianna Fáil now to complain.  As far as we are concerned, Deputy Tunney is admirably fitted.  So is Deputy Jones.  Deputy Jones was an admirable Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  It is Fianna Fáil, and Fianna Fáil only, who are responsible for this situation and, while I agree that the practice was generally accepted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It was they brought the Chair into politics, at the very beginning in 1932, and they continued to shilly-shally whenever they wanted a vote.  Now they object because they are hoist on their own petard.  That is their business. As far as we are concerned, our decision is to nominate Deputy Denis Jones as Leas-Cheann Comhairle and we propose to vote for him.</P>

      <P>Arguments as to what happened or did not happen are one thing.  What is before the House now is the creation of a precedent for the future.  Do Deputies opposite realise, I wonder, that what will happen now is that the group, whatever group commands a majority in this House, will command everything after this.  I will not go into the arguments. I merely draw the attention of the House to what is happening.  Consider what we are doing.  If the Government persist, the group behind the Government, which commands a majority here, in using their voting strength to dominate, then the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be their nominees and a constitutional balance will be removed from this House.</P>
      <P>I am merely drawing the attention of Deputies to this.  Let us know what we are doing.  It is a short step from that to other things.  Deputies opposite may laugh.  One of the tragedies of this House&mdash;perhaps one that we may have an opportunity of debating when the Estimates are being discussed&mdash;is that we are very flippant about serious matters while being serious about the not so serious matters. However, I want to make this point: we are creating a precedent if, today, one group, by virtue of their majority, whether big or small, take over the Chair.  This would mean that every subsequent majority in the history of the Dáil would do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to now the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who was almost equal in dignity and who was equal in authority in the Chair, <Col N="104" /> were taken from different parties. This has been our tradition and it afforded some protection.  As Deputy Lynch has said, it showed that justice was being done.  This is what is involved and let us not ask who is to blame or who is not to blame.  One can appreciate the case made by the Taoiseach when he said that we could have nominated and that the Government would have accepted, but it is clear also that the majority have the right to nominate the Chair and that it would be by their grace and favour that we would take the Chair.  The Opposition have their own freedoms also.  They may claim that we did not nominate the outgoing Ceann Comhairle so as to give us extra voting power but what right have they to ask us, who are their constitutional opponents here, to present them with a free vote?  None.  You have no right to claim that from us.  You are now using your power to bully.  I suppose we could accept this and recall the words of a former President of the USA who said that if you cannot stand the heat, do not come into the kitchen.  You are creating a precedent. Think well of what is involved in that precedent.</P>

      <P>I have no wish to delay the House unduly.  I appreciate fully the remarks made by Deputies Lynch and de Valera but let it be understood clearly that we did not chase Deputy Breslin from the Chair.  If it had been the intention of Fianna Fáil not to seek the Chair in this Dáil, why did they not state so before the election?  Why did Deputy Breslin not resign a week before the election was declared?  Why did he return to this House without a mandate from the people?  These are the questions which I, as an Opposiportan <Col N="105" /> tion Deputy, must ask.  I know Deputy Lynch to be a decent and honourable man and I have worked with Deputy de Valera on Committees.  I am aware of the fairness of both these men.  However, it is unfair of them to say that the Government are responsible for chasing Fianna Fáil from the Chair.  As the Taoiseach has said, if Fianna Fáil had nominated Deputy Breslin for the Chair he would have been re-elected unopposed because, in accordance with the practice that has obtained in the House, any person seeking re-election to the Chair is acceptable to the incoming Government.  These were the standards which applied when the late Deputy Hogan was in the Chair.  He was not opposed by Fianna Fáil and he would have remained in the Chair longer but for health reasons.  When Deputy Breslin was appointed Ceann Comhairle he was accepted by the Opposition without any question of a vote.</P>
      <P>There is no point in Deputies Lynch and de Valera shedding crocodile tears at this stage.  I hope that the present Opposition will be as responsible as were the Opposition in the last Dáil.</P>

      <P>There is a very serious matter involved here and no amount of sleight-of-hand by Deputy Harte or, indeed, by the Leader of his party, will get away from that important matter. The suggestion that has been made by both of them seems to be that there is a provision in the Constitution and in statute that a Deputy who is returned unopposed because he occupies the Chair is automatically returned to the Chair.  Of course, there is no basis whatever for that, as they know.  What happens is that such a person is returned unopposed to membership of this House.  This is for very good reasons, because during his occupancy of the Chair he is unable to participate in political affairs and is unable to deal with matters relating to his constituency as would an ordinary Deputy of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The real point at issue here, and the one which neither Deputies Cosgrave <Col N="107" /> nor Harte attempted to deal with, was the one put forward by the Leader of this Party, that is, that never before in the history of this State have we had a situation in which the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle were both from the Government side.  I must make a correction there in regard to my use of the phrase &ldquo;in the history of this State&rdquo; because I am not sure what was the position in the first few years.  Certainly since there was any normal political development in this State there has been no precedent for the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle coming from the Government side.  That is the fact which was not dealt with by the Taoiseach or by Deputy Harte.</P>
    <P>That is the important matter that is at stake in this debate.  Deputy de Valera did very well to point out what was involved.  Deputy Harte, who purports to act and speak responsibly on certain matters, might give a little thought to this instead of being so flippant. It is a very important matter. Deputy de Valera did very well to point out the importance of what is being done because if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is elected from the Government side of the House today never again will the Leas-Cheann Comhairle or the Ceann Comhairle come from the Opposition benches.</P>
    <P>Remember that.  An extremely serious precedent will be created if this is done.  In the height of our very deep political divisions in the past this was never done.  It is now proposed to do it for reasons which are only sordid and squalid.  I want to make it quite clear in what I am going to say that I am making no criticism whatever of Deputy Denis Jones who for a number of years filled the role of Leas-Cheann Comhairle fairly, courteously and efficiently.  As far as we are concerned we have no complaint whatever about Deputy Jones.</P>
    <P>It was stated by the Taoiseach that there were no objections to Deputy Breslin as Ceann Comhairle by him or his party and that he would have been quite acceptable.  He made that statement in the face of a motion which was on the Order Paper in the <Col N="108" /> past Dáil in the name of Deputy Frank Cluskey as follows:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann views with deep concern the Ceann Comhairle's ruling of 9th December, 1970 that the Taoiseach's announcement of measures clearing the way for implementation of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act, 1940 was not a proper subject of a motion contemplated by Standing Order No. 29; is of the opinion in view of the clear wording of Standing Order No. 29 that the Ceann Comhairle's ruling implies that the measures announced by the Taoiseach do not constitute &ldquo;a definite matter of urgent public importance and accordingly regards the Ceann Comhairle as having been on this occasion in dereliction of his duties as interpreter and custodian of the rules under which the Dáil conducts its business and, therefore, hereby declares no confidence in the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    <P>We had also a motion in the name of the then Deputy Richie Ryan, the present Minister for Finance, strongly deploring the decision of the Ceann Comhairle in another matter.  I am giving that background to point out that the bland statement by the Taoiseach that Deputy Breslin was acceptable is at the very least questionable. That is not the real issue and the Taoiseach knows it.  Surely the members of this Government know that what is involved here is far more serious than the question of who becomes Leas-Cheann Comhairle in the 20th Dáil.  The decision being made here today will be a precedent which will be followed, I would suggest, in every future Dáil.  If that is so, I would suggest to those Deputies on the Government side of the House that they think seriously before they commit themselves and commit every future Dáil to a procedure which is on the face of it a procedure which is divisive and which will be conducive to holding up the business of the House.</P>
    <P>It is true, as I said, that Deputy Jones gave every satisfaction as Leas-Cheann Comhairle as far as we on this side of the House are concerned.  Indeed, <Col N="109" /> he gave such satisfaction that when it came to the question of nominating a Ceann Comhairle it was reasonable to expect that the Taoiseach would nominate Deputy Jones but he did not.  What I am about to say now is not in any way criticism of you personally but rather in criticism of the reasons for the action by the Taoiseach.  It was reasonable to expect in the light of the performance of Deputy Jones as Leas-Cheann Comhairle that when the Taoiseach, with a majority behind him, was nominating somebody as Ceann Comhairle he would nominate Deputy Jones but he did not do that.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the first action in this 20th Dáil by the Taoiseach was one that he will not be proud of in future because the reasons for his action were squalid, dishonourable and petty.  Having taken that dishonourable action, the first indication of what we all know is inherent in a Coalition Government and the pressures that build up on a Taoiseach of a Coalition Government&mdash;we all know the reasons for that action, which are no credit to the Taoiseach&mdash;the Government then found themselves in the position that they owed a debt to Deputy Jones. This is one of the reasons we have this motion down here today.

Now he and his colleagues have their hands on the loot.  We hoped they would show some degree of discretion in the manner in which they dealt with these things.  We left quite a number of positions that they could fill, because we think that the Government of the day should be in a position to influence the various organs with which they have to deal. However, knowing all that&mdash;and the Government do know it; certainly the Taoiseach knows it&mdash;he found himself unable to resist the pressures which built up and which forced him into this position.

He is being pressured by the Coalition set-up, and this is the first step on the road to the kind of disaster that coalitions can produce. We intend to see that that disaster is not produced, but the public should pay attention to this, the very first act in this Dáil by this Taoiseach and the reasons why he did what he did, which has got him into the position he is in today.</P>

      <P>The public and the gentlemen of the Press will clearly recall that during the course of the last <Col N="112" /> Dáil the then Opposition, the present Government, made as their almost constant claim before the public that the standards they stood for, the principles they adhered to, were of the highest possible rank.  There are many Members in those benches this afternoon who, week after week in the public Press, spoke of the high standards which Fine Gael, particularly, stood for, their integrity and the respect which they had for the institutions of the State.  These same gentlemen who are here this afternoon apparently forget what was their constant theme when they were in opposition over the last few years, a theme which was fairly willingly taken up by a significant number of gentlemen of the Press who wanted to see them cast in that role.</P>
      <P>Now all we ask is that they judge themselves by their own oft-proclaimed standards.  I said this, in fact, after the recent election and before this Dáil reconvened, that we in Fianna Fáil would ask the new Government to adhere to the standards which they themselves had proclaimed.  It has been said here this afternoon that the real issue is that we put out Deputy Breslin.  If that type of comment is an indication of what they know of the institutions of this House then they know little of those institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach said in the course of his attempted justification for this step that the former Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Breslin, was returned on that basis by the electorate.  This, of course, is entirely inaccurate, as Deputy Colley has clearly indicated.  He was returned to this House unanimously by the electorate <i>ipso facto</i> as the holder of the position of Ceann Comhairle.  The same thing applies to the question asked by Deputy Harte: &ldquo;Why did Deputy Breslin not seek a mandate from the people?&rdquo; The law and the Constitution do not require that the Ceann Comhairle seek a mandate from the people.  What we are now concerned with, as Deputy Colley has suggested, is either that a debt has to be paid or that because Deputy Breslin has not&mdash; as he is not required to do&mdash;chosen to take the office of Ceann Comhairle, the <Col N="113" /> Opposition are reacting vindictively to that decision, and now that a decision which Deputy Breslin and the Government are entitled to take has been taken, the new Government are now going to give what they might call &ldquo;a does of your own medicine&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If that is the way they want to interpret the situation that is a matter for them on those benches, but in reacting in this way they are departing from those principles which they have so often called to their aid.  Although they have often claimed to be the very bulwark of the institutions of this State, they are now tearing those institutions apart, and on their heads be the consequences of it.</P>

      <P>We should not subject the former distinguished holder of your position, Sir, to speculation about why he either resigned or was forced to resign or was cajoled into resigning from the position of Ceann Comhairle which he held.</P>
      <P>I would fully accept what Deputy Jack Lynch has said, that it is inherently undesirable that the Government side should hold both the positions, because it is not generally in accord with parliamentary democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Equally, I would ask the House to note how often Fianna Fáil have to learn the elementary lessons of Parliamentary democracy in this country. It is with great reluctance that I will today vote in favour of the <Col N="114" /> Taoiseach's motion.  I will vote for it because it is high time that Fianna Fáil were taught a very severe and salutary lesson in the handling of Parliamentary democracy.</P>
    <P>This situation has arisen in particular because Deputy Breslin was told that, if he did not resign, his son would not get a nomination in the Donegal constituency in the next General Election.  That is the kind of sordid, squalid pressure which was brought to bear on Deputy Breslin to resign his position as Ceann Comhairle. It is double-barrelled and two-faced hypocrisy for the former Taoiseach to come in here and suggest that it was anything other than such pressure that was brought to bear on Deputy Breslin to get out of the Chair.</P>

      <P>I wish to say bluntly that there was no wish whatever on the Government benches to take over the Ceann Comhairle's position. Everybody on the Government side, every single incoming Deputy, assumed from the night when it became clear that we were the incoming Government, that Deputy Breslin would be the incoming Ceann Comhairle. There was no question whatever on this side of the House that we would assume he would not be taking up the position of Ceann Comhairle. This was clearly understood.  It is ironic, and a matter of severe public comment, that no comment was made by Deputy Breslin.  Deputy Breslin did not resign; he was not nominated by his party.</P>

      <P>The Government did not create the situation.  It was created cynically, squalidly and sordidly by the Fianna Fáil Party for narrow, internal, party political benefit in the division lobbies of this House.  They did a great disservice and a dishonour to Deputy Breslin and to the country by not taking their beating as it should have been taken and not allowing one of their own Members to take the Chair.  The Government would have taken the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle and there would have been no exhibition of posturing by the Fianna Fáil Party, as we have seen this evening, of heartbreaking outbursts in favour of Parliamentary democracy.</P>

The expectations of the people have been built up to expect much from the superbly talented people.  They are all waiting with bated breath.  We have had the first great deception exposed in regard to this vote which is to take place on this appointment of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I would like to say with reference to Deputy Jones that I have the utmost respect for this man.  I shared the disappointment of many when Deputy Jones was not selected for better things.  I fully expected he would have been so selected, but it was not expedient.  Word has it, and time will tell whether there is any truth in this, that the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle is to be upgraded and that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is to have a State car and an increase in salary.</P>

I admire Deputy L'Estrange here.  It is not so easy to keep your name in when in Government.  Deputy <Col N="117" /> Harte is speaking on everything.  It is at least some compensation that the length of the Deputy's speeches will be greatly reduced.</P>
      <P>As one who believes very much in the traditions of this House, I share the disappointment felt that the Opposition are not going to have their nominee accepted by the Government without a vote.  As always, I am happy in the knowledge that the gentlemen of the Press will make their own judgments on this objectively and that the people of the country will also make their own assessment on this point.  As an Opposition party we will not be dictated to by the Government as to whether we should have reappointed Deputy Breslin as Ceann Comhairle. He served this House with great distinction. I was glad that Deputy Colley referred to the fact that there was a motion put down by the present Government on the Order Paper expressing no confidence in Deputy Breslin as Ceann Comhairle.  I was disappointed at the hypocrisy of what Deputy Cosgrave had to say, because if what he had said was true, then that motion should never have appeared on the Order Paper or should have been withdrawn. He, as a barrister, made a very bad case.  Most of the points have been covered.  Our disappointment is real at the fact that our nomination is to be opposed.  It is too much to hope for and I know in my heart and soul that there will be no change in the Taoiseach's mind and that he will not at this stage withdraw the name of Deputy Denis Jones as this deal has been made.  I am so sorry that Deputy Denis Jones has to be the subject of this sordid business.</P>

We are talking here about a principle that has been long established and that, if the Government majority have their way, will be breached here this afternoon.  I should like to ask the Deputies opposite, at <Col N="118" /> least those who think deeply enough about this subject, what their attitude would have been if, four years ago, we not only nominated the Ceann Comhairle but nominated also the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Would we have finished a debate here in one afternoon, much less in one week? They would have asserted their right vehemently and rightly so.  They would have detained this House a long time in debating this principle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a well-known and well accepted fact&mdash;let me repeat again&mdash;that normally it is the duty and the right of the Government to nominate and elect a Ceann Comhairle, a chairman of this House.  There is no obligation or duty on the Opposition to provide this House with a Ceann Comhairle.  The Government have as their main function to run the business of the House and to fill the various institutions and offices in the House subject to certain limitations and one of these limitations is what we are talking about here today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been, I admit freely, occasions when for one reason or another the Ceann Comhairle was drawn from the Opposition side.  On this occasion the Coalition won the election rather narrowly and Deputy Breslin, having been returned by reason of his being Ceann Comhairle in the last Dáil but no longer being Ceann Comhairle, was then an ordinary member of the Fianna Fáil Party. There was no obligation on this party. to ask Deputy Breslin to go forward again but the Coalition Government, having won this election by a narrow <Col N="119" /> majority, there was no obligation on us either to swell their narrow majority. The Fianna Fáil Party took the decision deliberately and unanimously that Deputy Cormac Breslin would not be nominated for the position of Ceann Comhairle.</P>

May I say to Deputy Barry Desmond who having made his wild allegation, having stood up in his humbug manner and said that the name of Deputy Cormac Breslin should not be dragged through the House and then proceeded to do it more than any other Deputy had done hitherto&mdash;nobody on this side of the House mentioned Cormac Breslin's name&mdash;may I say to Deputy Barry Desmond that, first of all, he knows nothing of what happened at any Government meeting and there was no Government decision taken in respect of the position of Ceann Comhairle?  This was a matter only for the elected parliamentary party and the elected parliamentary party took their decision democratically and unanimously.</P>

      <P>It is the right, I suggest the duty in certain circumstances, of the Government to put forward their candidate for the Chair and there is no obligation on the Opposition to do so.  We took our decision democratically and unanimously not to put forward a candidate for the Chair.  What we are objecting to here is the principle now being established of not only the Chair but the vice-Chair being filled from the Government side of the House.  I think it is a sad occasion for the institutions of this House that this should be so.  I know well the reasons why and I will not elaborate on them.  There were certain positions to be filled on the Coalition front bench and the Labour Party insisted on their quota and if they used enough muscle to suggest one of their own men for the Chair then good luck to them.  You were elected unanimously, Sir, and you would not have been unanimously elected were it not that we thought you were fit for the job you now occupy but let us not delude ourselves into thinking that Deputy Seán Treacy came up for nomination out of nowhere.  Do we not know well what went on in the background and now the consolation prize is being offered to a man who I am sorry to see in his position, to see being used as an <Col N="121" /> instrument in this debasing and sordid exercise.</P>

      <P>As I said earlier one would have been impressed by the verbal concern which Fianna Fáil Deputies have expressed about the precedent being established but the first time that this precedent was established it was established by Fianna Fáil.  I know they have been looking up the record but they did not quote this one.  On 15th March, 1932, the late Deputy Norton, who was leader of the Labour Party, proposed that the late Deputy Patrick Hogan be elected Leas-Cheann Comhairle. The late Deputy Little, who was a member of the Fianna Fáil Party seconded that proposal.  For the benefit of younger Deputies on all sides, Deputy Hogan and Deputy Norton were members of the Labour Party. At that time the Labour Party were supporting Fianna Fáil.  Times have changed of course.  The arrangement was that the Ceann Comhairle was elected from the Fianna Fáil Party, displacing the outgoing Ceann Comhairle. With great respect to the present occupant of the Chair and the previous occupants, the first occupant was a most distinguished man&mdash;I refer to Professor Michael Hayes.  The present precedent undoubtedly is on all fours with this precedent of Fianna Fáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Election of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>Mr. Norton: I move:</P>
      <P>That Deputy Patrick Hogan (Clare) be elected Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>
      <P>Both Deputies were members of the Labour Party.  Deputy Norton was Leader of the Labour Party and the late Deputy Patrick Hogan was a member of that party.  At column 58 of the Official Report of 15th March, 1932, there is the following:</P>
      <P>Mr. Little: I beg to second the motion.</P>
      <P>Deputy Little was a member of the Fianna Fáil Party; he subsequently became a Parliamentary Secretary and later became a Minister.  The motion was passed.  Both of those parties, Fianna Fáil being in the majority and the Labour Party being associated with them, first elected the Ceann Comhairle from the Fianna Fáil Party on an earlier motion the week before and later on this motion proposed by a Labour Deputy and seconded by a Fianna Fáil Deputy.  That was the time the precedent was established; that is an exact and identical precedent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is the precedent that has not been quoted by Fianna Fáil: it is the precedent we are following.  During the course of the election campaign, Deputy Lynch on a few occasions said he would prefer the then Opposition or the then Fianna Fáil Government to get a definite majority rather than have a stalemate. He repeated this a number of times but his contribution to creating problems for the Government elected by a majority vote of the people was to extract from the Chair, whether he was willing or not, the man who was returned on the basis established by precedent.  It is true every new Dáil has to elect a Ceann Comhairle but the established precedent has been broken only by Fianna Fáil, never by any other party in this House.  The <Col N="123" /> precedent was first broken in 1932, secondly in 1951, and now, for the third time, in 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are the only party who have moved the occupant out of the Chair, either by not proposing him or by deliberately voting him down. This is the party who are complaining about precedent, who are feigning concern about the institutions of the State.  It does not wash.  Nobody believes it, they do not even believe it themselves, Fianna Fáil have created this precedent.  We have always respected the established precedents, whether in our favour or not.  Frankly, we would always prefer to see the occupant of the Chair if he were available and in good health returned <Col N="124" /> without a division but, contrary to the views expressed by Deputy Lynch that he would prefer to see a government with a clear majority, Fianna Fáil tried to embarrass the present Government by extracting Deputy Breslin from the Chair although he was returned on the basis that he was the outgoing Ceann Comhairle.  That precedent was established by Fianna Fáil. I rarely follow their precedents but on this occasion we are doing that.</P>

      <P>I move &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a simple and non-contentious Bill which was prepared by the previous Government.  I am advised that it must be enacted by 31st March, 1973.  In this connection Deputies will remember that leave to introduce it was granted when the Dáil convened and that the former Taoiseach then briefly explained its purpose.  I hope, therefore, that the House will agree to give me all Stages today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is an interim measure enabling existing financial arrangements in regard to RTE to be continued for a relatively short period.  Its urgency arises from the need to provide statutory authority for continuing to pay grants to RTE in respect of net receipts from broadcasting licence fees. Section 2 of the Bill provides for the payment of such grants for a further period of two years up to and including <Col N="129" /> the financial year 1973-74.  Pending the passing of this legislation, RTE's grant for general purposes for 1972-73 was circulated in the normal manner and was included in the Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs which was approved by the Dáil on 13th December, 1972.</P>
    <P>This opportunity is being taken to propose an increase from £3 million to £4 million in the upper limit for repayable advances which the Minister for Finance may make to RTE for capital purposes.  This is provided for in section 1 of the Bill.  The present limit was fixed in the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1964.  Advances totalling £2.951 million have already been made.  The balance of £49,000 undrawn under existing legislation will not be sufficient to cover advances which RTE will require during 1973-74 to meet existing commitments.  Some increase in the present limit is, therefore, essential.</P>
    <P>The greater part of the extra £1 million which will be available under this Bill is not being earmarked for specific projects, but some expenditure of a capital nature will be unavoidable over the next couple of years and it is desirable that it should be possible to make repayable advances to RTE from the Exchequer if this proves to be necessary.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like to thank the House for agreeing to take this Bill at such short notice.  The Bill is urgent because some of the provisions contained in it are necessary in order to provide a proper statutory basis for the new register of electors which will come into force on the 15th of next month. The register has been prepared on the basis of a voting age of 18 years in anticipation of the changes in the law proposed by this Bill.  The Bill arises directly from the decision of the people at the referendum on 7th December last when they voted overwhelmingly in favour of a lower voting age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill are dealt with in detail in the explanatory memorandum circulated with it but I would like to draw attention to some important aspects.  The Bill proposes to reduce the voting age for local government <Col N="131" /> elections to 18 years.  I understand and accept that it was the intention of the previous Government to take this step.  We have, however, gone a stage further and are proposing that the minimum age for membership of local authorities should also be reduced to 18.  This is in accordance with the view which we have consistently advanced that young people should be encouraged to play their part in democratic elections not only by voting but by coming forward themselves as candidates.  Deputies appreciate, of course, that the age for membership of the Dáil and Seanad is prescribed by the Constitution and that it is not possible, therefore, to deal with it in this Bill.  In any event, perhaps, it is just as well to make a beginning by reducing the age for membership of local authorities.  The voting age for election of university members of the Seanad is also being reduced.  The electorate in this case are the graduates of the two universities. I understand that there are not many graduates under age 21 who will benefit from this change but I am satisfied, and so was my predecessor, that it is a change which should be made.</P>
    <P>I think this short Bill deserves the support of Deputies on both sides and I commend it to the House.</P>

I shall be the first to congratulate him if and when he achieves the target of 25,000 houses. I shall certainly be watching to ensure that this target is achieved.  In the financial year just ending a record figure of nearly 21,000 houses was achieved; indeed, when the final figures become available, it is possible that the figure will not be very far short of 21,000.  That was achieved under a Fianna Fáil administration. I was happy to be Minister when this magnificent effort was being made.  I <Col N="132" /> trust the pace of housing output will not be slowed down and that an increasing number of houses will be produced.  I expect the new Minister to work like his Fianna Fáil predecessors did to achieve his target of 25,000 houses.</P>
      <P>While I was absent from the House I understand the Minister somewhat unkindly made a statement that I had removed some file from the Department relating to the revision of constituencies.</P>

      <P>Coming to the Bill before the House, in my introduction to the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution Bill I promised the House I would bring forward legislation revising the voting age in local elections to local authorities.  I am glad the new Minister has done this.  It was my intention to do this, a fact the Minister recognised in his introductory statement.  The only variation is that the Minister is going a step forward and proposing a minimum age; he proposes that the minimum age for membership to local authorities should be reduced to 18 years.  We agree that it should be reduced.  We approve of the Bill <i>in toto.</i> I personally believe that young people should be brought more and more into the democratic process.  These are consequential changes required in the electoral law as a result of the recent referendum.  Therefore, I welcome the Bill and I do not see any reason for any difficulty in dealing with it.</P>
      <P>I avail of this opportunity to ask the Minister to indicate, when replying, whether it is the intention of the Government to hold the local authority elections this year.  They are due to be held, but perhaps the Minister will indicate whether there may be a decision not to hold them.  I would like the Minister also to give us some indication as to what are his intentions regarding the restoring of Dublin Corporation and Bray Urban District Council.  I think the House appreciates my position in this regard. We had intended holding the local elections and, consequently, as these two areas would have been included, they would have been restored to the previous position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Molloy for his good wishes and assure him that the promises that have been made by the Coalition Government will be carried out in full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the local elections the Deputy will appreciate that we have been in office for only a few weeks. We are considering actively whether these elections should be held this <Col N="134" /> year.  Of course they were due to be held last year but were not held for some reason or other, so that we need not be surprised if a decision is made not to hold them this year.  I have personal views on the matter but it will be for the Government to make a decision.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of whether Dublin Corporation will be restored, I am sure the former Minister will sympathise with me if I do not make a decision in this regard within a few days of assuming office since he has had several years during which to do this but did not do so.  However, I assure him that in the very near future the necessary information regarding the restoring both of Dublin Corporation and Bray Urban District Council will be given so that everybody will know what is the position.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to Deputy Molloy and to the Opposition generally for the manner in which they have allowed this Bill to be taken this evening.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £5,671,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1973, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government, including grants to Local Authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing, and miscellaneous schemes and grants including a grant-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The gross amount required is £5,776,000 but this amount is offset in part by an increase of £16,000 in Appropriations-in-Aid and a further sum of £89,000 in savings, the net amount of £5,671,000 is spread over ten separate subheads of the Vote for my Department and corresponds to 36 per cent of the original Estimate for the Department for 1972-73.  The largest single element in the Supplementary Estimate is the new subhead O in which provision is being made for a sum of £2,400,000 as a grant to the Road Fund.  This amount is required because of the extent by which allocations from the Road Fund in respect of the current year exceeded the estimated income from the Fund.</P>
    <P>Next in importance is a sum of £1,800,000 in subhead E 2.  This additional amount is necessary to meet the Department's commitments in respect of grants for private houses.  The original provision of £4,700,000 for this proposal was exhausted some months ago.  A sum of £542,000 is required under subhead E 1 to meet arrears of subsidy due to local authorities in respect of their own direct housing operations.  Similarly, the additional £310,000 sought in subhead F is necessary to meet commitments to local authorities in respect of subsidy towards loan charges on capital moneys borrowed by local authorities for water and sewerage schemes.  The additional £500,000 required under subhead K is to meet commitments in respect of local improvement schemes on foot of supplementary allocations made to local authorities for this purpose in September, 1972, and December, 1972.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Exchequer <Col N="138" /> pays a subsidy to local authorities towards the current costs of providing dwellings.  The subsidy is in the form of an annual contribution towards the loan charges payable by the authorities on the capital borrowed by them and may amount to 66? per cent of those charges.  The Exchequer contribution, however, is restricted to a percentage of the loan charges on fixed limits of capital costs.  Because these limits were not revised regularly and adequately by the previous Government to take account of increases in the actual cost of providing housing, they are very much too low and, in fact, now represent less than 50 per cent of the present cost of providing a typical local authority house.</P>
    <P>For example, the provision of a local authority house now costs £4,700 on average but the limit of capital cost for subsidy purpose is only £2,200. The annual cost of providing and maintaining such a house is about £514.  The maximum annual subsidy paid by the Exchequer amounts to only £138 which, taking into account an average annual rent of about £114, leaves £262 to be met annually from the rates in respect of each new house provided by a local authority.  Therefore, the situation at present is that subsidy from the Exchequer, although nominally payable at a rate of up to 66? per cent of annual loan charges, in fact meets only 35 per cent of the annual loss on each new local authority house.  The disparity in the apportionment of the burden is even more marked in the case of flats because the subsidy from the Exchequer meets only 27 per cent of the annual loss of each new flat.  The restriction of housing subsidy from the Exchequer to fix limits of capital costs which are so much out of date is indicative of the previous Government's unrealistic approach to local authority housing and has resulted in an excessive housing subsidy burden falling on the rates.</P>

      <P>This short-sighted policy may well have induced some local authorities to slow or stop building further local authority dwellings notwithstanding the urgency of the need for such dwellings in their areas.  The policy in relation to the subsidisation of local authority housing which I have inherited will have to be overhauled as soon as possible.  In this connection the Government are committed to transferring housing subsidies from the rates to the Exchequer over a period of years.  The first phase of this transfer will be undertaken in the coming financial year.  Its details will shortly be announced by the Government.  I intend to initiate a comprehensive examination of the existing subsidy structure and submit firm proposals to the Government at an early date for its improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The £165,000 under subhead G is to meet commitments arising on foot of additional allocations made to local authorities in December, 1972, in respect of amenity schemes.  The balance of the Supplementary Estimate is made up of an increase of <Col N="141" /> £30,000 in the grant-in-aid to An Foras Forbartha and a number of smaller sums in respect of expenses incurred directly by my Department on foot of Post Office services, travelling expenses and statutory inquiries. I realise that the net additional amount sought at £5,671,000 is very substantial in relation to the original vote of £15,575,000 for my Department but these amounts are necessary to meet the charges falling on my Department in the current year in respect of the various services to which I have referred.</P>

As the money being voted is money expended during my term of office, I certainly agree that it should be voted here today and I certainly will not oppose that.  It is very clearly reflected in the amounts that have been asked for here that we were very active in the Department and continued an upward trend in each sector of activity which the Department was dealing with.</P>
      <P>The commitment to housing on the part of the former Fianna Fáil Government is clearly indicated in the overall amounts and in the supplementary amounts which we devoted to housing and to the other activities of the Department.  I hope that this will continue and I will have to avail of another opportunity to deal with the contentious and, indeed, nonfactual statements which the Minister made in the speech he read out to the House but which he did not circulate.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £340,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1973, for the salaries and <Col N="142" /> expenses of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, including certain other services administered by that Office.</P>
    <P>This is an additional sum required for the payment of salaries to increased staff in the Offices of the Revenue Commissioners.  The increased staff requirements arose as a result of our preparation for entry and accession to the European Economic Community, the introduction of value-added tax, the computerisation of Customs and Excise statistics and the implementation of the Health Contribution Act, 1971.</P>
    <P>The additional sums required under subhead B are in respect of the expenses of the Advisory Council on the Transition to Value-Added Tax £21,000, an increased expenditure on advertising in connection with value-added tax and other miscellaneous expenses of £23,000.  There is also an additional sum required of £47,000 in relation to machinery and equipment for security, printing and stamping. This item has arisen primarily due to the additional obligations by reason of membership of the European Economic Community and the regulations which arise by virtue of that membership.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £15,000 is required to meet the increased expenditure for law costs against the Department and also the legal enforcement of collection of arrears of tax £4,000 and counsels' fees of £3,000.  Under the heading of office machinery and other office supplies subhead, there is a saving, fortunately, of £51,000 but it is rather a temporary one I fear.  It is due to unforeseen delays in the installation of a new computer in the office of the Collector General, a saving which occurs under this subhead but is likely to arise at a later date as an additional expense.</P>

      <P>Since this Supplementary Estimate was incurred and, indeed, prepared in my time as Minister for Finance I will not oppose it. Since this is the first occasion on which I have had an opportunity to do so in this House, I rise merely <Col N="143" /> to wish Deputy Ryan well in his appointment as Minister for Finance in a personal capacity.  I do not envy him the task which faces him, which is difficult enough in normal times but which is made twice as difficult by reason of the circumstances in which he finds himself entering into office and the commitments made by himself and his colleagues.  We will, of course, be watching with considerable interest to see the manner in which he exercises his ingenuity to overcome these difficulties and we will have something to say about that in the future. For the moment I merely want to wish him well.</P>

        <i>(Dublin Central):</i> As some of this money arises out of the introduction of value-added tax I want to point out that it was customary, when turnover tax was introduced, to issue ready reckoners to the people responsible for the tax but up to now quite a number of people who are liable for value-added tax have not been issued with those ready reckoners.

I can well understand his anxiety about the capacity of the Government to fulfil their undertakings having regard to how little he left to enable anybody to fulfil any undertakings. Somebody who is in a better position to adjudicate from the sideline did say to me since the change of Government that both sides were reckless in undertakings which they had given but that the greater blame by far lay on the outgoing Government which knew the financial situation, on the one hand, and yet made promises which would have involved far more expenditure than the reasonable ones which had been made by the incoming Government.</P>

      <P>The financial provision for the Civil Service Commission is particularly difficult to estimate in advance.  It is a service agency for the Government Departments generally and for local authorities, and as it is expected to be in a position to meet the demands of these organisations which cannot be reliably forecast in advance, it is not always able to restrict its expenditure to the amount usually provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate now before the House can be explained as follows: subhead A.I.&mdash;Salaries Wages and Allowances&mdash;the original provision was for £199,000 and the supplementary sum now required is £17,000.  The excess is due mainly to an increase in the number of staff arising out of the increased number of competitions and higher number of candidates generally.  A secondary factor was the second phase of the 13th wage round.  Subhead B.&mdash;Travelling and Incidental Expenses&mdash;the original provision was for £18,000; the supplementary sum required is £8,000.  The excess is due to the fact that the Department of Finance computer was not in operation as early as expected and, accordingly, payment for computer rental had to be made.  Under subhead E.&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash; the original provision was for £221,000 <Col N="145" /> and this meant there was a shortfall of £7,000; the amount which fell to be claimed from local authorities under this subhead was less than had been expected.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is required to enable the grant-in-aid to An Chomhairle Ealaíon to be increased by £5,000.  The Department of the Taoiseach is responsible for making funds available each year to enable it to carry out its function under the Arts Act, 1951.  The amount provided for An Chomhairle Ealaíon in this year's Estimate was £80,000.  The £5,000 extra is necessary to enable An Chomhairle Ealaíon to meet outstanding commitments incurred during the year.  A draft Bill has been prepared by the Department of the Taoiseach on the reorganisation of An Chomhairle Ealaíon.  This Bill will provide for wider powers than An Chomhairle Ealaíon have at present, and it is hoped that when the Bill becomes law responsibility for subsidising cultural organisations will come entirely under the aegis of An Chomhairle Ealaíon.  This will involve, of course, a much larger annual grant-in-aid.</P>

    <P>This sum is required to meet expenditure under subheads D. and F. of the Vote, subhead D. being additional allowances and gratuities in respect of established officers, and subhead F, pensions, allowances and gratuities in respect of unestablished officers.  The bulk of expenditure on both of these subheads relates to lump sum payments to civil servants or their dependants in the form of retirement gratuities, death gratuities and marriage gratuities to female officers who resigned from the Civil Service on marriage.  The number of officers qualified to receive these awards vary considerably from year to year, making it difficult to predict expenditure in advance with any degree of accuracy.  This is particularly so in the case of subhead F. which provides for expenditure under the new pensions scheme for non-established State employees. This scheme was only finalised in 1971 and as yet no definite trends in numbers dying or retiring are discernible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate on this Vote is mainly attributable to the excess of £34,000 in fees for counsel.  A major factor accounting for this excess is the Special Criminal Court.  This court was set up, as Deputies are aware, <Col N="147" /> in May, 1972, because the Government of the day considered it necessary on the grounds that the ordinary courts were inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order. This court has been sitting almost continuously since it was set up.  Approximately 230 cases have been referred to it.  The reference of the case against the British Government to the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg is another important factor.  Most aspects of the Irish case were, as Members are aware, deemed admissible by the Court and procedures are at present in train for consideration of the merits of the case. Other contributory factors are the increasing incidence of crime and a shortage of staff in the Chief State Solicitor's Office necessitating the engagement of junior counsel on a fee basis for District Court work.  The excess of £12,000 on general law expenses is mainly accounted for by the upward trend in the number of court cases.  The excess of £4,000 on travelling and incidental expenses is accounted for in roughly equal shares between the Court of Human Rights case in Strasbourg and an upper trend in travelling and subsistence expenses.</P>

      <P>The Members of the House will be aware that the previous Government, subject to the approval of Dáil Éireann, undertook, in the aftermat of the Derry shootings in January, 1972, to provide moneys through suitable channels to help the minority <Col N="148" /> in Northern Ireland to achieve, through peaceful action, a just form of administration.  The Government at that time envisaged this financial assistance being channelled through the Assembly of the Northern Irish People which had indicated its intention of launching a fund to assist those who were deprived of human rights in Northern Ireland.  It was therefore decided to give moneys by way of grant-in-aid to the Assembly's fund.  This fund would be administered by trustees under the auspices of the Assembly for the assistance of those deprived of human rights and the Government contribution would be confined to defraying the cost of administration and publicity, in other words, to covering the initial expenses of the fund which was launched on 21st February, 1972.</P>
      <P>In the different situation which subsequently developed it was deemed inappropriate to press ahead with the question of the grant-in-aid and the matter has remained dormant since. The present Supplementary Estimate consists of the amount necessary to clear existing commitments.  These amount to approximately £10,000 in all, practically all of which represents expenditure actually incurred and already proven.  Expenditure from the grant-in-aid will be accounted for in detail to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

When the announcement was made by the previous Government we complained from the Opposition benches, where we then were, that the Opposition of that time <Col N="149" /> had not been consulted before the statement was made.  We said we were particularly anxious to ensure that there would be effective control over any money paid by the House, particularly for use outside the jurisdiction of the House.  We are satisfied that that is the position and any further accounting or vouching that has to be done will be done.  Having regard to what happened on a previous occasion, when money was voted under this subhead, it is necessary in the public interest that that assurance should be clearly given in this House so that public confidence will be secured.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is required to enable the Grant-in-Aid of the Abbey Theatre to be increased by £50,000 and to provide a grant of £5,000 for the general expense of the Dublin Theatre Festival.  The State grant to the Abbey is based on meeting annual deficits in the running expenses of the theatre.  In recent years these deficits have been growing due to wage increases, general cost increases and the fall in the number of tourists.  The Abbey Board have made reasonable efforts to maximise receipts <Col N="150" /> but are reluctant to increase the price of tickets above an unacceptable level. As from 16th January this year the price range of seats was reduced from six to four, and price increases were implemented over that range increasing the total value of a full house to £533.75 as opposed to £392.  These increases, through welcome, cannot meet the falling off in box office receipts incurred as a result of the decline in tourists, particularly this year. Furthermore, £40,000 of a grant of £160,000 paid already this year was used for the purpose of writing down the overdrafts existing on 31st March, 1972, which left the Abbey with a reduced working capital for 1972-73. In the light of these financial circumstances, a supplementary grant of £50,000 is required in order to clear off the estimated deficit in the current year.</P>
    <P>In July, 1972, the Minister for Finance directed that a grant be paid to Dublin Theatre Festival Limited to enable them to stage the 1973 festival. The organisers of the festival submitted, on request, a copy of the accounts for 1969 and 1971 and ultimately the Minister agreed to make a grant of £20,000.  The £5,000 being provided for in the Supplementary Estimate is the first instalment.</P>
    <P>The grant to the Dublin Theatre Festival was made this year as a &ldquo;once for all&rdquo; payment pending the restructuring of the Arts Council and to obviate the closing down of the Festival Office and the disbanding of the Festival staff through lack of financial support.</P>

      <P>The original Estimate did not include provision to cover payment of contribution in lieu of rates on State occupied properties at Dublin Airport. In previous years, these properties had been shown in the Valuation List as occupied by Aer Rianta Teoranta which paid rates in respect of them. Senior counsel has now advised that these properties are State occupied and as a result as from 1972 are deemed exempt from rates assessment.  This brings Dublin Airport into line with those at Shannon and Cork and an extra provision of £55,000 by way of payment in lieu of rates is needed.</P>
      <P>In addition, the original Estimate was based on an expected increase of 12½ per cent in rate poundages in county council areas and urban districts, whereas in the event the average increase in these poundages was approximately 15 per cent.  The county borough areas remained at 12½ per cent.  The total extra required is £32,000 approximately, making the total £87,000.</P>

    <P>This Supplementary Estimate is required to meet the cost of pay increases on four Votes.  The Votes concerned and the amount required for each Vote are set out in Part 3 of the Supplementary Estimate.  They are the President's Establishment, the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Courts and the National Gallery.  The amounts required are necessary to meet the cost of the second phase of the 13th Round increase and for some other increases for individual grades.  Under the second phase of the 13th Round the pay of civil servants was increased by 4 per cent plus 63p per week as from 1st January, 1973.  This increase was in accordance with the terms agreed at the Employer-Labour Conference on 21st December, 1970.  The terms of this agreement were applied in the Civil Service to grades below assistant secretary level, following negotiations with the staff.  The estimates for the present year have not made provision for the second phase of the 13th Round but the budget included a reserve for possible public service increases.  Increases for individual grades have arisen following arbitration board findings and the number of settlements based largely on these findings.  The amount sought in this Estimate are the cost of pay increases on the Votes mentioned, offset by savings on the Votes where such savings were available.</P>

      <P>When I was in the Office of Public Works I had to face up to the problem of building as against renting.  While the argument was pretty strong to conserve capital and rent office accommodation I initiated a study of this as a result of which the Government reached the decision that building would be done and before I left office at least three schemes had been put under way for which architects had been appointed to design schemes and another five or six are in hand. While subhead D is not immediately relevant I hope there will be no change of policy in this regard.  In regard to national monuments when I was in charge of the Office of Public Works at no time did I find the Government reluctant to give me funds for the development of parks and monuments.  This is a relatively new section of the Office of Public Works. It has been expanding at a pretty good pace.  I appeal to my successor <Col N="155" /> to impress on the Government the importance of the preservation of national monuments.  They are our heritage.  Once a national monument is gone it is gone forever and cannot be restored.  I hope the incoming Government will look after these items.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £6,519,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st March, 1973, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, including certain Services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain Subsidies, and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The net amount of this Supplementary Estimate added to the original Estimate for 1972-73 represents a total net provision of £83,127,000.  This figure shows an increase of £2,987,000 on the final total Estimate for Agriculture, including the Supplementary Estimate, for 1971-72.  Miscellaneous savings amounting to £4,675,000 have been taken into account.</P>
      <P>In view of the short time available I will be brief.  The biggest item relates to the grant-in-aid for An Bord Bainne for which an additional £4,990,000 is required.  This excess is due to a number of factors including higher than expected export losses on butter and casein and lower than expected profits on the export of skim milk powder. On the other hand due to the increased price paid for skim milk for processing there has been a saving of £1,980,000 on subsidy on liquid skim returned to creamery milk suppliers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next most important item is the further provision, amounting to £1,495,000 net for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis.  This is attributable mainly to the sharp rise in the cost of reactors.  There is also a net additional sum of £745,000 required <Col N="156" /> for the eradication of brucellosis owing to the increase in the compensation payable for reactors.</P>
    <P>Next there is provision for a further £1,000,000 in respect of the Farm Buildings and Water Supplies Schemes. The demand for grants under these schemes has exceeded expectations.</P>
    <P>The Beef Cattle Incentive Scheme requires an additional £500,000 owing to the fact that the number of cows inspected under the scheme in 1972 was greater than had been provided for in the original Estimate.</P>
    <P>Other significant items making up the Supplementary Estimate include the grant-in-aid to An Foras Talúntais, grants to County Committees of Agriculture, the delivery costs of ground limestone, the Land Project, loans to the beef export industry and recoupment of losses on native wheat.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would mention that this Estimate includes the cost of the increase in the mountain lamb subsidy and the subsidy for loans for the purchase of livestock which were provided for in the 1972 Budget.</P>

    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1973, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Foreign <Col N="158" /> Affairs and of certain services administered by that Office, including certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate is required to meet expenditure arising out of payment of compensation to the British Government for malicious damage to two boats belonging to the British Hydrographic Survey vessel, HMS <i>Hecate,</i> which were taken away and blown up on 20th April, 1971, while engaged in a hydrographic survey at Baltimore Harbour, County Cork.  This hydrographic survey was undertaken on behalf of the Irish authorities and for the benefit of Irish interests.</P>
    <P>In expressing regret for the damage the Government, in accordance with normal practice, offered compensation to the British authorities for the amount of damage caused.  A claim amounting to £19,012 in respect of the damage caused to the boats was subsequently received from the British authorities.  Payment of compensation of £19,012 to the British authorities has necessitated opening an additional subhead of the Vote for Foreign Affairs for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Savings amounting to £19,002 can be effected under other subheads in the financial year 1972-73.  A supplementary sum not exceeding £10 is, therefore, required to defray the charge which will come in the course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1973.  I recommend it to the House.</P>

      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is necessary because of additional expenditure totalling £4,660,000 under three subheads but an expected increase of £3,707,000 in appropriations-in-aid reduces the net amount required to £953,000.</P>
      <P>Under subhead D an extra £100,000 is needed to meet higher rates of travelling and subsistence expenses. An extra £330,000 is being provided under subhead E mainly for postal and general stores.  Under subhead F £730 is required for increased purchases of engineering stores.  A sum of £3.5 million is also being provided under subhead F for extra expenditure on telephone development, mainly to meet higher commitments to contractors for the provision and installation of telephone equipment and for underground telephone cabling.</P>
      <P>The increased expenditure of £3.5 million on telephone development is fully offset by a corresponding increase in the Appropriations-in-Aid subhead because expenditure of this nature is recovered from telephone capital funds.  A further increase of £207,000 on the receipt side arises because of a higher payment by the Department of Social Welfare for agency services provided on a repayment basis by the Post Office for that Department.</P>

I hope his stay in office will be somewhat longer than was my period of office in the Department of Transport and Power.  I should like also to thank the Minister for being so prompt during the last weekend in denying reports that once again had circulated regarding negotiations on landing rights at Shannon Airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="161" /> One group of newspapers in particular&mdash;the <i>Independent</i> newspaper chain&mdash;referred on two occasions in the last week to the fact that the incoming Minister had inherited the situation that the previous Minister and Government had conceded certain claims.  During the last few weeks while I was still Minister I corrected that impression which was created by columnists in the <i>Irish Independent.</i> One would have thought that when this was pointed out to them, and having regard to their standards of journalism, the <i>Sunday Independent</i> on Sunday last would not have repeated this error.  In a prominent position on the front page by a special correspondent who was unnamed it was stated:</P>
    <P>One, if not two American Airlines will fly into Dublin from May 1st.  This is the situation which the new Minister for Transport and Power found facing him when he took office from Mr. Michael O'Kennedy.  The agreement to this effect has already been reached. So ends the battle to keep them out which has been going on for five years.</P>
    <P>There is not much we can say here in answer to special correspondents who are unnamed.  However, if they had regard to the same standard of ethics in journalism as they preach we should have in politics they would at least have heeded the fact that the statement had been proved to be untrue. I do not wish to make any comment whatever on what stage negotiations had reached.</P>
    <P>I hope that the <i>Sunday Independent</i> will at least give the same prominence to this statement of mine as they gave on the front page last Sunday to a statement which was blatantly and totally incorrect.  I should like to thank the Minister for being so prompt in denying it and to wish him well in the further negotiations on this matter.  I think he, the Press and the public will find that the previous Government and my predecessors in this office, and their advisers, served the nation well in this matter.  I hope the Minister will do <Col N="162" /> the same in the conclusion of these negotiations.</P>

      <P>The gross amount required in this Supplementary Estimate is actually £1,085,000 but there will be an offset of a surplus of £40,000 on Appropriations-in-Aid.

    <P>£400,000 for the Industrial Development Authority to meet increased advertising and promotional activities and salary increases;</P>

    <P>The Minister said there was provision for an extra £400,000 for the Industrial Development Authority to enable them to expand their promotional work.  I was very pleased when I obtained it from the then Minister for Finance because of the necessity for this industrial promotional work. I hope the Minister will continue to give the fullest possible assistance to the IDA.  I hope that in the United States, where possibly the greatest <Col N="164" /> amount of promotional work takes place and from which we attract a great deal of our industries, interest will be maintained.</P>
    <P>The additional £122,000 provided for SFADCo was for similar purposes. I hope the Minister will be able to maintain the assistance to the IDA and SFADCo for the attraction of industry which is so very important to us.  We must maintain the expansion in our industrial development.  I also hope that the Minister will be able to make provision for additional moneys for the National Development Association who were so busily engaged in a buying and selling Irish campaign. Now more than ever, additional money is required under those headings.</P>
    <P>On a local basis I want to draw the Minister's attention to the provision in the Estimate for £4,000 under subhead T. for Rossmore New Collieries Limited.  This money was being spent to keep the old Rossmore Collieries on the Laois-Kilkenny boundary pumped out, or to keep the mine pumped out. I understand that it has been purchased by new owners who have plans for its expansion.  I hope the incoming Minister for Industry and Commerce will give every assistance possible to the new owners.  There is no objection on this side of the House to providing this money.</P>

    <P>The increased provision in subhead A.2 covers additional expenditure on travelling as well as the cost of my Department's participation in the scientific and technical exhibition recently organised by the Royal Dublin Society.</P>
    <P>The extra money required under subhead A.5 arises out of salary and <Col N="166" /> wage increases due to the 13th round, as well as the increased cost of materials.  The £25,800 in A.6 is a new provision to cover the general expenses of the National Council for Educational Awards established after the commencement of the financial year, while the increase under subhead D.2 is necessary because of the provision of a special course for training college students.</P>
    <P>The extra money required under subhead D.3 for school transport is due to increased wages to part-time drivers arising out of a Labour Court award made after the Estimates had been prepared, as well as the fact that transport costs rose to an extent greater than anticipated.</P>
    <P>The money required under subhead F.1 is to cover the purchase price of a gold coin issued by the Duke of Ormond in 1641, while the grant to Rosc Teoranta is to enable Rose to clear off outstanding accounts remaining as a result of the 1971 Art exhibition.</P>
    <P>The total additional requirements in Vote 27 is offset to the extent of £150,000 by anticipated savings in a number of other subheads of the Vote.</P>
    <P>In Vote 28, £3,548,000 of the extra money is required to meet increased salaries in national schools.  The increased provision in subhead A.1 over increased salaries as well as capital provision of £320,000 for the extension and modernisation of the training colleges.  An additional £58,000 is also required under subhead A.2 for grants and loans to students in training colleges.  The increase under subhead A.3 is necessary because of the attendance of teachers on special courses being greater than anticipated.  The increased provision of £40,000 under subhead C.5 is to meet the cost of grants for the painting of national schools.</P>
    <P>The extra £150,000 in Vote 29, A.3 is required to clear the backlog of cases awaiting grants for furnishing and equipping special subject rooms.  The increase of £1,800,000 in subhead B is due to increased salaries to secondary teachers.  The money required in subhead <Col N="167" /> C is to cover the increased cost of examiners and superintendents due to the number taking the certificate examinations being greater than anticipated, while the provision of £90,000 in subhead J.1 is to meet the extra salary costs of teachers.  In subhead K it is necessary to provide an additional £27,000 for grants towards the cost of free school books for necessitous pupils.</P>
    <P>The total additional requirement in Vote 29 is offset by £90,000 in increased receipts from refunds of portion of capital savings in subhead L.&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid &mdash; and by anticipated savings in a number of subheads amounting to £170,000.</P>
    <P>In Vote 30, £1,670,000 is being provided in subhead A for the annual grants to vocational education committees to meet the commitment for the increased cost of salaries to vocational education teachers and to enable them to meet other increased charges.  In subhead B an additional £90,000 is necessary to meet the increased costs, including salaries, of the special training courses for teachers as well as to meet deficits incurred in recent years by the training colleges of home economics.  An extra £6,000 is required in subhead F to meet the extra costs of examinations arising from the extra numbers taking these examinations. An additional £68,000 is required for the extra cost of teachers' salaries in the regional technical colleges as well as a capital provision of £150,000 for the building of these colleges.</P>
    <P>In Vote 32, £1,227,000 of the additional provision is for increased salaries and wages as well as to defray part of the accumulated deficits of UCD., UCC., UCG., Trinity College, the Dublin Dental Hospital and the College of Pharmacy.  Provision is also being made for additional capital expenditure of £650,000 in the case of University College, Galway, and of £80,000 in the case of the College of Physical Education in Limerick.  These extra provisions are offset to the amount of £210,000 by anticipated savings in other provisions in Vote 32.</P>
    <P>In connection with the submission of these Supplementary Estimates it may be of interest to the House to <Col N="168" /> learn that programmed budgeting has been fully implemented in my Department. I think it speaks well for our progress that recently we had a visit from EEC representatives in order that they might learn something from us preparatory to the development of programmed budgeting in their Budget Bureau.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased that this very substantial sum of money, more than £10 million, be provided by means of Supplementary Estimates for additional services in the current year. These Supplementary Estimates were prepared, of course, under my direction and they represent an increase of some 11 per cent on the unprecedently high provision of almost £97 million contained in the main Estimate for the services for which the Minister for Education is responsible.  I do not feel called on to comment in detail on the various items in these Supplementary Estimates.  Taken together, they are a further indication of the Fianna Fáil Government's commitment in the field of education.</P>

      <P>May I comment on the policy of this Department as directed by the previous Government &mdash;I take it I am permitted to refer to all the Supplementary Estimates from Nos. 27 to 32?  What I have to say affects my city particularly and it concerns the proliferation of prefabricated structures as schoolrooms throughout the country.  They are offensive and do not conform to the standards required by private citizens under planning law.  I should like to see a change in this policy so that we shall see decent schoolrooms.  In this connection I make particular reference to vocational schools and I particularly refer the Minister to such schools in my city.  They are being built up on the lines of wartime military camps and a number of people are beginning to growl about it.  It is time for a change in this policy.</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy Coogan's point about prefabs, I will bear his views in mind when I come to study the question of primary school buildings. The Deputy will appreciate that it is early days yet and I have not had an opportunity to examine these things in detail.  With regard to the question concerning the NCEA headquarters, I have not yet made a decision.  I am sure the Deputy will be anxious that the headquarters will be located in his particular area and I will bear this in mind when making my decision.  With regard to the Duke of Ormond coin, I understand that all the money in the subhead refers to that.  It must be a valuable one.  I wish to thank the House for the way in which they have received the Supplementary Estimate.</P>

      <P>The additional sum is required to meet extra expenditure arising on the Vote of the Office of the Minister for Justice in the year ending on 31st March, 1973, which was not foreseen when the original Estimates were being prepared.  Of the total extra sum required, £770,000 is needed to pay compensation to firms who held stocks of ammonium nitrate and sodium chlorate and were unable to dispose of them when the Government made the Explosives (Ammonium Nitrate and Sodium Chlorate) Order, 1972 (No. 191 of 1972) on 9th August, 1972.  A further net sum of £4,000 is required to meet the extra cost of legal aid, travelling expenses and Post Office services, and to offset a deficiency in the estimated Appropriations-in-Aid. The total extra amount needed for these items is £33,565 but this is offset by savings of £29,565&mdash; mainly on subhead A (salaries)&mdash;elsewhere in the Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government Order of 9th August brought ammonium nitrate and sodium chlorate under the controls created by the Explosives Act, 1875, and the various orders made under that Act.  This meant that these materials, being explosives, could no longer be sold or used in the State except under licence.  Furthermore the object of the order would be achieved only by ensuring that licences would not in fact be given.  For security reasons no advance notice of the making of the order was or could have been given and for the same reasons <Col N="172" /> it was undesirable to keep the materials in the State.  Accordingly, through no fault of theirs, importers and traders were left with stocks which they could not dispose of. Agreement was reached between my Department and the importers to have the materials re-exported by the importers at the best price which could be negotiated, on the understanding that compensation would be paid by the Exchequer for the actual losses which they incurred.  Other ways of disposing of the materials were considered but the cost to the Exchequer would have been far in excess of the amount now required.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The additional sum is required to meet extra expenditure arising on the Garda Síochána Vote in the year ending on 31st March, 1973, which was not foreseen when the original Estimates were being prepared.  Of the total extra sum required, £1,460,000 <Col N="173" /> is needed to meet the cost of applying to the Garda Síochána the increases in pay which were granted under agreements reached at the Garda Conciliation Council, and an arbitrator's award; these increases were in line with increases granted to public servants and to teachers and were additional to the general pay rounds. A further £209,000 is required to meet the cost of applying to the force the increases in pay which were granted under the second phase of the 13th round pay agreement.  The balance of the extra funds is required to meet overtime pay to the force which was not provided for in the original Estimate&mdash;approximately £341,000.  The total gross sum required is, therefore, £2,010,000 but, allowing for anticipated savings of £160,000 elsewhere in the Garda Vote, the net additional sum required is £1,850,000.</P>

On this Estimate I should like to point out the importance of the Garda Síochána, the importance of giving them support numerically and otherwise.  This can be debated more appropriately on the main Estimate but no opportunity should be missed by us, seeing that such opportunities are relatively seldom in this House now, of emphasising the importance of the force, their morale and of maintaining them at strength, increasing that strength and keeping them in a happy condition.</P>

The emphasis today is on the improvement of conditions in jails but it is time that we got our priorities right.  Some people would like to turn our jails into holiday camps.  Possibly prisoners' conditions might be bettered.  I think the Minister should look into this matter and maintain a proper balance in <Col N="174" /> regard to the maintenance of law and order.  We should not have the lawlessness and disorder we have at present. I appeal to the Minister to investigate the conditions in Garda stations throughout the country and do something to improve them.</P>

      <P>May I express my gratitude to Deputy de Valera for his good wishes.  It is encouraging to receive these on taking up this particular post.  I entirely sympathise with his plea for support for the Garda. In fact, at the passing-out parade in Templemore last week I indicated that the Government would be fully behind the Garda and would support them in carrying out their duties without fear or favour.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see that sentiment reciprocated on the other side of the House.  I share Deputy de Valera's concern with regard to the morale of the Garda needing to be supported. We must also be concerned with material matters affecting their wellbeing and I can assure the Deputy that these will have priority in my activities within the Department.  I understand the numerical establishment will come to full strength fairly soon in fulfilment of the programme initiated by my predecessor, to whom I should, at this stage, like to pay tribute.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coogan can be satisfied that conditions, which are relevant towards the maintenance and the improvement of morale, will also have a high priority in my activities.</P>

This is another precedent; we are to have an adjournment now after the usual two weeks already between the coming together of the new Dáil and the commencement of public business.  It is surprising, to say the least of it, that some business is not ready which could be taken in the two weeks before the Easter adjournment period.  There <Col N="176" /> were some Bills drafted and there were some Bills almost completed.  I appreciate that the new Government could not be committed willy-nilly to Bills drafted by their predecessors, but the Bills could have been taken on Second Stage and any amendments desired could have been made on the Committee Stage.  There was one Bill in particular, a Bill about which the Opposition at the time expressed some concern; I refer to the Ministers and Secretaries Bill providing for the setting up of a new Department of State following on the recommendation in the Devlin Report.  While I appreciate that the Government could not be expected to accept these Bills as drafted by their predecessors, the next two weeks could have been availed of to debate some of the issues involved.</P>
      <P>I suggested today that we might have a debate on the British Government's White Paper on Northern Ireland.  I realise that it would be too early to have such a discussion either this week or next week because the White Paper was published only a little more than a week ago, but I should like to ask the Taoiseach if he would indicate how soon after the proposed re-assembly there will be a debate on the White Paper.</P>
      <P>As I said at the outset, I am surprised that the Taoiseach should suggest an adjournment of more than a month.</P>

      <P>As I said earlier, circumstances are somewhat unusual. Printing problems have delayed the preparation of the Estimates and that is the sole reason for the budget being put back until the approximate date I mentioned.  So far as a debate on the White Paper is concerned, if the Opposition is agreeable I shall arrange to have the debate in the first week after the resumption.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Taoiseach what is the purpose in having a debate on the White Paper next May?  Surely a debate would be irrelevant at that point of time.  Discussion on the White Paper should take place here and now.  It is irresponsible to defer the debate.  Obviously, we are running away from the matter. Everyone can discuss it, including the British Parliament, but we do not think it worth our while to have a debate.  I appeal to the Taoiseach: there should not be any adjournment until the White Paper is discussed. The fact that such a lengthy adjournment is proposed is proof that the new Government is not overburdened with work.  There is really no excuse.  We are only running away from it.  Worse still, we are seen to be running away from it.</P>

      <P>It is a rather lengthy question.  I am appealing to the Taoiseach not to adjourn without having a debate on the White Paper.  Certainly, we should not adjourn until 2nd May.  The debate could be taken next week.  I know the Taoiseach has problems starting off in a new Government, but I do not consider those problems sufficient reason for not having a debate.  I appeal to the Taoiseach not to relegate the White Paper to Limbo.</P>

      <P>As I explained to the Leader of the Opposition, I do not think there is any need to rush the debate on the White Paper.  Circumstances, as far as I can see, will not alter substantially between now and the resumption of the Dáil.  There may, in fact, be an advantage in deferring the debate until then.  As Deputy Lynch pointed out, the White Paper has only been published.  Different views have been expressed and it may be to our advantage to avail of the time in between to assess the views expressed and the comments made and then have a debate here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I put this further point to the Taoiseach?  In view of the shortcomings of the White Paper, shortcomings which are legion, would he agree there is great need for a debate here so that some of the important omissions might be put to the British Government and others in the hope that even at this late stage the White Paper might be altered in its intent if not in its form.  Waiting for comment from other quarters is not serving our purpose.  If the document were one that could be regarded as, say, near perfect, I agree that there would be a usefulness in waiting for comment and then having a debate on what everybody else had said.  It must be obvious that the White Paper is so short and requires so much radical change that for this Parliament to remain silent on the matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach if he recalls that several members of the Labour Party, some of whom are now members of his Government, were on record recently in recommendations which they made to a committee of this House as suggesting that the House should sit on four or five days in each week, that the summer recess should be limited to a month or six weeks and that the recesses at Christmas and Easter should be limited to a week or two on each occasion?  Does the Taoiseach reconcile the views of the Labour Party with the proposal of the Government of which they are now members?  Does he realise also, that if the Dáil adjourns now, the House <Col N="179" /> will have sat on two days between December and May?  That is scarcely a satisfactory situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that we will need time to consider that report.  It is one of the matters we have in mind but he will appreciate also that this Government came into office only a fortnight ago. Many of these matters are taking time to consider and allowing for the fact <Col N="180" /> that we have had already to consider as a matter of urgency the White Paper and other matters and to give Ministers an opportunity to read even the current files in the Department, it is a reasonable proposal.  At the most it is only about two weeks longer than the normal Easter recess and in the circumstances it is reasonable.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 7.55 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 2nd May, 1973.</P>

      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to answer Questions Nos. 201 to 208 together.  Statistics on the lines sought in these questions have not yet been compiled for the years 1971 and 1972.  Much information of the type sought is contained in the Annual Reports on Prisons.  The latest report to be published is that for 1970 and some work has been done on the reports for 1971 and 1972.  However, the heavy demands on the staff of the prison service in the last couple of years has led to arrears in statistical analysis and in other work not essential to the maintenance and development of the service.  These demands arose from the almost doubling of the prison population in the last five years, from the acquisition of new detention centres and their equipment and from various disturbances that took place in the prisons, among them the riot in May, 1972, which destroyed large portions of Mountjoy Prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prison staff could not be diverted to statistical and similar work in the immediate future except at the expense of urgent current work and essential <Col N="92" /> planning, but work on the 1971 and 1972 reports will be resumed as soon as possible with a view to the publication of the reports with the minimum delay.</P>
