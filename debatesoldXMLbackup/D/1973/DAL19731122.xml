      <P>It is proposed to take Business in the following order: Nos. 7 and 8, Vote 37 resumed.  It is proposed to take No. 7, the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1973 until 2.30 p.m., and to resume the Agricultural Estimate after questions.  By agreement of the House, it is proposed that I would make a statement at 3.30 p.m. on the outcome of the discussions yesterday in Belfast, and that the leader of the Opposition would make a statement afterwards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>I must again emphasise that the increase in the number of seats in the Dublin area is entirely without proper thought.  Why the increase in Dublin and the decrease in the west of Ireland?  The Minister stated that it was particularly desirable that the historic county boundaries should be preserved as far as possible, and that natural communities <Col N="312" /> should not be divided between different constituencies.</P>
      <P>Looking at the west of Ireland, and the various counties and constituencies there, I wonder is the Minister really sincere in that statement which he has made on a number of occasions in this House and on radio programmes.  It is probable that the idea of increasing the number of seats in Dublin is to safeguard the Coalition Government, because in the east of Ireland there are 12 or 13 members of the present Cabinet, and not one worthy representative from the west of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Two thousand years ago three wise men were discovered in the east.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully) James Tully">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. Tully)</NameTxt>
      <P>There were so many in the west that you had to ask some of them to resign a couple of years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>There were three wise men in the east, Melchior, Balthasar and Caspar.  Two thousand years later the Taoiseach discovered 14 Melchiors, Balthasars and Caspars in the east.  In trying to justify that situation the Minister proposes to increase the number of seats in Dublin although the population does not justify that increase as compared with the population in the west.  According to the figures quoted in this House last Thursday, the population in the west, following the last census was 578,039, and the number of Deputies was 30.  If one were to retain the 30 seats the average per Deputy would be 19,267 which, the Minister will accept, is above the constitutional minimum. That is the situation west of the Shannon, from Donegal to Clare.</P>
      <P>The population of Clare and Galway increased between the last two censuses. Clare increased considerably and Galway also increased but just the same it is proposed to have a TD less for the two counties and a constituency less. I spoke of this constituency on the last occasion.  It is a constituency which I represented over the last few years with other good people, Deputy Callanan, Deputy Hogan-O'Higgins and the former Deputy Carty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present there are roughly 75,000 people in County Clare and 62,731 in <Col N="313" /> West Galway.  If the population of West Galway would not justify 4 seats, the population of Clare would. The Minister has created a four-seater in West Galway.  I have already given what I thought was the reason. The Press have already made a member of the Minister's party favourite for the seat in West Galway. With my own party's approval, I might even contest a little race and prove to the Minister and to the media that their assessment of form might not be altogether correct.</P>

      <P>The election down in Clare and Galway certainly showed that I was accepted by the people.  No matter what the people want to do about voting for me personally, the Minister has ensured that two-thirds of the people who voted for me before cannot vote for me again.  The constituency is&mdash;I will not use the word &ldquo;butchered&rdquo;.  Mr. Dockrell speaking here the other day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry.  Deputy Dockrell described his constituency and said it has gone back to the old situation, Dublin South Central.  He said that on the north side of the city the constituency went as far as the canal and included the area at the back of Mountjoy Jail and from there almost to Charlemont House.  Imagine that for a journey: from the Liffey up as far as Mountjoy Jail and over to Charlemont House.  Is that not a very extensive area?  Compare it with <Col N="314" /> the proposed West Galway constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy please let us have the reference as there are two Deputies with the same name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Maurice Dockrell.  I expect that the other Deputy has a larger area extending from Ringsend to Ballsbridge.  Compare that with the proposed West Galway constituency which stretches from County Mayo, around by Connemara and away down into County Clare almost to the town of Ennis and stretching to Lahinch which is a pretty well known golfing centre. Many Deputies from Dublin city would have plenty of time to play golf there, whereas the local TDs would not have time because they would be travelling around their constituency.</P>
      <P>It was suggested that Deputies represent people, not areas, and that is correct.  In this area of West Galway there are various problems.  Starting at the northern end you have the mountains of Connemara and the problem of housing the people.  You have the tremendous problem of getting ESB supply for them at a cost of anything up to £1,000 per house for a man in the mountains of Connemara who wishes to have electricity installed.  You have sheep grants and mountain grants, inland fishing, the lakes of Connemara where there are some restrictions on fishing by the natives.  You have extensive forestry. All these present problems to the representatives of the people.</P>
      <P>Further south there is a dairying industry with the problems of milk prices.  You have beet growing.  You have extensive sea fishing and extensive tourism.  Galway city has all the problems you have in Dublin city. There is a university there and the biggest hospital in the country is in Galway city with the biggest bed complement of any hospital in Ireland.  In Connemara you have remote areas where a doctor is not available.  All these things lead to problems for the TDs and each TD would possibly have twice as much to do as TDs in Dublin city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="315" /> On the question of tourism I was amazed recently to learn that small people who extend their houses with a view to tourism find it very hard to get a Bord Fáilte grant, whereas a couple of millionaires in the hotel business are getting grants of up to £500,000 from Bord Fáilte.  The big problem in Galway harbour is similar to the problem in Dublin harbour. Deputy Dockrell mentioned the loss of his friends from across the river Liffey.  He is a good man to walk and it would not take him long to cover his constituency and he could meet his friends on the other side of the Liffey.</P>
    <P>The Minister's figures were not all correct.  He was corrected the other day by Deputy Molloy.  I am glad we have an observant man in the front bench of our party.  The Minister gave a wrong figure and, decently enough, he came back to the House and explained that he had given a wrong figure for representation in Dublin.  He gave the figure of 20,840 which was corrected to 20,142 by Deputy Molloy.  The Minister agreed that that was substantially the correct figure.</P>
    <P>I do not have to refer to the fact that in Dublin there are three-seater constituencies and that Cork is a five-seater. I will leave that to the Cork Deputies who should be well able to deal with it.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach made a rather personal reference to Deputy Molloy when he was speaking about the 1971 census.  He said:</P>
    <P>...the number of people actually standing behind Deputy Molloy himself once this Bill becomes law and if he is re-elected will be, in fact, smaller and substantially smaller than the number of people standing behind any Dublin Deputy.</P>
    <P>Between the last two censuses the population of Galway increased.  Surely the number of people behind Deputy Molloy would be greater this time all things being equal, than last time unless it is Government policy to continue to concentrate on the east, thereby causing a denuding of the population <Col N="316" /> in the west in order that Deputy Molloy might lose out.  The Parliamentary Secretary said that TDs should follow the number of country people coming to Dublin.  He said:</P>
    <P>....all one has to do is to be a Dublin Deputy going around during election time and knocking on doors to know....</P>
    <P>If that is the only time the Parliamentary Secretary meets the people, surely that points to bad representation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Deputy does not believe that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe everything the Parliamentary Secretary states and that is here in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, in fairness to himself, that the Deputy is taking him out of context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>He said,&ldquo;knocking on doors to know&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>He instanced that as a very good overall test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is.  In my constituency I meet them everywhere and they call daily to my house. It is a different type of representation. The Parliamentary Secretary said at column 2026, volume 268 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>It is idiotic for a spokesman like Deputy Molloy to be whinging about Dublin getting seats and the west not.  This is a small country with a small population.  I freely admit that the bigger a city the more services it attracts and a scattered population may be neglected and will not have the same concentration of services.</P>
      <P>A scattered population may be neglected.  I gather from that statement that that is the present Government's policy.  It would so appear from a statement like that made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I advise the Minister from my heart &mdash;I am not thinking personally of myself in this case&mdash;of his own party's interests in County Clare.  In 1968, Deputy Barry Desmond, speaking at <Col N="317" /> a Labour convention criticised the government of the day for having made Clare a three-seat constituency; he said they should have retained a four-seater in the interests of the Labour Party.  Prior to that, Labour had a seat in Clare.  The Minister is letting down Labour supporters in Clare by not having a four-seater and by trying to justify a seat in West Galway where, I can assure him, Labour will not get the fourth seat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I will let the Deputy have a look at what was proposed by my predecessor.  Whatever chance the Deputy may have now he would have none at all under the proposals of my predecessor.  What Deputy Molloy was arranging would leave the Deputy with a pretty tough fight on his hands. I will let the House have this later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I will show his proposals to the House and everyone can see for himself then.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not worry about Cork.  I will deal with Cork.  The Minister will be very surprised in Cork, I am afraid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not detain the House any longer.  I wish the Minister well.  I know that the census rendered it necessary to make certain alterations here and there.  More luck to the Minister if he can alter to suit his party to the best advantage, but he has misfired in Clare and Galway.  I will make a small bet that both East Galway and West Galway will have three Fianna Fáil Deputies each and there will be two in Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a subject which is somewhat strange to a new Deputy.  I have not been reared, as it were, on the history of constituencies unlike some of the Deputies who have contributed and will contribute to the debate.  When <Col N="318" /> the debate started, I expected we would get some assistance from the chief spokesman of the Opposition as to the difficulties he saw in relation to the Bill.  I understand he himself had got to a fairly advanced stage in working out his own calculations as to how constituencies should be drawn.  There was an interesting interjection by the Minister a few moments ago concerning certain proposals for the last speaker's constituency in the west and it reinforces a suspicion I had that this legislation was actually one of the reasons for the sudden calling of the last general election. Deputy Molloy was Minister for Local Government and I have a feeling that the Bill was going to be drafted in such a way that certain members of the Fianna Fáil Party would find it difficult to get back to this House.  I believe there was a deliberate policy in that regard and the purpose of the Bill was to remove those who disagreed with the leadership of the Fianna Fáil Party and because the Bill was going to create trouble, the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party had no option but to go to the country before the Bill was introduced in this House.</P>
      <P>I am reinforced in that view and that suspicion by the fact that Deputy Molloy has not seen fit to give us any particulars as to what he himself was proposing.  He was, after all, in the saddle when the matter was first mooted.  It was mentioned in October and again in November and, over that period of time, one would have expected Deputy Molloy to have prepared some particulars, particulars as to what he proposed to do, particulars he could have furnished to us in this debate to support his objections to the present measure.  He was challenged by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach to produce those details.  He made quite a vitriolic attack on the Bill and, feeling so strongly about it, surely he could have put his cards on the table.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come back to the first point I mentioned, namely, what I believe to be one of the reasons for the sudden calling of the last general election, I did not care for the references made by Deputy Molloy in his contribution <Col N="319" /> to my constituency of Wexford. Deputy Molloy used the word &ldquo;gerrymander&rdquo; and I am going to use it now in regard to what I think his thinking is.  I think it was the intention of Fianna Fáil again to gerrymander the Wexford constituency. There was at one time a considerable cleavage in Fianna Fáil thinking within the Wexford constituency.  That, again, is in line with my thinking.  It is relevant to my thinking that the last general election was called before a constituency Bill, which was too hot to handle, could be brought before the House by the former Taoiseach and his Cabinet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>That was Deputy Lynch's decision&mdash;the Cabinet knew nothing about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the reasons he had to go to the country. He could not take the risk of kicking the ball into the playing field of politics because the real domestic history, the internal dissensions of Fianna Fáil, would then have appeared.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy referred to the matter of convenience and the size of constituencies.  He gave great mileage to administrative and county boundaries forgetting that it was the policy of his Department when he was in control and that it was the policy of his Cabinet colleagues to do away with many of the local bodies.  I take his argument with a considerable grain of salt.  I do not think it was a very genuine argument, nor was it intended to be such&mdash;rather was it a kind of fill-in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have before me a map showing the proposed constituency boundaries. As all Members know, there is no proposal to adjust or change the boundaries of the Wexford constituency I have the honour to represent.  However, if Deputies look at the map they will see that a certain portion of Wexford was hived off about 15 years ago.  One might wonder why that piece was hived off.  Was it because it was rather near the residence of the then Fine Gael Deputy, or was it for administrative convenience?  From the point of <Col N="320" /> view of administrative convenience I find it difficult to see any reason for hiving off part of Enniscorthy and the Bunclody area as all the administrative business of the area is dealt with in the town of Wexford and through the Wexford County Council.  If one looks carefully at the map, one can see that that portion is on the eastern side of the Blackstairs mountain; one does not make a place more accessible and more convenient when people have to climb a mountain to get there.  I am not at all convinced by the argument put forward by the leading spokesman for the Opposition in connection with this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Loughnane referred to the problems of travelling with which rural Deputies in particular have to deal.  It must be realised that in a country constituency there is a great orientation towards the local county hall and any rural Deputy will have to admit that 50 per cent of his work deals with local authorities at local level.  I have not been a Member of this House for very long and I am not a member of any local authority but notwithstanding that fact people come to me&mdash;and I hope they will continue to do so&mdash; regarding difficulties that arise at administrative level concerning local problems.  It means that people in the Bunclody area come to me regarding local matters but in relation to parliamentary matters they must go to their Deputies for Carlow-Kilkenny.  There is a considerable amount of crossing in this constituency.  People come to me and I have to refer them to another Deputy; people go to Deputy Governey and he has to refer them to me.  This is a blatant case where there was a deliberate gerrymander and it was done with the purpose of taking votes from the Fine Gael Deputy in North Wexford.  However, in the course of time we have learned to live with it.</P>
    <P>There were references to a Cork constituency and a complaint was made that what up to now was a purely urban constituency had been pushed into a rural constituency.  I cannot understand the objections to that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Neither did Deputy Molloy because that was what he was doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="321" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is a very good thing.  In past elections we have recollections of attempts to set rural interests against urban interests.  This was a regular ploy by the governments of the past.  It is desirable to have a combination of both interests in the one constituency because it cuts out dissension and introduces an air of cooperation and understanding.  If I have the honour of addressing a constituency meeting in Dublin city, I find people are quite unaware of the problems faced by people in rural Ireland.  It is almost as if one were talking to two different nationalities.  Therefore, I commend the Minister for what he has done in relation to the Cork constituency.  There is sometimes an attitude of mind that when people leave rural areas they have got the cow dung off their boots, they now wear polished shoes and look down on their country cousins. That is a wrong view and the people who adopt it are stupid but there is this attitude of mind and for this reason also I commend the Minister for his action in relation to the Cork constituency.</P>
      <P>Speaking as a practical working Deputy who has a large urban area in his constituency, I am grateful that I am dealing with a mixed community because I consider this keeps me in touch with problems.  In fact, I am rather sorry for the city Deputy who has to deal with a certain limited sphere.  Deputy Loughnane has instanced what is involved when one is obliged to travel a lot.  I do not think the average country Deputy objects to a bit of travel.  It may not be well known that a considerable number of people travel to their Deputy and are glad to do so.  Frequently it is regarded as a day out; on Sunday afternoons groups of families come to see me and I am sure this is the experience of other country Deputies.  These meetings are often regarded as social occasions.  With modern transport there are no great difficulties involved although I realise there may be a problem regarding time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies have clinics and frequently rural Deputies go to an area and spend some time there.  If there is any emergency they can always <Col N="322" /> be contacted by telephone.  Furthermore, the recent assistance given to Deputies in respect of long-distance telephones has resulted in easier contact with constituents in rural areas. I do not know whether this is strictly relevant to the Bill but there has been reference to a situation that is likely to arise in the future but how soon I do not know.  I refer to the possibility of the direct election of Deputies from provincial areas to the European Parliament.  In such event there would be much to be said for the larger-numbered rural constituencies because the more territory a Deputy would have at his disposal the better from his point of view.  If county boundaries are breached so much the better for the Deputy concerned because he would have a toe in several counties.</P>
    <P>On the question of a commission on constituencies Deputy Moore said that not handing over issues to outside bodies has done some damage to democracy.  I find that very difficult to understand.  Was the Deputy suggesting that the proper forum for decisions in reference to constituency matters is something that should be taken out of this House?  Was he suggesting that we should not have a say on what representation there should be?  Surely, on the Constitution, we are the ultimate voice of the people who send us here.  Surely we should have the say.</P>
    <P>While we can all understand a little lapse of memory at times I fail to understand the line taken by Deputy Molloy.  In fact, I had difficulty in understanding his speech at all and I have read it twice.  Deputy Molloy was advocating that the matter of constituencies should be dealt with by a commission.  I would refer the House to Volume 237 of the Official Report, for the 4th December, 1968.  At that time the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill was before the House and during the debate on Second Stage the Deputy said in regard to the appointment of a commission:</P>
    <P>...If, however, we were to have an independent commission set up to draw up the constituencies under PR you would have a much different position because the Constitution <Col N="323" /> only states that constituencies must have at least three seats. There is nothing in the Constitution to stop an independent commission from recommending to this House that we should have one constituency with 144 seats.  There would not have been any necessity for them to pay any heed to what we were told was the Irish system of PR.  We could have ended up with recommendations which would have been abhorred not alone by Members of this House but by the vast majority of the people.  We could have ended up with a completely different electoral system, something we did not want at all. I just want to point out the many strange decisions which it would be possible to make by giving an independent commission power to draw up constituencies under PR.</P>
    <P>I did not gather that that was the present thinking of Deputy Molloy. It seems that he thought otherwise about a commission when he was on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I had difficulty, too, in understanding Deputy Moore's contribution.  I think the gist of his argument was that there is an imbalance in the way in which the Minister has drawn the present constituencies and that this amounts to people being denied the right to vote.  We all know what happened not so very long ago to the 18-year-olds in this regard.  Therefore, that type of thinking does not come happily from the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore made one interesting comment but I am still waiting for a development in regard to it.  Perhaps subsequent Opposition speakers will do the job that has not been done so far. I quote the Deputy from column 2047 of the Official Report for 15th November, 1973:</P>
    <P>It is the intention of the Opposition to criticise this Bill and to make suggestions for its improvement in the hope that the Government will listen to them...</P>
    <P>So far I have heard nothing but negative criticism from them, criticism I regret to say, of individuals that can only be described as namecalling.  I <Col N="324" /> hope that as the debate continues it will be carried on in a different spirit.</P>
    <P>Another vital matter is the increase in the number of Deputies.  I have the honour to be a member of quite a few committees of the House and it has been my experience that a Deputy's time is very full.  Very often a Deputy has to look for somebody to fill in for him.  With committee work which often can last four or five hours or a whole day with a short break, and in addition the normal Dáil sittings, there is a fairly big load on a Deputy, who must also look after his constituents.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I cannot see any argument for restriction of the number of Deputies.  Indeed, I am all for the provision in the Bill in this respect and I regard the small increase as a minimal one.  I do not think this House would suffer if there were a great many more Deputies.  However, I suppose we must be grateful for small mercies and the limitations of legislation have to be considered. Difficulties will arise in reference to matters like the EEC and the OECD and through the requirements of the joint committee on secondary legislation. These are very time consuming.</P>
    <P>One must appreciate as well that all these committees must find a quorum before the committee can sit and do their business and it has been my experience that, due to work in this House and elsewhere, there have been considerable delays in trying to find quorums for committees.  As I have said, this has been due to Deputies being overstretched in trying to do all their duties associated with the working of Parliament.  I had to wait nearly an hour before a quorum could be found for a rather vital committee which had a time limit to deal with the work.  Eventually we found a quorum.</P>
    <P>That is an unhappy state of affairs and whether one is in Government or Opposition the position is the same. Opposition Deputies have their own behind-the-scenes committees which they have to attend.  What happens in this Chamber is only the tip of the iceberg, a great deal of the work being done in what are known as the corridors <Col N="325" /> of power.  There are meetings of committees and sub-committees.  For instance, in the joint EEC committee there are the main committee and four sub-committees and no week goes by without a meeting of one or other. Dealing with EEC matters is not simple.  Very often one word in a directive or regulation consumes a considerable length of time.  We must appreciate that these matters involve legal and economic technicalities, foreign and native laws.</P>
    <P>As I have said, they are functions which Deputies are expected to perform while at the same time keeping their eyes on this House and doing their work here&mdash;participating in debates, being present for voting and keeping quorums in the House.  These are additional to their normal constituency work.</P>
    <P>There is just one final point I should like to make.  It is to draw a distinction between an urban and a rural constituency. A personal awareness and knowledge of a Deputy in a rural area is far more important than is the case in a city constituency.  Deputies in city areas can have a certain anonymity but in a rural constituency a Deputy must be known personally.  That is one reason why I do not find any objection to a Deputy having to do a considerable amount of travelling.  For instance, my constituency contains nearly half a million acres.  It looks compact on the map but it involves a considerable amount of travel.  I would like to have seen Wexford reverted to a five-seater but I suppose one must make sacrifices to try to get the best possible representation for the west of Ireland.  That is why I was very annoyed when Deputy Molloy kept hammering at the unfairness of the Government in respect of representation to the west of Ireland. I do not know if he appreciates that that was a matter of deep concern to the Government and their supporters&mdash; to try to keep up the representation in the west of Ireland.  On the other hand, Deputy Molloy did not set out the area and tell us how he would have done it.</P>

      <P>I will deal later with a few points made by Deputy Esmonde for whom I have great respect.  First of all, I will deal mainly with Cork city and I am glad the Minister is present while I am doing it.  I suggest to him that he would keep the draft map for Cork city before him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a picture of it in my mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the Minister looking at it during the past few days but he will have to have another look at it as far as Cork is concerned.  However, I will leave that to the members of his party in Cork.  My contribution will be constructive rather than destructive.  Primarily in a review of Dáil constituencies we should talk about people rather than Deputies. We should try to establish an efficient service by Deputies for people and at the same time make it possible for Deputies to perform their duties properly.  The Minister will agree that should be the desire of every Deputy irrespective of the party he belongs to. People are the priority.  It is of vital importance that a Deputy should be able to administer his duties within the constituency he represents.</P>
      <P>I should like to quote from the Minister's statement at column 1987 Volume 268 of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>...Secondly as I have already stated, I endeavoured as far as possible to avoid breaching existing administrative boundaries and tried to ensure that natural communities were not split, unnecessarily. between different constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy Esmonde has left the House because I could have explained a point he mentioned.  I do not think the Minister believes this statement. It is far from the truth when one studies the Bill before us.  I will try to prove this when we come to consider the revision of Cork city.  A great injustice has been done to our second city.  Cork is and has been expanding <Col N="327" /> for many years as the Minister will be aware from his recent visit.  It must now suffer the humiliation of being down-graded by having one seat taken from it in an enlarged Dáil.</P>
    <P>I recall reading a report which was available to members of the Labour Party at its recent conference in Cork. It said that the position in Cork was serious where Labour had no representative in the Dáil and Cork should now get special treatment.  The treatment being afforded to Cork in this Bill is what the Labour Party had in mind.  I want to register the strongest protest against this Bill on behalf of the citizens of Cork.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Deputy register a protest against Deputy Molloy when he proposed to move several thousand people from Victoria Cross to Mid-Cork? I do not want to interrupt the Deputy but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection.  If the Minister has something to say, the House is the place to say it in.  If the Minister makes a statement, he should have proof to back it up.  The Minister is very good at making statements without substantiating them.  If I had spoken on the Estimate for Local Government yesterday, I would have made the same statement: let the Minister produce proof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a statement to the House.  That proposal was made by Deputy Molloy and Fianna Fáil.  I want to put that on record.  Of course, Deputy Molloy might not have told Deputy Wyse about it.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will produce this proof when he is replying to the debate.  I repeat, I want to register the strongest protest on behalf of the citizens of Cork.  I know it will fall on deaf ears.  The people of Cork, will in no uncertain manner, register their protest when it will be most effective.</P>
      <P>The Minister has little or no knowledge of Cork city.  If he had he would not be introducing revision.  I am amazed that the two Fine Gael Deputies representing Cork agree to it.  They and other public representatives have been advocating an extension of our city boundary.  I am sure Deputy O'Sullivan will vouch for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not that kind of man.  It is disappointing to note that the two Cork Deputies agree with the Minister taking a large slice of Cork city and including it in a county constituency. Deputy Barry and Deputy Burke should explain this to the people of Cork.  It is obvious to me why it was done.  I live in the heart of the city.  The suggested boundary line is drawn six doors from my house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister visit Cork.  If he examines a map he will realise what has been done to that city.  It is hard to condone his statement of being fair to the people or Deputies.  Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Deputies never considered the boundary between the two existing constituencies.  We worked for the people of Cork.  Whether one came from the north or south side of the city one was always welcomed to the homes and offices of the Cork city Deputies irrespective of the party they represented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I queried at the outset the Minister's knoweldge of Cork city.  Does he realise that he is taking half of the city and placing it in a constituency which extends to the Limerick border?  He is taking four of the oldest parishes&mdash;Glasheen, The Lough, Ballyphehane and Togher&mdash;from the <Col N="329" /> city.  I am glad Deputy B. Desmond is here.  He will understand what I am talking about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the oldest hurling clubs in the city, St. Finbarrs, has been pushed into the county.  The university, in which the people took great pride and was long associated with the city, is now included in a county constituency.  I would not be surprised if the Minister diverted the River Lee.</P>
      <P>In his introductory statement the Minister said:</P>
      <P>It is particularly desirable that the historic county boundaries should be preserved as far as possible and that natural communities should not be divided between different constituencies.</P>
      <P>I am wholeheartedly in favour of that. I would applaud that idea.  I am involved in community work and I can see the importance of what the Minister has said.  What I cannot understand is why the Minister did not put this idea into operation in Cork.  I do not know who advised the Minister. I doubt if Labour representatives advised the Minister.  Some mistake has been made.  It is not for me to tell the Minister.  Perhaps Deputy Desmond has some ideas about it.</P>

      <P>We will see.  I know this much: this revision will not affect the Fianna Fáil Party in Cork, no matter what way it is twisted, cut, or turned. It will affect the people.  That is the most important consideration.  It will affect the people because they are being deprived of efficiency.  It is the desire of all Deputies to provide an efficient service for their constituents. In the case of a constituency extending from the city of Cork to the Limerick border how can a Deputy provide that kind of efficient service for his constituents?  I ask the Minister, in all fairness to everybody concerned, to see for himself, to study the map of the proposed constituencies.</P>
      <P>I repeat that in his introductory statement the Minister said:</P>
      <P>It is particularly desirable that the historic county boundaries should be preserved as far as possible and that natural communities should not be divided between different constituencies.</P>
      <P>As I have said, I believe in that concept. That is one part of the Minister's statement that I would fully endorse. If the proposed revision of Cork city is not breaching existing boundaries and not dividing communities, I do not know what is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="331" /> I should like the Minister to listen to what I have to say about this.  In the last revision of constituencies we in the Fianna Fáil Party recognised that Cork would warrant an extra seat.  So as to ensure that the city would remain intact, we established a second constituency within the city boundary thus placing Cork in its proper perspective as the second city in Ireland.</P>

      <P>By this revision it is obvious to everybody, especially to the people of Cork, that the Government are running away from the people, that they are trying to lock doors.  No matter what revision they make, no matter what doors they lock, no matter what doors they open, they know what the people are thinking, even the people here in Dublin. I do not have to tell the Minister or Deputy Desmond.</P>
      <P>It is the desire of all Deputies to provide an efficient service for the people they represent.  That is why I am disappointed that Cork city is being carved in the way it is, especially having regard to the fact that it is the second city in Ireland.  I would have applauded the Minister if he had been man enough to say that he recognised the position of Cork and proposed giving an extra seat in Cork.  I wonder why the Minister did not give an extra seat to Cork.  The Minister would have done a good days work for the city of Cork, and for the people of the county of Cork, if he had done so.  I cannot understand why he did not do so because I would say that, even before the revision was thought of, that was something everybody expected, irrespective of their political affiliations.</P>

The Deputy, I believe, is trying to prevent me from reading an article which was published in the <i>Evening Echo</i> on 29th October.  The heading of the article was, &ldquo;Will Cork City Accept This Treatment?&rdquo;.  I will read the article slowly so that the Minister will understand the views of the people down there.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is reading the papers.  The newspaper article to which I have referred reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is freely admitted that when a Government comes to re-draw the electoral constituencies consideration is given to the areas in which the Government support is strong.  This does not mean that a Government could afford the scandal of blatant gerrymandering.  But it does mean that where shifts of population, decreases <Col N="337" /> and increases of population make it necessary to re-draw constituency boundaries or increase or decrease the number of seats allocated to various constituencies, a Government does give consideration to the carrying out of the operation in such manner as to benefit itself to the utmost and at the same time to mitigate the return from the Opposition's areas of strength.  This is accepted practice and, within limitations, quite understandable.</P>
    <P>But it is difficult to understand the thinking of the Minister for Local Government, Mr. James Tully, in relation to Cork city as portrayed in the draft of his Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1973.  This Bill which is to be published and given a second reading in the Dáil next month, blatently defies the big population increase in Cork city.</P>
    <P>I see the Minister is smiling but I should like to ask him to listen to me for a while.  The article continues :&mdash;</P>
    <P>In fact, instead of the city receiving an extra seat in Dáil Éireann, Mr. Tully proposes that the Cork city representation should be cut by one seat.</P>
    <P>Prior to the June 1969 General Election, Cork city had been a five-seat constituency.  The increase in the city's population, however, has resulted in the city being divided into two wards &mdash; North-west and South-east &mdash; each of three seats. Thus the representation of Cork city was increased from five to six seats.</P>
    <P>Now, despite the increase in the city's population in the interim, Mr. Tully proposes that Cork city should be satisfied again with five Dáil seats.</P>
    <P>To keep the matter in perspective it is necessary to record that Mr. Tully's department has been most anxious to consolidate Cork city and its environs into one managerial authority &mdash; a move which has the full support of Cork Corporation but which is resisted by Cork County Council.  It is claimed locally &mdash; and apparently <Col N="338" /> accepted in the Department &mdash; that the welfare of Cork city and its future development could best be safeguarded by bringing the city and its extensive area of influence under one managerial authority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I would not interrupt again but the Deputy is now talking about a decision taken by the previous Government, not this Government. I have not indicated my support for what the Deputy has said.</P>

What do you do?  You continue it as a sprawling constituency which you once condemned.  Let us be realistic. The article continues:</P>
      <P>And so Cork which had expected that its population would ensure it a representation of seven city deputies, now appears to be doomed to be reduced to five seats.  It is to be hoped that this measure will not only be sternly opposed by Fianna Fáil but that the influential Cork Minister for Transport and Power, Mr. Peter Barry, and his fellow deputy, Mr. Liam Burke, will employ their best efforts to ensure that the second city of the State is not thus cynically downgraded.</P>
      <P>When Cork was a five-seater constituency the normal representation was two Fianna Fáil, two Fine Gael and one Labour, although on at least one occasion, if my memory serves me right, the breakdown was three Fianna Fáil and one each for Labour and Fine Gael.  The Labour seat was in the long-time safe custody of the late much-esteemed Seán Casey.</P>

With the co-operation of the Minister he is now trying to squeeze me out of Cork city so that the Labour vote may go to a Labour candidate.  We see the sinister move behind all this.  Deputy Desmond is admitting it.  What is being done is patently obvious.

      <P>The Minister has not got the point.  He is downgrading Cork city and that will reflect on his own party in Cork.  He can be assured of that.  Deputy Esmonde asked for suggestions.  I will make one now.  We are the second city in the State and we should be entitled to one extra seat.  Whether that seat goes to the Labour Party, to Fine Gael or to Fianna Fáil, or somebody else, we should have one extra seat.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to give serious consideration to this and to give Cork city an extra seat in the enlarged Dáil.  I said at the outset we should not be talking only about Deputies.  Deputy Desmond intervened and I was obliged to answer him.  I came to talk about people and the importance of giving them the services they need.  Cork city has many problems to face and it needs the services of an extra Deputy.  I should like to know who advised the Minister regarding the revision of the Cork City constituency.  Deputy Esmonde asked that suggestions be made to the Minister.  On behalf of the people in Cork city I am telling the Minister we need the services of another Deputy.  If the Minister grants this he will be recognising that Cork is a developing city with an increasing population who need the extra service.  The greatest surprise was that it was a Labour Minister who downgraded us&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I suggest to Deputy Desmond that he should take a good look at the map and see the areas that are going into Mid-Cork and then he might have some understanding of what I am saying.  If he would do that it would be a pleasure for me to listen to what he has to say, but at this stage I strongly recommend him to confine his remarks to his own constituency and leave Cork alone.  I was glad Deputy Esmonde asked that suggestions be put to the Minister.  On behalf of the people of Cork I would ask the Minister to amend the revision and give Cork the extra seat it needs and deserves. I do not mind if it is given in either the north or the south side of the city and I know the Minister will not regret doing this.</P>
      <P>It is my duty and the duty of all Deputies who represent the area to provide the best service for the people.  We have a happy community in Cork city but the Minister has put a knife into the heart of the city. I am sure the Minister is aware of the wonderful community effort in Cork but now he has decided to take away four of the oldest parishes.  It is rather like a bulldozer coming in and taking an integral part of Cork and putting it into a rural constituency. I hope the Minister is keeping an open mind, that he will consider the suggestions made here and that he will be man enough to tell us that, after further consideration, he is prepared to make an amendment. If he does this he will be recognising Cork as a developing city, the second city in Ireland, and he will be providing the necessary services for the area.  I hope the Minister will take note of my request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="347" /> My intention was to be as constructive as possible.  I met with interruptions and in fairness to the people who interrupted me I thought I should enlighten them.  I hope I did not express myself in any disrespectful way to the Minister or to Deputy Desmond, but in all sincerity I would ask the Minister to reconsider the revision of the Cork City constituency.</P>

      <P>Everyone agrees the constituencies had to be changed to take account of the population changes.  The Minister has done a reasonably good job.  It is the first time in the history of this State that any Minister other than a Fianna Fáil one had the task of revising the constituencies.  Anyone listening to my esteemed friend, Deputy Wyse, would think that Fianna Fáil had never used the knife in relation to Cork city and county, but to put the record straight I will bring the House back some years to the time when West Cork was represented by the late Daniel Arthur O'Leary.  He was one of the most decent men ever to sit in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The late Deputy O'Leary, who lived in Ballyvourney, represented Cork West for many years.  But in order to ensure that he would represent it no longer the Fianna Fáil Minister of the day split the village of Ballyvourney so that Mr. O'Leary's house was on the boundary of a new constituency.  This meant that he could not even vote in the constituency he represented.  At least Deputy Wyse remains in his own constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us recall, too, what happened in Youghal.  The late William J. Broderick represented East Cork for many years.  He was chairman of Cork County Council for more than 30 years.  Under Fianna Fáil the town of Youghal was cut off from his constituency and was included with County Waterford in order to ensure that no one from East Cork could vote <Col N="348" /> for the late Deputy Broderick.  What does the House think of that?  I congratulate our Minister in this instance because I do not think there is any Deputy in the House who would not have had to make some changes if he were charged with a revision of the constituencies.  Compared with what happened under Fianna Fáil Ministers the changes proposed here are very small.</P>
    <P>I remember, too, when Spangle Hill was in the East Cork constituency. Perhaps Deputies would like to hear a joke that was told often by the former Deputy Martin Corry in regard to that constituency.  Deputy Corry's colleague called one day at the then Deputy's office and said &ldquo;I wish to do a bit of canvassing.  Give me one of the registers, I have no time to waste&rdquo;.  Mr. Corry handed him a register for the previous election, but of course the constituency had been changed as I have indicated. When they did that to a colleague what would they not do to us?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> I congratulate the Minister for having done a difficult task well without interfering with too many constituencies. He did it only where it had to be done.  The increase in the Cork city population is mostly a rural one.  People in the west of the county and in parts of the north had to lock their doors and go into the city to look for work.  That they had to do so is a terrible charge against the previous Government.  Deputies opposite should not smile.  It is a historical fact and it is a disgrace.  There is only one consolation and that is that they went into their own city rather than to England.  That does not diminish the responsibility of the previous Government who refused to look after the rural population.  We hear a lot about pollution and about the provision of services in cities and towns.  Rural people should have been enabled to live in areas where they were brought up and where their people before them lived.</P>
    <P>I want to look back on the statistics and to compare changes being made in this Bill with changes made in previous similar legislation.  The present Bill provides for 26 three-seat constituencies, the same number as was provided for in the 1969 Act.  The number of four-seat constituencies is to be ten.  In 1969 there were 14 and in 1961, 12.  In 1947 there were nine. That shows that the previous Government, in power for 16 years, made more drastic changes.  The Bill provides for six five-seat constituencies. The 1969 Act provided for two and the 1961 Act provided for nine.  That shows who did the carving.</P>

All Deputies will agree that revisions had to be made and these revisions do not affect many Deputies in the House, unlike the occasion when people like Deputies Broderick and O'Leary were put out of the House because the revisions made by the then Minister ensured they would not be re-elected.</P>

      <P>It is startling to hear rural Deputies speaking jubilantly about this Bill.  In the past the fight in rural Ireland was to protect the image of rural Ireland against the domination of the urban areas.  The central Parliament was in Dublin.  The organisations thinking for rural Ireland had their gaze directed towards Dublin.  I was particularly amazed to hear Deputy O'Sullivan jubilantly congratulate the Minister on this Bill.  I have spent my life trying to develop the type of life we need in rural Ireland. I travelled at an early age to earn my living and came home with some knowledge and expertise to help develop a way of life for the area I represent.  I spent 25 years on the local council.  Under this Bill I find that the tolerance which was introduced to give a reasonable chance for the development of rural Ireland has <Col N="352" /> shifted in favour of the urban areas. The Dublin constituencies are said to have a population of 19,500.  It is much below that.  An average of 1,000 people per constituency have not a vote, but they must still be represented. That means 43 Deputies are proposed for Dublin out of the entire country's representation.</P>
      <P>My constituency was enlarged.  It is the most rambling and extensive constituency in the country.  To travel from Ballydavid in the Dingle Peninsula by the most direct route through Dingle, Tralee, Killarney, Kenmare, down to the tip of Bere Island, is a journey of 120 miles.  If I leave my home town to get to Dublin I have to travel 120 miles before I leave Munster.  This shows the impossible position which obtains in my constituency of South Kerry.  If I visit every area in my constituency just once in the year&mdash;and every hard working Deputy if it is in his power is expected to get into every area of his constituency at least once&mdash;I would travel a total mileage of 46,000 a year.  If I did not come to the Dáil or county council meetings and spent every day of the 365 days, including Christmas Day, travelling, I would have to travel 125 miles every day.  If I did not count the Dáil and council days I would have to travel 190 miles a day.  If I do not count the odd days during Dáil recess when I visit Dublin on constituency business, I would have to travel 250 miles a day. This is an intolerable position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I walked around a four-seat constituency in Dublin in a little over an hour.  If I were to travel around my own constituency by car I could not do it in one day.  I would have expected the Minister to adjust a constituency like mine.  He has the right to fix the constituency in his favour, but I take exception to the fact that the Minister saw fit to give a lower tolerance of representation to Dublin as against the area I represent.  In my constituency there are smallholders, workers and many people who have not worked and who have problems. In Dublin city a large proportion of the people never call on their Deputy for help.  This Bill will give me extra work.  I am already overburdened and <Col N="353" /> this makes it impossible for me to do the job which I am expected to do efficiently.  Cognisance should have been taken of the position of rural Ireland.  Something should have been done to balance this.  The only compensatory factor is that the Minister decided to leave South-Kerry a three-seat constituency.  He must have accepted the fact that at no time in the future would there be a chance of shifting the two Fianna Fáil Deputies.</P>
    <P>It is impossible for one Deputy to cover the whole area.  We are lucky there are two Fianna Fáil Deputies and that we can divide the constituency. We stay to our own side and give a reasonable service.  As I said, a single Deputy is faced with this problem and one would have thought that the Minister, on behalf of his own party, would have considered this and done something about it.  I find it impossible to know everyone in my constituency.  The distance from Killorglin to Bere Island is 60 miles, from Killorglin to Ballydavid, 49 miles, from Killorglin to Caherdaniel, 51 miles, from Killorglin to Ballinskelligs, 48 miles, to Valentia, 46 miles.  These are the distances that I have to travel today.  These areas, with the exception of Bere Island are in my part of the constituency.  The time involved in travelling this vast constituency means that one is unable to attend functions or funerals that one would like to attend.  We must be available to the people whom we serve and it is impossible in view of the size of the constituency always to be available.</P>
    <P>I am worried.  I have never been known to adopt a political attitude in this House.  I have been practical in my approach because I do not believe in wasting time in making petty political points at the expense of others.  I have always spoken out frankly.  While I am a Member of the House, I will continue to do that. Today I am worried about the imbalance being created to the detriment of rural Ireland.  In the past we have tried to develop remote areas.  We have tried to hold the fort there pending success in stopping the <Col N="354" /> tide of emigration and providing full employment for all our people at home.</P>
    <P>Today there is a vast number of elderly people who have to be catered for, people who had not an opportunity of being married.  They are decent, intelligent people who were deprived of an opportunity to have a livelihood in their own land because of the domination that is past history.  These people will be affected by the fact that the number of Deputies in Dublin will be increased.  This trend is against the rural bias which we tried to develop and which is so necessary.</P>
    <P>In the past I have fought for the areas that I represent.  I have had the experience of being in Europe.  I visited areas on the outskirts of the city to study the way of life of the people there and to discover means of helping our rural population.  There is a danger now of a shift of emphasis from rural Ireland to the urban areas. It is not that city Deputies would operate against rural Ireland but because of pressures that would be brought to bear on them they would have to do the things that Dublin city and the urban areas would want them to do.  If Deputies representing urban areas are raiding the kitty, so to speak, there will be much less for the rural areas.</P>
    <P>The rural areas have developed a way of life.  In County Kerry great efforts have been made to preserve the countryside.  There are in Kerry some of the most beautiful spots in the world.  The buildings that were allowed to be erected blend with the natural beauty of the area.  That matter has been dealt with at local level.  Time and again we found ourselves clashing with the central authority, with people who tried to tell us what we should do and to impose their concepts on us.  We have seen horrible structures erected in Dublin.  I have often referred to the building that took place on the quays in Dublin which is completely out of place and does not harmonise with the surrounding area.  The very people who have allowed this to happen in Dublin have tried to tell us what should or should not be done <Col N="355" /> in Kerry.  I maintain that we have done a good job in Kerry.  The rate of refusals of town planning permission by the central authority has been very low.  This indicates that we have been forceful in having our ideas adopted.  It cannot be repeated often enough that if this Bill goes through in its present form rural Ireland will suffer.</P>
    <P>Through the help we hope to get from the EEC it is hoped to develop the west of Ireland.  At one time our people were banished &ldquo;to hell or to Connacht&rdquo;.  Rural Deputies have tried to find ways of keeping our people on the land.  Many people who in their younger days had to emigrate have returned because they like the Irish way of life.  Any change in structure will affect the rural community. I would again ask the Minister to reconsider the position and provide a balance in favour of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>At present I represent 20,000 people in South Kerry.  A Dublin Deputy, under the proposed new arrangement, will represent 19,500 people, quite a number of whom will be aliens and will not have a vote. That will bring the number of voters he represents down possibly to 19,000, the tolerance allowed for a population of 20,000 to 30,000 per Deputy. Reading that one could interpret that 20,000 was the basis for a rural Deputy to represent, whereas 30,000 was not unreasonable in Dublin.  This is where the major damage has been done and whether rural Ireland will have it at some future date enshrined in their thinking that the Government of this day has done a very bad day's work I do not know but history will prove it.  The danger is there, not through any fault of Deputies because they will only be concerned with their immediate area, that the efforts that took so much pain, so much trouble and energy to get the rural side of our life developed to such an extent that it would contribute to the national wealth will be for nothing.</P>
    <P>Rural areas have contributed greatly to the national wealth.  Rural Ireland has contributed much more to <Col N="356" /> Dublin because it will not help Dublin thinking, or the thinking of any city, to see the hillsides of Kerry, Connemara or Mayo barren without people living on them.  Every effort should and must be made to keep our rural way of life, particularly in the west of Ireland.  The only way it can be done is to keep the balance of Deputies in rural Ireland who can utilise the money collected through taxation and through the different systems to benefit our people until we can get them all to work and get the energy that lies dormant there going to produce the way of life to keep the population needed in those hillsides.</P>
    <P>In recent times I have found that the young people in rural Ireland are no longer anxious to emigrate but are remaining on their father's holdings ready to do everything possible to improve their farms.  In Killorglin our population has increased by more than 200 people in the past five to six years.  This has been brought about by reason of the fact that people no longer have to emigrate.  This is what I hope to see happening in every town and village in Kerry, Clare, Galway, Mayo and the other western counties. It is in those counties that our real Irish people are and it is through these areas that we hope to attract our people at present in England.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to have another look at the structure he has now created which can end up, in the way it is now framed, destroying rural Ireland.  I am amazed that the Minister, a rural Deputy, should go along with this.  There is still time to restructure this Bill and destroy the set-up. I am sincere in that appeal because I am versed in the ways of life in the hillsides and lowlands of Kerry. This way of life is really Irish and represents the Irish way of thinking. It is a way of life which is very much appreciated and loved by the tourists. It is also a way of life that we cannot afford to lose if we are to retain our identity as a nation.  The set-up proposed by this Bill will do damage in the future which we might never be able to rectify.</P>

      <P>I have every sympathy, and understanding, for the viewpoint expressed by Deputy O'Connor.  It is a pity that the framers of our Constitution, and those responsible for electoral law in this country, in the decades past when rural Ireland had an even stronger voice did not see fit to put forward that kind of, what one might call, positive discrimination in the electoral sense in favour of rural areas.  However, we are tied by the Constitution of the country and the Constitution, as such, is indeed, most defective in terms of electoral law.  In fact, it is almost naked when it comes to pronouncing on the principles of representation of the national Parliament.</P>
      <P>I have every sympathy for the Minister for Local Government in the drawing up of this Bill.  It is very questionable that this major constitutional responsibility should rest at all on the shoulders of the Minister for Local Government.  It is, in my view, in the long run improper and undesirable in the democratic sense that there should be devolved on Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann&mdash;it is even less proper that it should be devolved on Seanad Éireann&mdash;the responsibility of Deputies deciding their own constituencies.</P>
      <P>The constitutionality of the question has never been determined, largely because it suited the politicians. The democratic instincts of the Constitution have never been fully analysed in that regard.  I go so far as to say that even on the Government side we would be quite stupid and unfair if we were not to admit that the party political pressures on the Minister for Local Government are, in the circumstances of the drawing up of this Bill, quite enormous. Anybody who would ignore the reality of that situation would, in my view, be intellectually dishonest in discussing this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ministers for Local Government who redraw the constituencies are continuously placed in a most invidious position.  In the last Dáil Deputy Kevin Boland spoke about South County Dublin and how the drawing of South County Dublin <Col N="358" /> affected his political future.  On this occasion we have Deputy Tully facing the political problem of representing County Meath which inevitably, being a Leinster area, will be affected by the changes in population.</P>
    <P>The irony of the whole situation is that the impetus for change has never come from Fianna Fáil in the history of this State.  The Government now have the opportunity in the short few years ahead, to set right these constitutional defects.</P>
    <P>I shed no crocodile tears for Fianna Fáil in relation to the 1947 Electoral Amendement Act, which they used ruthlessly to featherbed their own party position.  They did likewise in 1961 and in 1969.  The former Taoiseach, Deputy Lynch, has an enormous capacity in political life for saying nothing about things that might be questionable which he is about to undertake.  No one was more cynical or more ruthless or more abusive of the democratic process in 1969 than the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    <P>The 1969 Act was the product of Fianna Fáil in power.  Admittedly he had his glorious front men, such as the former Deputy Boland and Deputy Blaney who is now an Independent. He had the young carver-uppers like Deputy G. Collins.  These were the men who did the carving up to suit themselves and the then Taoiseach's hand remained officially clean and officially he reaped the benefit of the subsequent general election.  Let us be quite blunt about it.  On the Government side we have a considerable amount of information.  We know that in August, 1972, proposals were made within the Fianna Fáil Party for a revision of the constituencies.  Later in August, 1972, alternative amendments were proposed particularly in relation to the Wicklow area.  In September, 1972, other alternatives were submitted to the Minister, Deputy Molloy.  In September, 1972, there were revised proposals for the West of Ireland and in December, 1972, further variations were submitted on request.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind that major amendments <Col N="359" /> in constituencies were in train within the Fianna Fáil Party from August, 1972, to January, 1973, and right up to the precipitous decision by the then Taoiseach to go to the country, it ill becomes the Fianna Fáil Party to come into this House mewling and puking and, with a great show of political self-righteousness, beating their breasts in favour of a constitutional or electoral legislative constituencies commission. They have a hell of a neck to adopt that totally hyprocritical posture.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I want to say bluntly that personally and strongly I favour a constituencies commission and I have favoured it since I became a member of the Labour Party in 1967. That brings me to a point made by Deputy Wyse.  Understandably Deputy Wyse is horrified at the prospect of losing three parishes out of the south side of the city where I was born.  We were born within a stone's throw of each other on the south side of Cork city.  Let the people of Cork remember that when Deputy Lynch was Taoiseach he deliberately and cynically split Cork city into two three-seat constituencies in order to carry in a hind tit Deputy&mdash;<i>a la</i>&ldquo;Backbencher&rdquo;&mdash; namely, Deputy Seán French on the north side of the city, and in order to ensure that the Fianna Fáil vote on the north side of the city would bring in two Deputies as well.</P>
    <P>There was no other reason whatsoever for the division of Cork city into two three-seat constituencies.  Those who talk about the unique togetherness of the people of Cork in a Cork city constituency should remember that when they see now that at least the imbalance has been partly restored by the Minister by making Cork city a five-seat constituency.  One might say that had the Minister taken a few parishes out of the north side of Cork city constituency we would have had Deputy Lynch here this morning protesting violently, but the temptation to do so was resisted.  I am quite sure. The Fianna Fáil Party deserve very little sympathy on this Bill.</P>
    <P>I favour the setting up of a constituencies commission for a number of reasons.  First of all, the Minister should <Col N="360" /> not be placed in an invidious constitutional position.  Secondly, I do not believe that Members of the Oireachtas should have such extensive powers in relation to Dáil constituencies.  I do not believe we have a democratic right to have such extensive powers as we now have.  I hope that, as a mark of the different approach on this side of the House from that of Fianna Fáil &mdash;and we certainly intend to adopt a different approach from that of Fianna Fáil in relation to political administration&mdash;we on this side of the House will bring in either a constitutional amendment or a legislative amendment with which I will deal later.</P>
    <P>We should examine the efforts of the Fianna Fáil Party to consider the question of a constituencies commission. Their record in that regard is absolutely disgraceful.  As we know, a report of the informal committee on the Constitution was published in 1967.  It is interesting to note that Deputy Molloy was a member of that committee and signed the report. Ironically, the present Minister, who was also a member of the committee, signed the report too.  At page 21 of the report they dealt with the question of a constituencies commission. It is interesting to consider the views expressed then by Deputy Molloy and the then Deputy Tully.  At page 21, paragraph 57 it is stated that:</P>
    <P>...the committee were unanimous that, in the event of any Constitutional change, a Commission should be established to determine the delimitation of the constituencies.  Commissions of this kind are a regular feature of the electoral law of other countries. The final say on the question whether or not the findings of such a Commission should be accepted ought, however, properly rest with the Oireachtas.  Furthermore, it would be reasonable to require that the Commission in putting forward its findings should be obliged to give the reasons for its decision in each case.  We have deliberately refrained from expressing views as to the composition of the Commission as this would be a matter which would be determined by legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> In 1967 both Deputy Molloy and Deputy James Tully were members of the committee and both were in favour of the concept of a Dáil constituency commission.  Unfortunately, we have to place on record the fact that from 1967 to 1973 no effort whatsoever was made by the Fianna Fáil Party in Government to introduce any constitutional amendment and they had more than ample opportunity to do so in that long period. I think it ill becomes the Leader of the Opposition now, after defeat, to trot out this suggestion almost six years after the committee on the Constitution made the proposition.  For six solid years Fianna Fáil never worried about the idea of such a committee until they suddenly saw themselves in Opposition with, as Deputy Jack Lynch said, and he used the phrase on several occasions, and it is indicative of his political attitude, this Government with, in his nostalgic but expressive phrase, their fingers on the loot.  I heard him use that phrase two or three times over the past three or four months.  It seems to me that there is a certain nostalgia in it.  I presume Fianna Fáil expect this side of the House to behave in the way they did when they occupied these seats.  For six years Deputy Lynch suffered in silence.  This report was available and he could have taken action on it.  He could have implemented the unanimous recommendation of the committee.  For six years he sat silently, keeping his fingers, to use his own phrase, on the constituencies loot.  This is not a very pleasing phrase to use in a democratic country.</P>
    <P>The question arises as to what kind of commission we should have in relation to constituencies.  I do not see much purpose in having a constituency commission decided on by legislation. I favour a constitutional change for a number of reasons. There are two alternatives.  We can have a constituency commission by passing an Act or we can have a commission established by constitutional amendment.  I favour an amendment of the Constitution. Indeed, I believe we should have a <Col N="362" /> new Constitution because the existing Constitution needs so many amendments. We should have a constituencies commission with democratic independence on behalf of the people and with adequate terms of reference so that allegations of gerrymandering could not arise.</P>
    <P>There are difficulties in relation to both alternatives.  Setting up a constituencies commission by Act of Parliament would inevitably face such a commission with impossible constitutional requirements.  Here Article 16 arises immediately.  &ldquo;No law&rdquo;, it says, &ldquo;shall be enacted whereby the number of Members to be returned for any constituency shall be less than three.&rdquo;  It does not require any great imagination to appreciate the insurmountable problem a commission would have in trying to decide in favour of three seat, four seat, five seat, six seat or seven seat constituencies. If they favoured a multiplicity of three seat constituencies the politicians might opt for five seats in certain parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The Constitution is quite inadequate in regard to the size of constituencies. It merely lays it down that there cannot be a lower number than three. There is no norm and no maximum and the constitutional deficiency would eventually emasculate the position.  That would be the position. I think we would be as well off if our Constitution made provision for a specific number of Deputies in each constituency.  I do not favour three seat constituencies because of the diminution of the principle of proportional representation since PR for all practical purposes does not exercise any great influence in a three seat constituency.  First preference votes and the strength of the relative candidate carry greater emphasis in a three seat constituency.  There is need for the people to make up their minds what they want.  If they do that, then it should be possible to delineate constituencies more effectively.  The only thing on which people have made up their minds so far is that they do not want the abolition of proportional representation.  We know that since 1968.  The people quite clearly <Col N="363" /> did not want to be represented by one Deputy in a single seat constituency. If we are serious about setting up a commission, we should consider the amendment of the Constitution in that framework.</P>
    <P>I submit that in making provision for a constituencies commission it should be given considerable constitutional independence.  I envisage such a commission having virtually the status of the Supreme Court.  I do not think the Minister, his Parliamentary Secretary or any other Deputy has the right to draw an imaginary line up and down a road or across a county boundary.  We have not the right to decide whom we will represent.  A great deal of nonsense has been talked about county boundaries in relation to this Bill.  There is no constitutional requirements whatever that constituencies should approximate to county boundaries.  There is an appalling confusion in the minds of many Deputies between Dáil constituencies and county electoral areas of local authorities. This confusion has arisen largely because many Deputies are members of local authorities and they want a political convenience rather than a democratic Dáil convenience. They like the convenience of being members of a county council and simultaneously representing their area in Dáil Éireann.  I do not see any logic in that although I appreciate the political desire to have this dual role. The Minister has done his utmost to keep as close as possible to county boundaries&mdash;his personal disposition inclines him towards this course and it should be respected&mdash;but I do not think that argument should be used too extensively.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out to Deputy O'Connor that the special pleading on behalf of rural Ireland does not exist in the Constitution.  In the PR referendum in 1968 there was a great national hoo-ha about having one's own Deputy for the county electoral areas, where the single seat Deputy would represent five or six parishes in rural Ireland, all of them having a cosy, happy, democratic dialogue between themselves.  The people rejected that proposal; they said the proper <Col N="364" /> criteria were population, multi-seat constituencies and PR.  I do not think any government in their sane senses in the next decades would try to have another referendum on this matter. We have had two already and the people have made known their wishes. I do not think we will get in a constitutional amendment any special, positive discrimination in favour of rural areas as has been pleaded here. I am aware that in many countries, including some western European countries, there is an imbalance, and in the British constituency system there is a special balance in favour of rural areas, but I do not think there should be any special balance here.</P>
    <P>On a personal basis, I would point out, that an all-party committee on Irish relations has been established by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  One of the functions of the committee is to examine the Constitution.  I am a member of the committee and I hope the question of a Dáil constituencies commission will be the subject of serious examination in the years ahead. This would be a desirable and effective measure.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on the contrast that exists now between the North of Ireland and the Republic in relation to the size of constituencies. Fianna Fáil can hardly claim they have been especially sensitive to the feelings of Northern Ireland in relation to this matter.  In 1947 we had nine five-seaters, in 1961 we had five also but in 1969 Fianna Fáil, for their own narrow, party political advantage, deliberately reduced that number to two five-seat constituencies. Fianna Fáil also decided to reduce as far as possible the number of four-seaters.</P>
    <P>There is a very considerable discrepancy between the constituency electoral provisions in Northern Ireland and those in the Republic.  We have in the Dáil at the moment 26 three-seaters, ten four-seaters and six five-seaters, a total of 148 seats.  It is interesting to note that in the Northern Ireland Assembly the North Antrim constituency is a seven-seater; Antrim South is an eight-seater; Armagh a seven-seater; Belfast East, North, West and South are six-seaters, <Col N="365" /> making a total of 24 seats; North Down is a seven-seater; South Down a seven-seater; Fermanagh and South Tyrone is a five-seat constituency&mdash; the only five-seater; Derry is a seven-seater and the Mid-Ulster constituency has six seats.  It can be argued that the democratic influence of PR on this island is greater in Northern Ireland than in the Republic.</P>
    <P>In the years ahead I hope the Minister will increase the number of members in constituencies.  I am pleased to note that under the 1973 Bill we will have six five-seaters as compared with two in 1969.  I would urge the Government in any future examination of any constitutional provisions to take into account what has happened in Northern Ireland in regard to PR.  It would be remiss of me not to welcome the fact that in the next Dáil there will be four additional Deputies, making a total of 148.  This increase in democratic representation is welcome as it has occurred because of increased population.</P>
    <P>Dáil constituency changes have an amazing effect on the fortunes of political parties.  I do not think it has fully dawned on the political commentators in the Republic, neither has it dawned on the organisers of the political parties, the PR razor's edge result we had in the last general election.  It gave us good and stable government.  It is to the credit of that system that despite the fractional change which occurred we succeeded in getting a good Cabinet and a good change in government in general.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that in the last general election Fianna Fáil lost seven seats to Fine Gael by margins of less than 1,000 votes.  In Longford-Westmeath the margin was only 104 votes so that a slight change in that constituency has profound implications. In Laois-Offaly Fianna Fáil lost a seat to Fine Gael by a mere 234 votes.  In North Kerry the difference between Fianna Fáil and the other parties was 514 votes, in Sligo-Leitrim the figure was 559 votes, in West Mayo, 650 votes, in Roscommon-Leitrim, 935 votes and in South West Cork the difference was 935 votes, also.  Fianna <Col N="366" /> Fáil lost to the Labour Party in other constituencies by historically small margins, for instance, in North Tipperary the difference was only 143 votes. In Kildare we were ahead by 561 votes, by 838 votes in Meath and by 867 votes in Carlow-Kilkenny</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil fared out badly by comparison with the last general election. In many constituencies there were fewer than 1,000 between them and the other parties.  This was a unique feature of the election as compared with previous ones.  Therefore, the PR system which was operated tightly by the Coalition parties in the last election did not help Fianna Fáil.  The changes in the constituencies will have a profound effect on the fortunes of political parties as a whole.  There was not very much change in the last general election as compared with 1969 when Fianna Fáil were returned comfortably. We know that as between 1969 and 1973 Fianna Fáil increased their share of the national vote by a half per cent while Fine Gael increased their share of the vote by one per cent. This was substantial in terms of a swing under PR.  The Labour Party dropped their share of the vote by 3.3 per cent.  I submit that the changes proposed here will have a considerable effect on the result of the next general election but the way in which the PR slot machine will fall will depend largely on the candidates and on the political climate at the time.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me if I did not take this opportunity of thanking the Minister publicly for leaving my constituency of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown as a four-seater.  As we anticipated, we are shedding about 10,000 votes but this is necessary because we had exceeded the tolerance level for a four-seater constituency.  Nobody would envy the Minister the very difficult task that faced him in regard to all the changes that were necessary.  The work involved must have absorbed a great deal of his time and the result is bound to bring a great deal of personal odium on him from Opposition Deputies who may be of the opinion that they have been treated badly.  Changes had to be made regardless of which Minister might have been in power.  The Minister did not have available to him <Col N="367" /> the benefit of any constituency commission's report and he had to work within the existing legislative powers. Bearing these facts in mind, I am convinced that he has done a good job, that he approached the matter in a much more satisfactory way than we could have expected Deputy Molloy to have done. To give an example of Deputy Molloy's thinking in this regard he had thought of transferring population from North-East Donegal to Donegal-Leitrim and of transferring population, perhaps, from Sligo-Leitrim, plus the addition from Donegal-Leitrim to Roscommon-Leitrim and to Longford-Westmeath.  He was thinking in terms of West Galway receiving population from Clare-South Galway.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of machination that the former Minister had in mind in relation to his own part of the country.  Quite bluntly, I think the country is lucky to have Deputy Tully doing the revision of constituencies on this occasion rather than Fianna Fáil because we would have a completely emasculated West of Ireland structure of constituencies which would be a disgrace to any democracy.  Instead, we now have a much more logical set-up in the West of Ireland, and the east coast of the country is much better represented.  I commend the Minister on this and I would urge him in the future strongly to consider the setting up of a constituencies commission. I have no doubt that in the years ahead the Government will give serious consideration to the idea because I do not think we could ever expect it from Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Whatever hope we have of a constituencies commission it would be from the Coalition Government.  It is hopeless to expect it to come from Fianna Fáil and certainly it will never come from the present leader of that party because Deputy Lynch had from December, 1967, when he got the report, until January or February, 1973, to do something about it.  He did not do anything about it and the shedding of crocodile tears by him now does not wash politically on this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I have listened to the contributions made by the various speakers.  I was impressed very much by the case put forward by Deputy Wyse.  I also listened attentively to the contribution of Deputy Desmond and I find it hard to reconcile in my own mind his support for a five-seat constituency in Cork and a four-seat constituency in his and the Taoiseach's area&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmons</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I find it difficult to reconcile the justification for Deputy Desmond's support of a five-seat constituency in Cork and a four-seat constituency in the area represented by him and the Taoiseach against the general pattern of constituencies which we find in the Bill. I oppose the Bill mainly because of the illogical nature of this carve-up, particularly in relation to Dublin city constituencies.  This puerile effort on the part of the Coalition in the city and suburbs, except in the Taoiseach's own constituency, will be seen by the public for what it is&mdash;a desperate attempt at manipulation.  There is a world of difference between keeping the constitutional balance in rural areas and in densely populated cities.</P>
      <P>In Dublin North-East there will be endless confusion as to who belongs to which constituency.  Even though it is many years since the last revision, many people still come to me from former areas seeking my services.  I have no objection to this, but in this latest carveup, the confusion as to who represents whom will become much more difficult, especially for old people in North-East Dublin.  It must be said of the Minister that he has done very well in his arithmetic.  He has kept the deviation from the national average between a plus 996 and a minus 974, but it took a great deal of boundary butchering to suit the ambitions of Fine Gael and Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In taking his partisan knife to the job, the Minister has been irresponsible. In my area at least, he has taken no cognisance of closely-knit community aspects of the other constituencies <Col N="369" /> or of constituency welfare. With this suburb now slashed into three constituencies a person will have to call on nine Deputies. Coolock is split down the middle as are various other communities throughout the city.  The Minister went into an astonishing jig-saw spinoff in the northern extremity of North-East Dublin.  He has taken a line from Whitehall-Santry in the crookedest way possible to Coolock and conveniently he has left a large part of the city to be looked after by County Dublin candidates.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the views put forward here by Government Deputies and some newspaper commentators, I have no doubt that Fianna Fáil candidates will contest the new areas with the same relish they did before. The changes will merely inject a new confidence into the standard bearers of the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the context of the Government's record, particularly in the last few weeks, the public in reading the discussion here will wonder what relevance it has to the grave issues outside.  Before I came in here today I had a telephone call from an old persons' home which had been cut off from electricity and I was asked, as a Fianna Fáil Deputy, if I could do anything about it.  I merely mention that in relation to the attempt to provide three-seat constituencies&mdash;perhaps in the hope that the Coalition candidates will succeed in the next election.  I doubt it very much and when it comes to an election, whether very soon or next year, the general public will judge the failures of the present Government in relation to matters of such urgent public importance as protecting the livelihood of the citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;gerrymander&rdquo; was used a lot in these discussions.  It was used against Mr. Boland and against the present Minister.  It stands to reason there is dissatisfaction not only in the Opposition but among Government backbenchers.  I do not believe the word &ldquo;gerrymander&rdquo; has been <Col N="370" /> used here as it was in Northern Ireland, with justification, when the civil rights campaign got under way. It means the carving up of communities and counties which the Minister has given us in this Bill.  I am quite confident that my party can overcome these obstacles in the future.  However, I go along with the view that there is need for a complete examination of our electoral process. There has been much play with the democratic base of our system here and the people on the other side favoured the proportional representation system.  We should not be content with the present system.  We should examine its imperfections and start with constituency boundary revisions as one of the big flaws. However, where closely-knit communities exist in rural or urban areas, no attempt should be made to interfere with them to meet the question of representation in this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kyne</NameTxt>
      <P>Any Minister for Local Government engaged in the revision of constituencies has a most unenviable job.  Not only do the Opposition accuse him of gerrymandering <Col N="371" /> the constituencies to suit his own party, but Members of his own party will accuse him of doing things against their personal interests in the constituencies. It is impossible to satisfy everybody.  A Minister can only do his best on the advice of his advisers. He is as human as anybody else, and he has an eye to it that his own party's candidates are put in a favourable position.  I would advise the Minister to oppose any amendments to this Bill.  If he makes an alteration to one constituency it will spread all over the country.  The only alteration he might consider would be an amalgamation of two three-seat constituencies into a six-seat constituency. I do not know of any particular case which might justify that at the present time.</P>
      <P>I have been a Member of the Dáil since 1938.  In 1961 I had to endure the harsh decision of the Fianna Fáil Minister who dismembered County Waterford in the interests of attempting to hold the three seats in County Tipperary.  Due to by-elections which had occurred between the last general election and the time of the constituency revision.  Fianna Fáil had gained an extra seat in South Tipperary. That was then a four-seat constituency. On population figures and voting strength it was obvious that South Tipperary should be reduced to a three-seat constituency, but that did not suit the Fianna Fáil Minister.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand how Fianna Fáil Deputies can complain about the harsh treatment meted out to them under this Bill.  In 1961 practically one-third of Waterford was transferred to South Tipperary in an effort to secure the election of the late Deputy Loughman.  Unfortunately for Fianna Fáil, it did not work out.  Not only was Deputy Loughman defeated, but Deputy Treacy was elected for the first time as a Labour Deputy.  In my constituency it was on the cards that Fianna Fáil would win two of the three seats and I would lose my seat as a Labour Deputy.  However, the rape of Waterford caused such resentment that, for the first time, I headed the poll.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="372" /> I am completely against the revision of any constituency that will include part of another county.  If it is at all possible the city and county should make one constituency unit.  Labour Deputies in South Tipperary found it almost impossible to service their constituents in West Waterford.  This was because their only connection with our county was that they were elected as Deputies for it.  They were not members of the county or urban councils, the vocational committee, old age pension committees or any other committees which operated in the county of Waterford.  Their representations were made through councillors representing their party or by letters written directly to officials.  The city and county boundaries of Waterford will now form one constituency, and for this I thank the Minister.  He is redressing a wrong done to Waterford in 1961.</P>
    <P>At the time of the transfer of County Waterford north west of the Finisk River into the South Tipperary constituency some 7,000 voters were sent to South Tipperary.  They would have justified a four-seat constituency in Waterford had they been left.  Because it did not suit Fianna Fáil tactics, because they were afraid they would lose the seat in South Tipperary, they transferred those voters without thought or care for the people of the Waterford constituency.</P>
    <P>All Deputies so far as possible should have influence with their local authorities, county and urban councils and various other bodies.  There may be merit in the amalgamation of two adjoining counties which by themselves would not allow for their representation because of the small population.  This happened in the Carlow-Kilkenny area and it works reasonably satisfactorily.  When dealing with Waterford the Minister in my opinion, has done a very good job and I want to extend my appreciation to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Mr. Murphy, <Col N="373" /> said last night that Deputy Callanan had the decency to give credit where credit was due.  That certainly is the case but as a western Deputy I have openly and severely to criticise the manner in which the western seaboard is being deprived of two seats which deprivation, according to the figures, is not warranted.  The area that I come from is where the terrible butchering is taking place.</P>
      <P>I shall not talk about what did or did not happen in the past but I have read a good deal about Ministers of the present Government complaining bitterly about people who were deprived of constituencies in the past. The Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote an article which appeared in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> in September last about the gerrymandering that went on as something which should never happen again.  Nobody will convince me that what is happening around my area in Galway is not a deliberate attempt to take two seats from Fianna Fáil.  Down through the years, even when Galway was a single constituency, it was traditionally Fianna Fáil.  Fianna Fáil held six out of the nine seats.  That was the position when I was a boy.  It was changed again.  In any change that was made by Fianna Fáil there was never a deliberate attempt to take a seat from the Opposition.  There was always a Fine Gael seat in West Galway, in East Galway and in Clare-South Galway.</P>
      <P>As far as I am concerned I am a new representative.  I shall not live forever.  I do not give a fiddle-de-dee whether I am re-elected or not.  This is a deliberate attempt, based on the figures of the last election to take a seat from Fianna Fáil.  This may boomerang on the Government.  I do not know whether it will or not.  In regard to the West Galway seat they may be playing with fire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan said that Deputy Loughnane was the only Deputy who was in any way secure but this revision leaves Deputy Loughnane, who is with me in the Clare-South Galway constituency with Deputy Mrs. Hogan O'Higgins, with his huge vote of nearly 7,000 being split in three.  The Deputy can decide for <Col N="374" /> himself where he will throw in his lot but wherever that may be he will have a fight for survival unless there is an enormous swing.  The only secure man in Fianna Fáil, according to Deputy Coughlan, is being jeopardised by the revision.</P>
    <P>In the East Galway constituency, if Deputy Loughnane goes out of it and goes back into Clare, you will still have three sitting Fianna Fáil TD's, Deputy Kitt, Deputy Hussey and myself.  One of us will have to walk the plank unless there is a big swing. In this case there is a deliberate attempt to take two seats from Fianna Fáil in this area.</P>
    <P>Take the map of the West Galway constituency and the way it is drawn. Headford is on the Corrib.  In order to suit certain Deputies, Headford is being taken into East Galway.  Then the line is drawn to take in Craughwell village and put it into West Galway at Ardrahan, which is very much east of Headford.  The line takes another twist and takes in Goffstown and puts it into East Galway.  Lisdoonvarna, Ennistymon and Corrofin and all that part of Clare are put into West Galway.</P>
    <P>The last speaker said, quite rightly, that this is a question of counties.  If you take the area of West Galway now, it goes from Westport to Clare.  It would take a Deputy three days to cover his constituency.  I do not know how the proposal for West Galway could be justified.  It is proposed to make it a four-seat constituency.  West Galway was always a three-seat constituency. In Galway city there is a university, one of the biggest hospitals in Ireland, a big military barracks.  It would be difficult for a voter in the western or Clare part of the constituency to elect a city man.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider the matter.  He should consider what Deputy Loughnane said, that Clare would justify having four seats and West Galway three seats.</P>
    <P>I have read the book written by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, in which he commented on the revision of constituencies.  I thought that in this Bill we would get something <Col N="375" /> completely different.  I am not saying that everything was done perfectly in the past.  I am not saying that things were not done for certain advantage but the people in the media seem to know that this Bill is designed to take about six seats from Fianna Fáil. Everybody seems to think so.  I cannot speak for any area outside my own but I can definitely say that it is designed to take two seats from Fianna Fáil in that area.  I would ask the Minister to take note of the danger that Deputy Loughnane warned about.  I would not be sure that the arrangement in West Galway would not react against the Government because Galway has been traditionally Fianna Fáil.  The people have not changed.  They have been well served.  They know that they got a fair crack of the whip from the Fianna Fáil Government.  We are losing two seats that we should not lose on the western seaboard.  I would tell the Minister that although the figures at the moment may indicate otherwise, the seat in East Galway that it is supposed will be taken from us, is not all that secure to the Government.  There are three good fighters left in East Galway.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>An earnest of this Government's intentions regarding the elimination of poverty is to be found in the unprecedented increases from July of this year in all rates of social insurance and assistance payments including substantial increases in the rates of children's allowances and extension of that scheme to provide for payment in respect of children between the ages of 16 and 18 years who are continuing in full-time education or are apprenticed or disabled.  In addition the pension age was reduced to 69 and a scheme of payments introduced for unmarried mothers.</P>

      <P>As I explained in reply to the Deputy's question of 3rd May last in this matter, the practical recycling of waste is as yet at an early stage of investigation and development. To a large extent it is tied up with technical developments in industry and agriculture.  My Department are concerned with the waste collection and disposal system operated by local authorities and with the impact of waste on the environment, especially in regard to water and air pollution.  Practice in these areas is at present being reviewed and contact will be maintained with developments of interest in recycling.  For example, the draft environment programme proposed for adoption in the EEC provides for examination of various aspects of the waste problem and we will have the opportunity of taking part in that work and benefiting from the result.</P>

      <P>The forms in use for estate duty purposes were redesigned and modernised some years ago and the number of forms of inland revenue affidavit was reduced from four to three by the amalgamation of two forms one of which provided for non-settled property only and the other of which provided for settled and non-settled property.  The form A-1 was introduced in respect of estates of under £3,500 in value, since raised to £7,500, to expedite the extraction of grants in cases in which no estate duty liability arises.  This form is now used in approximately half the total number of applications for grants and is dealt with on the day of receipt. The position is kept under constant review to see what further streamlining of procedures can be achieved for the mutual benefit of the public and the estate duty office.</P>

      <P>The budget estimate for income tax for the current year is £207.1 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statistics available do not show separately the cost of collection of income tax, since income tax, surtax and corporation profits tax are administered <Col N="397" /> as part of the one scheme of taxation.

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the Government's intention to increase the annual level of official assistance to developing countries over a period of years by way of a comprehensive and balanced programme.

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anybody has suggested that Ireland is making a reduction in its contribution because Ireland's contribution has been on the increase.  However, many countries, with much greater resources than ours, have not been increasing their contribution at the same rate as we have.  It is worth bearing in mind that the United Nations having urged that people should strive to achieve the target figure of 1 per cent also said that regard would be had for the special position of countries which are not net importers of capital.  Ireland falls into this position.  I am not saying this is a reason why we should not strive; I am saying we are striving, and this year we have doubled the contribution and we hope to continue to increase it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy entirely.  I would say that if we were able to prove what the private contribution was we would find that Ireland was among the leaders in contributions made.  However, it is difficult to identify the sums if they do not pass through the normal channels. We are endeavouring to make reliable assessments as to what Ireland's contribution is both private and public.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to contribute a few words on this Estimate.  I was not in the House when the Minister introduced his Estimate but I have read his opening statement.  I congratulate the Minister.  He is doing a good job.  He came up in the same school as I did with Macra na Feirme and so on.  His is a difficult task.</P>
      <P>Coming from the west of Ireland, I had certain reservations about our entry into the EEC but I supported our entry as strongly as possible.  I was in Paris about 12 years ago at an international conference of agricultural producers and I knew what we were up against; I knew the competition we would have to face.  I knew the small man would have a hard fight for survival. I also knew there was no alternative. I knew we would have to drive a hard bargain to get the best we could, particularly for agriculture.  The principal base for us was the common agricultural policy and I am glad to note from the Minister's speech that he is trying to get that applied to sheep as well as to land.  This is of vital importance.  More important still from the point of view of the west is the question as to what we are going to get out of the fund and what directives there will be in relation to making farms in the west viable.</P>
      <P>What is the attitude of the EEC towards directing funds for the purpose of land drainage?  The first thing we have to do is to drain the land.  It is no good ploughing money in unless you first drain.  I was astonished to learn that drainage is not a priority in the EEC.  I was rather disappointed about this because we sold the EEC to the people in the west on the ground that we would be able to get plenty out of the fund to do land settlement and to drain land.  We have several major rivers; we have the Shannon, the Dunkellin and the Fergus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad the land project is to continue.  It is most important that these schemes should continue. Several LIS are held up because <Col N="411" /> the levels are wrong and so drainage cannot be done; neither can any land project scheme be done, or anything else, until drains are opened. It is of vital importance to make the holdings in the west viable and, to make them viable, something will have to be done about drainage.  If we do not get money for that, then I do not know how a man can be expected to prepare a farm plan.  I am all for farm planning and keeping accounts. But these things are useless unless he is put in a position in which his farm is viable.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us what pressure is being put on the EEC.  Where does drainage stand in the list of priorities?</P>
    <P>People may accuse me of being parochial.  That may be so, but I know a great many people in the west who are looking forward to what will come from the directives designed to make small farms viable.  I may be knocking at an open door where drainage is concerned, but I urge the Minister to press this matter.</P>
    <P>Money will also have to be directed into land settlement because, unless the farmers have the land, we cannot have a viable agricultural industry.</P>
    <P>I have always been very keen on balancing the economy even before we entered the EEC.  I actually wrote an article on it.  I believe not enough is being done about it.  Since I was a boy, and that was not yesterday, I have heard various Ministers plugging different commodities.  I remember when we were to drown Britain with eggs.  I remember other commodities being plugged.  Supply and demand govern world markets and they will continue to do so as long as the market is there.  Not enough effort is being made to balance our economy. We go all out for a particular commodity. At the moment we know beef is good and will be good for some time.  Where the tillage farmer is concerned, it was not economical to till for the last two years.  I heard a great deal about the fierce shortage of potatoes last year.  Two years ago I had to throw them out on the side of the road because I could get nobody to buy them.  No attempt has <Col N="412" /> been made by the Department to balance the economy and ensure an adequate supply of all agricultural commodities.</P>
    <P>Now how can this be done within the context of the EEC?  This is something I tried to point out before we entered the EEC.  Within the context of the EEC it is not possible to subsidise by way of price but there are other ways to subsidise and thus balance the economy.  It would be possible to subsidise the man who engages in tillage to ensure that his income is nearly on par with that of other sections. I congratulate the Minister on having a floor price for potatoes, although I do not think it is high enough.</P>
    <P>I am convinced there is nothing in the Treaty of Rome that prevents subsidisation. I think the Department have made a big mistake in this matter.  I remember when we were told we could not produce enough milk, but now the EEC are paying farmers to get out of milk production.  It is important that we balance our economy and ensure we do not have all our eggs in one basket.  I am glad that the land project and other schemes that are of vital importance to farmers can be continued. Worthwhile results have been achieved by the land project scheme, particularly in my area.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the eradication of disease in cattle, particularly brucellosis and tuberculosis.  These schemes are in operation in County Galway and there has been a considerable number of reactors.  It is wrong that a month should elapse before these animals are bought from the farmers. I do not think we tightened up the TB eradication scheme sufficiently; a considerable number of cattle have reacted and this should not have happened.</P>

I should like to refer to a scheme the Minister mentioned&mdash;it is one for which I can claim a certain amount of credit.  Years ago the son who was not much good at <Col N="413" /> anything else was given the farm to manage.  Rural organisations such as Macra na Feirme&mdash;I should like to pay a tribute to them&mdash;decided this was not right.  They realised it was necessary to study all aspects of farming and a number of enthusiastic people got together to consider the matter.  I came to Dublin and met a very able man in the IAOS.  I asked him a question about fat lambs in the west of Ireland. His answer was: &ldquo;Where would you get fat lambs in the west of Ireland? You use the manager for hayseed down there.&rdquo;  That was the opinion of people regarding the west&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Due to the efforts and enthusiasm of a number of people there have been tremendous changes in rural Ireland.  Years ago it was considered that farmers in the west knew nothing about producing fat lambs.  However, with the help of lectures and other aids the farmers were educated about all aspects of farming.  We received help from voluntary organisations and the advisory services of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and in the last 20 years there have been tremendous strides.</P>
      <P>In the early days we suffered from an inferiority complex but that is gone.  However, I always make an appeal to the farming community not to get a superiority complex.  I regard myself as a rank socialist.  Because of the efforts we made in the matter of education the farmers in the west are doing as good a job as those in other areas.  If the small farmers were given the opportunity they could compare favourably with the best in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early days we thought it would be worthwhile to organise a farm apprenticeship scheme.  I was chairman of that committee and we went on a deputation to the then Taoiseach, the late Mr. Seán Lemass. The Minister for Lands at the time was Mr. Michael Moran.  We were seeking land for congests but were told that there was not sufficient land available for this.  Instead we were offered a scholarship scheme, which we availed of.  This was the farm apprenticeship scheme.  The course comprised two years at an agricultural college and a further two years <Col N="415" /> apprenticeship to a master farmer. It was not an easy course by any means but was a very good one.  I am glad to note now that the Minister proposes an educational course for those who may not find it possible to leave their farms.</P>
    <P>Regarding free trade within the EEC, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the imposition of a tariff on calves exported last summer to Italy.  When I raised this matter here I was informed by the Minister that this tariff would not have any effect on calf prices, but I can tell the Minister now that he has been proved wrong.  This year was a bad one for the hay crop.  Baled hay, in particular, was very bad.  The farmers in my area are mostly small farmers and they must specialise in either milk or beef. If they are in milk production they maintain the maximum number of cows possible and they sell the calves as dropped calves, whereas if they specialise in beef production they sell the calves as weanlings because they would not find it possible to keep both cows and calves during the winter months.</P>
    <P>The position this year is that these farmers must accept a reduction of between £5 and £7.50 per calf on last year's prices.  In some cases there is difficulty in selling calves and this results in the calves eating the silage that should be kept for the cows. Cattle generally are fetching prices as high as £20 more per head than last year, but this is not the position in relation to calves.  We were informed that there was a shortage of cattle, but I fear that the whole idea was to ensure a plentiful supply of cheap cattle in the west for the midland breeders.  I am not in a position to state the extent of the effect on prices which resulted from the tariff I have referred to, but we had been told that the price of calves this year would be as good if not better than last year. We consider the situation to be one of discrimination against the western farmer.  When are we to be put on an equal footing with people from other parts of the country?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="416" /> It is my belief that the Minister has the interest of agriculture at heart but I would like him to bear in mind the points I have made.  It is our duty to concern ourselves with the interests of the small farmer and to ensure that he benefits from our membership of the EEC.  The difficulty in relation to small farmers is that their outgoings are very great.  I consider the EEC to be a club for the bigger man but we must not allow such persons to benefit at the expense of the small farmers.  If the small farmer is to remain in business he must ensure the maximum output from his land.  This requires the maximum application of fertilisers but we all know that the cost of artificial manures has increased by 30 per cent and that all other items have increased in cost also.</P>

      <P>The general cost of living has risen considerably.  It will be seen, therefore, that the lot of the small farmer has not improved very much as a result of our membership of the EEC.</P>
      <P>The question of drainage is very important especially to the people of the west.  I trust that the Minister will spend as much money as possible in this area.  We must subsidise the small farmer in every way possible.  His fight for survival in the future will be a hard one.  Those people involved in sheep production are faring out all right now but we must give every help and encouragement to the tillage farmer so as to ensure that he does not go out of production.</P>
      <P>I noticed recently that the artificially-inflated cost of potatoes was the biggest factor in the price rises in the cost of living index.  The reason for this was that people would not sow potatoes because of the difficulty in selling them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="417" /> I give the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries credit when it is due to him.  I know he has a hard fight.  The Minister before him did his best.  I believe in trying to be constructive.  I put my case to the Minister on behalf of my constituency, on behalf of my area, which is the whole western seaboard. I want to tell him what we want and appeal to him to give it to us.  In order to survice we want a fair share of EEC grants.  We have made our preparations.  We have got cooperatives together.  We have pig fattening stations which are doing a good job, particularly for small farmers.  I appeal to the Minister to see to it that we get our fair share of EEC grants.</P>
    <P>Do not forget that at one stage we were sent to hell or to Connacht.  Do not forget that Pearse said of us that we had in the west everything that was beautiful and Gaelic.  I ask the Government to think of the people of the west.  I will not say anything about the east or the people there&mdash;I have nothing against them&mdash;but as you cross the Shannon you get the real Irish, not that anybody else is not Irish too.  We want a certain amount of money in the west.  We do not want charity&mdash;we are prepared to work&mdash; and I ask the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to see that we get a fair cut of EEC moneys.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I compliment the Minister on the feat he achieved in Brussels in the matter of benefits where dairy cows are concerned in hill farms.  It was a personal feat which was lauded by most of the Press.  His work there will mean substantial benefits to farmers, particularly on small farms where Deputy Callanan and I come from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the matter of land resource development and I should like to make a few comments on it.  Two months ago the Minister visited the Glenamoy Station in County Mayo where a great deal of experimental work has been carried out on peat land.  During the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Lands recently there was a great deal of comment by Deputies, particularly <Col N="418" /> those from the western areas, in regard to the necessity to make much more of our land productive. There has been a great deal of controversy in regard to our commonage system.  Unfortunately there is not a great deal of incentive in lowland commonage to make this land productive and there is a very strong case to be made for the division of commonage in the interests of the farmers there.  With the great advances that have been made in agriculture in the last few years, with the startling improvement in farm incomes and the substantial increase in the value of agricultural land, a position has been reached in the matter of land resources where there is a very large acreage of land developed which until now was not considered viable.  However, because of the increase in land values through development, because of better machinery with which to do drainage work and land reclamation, more land is now available than ever before for productive agricultural use.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister therefore, in examining this resource, to take the steps that are possible, in conjunction with the Minister for Lands, to see that one of the major planks of policy in the Department will be the greater utilisation of this land.  When we are talking about developing resources&mdash;industry, fishing and agriculture&mdash;it is an extraordinary thing that in this country, which is basically rural and agricultural, the under-utilised resource is land.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate in these circumstances that there should be so many problems from the point of view of the land project section of the Department. In the part of the country I come from there is an enormous backlog of applications under the land project.  Until quite recently it was running to one year before applications were even looked at, and the backlog in the carrying out of the work was running very much longer than that.  This is a most unhealthy state of affairs in circumstances where there is the possibility of further increasing farmers' incomes through the development of this land.  The Minister <Col N="419" /> has told us he proposes to speed up the operations of the land project. I strongly urge him to do this, because what is happening now in this regard is detrimental to the agricultural economy of the country.  The Minister also referred in his speech to the continuing decline in labour requirements where agricultural production is concerned.</P>

    <P>The Dáil will be aware that elected representatives in Northern Ireland who have been involved in inter-party talks with the Secretary of State, Mr. Whitelaw, over the past six weeks with a view to the formation of a <Col N="421" /> power sharing administration have reached agreement.  The agreement, reached last night, offers a basis for hope to all of us in these islands who seek a lasting political settlement.  It is historic because it helps to open the way for the establishment in Northern Ireland, for the first time in its history, of an administration representative of, and supported by, each of the communities there; and it is important and necessary first step in the working out of political institutions providing the basis for a settlement that can bring co-operation and peace in this island.</P>
    <P>I sincerely congratulate the representatives of the three parties&mdash;Alliance, SDLP and Unionists.  I should like to extend our congratulations to the Secretary of State, Mr. Whitelaw, whose patience and energy have contributed so much to the success of those talks.</P>
    <P>The occasion is a historic one and presages, I hope, a period in which progress flowing from co-operation and respect for human dignity will show the sterility of violence.</P>
    <P>The talks which I had with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Heath, in Baldonnel last September contributed in some measure to the understandings which have now been reached.</P>
    <P>The proposed Administration and Executive will not be constituted immediately.  But the agreement as to how they could be established has opened the way for further steps towards a settlement.  The next stage&mdash; in which the Government here will be directly involved&mdash;will be the conference to negotiate the detailed arrangements for the Council of Ireland.  The Government is now ready to play its full part in these negotiations which, I expect, will shortly get under way.</P>
    <P>The Government has kept itself fully informed of these important recent developments and has been in continuous consultation with the British Government.  With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I would like to outline to the Dáil the points on which an understanding has now been reached between Mr. Whitelaw <Col N="422" /> and the party leaders who have engaged in consultations with him.  I understand the information on these points will also be conveyed to the House of Commons in London shortly.</P>
    <P>Firstly, it has been agreed that there will be a 15 member administration in Northern Ireland composed of seven members of the Unionist Party, six members of the SDLP and two members of the Alliance Party together gether with a Deputy Chief Whip outside the administration who will be a member of the Alliance Party. Eleven members of the administration &mdash;six Unionists, four SDLP and one Alliance&mdash;will be appointed members of a Northern Ireland Executive.  The Chief Executive will be Mr. Brian Faulkner, leader of the Unionist Party.  The Deputy Chief Executive will be Mr. Gerry Fitt, MP, leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Departments will be allocated on the following basis:</P>

    <P>Secondly, it has been agreed that a Conference will shortly be held between representatives of the British Government, the Government here and the members of the Northern Ireland Executive-designate to discuss the formation of a Council of Ireland. The leaders of the other parties in Northern Ireland who are not prepared to participate in the Executive <Col N="423" /> will have an opportunity to make their views known to the Secretary of State, Mr. Whitelaw, before the Conference. If as we hope agreement on the detailed arrangements for a Council of Ireland is reached at the Conference, the British Government will then take the necessary steps to devolve powers to the Constitutional Executive in Northern Ireland and to the Assembly.  Once this has been done a formal conference will take place between the British Government, the new Executive, and the Government here in order to ratify the matters agreed on at the earlier conference in relation to the Council of Ireland, thus clearing the way for the establishment of the Council.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, as part of their wish to bring about a lasting peace, the British Government, in the agreement reached in Belfast last night now reaffirms that it will bring detention to an end as soon as the security situation permits and as an earnest of this, it is hoped, if the security situation permits, to take the steps necessary for a number of detainees to be released before Christmas.</P>
    <P>As the Dáil will be aware, the Government here over the past few months has discussed and worked out the proposals which it will put forward in regard to the formation of a Council of Ireland and has made its views on some of these matters known to the British Government. The British Government now reaffirm that they favour and will facilitate the formation of a Council of Ireland. Under these proposals with which my Government concurs</P>
    <P>1.  A Council of Ireland would be confined to Northern Ireland and the Republic, subject to certain reservations by the British Government as regards devolved subjects and arrangements to safeguard these interests in the area of finance and other reserved subjects.</P>
    <P>2.  As to structure, the Council would consist not only of representatives of the Government of the Republic and of the Northern Ireland Executive but also, on a <Col N="424" /> separate advisory and consultative level, of representatives from the parties in the Dáil and the Northern Ireland Assembly.  The Council will have its own secretariat.</P>
    <P>3.  The Council would have some executive functions as well as a consultative role.</P>
    <P>4.  The Council at Government level would operate on the basis of unanimity.</P>
    <P>5.  The Council should be able to play a useful role in relation to certain subjects reserved for the time being to the British Government.</P>
    <P>The nature of these subjects and the role to be played by a Council need to be agreed between the Governments concerned and the Northern Ireland Executive.  Among these subjects mentioned for discussion are the concept of a common law enforcement area, the question of extradition processes, human rights, and what role a council might play in the law and order field.  Without going into detail, which would be inappropriate for me at this stage, I would like to emphasise as well the real social and economic advantage for all the inhabitants of this island which would flow from a properly constituted and functioning Council.</P>
    <P>I said in London last summer that those who had been elected in this island should speak to one another and, chastened by the experience of recent years, find a way of living and working together with respect for each others' views and aspirations. A Council could help to achieve this essentially simple purpose.  It is in this spirit that I hope the concept will be discussed at the forthcoming talks.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, all of us who live on this island today, whatever our political or religious outlook or loyalties, live with the heavy and difficult legacy from our common past.  We in our time can add a further burden to that legacy for our children by intolerance and intransigence; or we can begin to work towards an ending of conflict and a beginning of working and living together.  The agreement worked out last night in Belfast is <Col N="425" /> a necessary first step in this process. The majority in this island, in both parts of this island, have already endorsed this process by their votes and they will, I believe, continue to support those who set themselves to work with one another in this sense.  They have already by their votes decisively rejected those who choose instead to impose their own views on others, whatever the cost in killing and death. What we are now about in this island is the working out of a settlement which will provide hope for us and for our children.  I believe that this means agreeing to differ about our long-term aspirations and concentrating instead on working now as best we can towards peace based on justice.</P>
    <P>What we are working for is a political settlement which will have two pillars, an Administration and an Executive, which will have widespread support throughout the communities in Northern Ireland and a Council of Ireland through which North and South can learn to live and work together in growing harmony to common benefit.  The Dáil and the country may rest assured that this Government will do everything in their power to make this settlement work.  In this we ask for the support of all those of goodwill in this island. With the support of the people, under God's providence, we must succeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party welcomes the decision to establish a new power-sharing Executive and an Administration in the North. This is the first we heard of a separate body called the Administration and I understand now that the Administration will be comprised of all those who will be members of the Executive as well as those who will be Ministers, so to speak, without portfolio.  We hope that the establishment of this Executive and the Administration will bring peace to the people of Northern Ireland.  We wish the members of these bodies well in their efforts to work for all the people of Northern Ireland.  We sincerely hope that they will be successful in healing the wounds inflicted and suffered in the past tragic years and <Col N="426" /> in leading the people of Northern Ireland to a better future.  The sufferings of our fellow countrymen in the North over these years have been a major concern to us and our immediate priority is to bring about peace with justice in the North and so to bring to an end violence and suffering.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach mentioned that developments that have now taken place may have been contributed to in some extent by his meeting in September with the British Prime Minister in Baldonnel.  I want to say to the House that all my efforts while I was Taoiseach in all the consultations I had with successive British Prime Ministers and other representatives of the British Government were directed towards this end.</P>
      <P>We feel that the partnership now proposed between the different faiths and the different political traditions offers great hope for the people of Northern Ireland.  We also hope that this partnership within Northern Ireland will be followed by a new partnership North and South based on mutual respect and tolerance which will allow all Irishmen to co-operate in maintaining peace on this island and to work for the economic prosperity of all its people. We know that there are many difficult problems still outstanding and if these are to be satisfactorily resolved there will have to be some yielding on intransigent positions now taken up, for the overall and ultimate good of our country.</P>
      <P>As for the Council of Ireland.  I was glad to hear the Taoiseach mention that this will be extended to elected representatives in all the country.  It was always my belief that it would have to be composed of such elected representatives and as Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, which speaks for almost 50 per cent of political opinion in this part of our country, I may say that we expected this broad representation and we will expect to be adequately represented on the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems from the Taoiseach's statement that there will be two tiers. He referred in particular to a separate advisory and consultative level of <Col N="427" /> representatives from the parties in the Dáil and the Northern Ireland Assembly.  I hope that, as in the case of other outstanding matters between the two communities in the North, hard positions will not have been taken up on this aspect of the Council.  We know from the experience of our own colleagues in the European Parliament the frustration that that Parliament can have because its powers are so very, very limited.  I would hope that, no matter at what level this Council will operate, it will have real functions and those comprising it will have a say in its evolution and its development.</P>
    <P>I am not and have not been, of course, fully informed of all the proposals the Government put to the British Government in relation to the Council.  In an interview earlier today I stated that it would not be helpful to try to postulate, in too much detail at any rate, as to what the composition of the Council of Ireland would be or what its functions might be; but I agree with the Taoiseach that it does offer an opportunity of co-operation and reconciliation throughout the whole island and gives all Irish people an opportunity to work for our mutual benefit.</P>
    <P>I should like to join the Taoiseach in paying tribute to those who have in long and difficult negotiations brought about the agreement to formulate this Executive and Administration and I think it is only fair that I should join with him also in paying tribute to Mr. Whitelaw, whose patience and dedication to his task obviously contributed greatly to the measure of agreement between the elected representatives of the two communities.</P>
    <P>As I have said, Sir, there is a long way to go.  The first task, as I understand it from the Taoiseach's statement, will be a tripartite meeting to discuss the formation of the Council and then further meetings before the Council will in fact be set up.  I would hope that this side of the House will be kept fully informed as to developments <Col N="428" /> and, incidentally, I would like to thank the Taoiseach for informing me immediately he got the news last night, even though it was the only news he got, that agreement had been reached on the formulation of an Executive.</P>
    <P>It will be necessary in order to secure the best possible advantage out of this situation that the goodwill of the Opposition be maintained.  That goodwill can be maintained if we know in what direction these developments are bringing us and if we know in advance rather than having thrust upon us decisions that might be come to as to the formation of the Council of Ireland and that might be come to as between our Government, the British Government and the Executive of the Northern Ireland Assembly I think the Taoiseach will bear in mind that it will be of extreme importance that we can maintain, by reason of co-operation and the information to be given to us, the unified approach that has been established in this House to this problem over the past four or five years.</P>
    <P>Again I want to express the welcome of this party for the development that has now taken place and the wish that those who will be active and will form part of the two new bodies&mdash;I am not sure yet whether they will be two separate bodies&mdash; nevertheless, to refer to them both in one joint term, that the members of this Executive will be able to work in peace and harmony and will have the opportunity of airing whatever differences they have and coming to agreement to the fullest extent that they can in the interests of the communities they represent and in the interest of eliminating violence and suffering from those of our brethren in the North of Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the Taoiseach's statement I had been talking about the land project scheme.  I was urging the Minister to make arrangements to have applications under this scheme expedited.  I had mentioned that there was a backlog in the processing of applications for drainage schemes in the land drainage section which amounted to about 12 months. I realise that the Minister has stated he is arranging for a transfer of staff from certain sections to land projects section to deal with the backlog, particularly in the west.  This must be given the greatest possible attention. It will mean a trebling of the existing staff in the land project offices in western areas.</P>
      <P>There is a certain amount of confusion where the drainage of land is concerned.  There is ambiguity.  Many farmers are not altogether aware of the particular section of the State service to which they should apply for drainage facilities.  Certain drainage works are carried out by the Office of Public Works.  Others are carried out under the local improvement schemes and others under the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries land project scheme.  The source of revenue for the vast proportion of the drainage work on small farms will have to come from the land project scheme. The Office of Public Works are concerned with the larger arterial drainage schemes.  There is a problem about the local improvement scheme because quite a small proportion of funds can be used for drainage from that source due to the necessity to use the bulk of that fund for poorer roads in the country areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The land project scheme will be the source for the completion of drainage. <Col N="431" /> Agriculture is very valuable in our economy.  With increasing yields and better machinery available to make land more productive, it would be a pity if we did not pay attention to the development of land.  We should compare the acreage in this country with that of other countries where every square inch of ground is used.  We have much leeway to make up.  We have this native resource which does not depend on foreign raw materials. If we do not provide funds and staff for the Department concerned with this matter, we will not make the best progress.  The Minister should pay attention to this point.</P>
    <P>Coming now to the common agricultural policy, I compliment the Minister on the work done in Brussels this week in the interests of this country in getting a major concession accepted by the EEC in connection with dairy cows in hill country.  In his speech the Minister referred to his commitment in regard to sheep and lamb.  He stated that as yet there is no EEC scheme in this regard.</P>
    <P>There is concern because of the escalating price of all types of grain. Much of this is entirely outside our control due to the world cereal prices, the situation of the harvest in Russia and the increased prices of certain raw materials in the US.  I should like the Minister to see whether something could be done in this regard. Under the scheme which An Bord Gráin operated there was a subsidy system under which barley and wheat were sent into the western counties. The subsidisation supposedly worked to the benefit of farmers in the western areas.  I have thought for some time that this was not a great concession.  There was already a steep increase in price of green barley.  The barley went through the various stages and was sent in railway wagons to the west.  There were the costs of handling, drying and storing.  Interest charges built up.  When, eventually, it arrived in the west the farmers were not gaining all that much on it.  With the increasing pig and poultry production in some parts of the west, a better method of subsidisation might <Col N="432" /> be considered by the Minister.  Perhaps deliveries of green barley to the west could be arranged.  If barley is green one gets it at the right price. If there were drying stations and storage facilities in the west, the benefits would be greater.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed change in the constitution of county committees of agriculture.  I welcome the proposal to include on the membership of these committees members of vocational farming organisations.  The seconding of representatives of such organisations will be very much in the interests of the agricultural industry. This will bring new views to the deliberations of such committees in addition to the views already expressed by elected representatives and nominees of county councils.  This will give a greater incentive to young farmers to become active in vocational farming organisations.</P>
    <P>We have a problem causing great dissatisfaction in Mayo in so far as the beef cattle incentive schemes are concerned.  The Minister must be aware from the many representations received that there are two inspections under this scheme.  There are no complaints about the first inspection but there are many serious complaints about the timing of the second inspection in areas where the land is poor.  As a Deputy I am aware of continuing representations being made to me over a number of months in regard to this.  The representations are coming from sensible farmers and responsible farming organisations. Something must be done to allow for sensible farming practice.  In most cases the second inspection is taking place far too late to suit the working of the farm.  If a farmer wishes to avail of the bonus he must hold his cattle beyond the time which is suitable, bearing in mind the type of land which he has.  He is beaten either way. If he sells carly, he will lose his bonus. If he holds his cattle to get the bonus. he is engaging in poor agricultural practice.</P>
    <P>This anomaly should be corrected. There seems to be two options.  One is to bring forward the second inspection to an earlier date.  There <Col N="433" /> should be an emphasis on an earlier second inspection in areas of poor land.  The other alternative is to arrange that there is one inspection. The question of one inspection might not be desirable nationally for certain reasons.  But if not, why not look at the possibility of arranging a single inspection in the areas I mentioned? It is a serious and genuine grievance which should be corrected.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister paid compliments to the working of the small farm incentive scheme introduced a few years ago.  This scheme is apparently working very well.  I know it has been of tremendous benefit in Mayo and I am proud, as a Deputy for Mayo, to be able to say that Mayo farmers lead the league of all counties where the joining of the small farm scheme is concerned.  Any encouragement that can be given in this area is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about his basic philosophy and that of the Department. He explained that it was to ensure that the farmer who stays in farming will enjoy working conditions and living standards at least as good as those in non-farming occupations. Of course we all concur with those remarks but they bring to mind one of the great problems we will continue to have in agriculture for the next few years.  It is in regard to the anomaly that, while gross farm income will increase and while family farm income will increase greatly, as it has spectacularly done over the last few years, we will continue to have a most serious problem where people are concerned.</P>
    <P>Like other countries we are living in an era of mass production, an era of mechanisation, an era in which one man can look after as much land and facilities on land as ten might have done 20 years ago.  No doubt this will be a continuing situation if we are to have regard to what has been happening and what is happening in the developed world.  It seems that the policy of the Department will obviously have to be to make the farmer who stays on his land more productive and to provide him with greater incentives and facilities. Without question he should be in a <Col N="434" /> position to compete in every way with people working in non-farming occupations.</P>
    <P>However, the manpower problem we have is this.  Today a very high proportion of our people are working in agriculture.  Therefore, there will be a continuing cry over the years that, while farm income is increasing, there will not be the opportunity to provide employment in the agricultural sector for as many people as we might desire from a human point of view and from the personal consideration of many of our farmers.</P>
    <P>For that reason, like the Minister, I welcome the socio-economic directive of the EEC to which he referred. It seems very sensible that if you are looking to the future and you are looking to individual families with a number of children but where there is possibly room for only one on the land, you must be concerned about the social aspect of agriculture.  This does not apply to agriculture alone, but to the country in general, because it will be necessary to develop areas of employment other than in agriculture. More recently there is, happily, a better spread of industrialisation, which is beginning to offer substantial employment in most of the market towns which are the centres of rural areas.  I welcome very much the fact that this is contained in the socio-economic directive and that it is the intention to arrange that farm advisers will be specially trained to deal with the overall family situation in addition to the essential agricultural aspect of work.  Training in this regard is very necessary in the national interest if we are to arrive at a situation in which there will be full employment fairly evenly spread throughout the country in years to come.</P>
    <P>The 40 per cent increase in family farm income between 1960 and 1972 is remarkable and is justification of our entry into the EEC.  That represents an increase from £112 million in 1960 to £277 million in 1972.  It would seem in this year that we are reporting on a healthy state of affairs in the Department and in the area of agriculture.  Without attempting to <Col N="435" /> strike a political note it is quite in contrast with the position in which Ministers for Agriculture have found themselves in past years.  The Minister is fortunate this year and he recognised it in his speech in that through being a member of the EEC, with the support for agriculture, we are in a very much better situation nationally.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the fact that the Minister was in Glenamoy peatland station in Mayo and examined the work they have carried out there in research where land utilisation is concerned.  I know that he was very impressed by the work which has been done there.  There are vast acreages of land in that part of the country which until recently was not looked on as being of any significant value. It is now becoming a much more valuable resource than had been thought possible.  Farmers in such areas should be on guard and somewhat wary of offers they may be receiving for such land.  I know that recently some people have come from other countries and have made offers for such land which have been 100 per cent greater than such land was sold at three or four years ago.  This does not necessarily mean that is the going price for that land today.  I would advise such farmers, if approached to sell that type of land, to seek the best advice possible before concluding any deals.</P>
    <P>I read with interest the recent studies by farming organisations which went into the greatest detail in regard to the position of farms which are not worked.  Whereas earlier I was speaking about land which was submarginal <Col N="436" /> I am now speaking about perfectly good land of which we still have a very high proportion which is totally underutilised.  I know the previous Government made attempts to deal with this.  In the last week the Minister for Lands announced proposals designed to deal with this problem also.  It is essential, in the interests of the country, that a policy evolves which will be successful and which will give incentives to young farmers, who are married and are raising families, to get the amount of land they require to make a decent living.  At the same time it is also necessary to ensure that elderly people who may own land but are possibly not using it to the extent that it might be used will get terms which will attract them and result in a more productive situation.</P>
    <P>Some years ago the then Minister for Lands, Mr. Ó Moráin, announced a scheme, but it obviously was not successful because merely a fraction of land changed hands under that scheme.  The present Minister for Lands has introduced a scheme in regard to structural reform under which he has announced substantial retirement benefits for farmers over 55, married and unmarried, with an arrangement under which they will be paid a bonus of 10 per cent over the sale price of such land.  In addition to this he is arranging an annuity for such farmers.  I think it is £600 per annum for a married farmer and £400 per annum for a single farmer.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
