      <P>Yesterday I congratulated the new Minister on his appointment to the Department of Defence. It is interesting that for the first time in many years the Minister has a good, active, sporting background and is there to lead his Department and set an example for the youth in the Army. One can only offer the highest praise to members of the armed forces for the wonderful job they have done in <Col N="362" /> the past few years and every support and encouragement should be given to them by Members of the House.  In this way we should attempt to expand our military base.  It would be very helpful if we could encourage more cadets to join.  I think the number has been dropping.  We need the cream of the schools and the Leaving Certificate boys to make up the backbone of the officer corps of the Army and every encouragement should be given them particularly in the field of education and by such schemes as that introduced some time ago whereby cadets go to University College, Galway.</P>
      <P>The Minister's speech was very informative. Some Deputies mentioned that the Naval Service is at its strongest since the Second World War.  Many of us when in Opposition were very keen on having the vessels improved and the quality of life in the Irish Navy improved.  It is no harm to mention one or two anomalies that exist in the case of officers and men down at Haulbowline. For instance, it is quite possible that an officer with watch officer qualifications could be loaned to the Department of Transport and Power to help man the coastal rescue station in Haulbowline.  It can also happen that his work load may be increased to such an extent that he no longer goes back to the mainland but must stay in the Mess.  A peculiar thing about that situation is that maintenance costs are increased, his work load and number of hours on duty are increased but his salary in the end is decreased. Small things like this are very important. The standard in the watch officer class is very high.  The men are all highly qualified.  Whether they are taken from the officer corps or whether they could be seconded from the merchant navy is something into which examination could be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is great need for modernisation of the Army.  Streamlining is very important. Improving morale should be constantly in the forefront.  The number of troops engaged on essential chores within the barracks should be liberated, in the present situation there is a loss of effective military manpower since a certain minimum number of troops are <Col N="363" /> tied up in tasks such as cleaning and provisioning the barracks.  A certain number must always be in barracks and that means less troops available for field activities.</P>
    <P>Attention should also be paid to the Air Corps.  There is a possibility of further expansion here.  It would be no harm to purchase one or two very fast aircraft, though I myself approve of the slower type of craft purchased recently.  The training given to the pilots is very valuable to our civil aviation arm.  There is a steady stream of very highly trained pilots from the Air Corps into Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>The setting up of a construction corps within the Army is a definite possibility. Civilians could very well be employed to help in tasks more germane to civilian life.  There are jobs within barracks which could be performed by civilians.  The whole situation should be examined.  If a man commits a misdemeanour he may be sent to jail for six months and come out after four months; he is not necessarily the better off for this.  My idea would be to compel these people to engage in some healthy work under a rigid discipline.  A civilian construction corps within the discipline of the Army would be a solution.</P>
    <P>There are many jobs being performed by highly trained personnel which are not commensurate with training. I suppose that happens in most institutions. As the standard of education improves this situation will become aggravated.  A civilian construction corps should be considered.  The Army would certainly benefit.  There would be no training in arms or anything like that and they could be paid for the work they do.</P>
    <P>The Minister adverted to recruiting. It is heartening to know that it is reasonably satisfactory.  Improvements have taken place and we all hope further improvements will take place.</P>
    <P>The Army Jumping Team is tremendously popular with the armed forces and everything should be done to enable the team to become really first class.</P>
    <P>The strength of the FCA on paper <Col N="364" /> is not necessarily the effective strength. The FCA and An Slua Muirí might benefit by weekend participation in service along our coastline and elsewhere. As well as benefiting the FCA and An Slua Muirí this service would also benefit society at large. Consideration should be given to this instead of sending the men to camps and cutting them off from society. Their services could be availed of to keep watch on certain premises over the weekend and things like that.  The strength of the FCA rose by 2,000. That is a very good showing.</P>
    <P>There has been a problem from from the point of view of athletics. There was a time when we had an excellent Army boxing team and some very fine runners.  The <i>Asgard</i> is used to train people in sailing.  Last August the <i>Asgard</i> went to Kiel.  Everything should be done to stimulate sport and physical development.  I mentioned earlier the co-operation which the Department of Defence can give in regard to sport for children particularly in urban areas where the Army have large areas of ground which, for security reasons, it is not very simple to give over to schools or to football teams. In Ballymun there are three handball alleys and the students of the Albert College approached me to make representations so that they could use the alleys at lunch time.  Permission was not given.  I thought that was rather hard on them.  The previous Government set up a National Council of Sport.  Some very fine people acted voluntarily on that council.  They recommended to the Department of Defence that some facilities available at military institutions should be made available to school children and to athletic organisations throughout the country as far as this was possible. We have schools who are unable to offer the facilities necessary for playing matches to their sister-schools.  In Ballymun there is a school with 470 children under the age of 12.  It is interesting to drive your son to school where the first lesson of the day is a rugby match at 9.30 a.m.  The public should be made aware of the very fine standard of sport in the Army.</P>
    <P>The siting of the new military barracks is secret at the moment, but <Col N="365" /> looking at it from every possible angle it seems to me that the Curragh or Baldonnell would be the most suitable site.  Mention has been made of Gormanston. I have not much more to say except to congratulate the Minister on what has been done since he took over in the Department of Defence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to take this opportunity of expressing my thanks for the assistance and co-operation which, while I was Minister for Justice, I got from the Army and from the Department of Defence in many difficult situations in which I found myself and in which the country was placed in relation to security matters.  I remember in particular the readiness with which the previous Minister for Defence and the officials of the Department and the Army themselves agreed to provide facilities at very short notice and in circumstances which I knew would create many problems for themselves, particularly after the riots in Mountjoy Prison in May, 1972.  My recollection is that on each occasion that I telephoned the previous Minister for help of this kind such help was always forthcoming literally within an hour. In expressing my thanks in regard to that, I express not just my own appreciation but the appreciation of the whole country that such assistance was given and given so readily.  If there is any individual group within the Army to whom I think the whole country is indebted it is the Military Police Corps who were asked at very short notice and in difficult circumstances to undertake tasks which were alien to them and for which they were not really fully trained, which they could not find very pleasant and did not actually find very pleasant.  The duties which became necessary for them to carry out were carried out by them with great efficiency and very much to the benefit of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not realised that over the past few years the Army and the Department of Defence were able to provide several premises at short notice when my Department were in serious difficulties at particular times.  We were given a military detention barracks at Cork.  We were given premises <Col N="366" /> at Arbour Hill.  Under the Prisons Act, 1972, we were enabled, at about 24 hours notice, to transfer prisoners to the Curragh where the staffing of that prison was carried out by the Army.</P>
    <P>I have read the Minister's speech. It is probably fair to say that this speech is to a great extent a recital of what was done in the past 12 months by the Minister's predecessor. It is a very creditable series of achievements on the part of Deputy Cronin who was Minister for Defence at a time of particular difficulty in this country and who left that post with our Defence Forces several thousand stronger than when he entered it and with our Defence Forces very considerably improved in so far as their equipment and armaments are concerned.  Deputy Cronin left them also in a position where their morale and confidence in themselves and their ability to do the important job which is their duty has also been greatly increased.  I would have hoped that the increase in equipment and armaments would be a continuing policy of the present Government.</P>
    <P>While I find it very confusing to work out precisely what the details of this or any Estimates mean there are two subheads on the Vote for Defence which to my mind make rather disturbing reading.  They are subheads O.2 and P.  While we had Deputy Byrne congratulating the present Minister&mdash;he was specific about that because I asked him which Minister he was congratulating&mdash;on the way he had increased the helicopter wing of the Defence Forces, the Estimate prepared by the Minister and placed before the House shows a drastic drop in the provision regarding helicopters.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Naval Service, under subhead P. the cut there in the current financial year is from £580,000 to £304,000, which is virtually half the amount.  That is regrettable and I expected that the present Government would have continued the policy of strengthening the Defence Forces, in particular the policy of building up their equipment.  I thought we should have spent considerably more on the Naval <Col N="367" /> Service rather than reduce the amount.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes difficult to draw conclusions from the Estimates, but I notice in subhead D, which refers to Reserve Defence Force pay, that the Estimate has been reduced by more than £50,000, from £1,589,000 to £1,045,000, and that the numbers of those in the first line reserve show a considerable drop.  At this time, and in the circumstances in which we still find ourselves, it is unwise, to say the least, to provide for such a drastic reduction in our reserve Defence Forces.  The House will recall that within the past two or three years these men were called up for full-time active service. They gave that service readily and at personal cost and loss.  It seems remarkable that the provision for them in the first Estimate the Minister has placed before the House shows a reduction of one-third in their pay and allowances and a considerable reduction in their numbers.  One would have expected that the situation in the country as a whole demanded that the trend be the other way.</P>
    <P>It is all the more remarkable when one bears in mind that pay in the Army, as elsewhere, is increasing all the time and we can expect the normal kind of increases in Army pay during the coming year.  Allowing for those normal increases, that would seem to indicate that the proposed decrease in our reserve forces is even more drastic than appears at first.</P>
    <P>So far as the permanent Defence Forces are concerned, the increase in the Estimate is not large&mdash;it is £1.8 million&mdash;and the normal pay increases would more than account for that because the percentage that would represent on the outlay in the last financial year would be more than covered by any proposed increase in pay.  I find these tendencies disturbing and it is no harm to draw the attention of the House to them.  If there is some explanation for these apparently substantial cuts in proposed expenditure on our Defence Forces, it should be given to this House by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the Curragh civil prison and to the work that was and is being done there by the military <Col N="368" /> police corps.  I omitted to express my thanks at that time to members of the visiting committee of that prison. The nucleus of a visiting committee tends to consist of men and women who have long experience in this kind of work.  Those who undertook these duties in relation to the Curragh did not have any such experience and they may have had considerable problems and difficulties.  They deserve our gratitude for the manner in which they carried out their duties.</P>
    <P>While the Minister's speech chronicles fairly fully the activities and achievements of his predecessor in the past 12 months, it says little about the future.  In his speech there was no forward thinking expressed.  One would have thought that a new Minister would have given his views on what he regarded as the potential role of our Defence Forces in the next five or ten years, in particular on their role in a European context.  None of us knows precisely what that role will be but it is a matter on which thought should be given and one would have hoped that the Minister would have given his views.  Regrettably we did not get those views; we got very little about the future except the statement that various plans and schemes of the previous Minister would be continued and brought to fruition.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence has been in office for only a short time and normally one could scarcely praise or criticise him for his performance in office in such a short period.  There was one rather famous occasion on which the Minister made statements and apparently made decisions of which we will not hear the end for a long time to come.  I have no wish to get into any conflict with the Chair on this matter, but I must express my concern that a matter of such considerable importance as the events of 28th March last are not debated in this House.</P>
    <P>This is notwithstanding the fact that there is a court case involving one aspect of that matter, or certain people involved in one aspect of that matter, or allegedly involved in one aspect of it.  There are many other aspects about which there is no court case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="369" /> I was most circumspect and careful in the drafting of questions&mdash;a considerable number of them&mdash;which I submitted to the Taoiseach in relation to the matter and which were all disallowed. I had no option, it appears, but to accept that ruling whether or not I consider that the ruling is correct. I do not think it does this Parliament any good that we should be prevented from talking about a matter because it is awkward for the Government.  There is a widespread belief that a very serious error was made&mdash;possibly not by the Minister for Defence; I say that in fairness to him.  On the other hand, he cannot complain if he is blamed for it because no explanation of the events and of the decisions was given.  It may be that the Minister for Defence was not responsible for the very serious error that was made in relation to a particular ship.  It may be that some other member of the Government was responsible for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, with all due respect to you, Sir, what I am discussing is the non-institution of proceedings rather than the institution of proceedings.  I would find it very remarkable indeed, if proceedings were not instituted in relation to certain events and the discussion of that fact could be ruled out in this House, or anywhere else, on the grounds that it was <i>sub judice,</i> because the whole point of my complaint is that the matter is not <i>sub judice.</i> It is a pity that it is not.  If proceedings had been taken against certain people who were not prosecuted and who were allowed to leave this jurisdiction, the matter would then be <i>sub judice.</i> The whole point of my complaint is that proceedings were not taken and that certain people were allowed to leave the jurisdiction very rapidly after their arrest.</P>

      <P>In effect, therefore, what the Chair is saying is that the Minister for Defence should not have made these statements.  I may say that I thoroughly agree with the Chair, as do a very great number of people in this country who were rather appalled at the performance of the Minister for Defence in relation to this matter.  At least, the Minister for Defence is getting the blame in relation to this matter but, as I say, it may well be that somebody else&mdash;possibly a member of the Government, possibly not&mdash;may, in fact, have made these decisions which so annoy people: decisions, I might add, which caused resentment within the Defence Forces.  A number of officers and men have expressed that resentment on the basis that one would imagine that it was not the Army and Naval Service which performed these tasks but that the Minister for Defence had performed them single-handed. The role of the Naval Service and the Army in relation to this matter is deserving of our praise and, indeed, of our total praise.  The credit should lie with them entirely.</P>

      <P>The sort of statements which I am not allowed to quote and which were made by the Minister on the occasion of this press conference would lead one to believe that this country would be ruled in such a way that anybody of a subversive nature or, indeed, any kind of an illegal nature, who showed his nose would have it chopped off, or that he would be kicked up the transom, if I may use another phrase of the Minister's which not all of us understand because we have not the advantage of his nautical background.  It was curious to find the contrast between the statements of the Minister which I will not quote&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The contrast between these unquoted statements by the Minister which the Chair disapproves of and what happened at a place called Kilcrumper, Fermoy, County Cork, only a few weeks later is curious.  The reason I noted particularly what happened at Kilcrumper, Fermoy, County Cork, was that approximately one week before the general election, Deputy Cooney, now Minister for Justice, made a speech for election purposes.  Nearly anything is fair enough for election purposes, I suppose, if you can get enough people to believe it.</P>
      <P>In that speech he was highly critical of me and accused me of having got cold feet prior to the election because a certain gentleman whom I will not name slipped surreptitiously by the side door of a ballroom in Cork into a meeting, and slipped out again equally surreptitiously.  The same gentleman appeared with a very large crowd of people&mdash;several thousands I am told&mdash; on the land of a semi-State body, An Foras Talúntais, at Kilcrumper, Fermoy, County Cork, some weeks after these famous unquoted statements by the Minister for Defence.  A programme was published in relation to that event three days before the event took place, I am informed, and the name of the person who would deliver the speech&mdash;or as I think it is described in these contexts as the oration&mdash;was prominently displayed.</P>

      <P>If the Chair allows me to develop the point, the relevance will become clear at that stage.  It is a very curious matter that three days advance notice was given to the public of this, that all sorts of arrangements could be made, that events were to take place on the land of a semi-State body, presumably under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries and that nothing was done for so long.  As Deputy Dowling rightly pointed out it is very difficult, when dealing with the present Government, to know precisely whose function begins where and ends where, because there seems to be a remarkable degree of overlapping.  We have the Minister for Defence making very strong statements, not just the one of the 29th March about law and order, a law and order Government and the law and order of the country and then we have this sort of thing happening a couple of weeks later.</P>
      <P>I would like to contrast that with the events in Cork, of which I got a report from the police at the time, which was a surreptitious ducking in by a sidedoor from a laneway and ducking out again a very short time later, with the events in Fermoy some weeks ago, about which I speak.  It may not, perhaps, be formally the job of the Minister for Defence to reply to this point.</P>

      <P>We have the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Finance at complete loggerheads about what they should do in relation to takeovers and mergers. The Minister for Finance says there is no need to do anything about it and that the Bill which Fianna Fáil had should be scrapped because it is not a problem at all.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce comes along and says quite the contrary, that the Bill which Fianna Fáil had was not strong enough, that he will have to scrap that and get a stronger one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for that but I am sure the Chair appreciates my difficulty that the functions of the Minister for Justice seem to be carried out as often as not by the Minister for Defence.  I will not say <i>vice versa</i> because in fairness to the Minister for Justice he is not at liberty to carry out the functions of the Minister for Defence.  We have had some unusual performances recently and perhaps the other example which I gave of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce demonstrates this further.  It may be necessary to amend somewhat the precedents and rules of this House to enable the unusual situation which exists under this present Government to be gone into fully because, of course, it is not just as between Ministers; we had an example yesterday of it as between <Col N="376" /> civil servants.  The civil servants of one Department are apparently responsible to a Minister in another Department which seems to me to be a unique situation for which no good explanation has been given.  Now that we are on the Estimate for the Department of Defence I would like to inquire from the Minister if there are any civil servants in his Department who are responsible to any other Minister and, alternatively, whether there are civil servants in any Department other than the Department of Defence who are responsible to him as Minister for Defence.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the traditional structure of responsibility within the Civil Service will undergo a very radical change if this sort of situation continues.  The tradition of the Civil Service is that each official is responsible to his Minister and that the Minister is responsible for the actions of that official even if he personally was not aware of them or did not personally approve of them.  It is again a matter which could have considerable relevance to the rules of discussion in this House as to whether that system will end.  We could have a situation if on the debate for the Taoiseach's Estimate one wished to say something in relation to the work or activities of his Director of Publicity, or at least of the Director of Publicity working in his Department as an Assistant Secretary, the Taoiseach, apparently, could now get up and say that debate on that matter was out of order because this man was responsible to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  If we try to discuss this matter on the Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs we may well be met with the reply that it should be more properly discussed on the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>

      <P>This Estimate gives us an opportunity to pay a tribute to our Defence Forces which is definitely in order at this time.  The operations which our Defence Forces have carried out, either on land or at sea, deserve to be recognised by the Members of this House and it is only right, on behalf of our constituents, that we should pay a very high tribute to the manner in which our Defence Forces have carried out operations not only in the recent past but over a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently people have come to appreciate the need in this State for an army and a navy.  There were times in the past when, unfortunately, they were regarded as a bit of a joke in some quarters but the way in which the Defence Forces have gone about their duties, particularly during the last few difficult years, has dispelled any such inclination in the minds of the general public.  The practical way of showing our appreciation of our Defence Forces is the paying by the Minister of the 14th round of the national pay agreement to members of the Defence Forces with effect from the 1st June <Col N="378" /> last.  This will bring the basic pay of a single recruit to £20.70p in June.  This is a very practical way to show our support for the young men who join our Defence Forces.  These men are put on a pay scale which compares very favourably with the scales available in industry, agriculture, forestry and local government.  That is a very practical way of increasing recruitment to the Army and to the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody will begrudge any young man earning £20.70 in June for the type of work he has to do.  Most of us have seen, unfortunately only on television, the dangerous type of work they are asked to do.  They should be very highly paid.  There is a training area for the Army in my constituency and I have met many of the permanent force there. I know the difficult terrain in which they operate on training.  The training is on a par with that available in any other nation.</P>
    <P>For many years the Army and the Naval Services were starved of proper equipment.  I am glad to note from the Minister's speech that money is being made available to improve the equipment available to the Army.  On the naval side there has been the recent addition of a very modern ship for training purposes.  This is important from the point of view of providing modern equipment for training purposes. I hope that over the years the Minister will build up the Naval Service. As the Minister has stated, the coastline of Ireland is very long and it is important that all available money should be directed to improving the Navy.  This would confer benefit from the point of view that the Naval Service is safeguarding the fishing industry which has expanded at a fantastic rate in the last ten years.  It is a pity that money gained from fishing cannot be ploughed back into the Department of Defence for the purpose of providing additional protection.  For many years our stocks of fish have been poached to a very large extent by foreign trawlers. These trawlers may have increased rights within the EEC but they are still poaching within the limits set down by the EEC.  The only way our fish stocks can be protected is by the extension of <Col N="379" /> the Naval protection service.  The provision of boats of the type recently provided would help to prevent poaching.</P>
    <P>We have, for the first time, a Minister for Defence who understands the need for a Naval Service, who has had practical experience of the sea and who will have a very deep interest in that branch of the Defence Forces.  I hope he will realise the need for the provision of boats like the <i>Asgard</i> for training purposes, on which interest in maritime pursuits can be inculcated and developed.  There is surprisingly little interest taken in this country in maritime pursuits despite the fact that three-fourths of the counties comprising Ireland touch the sea at some point and that no part is more than 100 miles from the sea.  I hope that the Minister will take practical steps to develop an interest in the Naval Service. Training ships should be used to demonstrate to young people that life at sea can be interesting.  I understand that one factor preventing expansion of the Naval Service is the difficulty of recruiting young men.  It might be useful to have more training vessels like the <i>Asgard</i> or even a larger type of vessel that would take a greater complement of men.  Money spent in this way would be well spent.  I do not know if it is a matter for the Minister for Defence or for the Minister for Finance.  It would be in the interest of the Department of Defence to have training vessels with a view to the expansion of the Naval Service.  Young people could be taken on these training ships during holiday periods when too many young people have too little to do.  An interesting week or two at some of the naval establishments at Haulbowline or in Dublin might stimulate a desire for further contact with the sea and, perhaps, a career in the Navy</P>
    <P>I am not sure if it is appropriate to refer on this Estimate to the inadequacy of the off-shore protection service. I have in mind not merely military protection but the protection provided by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution.  I do not know whether or not that comes under the aegis of the Minister.  This is an area where the Minister for Defence and <Col N="380" /> his colleagues might see need for expansion. Recent tragedies around our coast required the Department of Defence to use their boats and equipment on salvage operations.  Some years ago an aeroplane crashed off the Tuskar Rock.  A helicopter that was being used for filming crashed in Wicklow Harbour.  These incidents involved bringing the Naval Service to carry out operations which, strictly speaking, do not come within the responsibility of the Department of Defence.  The boats in question had to be taken from areas in the south-east and north-west where they were most needed for fishery protection in order to carry out this salvage work in Wexford and Wicklow Bay.  Whole stretches of our coast were left unprotected while this operation went on, in one case for several weeks and in the other, I believe, for almost a few months.  This is why more local protection on the lines of the Royal National Lifeboat Service should be provided.  This is particularly necessary on the west coast where there is no boat of the RNLI between Kerry and Mayo.  I understand one is now being provided by the RNLI but I think the Department could themselves look into the problem and perhaps equip a smaller type of boat to assist in that work and supplement the RNLI which does very valuable work and which is staffed by volunteers who deserve the highest praise.</P>
    <P>Returning to the Army for a moment, reference is made in practically every Estimate speech to the type of uniform provided for the Army.  I am glad that the new type uniform is now becoming generally available to Army and FCA.  In debate after debate on this Estimate the point was made that the type of uniform issued to the Defence Forces was of very inferior quality and I am pleased that the new type uniform is now becoming generally available.</P>
    <P>Another issue raised, I think on every Defence Estimate, by Deputy Dowling is accommodation for the Army.  When I was in Kildare during the 1970 by-election I was made acutely aware in the Curragh area of the really sub-standard accommodation provided for the Defence <Col N="381" /> Forces.  At that time efforts were being made to improve the accommodation: more permanent members of the Defence Forces were living outside the barracks in local council schemes. We must welcome the major building programme which as the Minister said, is designed to improve Army accommodation.  I hope the old days are gone when families lived in accommodation with only outdoor toilets and that the old-type barracks in Kildare and other areas will soon be things of the past.  There is pressure for space and this building programme should be pressed forward with all speed by the Minister.  I am sure he has already taken steps in that direction. This is a practical way in which we here can show our appreciation of our Defence Forces&mdash;first, by providing a good income for them and then affording adequate housing.</P>
    <P>With the Spring Show taking place this week it is topical to mention the Army Jumping Team, one of the most famous international jumping teams in the world.  In recent years they have not done so well, not having the type of horses that were available in the past.  Possibly these animals are now much more expensive and the commitments of the Department may mean that they cannot afford the money for the type of animal required for international competitions.  The jumping team were a great advertisement for our armed forces internationally and this is an area in which money could well be spent in equipping our Army with the best animals for this type of jumping.</P>
    <P>Countries such as Italy, Britain and the Argentine are using Irish horses which in itself is a great thing but we do not seem to be able to produce Army horses of the same calibre as those used by other national teams for international events.  If we can get back to the situation of the forties and the fifties, when our team was always at the head of their class in international jumping it would be a practical way, now that we have entered into greater international commitments, of showing that Ireland is a country with great resources of many kinds and one which leads in show jumping and the production of <Col N="382" /> bloodstock.  I hope some extra funds can be provided for the jumping team to equip them with the necessary bloodstock.  We still have men of sufficient ability in the Army to compete internationally but the horses are lacking.</P>
    <P>The civil defence organisation was set up primarily to protect people from hazards arising from war and particularly from nuclear attack.  We hope this will never happen but it is still very necessary to have volunteers comprising our civil defence organisation. Those who give their services in this way have, in the meantime, provided the basis for essential back-up fire fighting services and rescue and first aid teams in every county.  In a difficult county like my own, where there are so many mountains, forests, rivers and a long coastline, the work done by civil defence in backing up the garda, the fire fighting services of the Department of Local Government and the forestry protection services has been particularly valuable.  The hazard of large fires in my constituency was highlighted during the St. Patrick's Day weekend when large fires which took place in plantations would perhaps have extended much beyond the area actually devastated had it not been for the vigilance of the civil defence organisation.  The work done then, and the time spent by civil defence workers at a time when they could have been enjoying themselves like many others, deserves the highest appreciation.  They gave their time willingly to preserve the amenities of Wicklow.  Unfortunately, large areas were devastated by fires but the efforts of the civil defence workers in the area certainly helped to minimise the damage that weekend.  They have also been very active in mountain rescue and other rescue services.  They have made many dramatic rescues from rocks and crags along the Wicklow coastline.  That kind of work is very useful.  It would be an excellent idea to have a trained corps in every county which could be called on in time of emergency.  The main duty would, of course, arise in the time of war.  These people have been trained to deal with fallout, for example, in nuclear war.  That is one <Col N="383" /> part of their training that we all hope they will never be called upon to operate but, trained as they are to the optimum degree, they are an asset to society.  I trust the Minister will meet their needs from the point of view of equipment and so forth.  There is no problem of recruiting.  There is always a steady stream into the civil defence rescue services and those who leave after training are an asset to their local communities.</P>
    <P>I have heard some criticism voiced on the opposite benches of the Minister's activities since he took office.  I certainly do not share the view of the previous speaker that many people are dissatisfied with the Minister's activities. On the contrary, I have found that the interest taken by the Minister in the short time he has been in the Department of Defence has been welcomed by everybody.  Certainly his activity in an affair recently showed his interest in people who rarely get publicity for the work they do.  It was heartening to see him so active over that difficult period.  His keenness and interest have been welcomed by people generally, as has the keenness of his colleagues on the front bench.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister will take note of what I said about the Naval Service. It has been neglected to a greater or lesser degree over the years.  The Minister should try to strengthen that side of our Defence Forces.  Many benefits would accrue from such a policy.  The fishing industry and the boat-building industry would both benefit.  I trust he will see his way to providing boats in which young people can train.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add my voice to those of others who have wished the Minister well.  I am a new Deputy and I am delighted to hear so many people praising the Army.  I was pleased with the Minister's speech because it was a credit to those who preceded him.  He found very little he could criticise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the debate yesterday, the speeches seemed to me to be repetition.  Those who contributed to the debate had really very little to say, even in quite lengthy <Col N="384" /> speeches.  It seemed to me to be an exercise in staying on one's feet as long as possible and saying as little as possible.  That is what I gathered from my first day in Dáil Éireann at any rate.  Business people say what they want to say in as few words as possible. Here one seems to use as many words as possible to say as little as possible.</P>
    <P>The Army is the showpiece of the nation and I am glad everyone realises that.  Some years ago it was not popular to spend money on the Army. People thought it was a waste of money.  They wanted to know what did a small nation like ours want with an army.  As I say, the Army is the showpiece of the nation.</P>
    <P>As far as the Army jumping team are concerned, sometimes they are excellent and sometimes they are not so good.  I am a member of the committee of one of the leading shows in the country and we are always glad when an Army jumping team come to our show.  On a few occasions untrained horses were sent and naturally criticism was voiced of the team.  If the horses are not reasonably good they should not be sent out to shows. Sometimes it is not possible to send a team because of prior commitments.</P>
    <P>Where sport is concerned, the sporting organisation to which I have belonged all my life has always put the Army first.  That is the GAA.  We are always very proud to have the Army participating in our games.</P>
    <P>On the subject of the Old IRA special allowances, the special allowance ceases when the recipient dies. If the allowance is given to the recipient because of special circumstances surely half the allowance at least should be paid to his widow.  That is done in the case of a pension.  I would ask the Minister to consider this point.</P>
    <P>I served in the FCA during the emergency.  On the barrack square one always obeys one's superior officer. In civilian life there should be no distinction.  Not everyone can become a colonel.  Privates come from very good homes, as was pointed out earlier in the debate, since the Army is very particular about the people it recruits. All my life I have been against class distinction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="385" /> These are the few points I want to make.  I wish the Minister well.  If the need to criticise him arises, then I shall be the first to criticise, but my criticism will at all times be constructive. If I see something wrong being done I shall certainly draw attention to it.  As I said, his speech was really a compliment to those who preceded him.  He found the Defence Forces in excellent shape.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BillLoughnane" hpid="Dr. Loughnane Dr. Loughnane">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Loughnane</NameTxt>
      <P>Having served in the Army for a number of years on permanent service and in the reserve I would like to make a few comments. Mindful of the great improvements in conditions from the time of my recruit days, which was the time of the tin plate, the tin mug and the bulls wool, I want to make a few constructive suggestions for the Minister's consideration.</P>
      <P>It seems that the flow of recruits has halted and the figures of personnel for security duties is therefore static and still inadequate.  The incidence of duty is very high and in many stations a soldier, whether he is an officer, an NCO or a man, may be, and most likely is, on 24-hour duty twice a week.  This is physically hard and particularly demoralising.  It leads to the soldier retiring when his time is up, thereby making fewer available, and so the vicious circle continues.  It is felt by those who have studied the matter in detail, and who, I believe, have made the case accordingly that a financial incentive, or a reduction of the duties, is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since an FCA man who, for instance, with a day off from his normal employment does a security duty in a barracks or similar post is paid for the performance of this duty from 09.00 hours to the same hour the following day two days' pay, it is felt that a similar extra payment of a day's pay would compensate the soldier. Since a man ceases to be a soldier proper he becomes a full-time security man.  As things stand the effort to man the posts and installations for RTE and ESB has really stretched the limited resources.  There is at the moment some small compensation for disturbance, but it is very small.  For <Col N="386" /> most people promotion can mean a small rise in pay but considerable overall financial loss.  If concerns like CIE can make promotion worthwhile, surely the Army can be granted conditions at least as good as those available to other public servants.</P>
    <P>Resettlement is a big problem.  In this I suggest the introduction of vocational education to prepare the soldier for some type of appointment on retiring.  Some links could be established between major firms, many of which are Government-sponsored, and Army personnel with a view to employing the latter.  I have seen appointments advertised by the Civil Service Commissioners granting extension of age limits to civil servants and officials of local authorities with certain service.  I suggest that these facilities should also be granted to members of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>I have circular 9/73 of the Department of Finance regarding the reckoning for superannuation purposes of service with the Defence Forces during the emergency.  Paragraph 2 (a) reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Defence Forces Emergency Service must have been satisfactory and must have been followed immediately or at a later stage by service as a civil servant or as a civilian employee in the Department of Defence.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 2 (b) reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Not more than two years of Defence Forces Emergency Service may be aggregated with subsequent service for the purpose of making an award.</P>
    <P>I ask why not extend this and have this applied to men in semi-State bodies such as Aer Lingus, CIE, <i>et cetera</i>?  Surely the men who joined the Army and went into semi-State bodies were prepared to serve as well as the civil servants.  Reckoning for pension purposes should be similar in all such cases.</P>
    <P>I am told that the new uniforms are very light.  They are not of bulls wool as they were in my day, but I am told that they would be unsuitable for winter wear.  I concur with the views <Col N="387" /> of the speakers from both sides of the House who asked for better facilities for the Old IRA.  Their numbers are decreasing fast and I believe we should acknowledge their service to the nation by granting them increases in their allowances and other facilities.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, as an ex-soldier I congratulate the Defence Forces on their dedication to duty.  I would like to join with Deputy O'Sullivan from the other side of the House in praise of the Army's non-involvement in internal politics.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank those Deputies, and particularly Deputy Cronin, who congratulated me on achieving office and who wished me well.  I must single out Deputy Cronin, who is a friend of mine, and say that I wish him every success in his career in the future. Deputy Cronin mentioned the Naval Service.  I will deal with it in the course of my address.</P>
      <P>I wish to go through the various points raised by Deputies.  The Deputies know and I know on best advice that our coastlines could not be covered completely by the number of naval vessels we have.  The number of vessels which would be necessary to provide complete cover would be beyond our financial capacity.  I want to assure Deputy Cronin and all members of the House that I will be taking a serious look at the Naval Service in the months ahead.  We will have to see what best we can provide. There will be the question of a decision in this regard, but that decision will not be too long delayed once I have got the best advice available from my officials and from the various sources available to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cronin mentioned the incident at Fermoy.  As other Deputies also mentioned it, I will leave it aside for the moment.  The question of security is being seriously considered. I have interested myself in it since I arrived and in the short period of time at my disposal I have briefed myself on the situation.  The position is that the Army is an aid to the civil power.  There is a sad situation in our country when that is necessary.  Such aid <Col N="388" /> is necessary and will be provided. It must be clear to all that, even if there is a spectacular improvement in our security position in the months to come, we may have to have such aid for the civil power in the manning of road blocks, the provision of patrols along the Border and the guarding of installations for years to come.  We must accept that 800 people have lost their lives within our shores and the degree of enmity which has resulted from their deaths.  This, in relation to offences against the State, is primarily the responsibility of the Minister for Justice.  If a situation exists where aid is necessary to the civil power then a well-equipped loyal Army is certainly necessary.  The Members of the House would all agree with me, in a non-party-political way, that such aid and backing is going to be necessary in the years to come.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cronin and other Deputies mentioned the question of cohesion between the auxiliary fire services operated by the civil defence and our fire services as a whole.  If there is any dissatisfaction on this point it would be my duty to recommend to the county managers who are the heads of civil defence that this cohesion and co-operation should be brought about. Personally I think there is probably more talk than fact about this.  I have seen some fires in my constituency and when it was necessary for the auxiliary fire service to be called out, it was promptly available, but if Deputies say, as more than one Deputy has said, that there is a need for greater co-operation, one with the other, it is a matter entirely for the county managers who are the heads of civil defence. What I am saying now on the matter, together with the fact that we will draw attention to that particular criticism or worry on the part of Deputies, will bring about this co-operation and cohesion which is so necessary.</P>
    <P>The matter of providing facilities for Old IRA veterans in St. Bricin's Hospital was raised by Deputy Cronin and others.  The position here is that some weeks before the election a lengthy memo went to the then Minister for Health.  Other events intervened <Col N="389" /> and the matter was not dealt with, but it will be quite clear that as soon as the present Minister for Health replies, this matter can be considered and I undertake to see that it is so considered.  We are all anxious that these veterans should be properly looked after and we all know, as has been said by many Deputies, their numbers are decreasing but at this moment in time that is my information which I have pleasure in giving to the House.  I am sure everybody will regard it as an utterly non-political matter and merely a matter of decision and ability. If it is possible to do something for them in St. Bricin's, to provide any sort of service, that is on, but if it is not possible, if wisdom dictates that no such service could be provided, we will have to look around and see what we can do elsewhere.  The point has been put and this memo was sent from my Department before my arrival and we await a reply.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cronin, Deputy O'Sullivan and many others raised the question of wives of Old IRA personnel not being allowed to travel without their husbands.  The obvious physical point arising is that as people grow older, it may be that a husband cannot travel because of being bed-ridden or house-bound and it does seem rather unfair that a wife who could travel with him when he was fit and well cannot travel on her own.  It is not my responsibility; it is entirely a matter for the Minister for Finance, and I undertake to draw it to his attention and I would hope that we would manage to get something done in the matter.  It would be for me a very great joy if such did occur.  Other Deputies who raised this matter will take my explanation to Deputies Cronin and O'Sullivan as an explanation to them also.</P>
    <P>The question of Old IRA pensions was also raised by Deputy O'Sullivan. The position here is that these pensions rise year by year almost automatically. My experience over 19 years&mdash;16 years in the Dáil and three years in the Seanad&mdash;has been that there was some grave dissatisfaction on many occasions with the amount of service which was approved by the examining officers as proper for the <Col N="390" /> pensioner.  If this amount of service was quite small, the pension in many cases was quite minute.  I had a case the other day of a man who was granted a pension in 1941, a pension which was so small in his opinion that he was annoyed and did not accept it.  That pension granted in 1941 has, in fact, almost multiplied itself by six now and the position today is that if he wished to take his pension, he would be getting six times what he would have got in 1941.  The argument that the judgment was severe, that the examining officers gave very little service, with the result that many a man started off with a very small pension may be more true than, perhaps, is Deputy O'Sullivan's criticism that the increases given were inadequate. The relevant increase referred to in my statement and in the Book of Estimates for this year is 14 per cent and Deputy O'Sullivan was asking for ten per cent.  He is doing it in all sincerity, but if he wished to look at the thing carefully he would realise that probably the ill here is more in relation to the starting off point than the present series of increases.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also mentioned civil defence uniforms.  The position is that this uniform is a working uniform and I have a memo which tells me that a number of suggestions have been made for an improvement in the present type of uniform.  The second paragraph of that memo tells me that it should be remembered that it is basically a working dress for use in operational conditions and bearing that in mind it may be taken that the uniform is not that bad, because if these personnel are to work, are to rescue people, to act in the auxiliary fire service, they need a working uniform. The question arises as to whether or not there should be two uniforms.  The complaint made by Deputy O'Sullivan, which is not merely a complaint by him but one which we hear very often, would be related more to the fact that if civil defence personnel go to a dance or other social occasion, they find themselves dressed in a working uniform and, perhaps, as they might think, not properly dressed for the occasion; but the provision of extra uniforms <Col N="391" /> would involve a very large sum of money.  I wonder whether something in between or an improved new cut, style and perhaps material for the present uniform might not be a half-way house.</P>
    <P>It has been a great experience for me to find these matters which, rightly or wrongly, are the subjects of complaints being drawn to my attention in the first few weeks in my Department because it is making me work and think.  It means that I will be able to go back and be advised from the official side and the Army side on the various problems so that I can reach the best conclusion.  Taking the memo as it is put to me, in this particular regard we are in the dilemma that to do the job well would require two uniforms because the working uniform, with the excellent work which the civil defence people do in rescue operations, can of necessity at times be dirty and arduous and one may have to look at it in that light, but the explanation given is in my view quite right.</P>
    <P>In relation to complaints about rates of Army pensions, I was not in the Department a wet weekend when I had many such complaints coming on my desk.  However, they are not that bad and it is well perhaps that I should record what they are at present, and I quote from a memo given to me in relation to the weekly rates of pension for the various ranks on current discharge after 31 years' service.  In the case of pension and married pension, the figures are: sergeant-major, per week, £17.81; battalion quartermaster sergeant, £16.64; company-sergeant, £15.74; company quartermaster sergeant, £15.20; sergeant, £14.82; corporal, £14.69 and private, £13.58.  These range as a percentage of the Army pay of these married men, from 46 per cent in the case of sergeant-majors to 51 per cent in the case of privates.  If a private had joined at 18 and was coming out at just my age, 49, he would be going away with his £13.58, and still a private. It would be rather unusual if that happened.  I should have thought he would have moved up the line to <Col N="392" /> the rank of corporal or sergeant at least.  If a person spent 31 years in the Army it is obvious that he must have some aptitude for Army life and when one considers this, together with the experience he would have gained during his service, it is more than likely that the person would have risen in rank.  Without having any figures before me I do not think many people come out of the Army at the lowest grade.</P>
    <P>In the case of single NCOs and privates the rates are somewhat lower but the percentage is better.  After that period of time a sergeant-major would come out at £15.06; a battalion quartermaster sergeant would have £13.89; a company-sergeant £12.99; a company quartermaster-sergeant £12.45; a sergeant £12.07; a corporal £11.94 and a private £10.83.  A single sergeant-major would receive 48 per cent of his Army pay while a private would receive 54 per cent of Army pay. These are not bad rates, especially when one considers that these men come out at an early age and that married people receive a resettlement allowance.  I am not saying that I am satisfied with them, or that the pay is marvellous, but it appears reasonably fair and I think that, with some adjustments in the years ahead, it is not a bad scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brugha asked for confirmation that the 4,200 widows granted allowances are widows of veterans of the War of Independence.  The answer to that is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason the Deputy asked the question was that it was not clear if it referred to an ordinary soldier on pension and this is the point I raised also.  We wanted to know if the pension ceased on the death of the soldier.  The explanation given by the Minister is satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan and others referred to visiting committees. I have found that one of the major matters was with regard to complaints. There might be complaints about, for instance, the Portlaoise prison, about conditions in other prisons or about visiting committees, but I found for some extraordinary reason&mdash;<Col N="393" /> which might be for propaganda purposes&mdash;that all the complaints centred on the Curragh detention prison and this made me consider the matter.  I found that although the maximum number on a visiting committee should be 12 and the minimum number six, when I arrived at my office the number had dropped to six and on my desk was a resignation from one of the six. This would have left me with a committee that was under the minimum stipulated.  I appointed seven people; they included old people, late middle-aged and middle-aged people.  The people appointed included the former Deputy Boylan, Deputy Bermingham, a former secretary of a semi-State company, a former bank manager and a farmer.  There were no arrangements for travelling expenses but I did not think it was sufficient merely to have a local visiting committee.  The committee I appointed are having their first meeting today.</P>
      <P>I visited the prison and spent three hours there.  I inspected it with the help of the Secretary of my Department, the Adjutant General and the Governor of the prison.  As I pointed out in my opening speech, the food supplied will have to be as good as the Army food. The instruction has been given, and I corroborated it, that, within the limits of prison regulations, the food should be the same as that in the Army and should be cooked by Army cooks.  I might remark that there is nothing new in this; my predecessor made the same ruling.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out in my speech, because this prison is not the same as an ordinary prison it has one disadvantage. In the past when an Army detainee had his breakfast he was put to work draining football pitches&mdash;I understand all drainage of the football pitches at the Curragh was carried out by detainees &mdash;or he was given other fatigue duties. After tea the detainee was put into his cell at 9 p.m. and this continued for the duration of his sentence.  That situation meant that the people who planned this prison had not the necessity to provide as much dayroom accommodation as would be required in an ordinary prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to remind the House that there <Col N="394" /> is no justification for all the criticism my predecessor and myself have suffered regarding the Curragh prison. It has been stated that it is unfair to place prisoners in it.  There is the added disadvantage about this prison that, as former detainees could have been anywhere in the Curragh complex during the daytime, there are not the high walls that surround many other prisons. My predecessor and myself have had to do certain things; I have had to provide a separate exercise ground for two prisoners.</P>
    <P>Because of the wrecking of Mountjoy prison I have had to look after these people who were led astray. They are opposed to the State and to our democracy and it is a tragedy that their energies and intelligence were not devoted towards working for the State.  It is my job to make sure that they remain in custody, not merely as a measure of punishment but also for security reasons, for the term the court has decided.  However, these people will be treated in a humane manner.  I reject completely the constant pleas for unsupervised visits.  We are dealing with people who naturally enough wish to escape and if unsupervised visits were allowed, messages and material could be passed to them.  Such visits are not allowed in any prison.  I have inspected the visiting rooms and I wish to assure the House that they are perfectly normal.</P>
    <P>I have visited people in Mountjoy Prison.  There was a table with a glass partition about nine inches high in the middle of the room and the visitors sat on one side and the prisoners sat on the other with a prison officer present.  An exactly similar situation exists in the Curragh Detention Barracks.  Any of the propaganda which Deputies may have heard&mdash;for some unknown reason all slanted at this prison&mdash;may be taken to be entirely erroneous so far as my full investigation was concerned.  I want to assure the House and the country that it is my job to see to it that there will be no escape from there&mdash;I would remind the House that there was an escape from there last October.  I am also charged with <Col N="395" /> the good health and the proper treatment of prisoners and this charge will be carried out to the full without any discrimination of any kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe mentioned the people on bomb disposal work.  The people of this country are now awakening to the fact that there is a necessity for such people as Army experts.  A person who defuses a bomb at risk to his life is surely not only an expert but almost a hero.  We have these people in the Army, and we have such training in the Army. It is highly necessary.  As more nefarious and horrible weapons arrive &mdash;if they do arrive; and we may as well accept that some of them did arrive&mdash;we must see to it in every possible way that they do not cause loss of life.  I hope and I think these weapons do not arrive through this part of the country.</P>
    <P>The Russian rockets which are now being used in the North of Ireland are dreadful weapons.  So far they have not been used successfully, through lack of training we would think, but they did arrive.  There are also bombs of the most modern type. There are bombs which with a lesser weight and size could create far more loss of life and damage to property than the conventional type of explosives more normally used.  The bomb disposal experts to whom Deputy Briscoe adverted are our front line experts in this field.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe made the point, and I take the point, that in the event of one of these gentlemen losing his life there is a case for a more generous approach to his dependants.  Happily, so far as I know, this has not occurred at least during the past few years, but Deputy Briscoe's point is salient and should be looked at and I will do so. He also wished me luck and I thank him for that.  He instanced the case of a soldier with 37 years' service, with four years out of the Army during that period, and a pension of £40 a month.  His widow got nothing.  I should like him to communicate with me or my Department about this matter because it appears to be out of line.  We will have it looked up and <Col N="396" /> we will see to it that if there is any error&mdash;I do not think there is&mdash;it will be corrected.</P>
    <P>The vexed question of married quarters and overholders was raised by several Deputies, including Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Briscoe.  I should like to deal generally with married quarters at the moment.  During my short period of office I have addressed myself to this question.  The general policy whereby local authorities would build houses in proximity to known permanent barracks, in which soldiers could live as ordinary citizens and report for their duties at the barracks, is not meeting with as much success as we would wish.  One of the obvious places that comes to mind is Kildare.  One also thinks of Naas and the Curragh.  As far as I know, Deputy Bermingham is a member of Kildare County Council and he was quite critical of what was occurring. During the next couple of months, to speed this up, one of my duties will be to interview county managers or secretaries of local authorities and see if we can set up a scheme and do something positive in this regard.</P>
    <P>By and large, I would think that the point made by Deputy Byrne and Deputy Dowling, that soldiers are better living outside barracks, if possible, is valid.  The applicants for houses with local authorities include applicants from married quarters within barracks, and somebody made the point that the only way you could bring the Army into line in this regard would be to go in and do the dreadful deed of condemning married quarters. Since I became Minister I have not had the opportunity of visiting married quarters but I will do so.  The fact that my Estimate was taken first gives me a chance to get on the road.</P>
    <P>I did have an opportunity of visiting all the married quarters in the Curragh Camp during a recent by-election in Kildare.  Frankly, I was appalled. Over the years when it came to making economies in the Army, married quarters seem to have been neglected.  Money was saved on married quarters.  Possibly it was thought that it was not right to have these <Col N="397" /> huge rows of married quarters in the barracks and that the soldiers should be accommodated outside and this may have led previous Ministers and the Department to decide to let married quarters die a natural death.  I would hope that, under the aegis of the National Building Agency, perhaps, and with the goodwill of the local authority and the goodwill of the Department and myself in relation to sites and land, we could do something to deal with the problem of married quarters.</P>
    <P>For the first time in my reply I am expressing a criticism on the basis that in some cases married quarters are dreadful.  I was shown around the married quarters of a man and his wife and four children and it was not fit accommodation for them.  There was nothing he could do about it.  His life was the Army and he had to put up with it, because outside, the local authority may have been making sounds but they were not producing houses.  I will have to investigate this and try to get a proper relationship between local authorities and the Army, and try to get the building scheme which is under way at present enlarged so that Army men will be able to live outside barracks in houses which are proper for themselves and their families.</P>
    <P>Deputy Briscoe raised the point about pensions for widows of soldiers. I have not addressed myself to that matter since I became Minister but I am advised that some thought has been given to it.  All I can say is that I will examine it.  I will have to take a copy of this debate with me everywhere I go to see what I said I would examine.  I will have to see how I can activate those matters which I wish to activate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bermingham said that a widow was disqualified from getting a pension to which she was entitled because she did not apply within one year of her husband's death as she did not know she should.  This seems to us to be a little off beam.  If Deputy Bermingham would be good enough to let me or the Department know what the situation is we will do our very best.  We will certainly see that if any <Col N="398" /> injustice has been done&mdash;and I do not think it has been&mdash;it will be righted immediately.</P>
    <P>We are in a dreadful position in regard to overholding.  If you give a man a house for 20 years and it comes to the end of his stay in the Army and somebody else needs the house, you have two needs and one supply.  If you have two children and one slice of bread and the minimum allowance is one slice of bread, then one child goes hungry.  I know it is difficult when a man has been from 20 to 25 years in a house and has served loyally during that period to be asked to move away. I can see no short term solution here but I think of it as almost being in the sphere of the social worker&mdash;that there should be some planning towards the setting up of the soldier outside after he leaves the Army, and that includes his house.  I wonder if a scheme could be devised whereby we could have subsidised loans for such soldiers, if we could have some sort of arrangement with building societies or if the sort of thing I am thinking of in relation to local authorities and the pressure we should put on people to get a move on in this regard would not help in relation to overholding.</P>
    <P>I do not approach the overholder as a person who is a great sinner but as a person who is in a cleft stick.  I am aware that the present situation is that the overholder suffers penalties on the basis that he does not get his pension as long as he overholds the house. That is like the case of the carrot and the stick.  We are trying to encourage him to get a house elsewhere and leave the accommodation he occupied as a serving soldier.  As long as the thinking is that the serving soldier should have it, that is a legitimate approach but we must take into account the sympathy we should have for a man who has served long and loyally.  As I am Minister for only a short time I would not be competent to say if most people in Army married quarters are long or short service soldiers.  I think that most of them are long serving so it is hard if a person has to leave his place of residence after so long.  I shall do something about this because I see it as a long term problem and <Col N="399" /> one which we will have to solve as best we can.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera mentioned the stop-go attitude in relation to Defence and suggested that it should never occur again, and I agree with him.  If I have any experience or knowledge apart from my political experience it is on administration in business and I have some contempt for the annual profit and loss account and the annual balance sheet.  If you want to plan nowadays, if you want to do your job right, you have got to plan over a period of five or ten years and one year is no use at all.  The cutting down one year and the giving back the next year&mdash;if there is a great criticism and heavy pressure that something has been neglected, you then plunge in and you produce the bank book again&mdash;is not the way to do it.  I agree with Deputy de Valera that the right way to do this is on a planned basis over five or ten years' thinking.</P>
    <P>This means that you admit, perhaps, that some of the things that are desired might not get done until three or four years' time.  If that is the truth, is it not better to admit it, because by so admitting you might get them done in two or three years' time instead of in three or four years?  A great degree of forward planning is necessary.  I intend during my time as a Minister to provide the push forward for what I find to be a most loyal band of people in my Department and in the Army to try to get that forward planning.  This is absolutely necessary in the case of the buildings we have.  If you wanted to have the sore thumb I suppose you would go back to the married quarters. We have to sit down now and think out how we can get moving on a non-stopping vehicle, within the amount of capital that can be provided for the Army.  There is no use in saying that this State should spend too much on the Army.  The proper amount should be spent on the Army, which in my view is something more in 1973 money terms than is being spent at the moment.</P>
    <P>I can see the places of difficulty and the places of neglect.  The situation must be corrected, but it will not be <Col N="400" /> done in 1973.  If the planning is done and if the infrastructure starts to build up, then I can see a much better situation for this loyal Army.  I take Deputy de Valera's point and I agree with him. If energy on my part and whatever little intelligence God gave me can make that happen, the Deputy may be assured that such will occur.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera mentioned the question of producing items of equipment locally as a further development of the armoured personnel carrier idea. I look forward to seeing this prototype armoured personnel carrier.  I have not yet visited where it is being manufactured. Some criticism has been made of my being too light on my foot and hopping into helicopters too often.  I am sorry to say that that criticism will be further fomented if people are not convinced of what I am going to say. I came into this Ministry to do a job and if a helicopter gets me faster from here to there and if I can do three or four visits in one day instead of two, I will go by helicopter and I will accept all the criticism.  I do not care about the small thinkers because they are the sort of people who will end up with married quarters in the conditions they are in today, in 20 years' time.  That will not happen in my case. Whatever I can do by modern means, whatever I can do by employing whatever energy I have I will do.</P>
    <P>I have not visited the apprenticeship school at Naas but I hope to get there soon.  Before I became Minister I heard some criticism of that school and yesterday Deputy Dowling criticised the standard of equipment used to train these people.  I want to see if it is bad and I want to see what are the deficiencies.  In relation to the provision of equipment for training apprentices I positively guarantee this House if there is any deficiency there it will be corrected immediately.  I hope in the Army we can give the opportunity to more young men to come out after their period in the Army with a trade, to be better able to fend for themselves in the world than before they came into the Army.</P>
    <P>I know Deputy de Valera is interested in inventions as he has that type of inquiring mind and that he is prob- <Col N="401" /> ably very interested in the fact that an armoured personnel carrier has been produced which might even sell to other nations and certainly can be of use to us.  The thought that the Deputy has produced, that we should go further than that and avail of any opportunity to do something for ourselves, is highly relevant and comes back to the question of apprentices.  If there are opportunities to go into other fields, to give more young men more experience and if there is within the apprentices who come in and within the forces dealing with this particular aspect in the Army somebody who can by expertise, knowledge and a bit of inspiration, produce something that will make us a little better than the others, I am all for it.  I should like to be able to expand this apprenticeship scheme and to create a situation whereby young men would have greater opportunities in the Army for the expansion and the exercise of the gifts God gave them.</P>
    <P>I want to say that I am advised, and I accept absolutely, the fact that Army duties and the question of arms means that everybody cannot spend all his time in the apprentice school.  There will be, of course, many young men who join the Army who do not want to do anything except soldiering.  They might perhaps become specialist soldiers. They may want to be drivers. They could perhaps have a special aptitude that the officer in charge might discern and he might direct them.  Leaving aside drivers, carpenters, fitters and all the rest, there still will be a large number of young boys in the Army who will be soldiers as such and who will carry out the duties of soldiering that are so necessary, not in a specialist but in a general way, under their officers until they come to the stage of promotion.</P>
    <P>That means that it is not realistic to say to parents who you would wish would regard the Army as a way of life that would improve their sons over a three year period or perhaps longer, that everyone who joins the Army will come out with a trade. You cannot and should not say that. It is just not on.  At the same time you can try to develop the technical aspects of the Army.  You can look <Col N="402" /> forward to the situation where with more boys in apprenticeships, more people in certain specialist occupations, you can produce a more efficient defence force, a defence force that will move further away from the concept of footsloggers.  That is a long-term project.  It is a development to which we must address ourselves as having some merit.</P>
    <P>The question of recruits was mentioned by the last speaker.  It is true that in the last weeks there has been a drop in the number of recruits. That is seasonal.  It is true that the number is under establishment.  I intend to press forward with a recruiting campaign.  As I see it, and I have clearly made my point and all sides of the House will take the point, security duties for some years to come will be necessary in aid of the civil power. While that is the case we need an army of a certain establishment and therefore we must have a flow of recruits.  I would put it to the parents of the country that in the conditions of life prevailing at the moment, where people are involved in all sorts of difficulties with drugs, and so on, for a boy who joins the Army at 18 years of age, the three years of Army discipline, outdoor life, good food, interesting occupation, would provide him with a period in which he could make up his mind as to whether or not he would like to make the Army his profession or would prefer to enter some other profession.  While not implying that there would be a general opportunity, because of the dishonesty of doing that, there would be opportunities for boys within the Army to become apprentices to some trade or other.  A boy could go to Baldonnel and get an apprenticeship in the Air Corps, which is highly valuable.  The minute they are ready and right they go to Aer Lingus.  That is a wastage we cannot stop.  The man serves for his period and when that period has expired he has a right to do what he will.  I wish I could project to parents the idea that working under the most conscientious officers, the most kindly and understanding officers, a young boy could very easily find in the Army something that would make him right for life, <Col N="403" /> that would make a man of him. There are opportunities for apprenticeships but these do not extend to all of those who join the Army.  I could not say that they did unless I were a dishonest man.</P>
    <P>Boys who join the Army would provide for the nation a service which is necessary for the nation. We need at present security forces and need them badly.  The security forces must be kept at a certain level. Who is the true patriot?  I want to suggest to the House that the true patriot is the boy who joins the Army, does his training, carries out his duties, is paid for that and well paid, all found, and comes out a better man after three years, having given that formative period of his life to his country in a time of need.  Do not let anyone think that this is not a time of need.</P>
    <P>Deputies were confused about the title of the Naval Service and Slua Muirí.  I must confess that, like other Deputies, I used to call it Slua Mhuire, until I realised that the title did not refer to the Blessed Virgin but to the sea.  The situation is that young boys are based in Limerick, Cork and Dún Laoghaire.  The phraseology in my opening speech in relation to Slua Muirí was my own.  It was to the effect that something had to be done about it or else it would die a natural or, looking at it in a different way, an unnatural death.  I regard the Slua Muirí situation as a totally unnatural situation.  There is no point in taking young boys at a time in their life when they have stars in their eyes, if they happen to be interested in the sea, and giving them, between them all, five open boats and not even one further opportunity whereby they can go on some other type of boat and get more advanced type training, possibly under sail, or become a naval rating in our Naval Service or go further and become a cadet.  There is a snag in relation to the Slua Muirí people becoming cadets in that if they do two years there, they may have gone beyond the age limit. So, they might well be the force that would produce the young ratings in the Naval Service.</P>
    <P>One has to think also that there have been courses in the Army and in <Col N="404" /> every army whereby non-commissioned officers become officers.  There are various suggestions that one could make to the people who are so receptive in my Department in this regard as to how this force could be developed into something that would be a feeding ground for the Naval Service either in the form of ratings or in the form of ratings who might become officers at a certain stage or, in the case of boys who had joined at a sufficiently young age, naval cadets.</P>
    <P>I must consider this in the most serious way.  Some Deputies across the House suggested that I had a background of the sea.  I admit completely to having two wet feet, I am so fond of it.  That means that I must discipline myself and not go overboard in relation to one section of the service to the detriment of another.  I would not accept, unless I could be convinced otherwise, the suggestion that is on my desk that there might be a number of power boats costing £40,000 each and that would be all there would be to it. I wonder whether or not the necessary degree of training would be provided in those boats for this colossal expenditure. Deputies may take it that as far as An Slua Muirí is concerned I shall certainly work hard to see what is the proper way.  I am convinced that it had been entirely neglected, that nobody bothered much about it and that it would die a natural or unnatural death.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan adverted to this situation and while I do not know if his figures are correct, and therefore do not accept them, he said they had at present only about 12 people going to Sarsfield Barracks in Limerick and that the nearest they got to the sea was when they got water from the tap.  That may represent a degree of hyperbole which is allowable but I cannot and, indeed, have not in the recent past, indulged in that figure of speech but the position is that this situation must be corrected and either we admit that there is no future in this or we must say what we intend to do.  This is something that must be tackled seriously.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern thanked me personally for a number of things and wished me well and I thank him for <Col N="405" /> that.  He raised a point which I shall ask the Department to take up.  It would appear to be a very undesirable position, if it is true, that our London Embassy does not recognise the Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen.  I do not accept rumours but I completely accept that Deputy Davern believes this to be so.  I shall ask the Department to see if there is any suggestion that when ONE contact our London Embassy they are brushed off, or anything like that.  I do not believe it is so but if better relations can be brought about we shall see what can be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern also referred to the matter of one year's training not being enough for an officer.  He was referring to a crash course which is entirely a sign of the times.  One of the first pleasant duties I had, in fact, was to commission these cadets at the Curragh.  As my predecessor knows, they worked very hard.  They were given a crash course because we needed junior leaders.  They will be fostered and will not be thrown to the wolves because they did a crash course and got through double as much as others in the same or less time.  They will be watched and developed but the course was a sign of the times and of the need for security.  These young men behaved marvellously and looked very well and I have heard nothing but praise for them.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the question of barracks and give my general view on the subject.  The Department have some valuable property, principally in this city.  Deputies approached this matter in widely diverse ways. Some said they wanted the barracks sold and others wanted barracks built: some criticised the barracks.  I am advised that modern Army thinking is that you should not have a large barracks within a city, that you run into traffic problems and you are to some extent a sitting duck and that in the proper concept of a barracks, particularly in regard to riot control and civil disturbance and, as we had not so long ago, a series of serious bombing incidents, you are better off with your barracks and personnel outside the city. With radio control and with modern <Col N="406" /> vehicles you could arrive quickly at the trouble spot.  This is the modern thinking on the matter.</P>
    <P>We have very valuable properties, notably Cathal Brugha Barracks. Some Deputies said this was highly valuable property, that it should be available for the nation, that there should be schools in it and that we could improve the life of the Dublin people by using it, and so on.  The Army is not Barnardo's Benevolent Fund.  As my predecessor knows, capital funds for the Army in future, no matter what Government are in power, will be one of the factors slowing down development.  Even when your planning is right and you get it going you must be able to get the capital for it.  There is a large capital fund residing in the property that might be disposed of and I hope that in a planned and proper way that large fund will be directed towards the Army in the years to come.  Despite that, it would be quite wrong for anybody to say that if within the areas to be disposed of&mdash;whenever the decision is made&mdash;there was a prime necessity for something such as schools, arrangements could not be made in that regard: of course they could.  But I would expect and, as Minister for Defence, would hold strongly that the Army has need of large capital sums for those things that have not been done in regard to building, for married quarters, for modernisation plans, and so on.  If within its complex it holds valuable building sites which would yield big capital that capital and probably more with it should be spent on the advancement of the Army.</P>
    <P>For anybody to conjecture about millions of pounds at this stage would be quite wrong and we are talking in millions of pounds.  If we are to have an Army&mdash;and everyone now accepts that we need an Army&mdash;we must give it a fair deal and therefore we must do forward planning.  That should be one of the most interesting and satisfying experiences and I look forward to it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern also mentioned the matter of more attractive payment for Border duties.  I have not had time to address myself fully to that question <Col N="407" /> but I am aware of the exigencies of these duties.  I have seen patrols leaving Longford Barracks, with food which they had to cook themselves in their vehicles, to do 13 hours on patrol before returning to barracks.  I am aware of Army personnel doing 80 to 100 hours per week, admittedly some of it on stand-to, but in the barracks and away from wives and families.  I know this happens on Border duty and I want to thank personally each one of these people who is putting in that much effort.  It is because of them that subversives are not in a position to cross the Border with complete immunity.  The soldiers and the gardaí are the patriots and the people who should be tops in this country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davern, Deputy O'Malley and others spoke about an incident in Fermoy.  I want to be quite clear on this.  The Army on the request of the civil power will act and if somebody slipped through our fingers in Fermoy, the position is still the same.</P>

      <P>Deputy Power referred to the urgent need for accommodation at Baldonnel.  We have a considerable building programme in hands and all essential works will be attended to as soon as possible.  The programme will have to be extended if we are to solve the problems I outlined.</P>
      <P>Deputy Power also referred to the inadequacy of medical treatment for soldiers' wives and families at the Curragh.  I am advised this is a matter for the health authority.  How it originally arose I do not know, but the medical officers in the Curragh have rendered medical assistance to the wives and families of soldiers. That, of course, depends upon the exigencies of the service, including the availability of medical officers. The soldier's family is in the very same position as every other family, but it did happen that in the Curragh the medical officers provided a service.</P>
      <P>Deputy Power asked what the need was to appoint persons from my own county on the visiting committee.  The answer is that I appointed one person from my own county, a middle-aged man of the highest integrity.  I picked people who would have sympathy for the prisoners and, at the same time, would be highly responsible from the point of view of security and the proper carrying out of the duties appertaining to a prison camp.  I make no apology for that.  Indeed, I wish I were as good a man as any one of them. When I arrived in the office I had half a visiting committee and a resignation sitting on my desk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Power suggested that a new civil defence booklet was needed.  I <Col N="409" /> am informed that the booklet issued some years ago is still valid.  Copies are available on request from the Department.  All anyone who wants them need do is ask.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan supported the idea of wholesale military service and Deputy O'Malley subsequently took up the same argument and suggested the Government intended to introduce conscription. That is just too ridiculous. There is no basis for such a suggestion at all.  My effort to bring the force up to establishment will be based on voluntary recruitment.  I have a particular line on this.  Excellent results would accrue from even a short term in the Army.  I have a note in relation to this:</P>
    <P>Enlistment in the Defence Forces is on a voluntary basis and even during the Emergency (1939-45) compulsory military service was not resorted to.  While it is a matter that might be thought about in the future, there is no legislation in existence pursuant to which compulsory military service in the Defence Forces could be introduced in peacetime or in an emergency situation.</P>
    <P>Nobody, the Government or anybody else, has any idea of introducing conscription. It would not be in the public interest.  I depend on the degree of patriotism that I know exists, proper, decent and responsible patriotism, to provide for the Army the boys we need to enable our security forces to reach their proper level.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan complained about the medical examination for cadets.  He said that if a tooth was replaced they were rejected.  I have had personal experience of people writing to me on this matter since I became Minister and I can assure Deputy Coughlan that such is not the case.  He is quite incorrect. We must, of course, have men of a high degree of physical fitness in both our cadet corps and in the Army generally.  An army must be a fit army. We are not taking people in to push pens.  There are periods during which they may not be engaged on very arduous duties but they must keep themselves at all times at a degree of fitness which will permit them to take <Col N="410" /> up arduous duties at any time and they must, therefore, do their period of training every year.  We must have the highest fitness standard possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan referred to the Army jumping team.  I mentioned in my opening speech that I was looking forward to my first meeting with Bord na gCapall.  An arrangement has been entered into under which the most efficient trainer&mdash;he has returned to the country&mdash;will work for Bord na gCapall and the Army jumping team on an agency basis.  We will pay so much per year to Bord na gCapall and we will have the services of this trainer for our Army jumping team.  There will be further negotiations with the board. Phasing out of the Army jumping team is no part of my policy, but we must accept that this sport has now become a millionaire's pastime.  One horse can cost a fantastic sum because he is a super performer.  The hiring or acquiring of two or three riders out of the whole of these islands, or five or six out of the whole continent of Europe, because of their superlative standard in equestrian activities can cost an inordinate amount of money.  This is something we must accept.  Professionalism is not really applicable but, in its modern connotation, it just means that we are on a sticky wicket, if I may mix my metaphor.  If we co-operate with Bord na gCapall I think the halcyon days of the Army jumping team will return again.  I would not like to think the team would be dropped and I shall make every effort to see that they are not.  When I am dealing with Bord na gCapall I shall want my pound of flesh and that is why I am looking forward to my meeting with Bord na gCapall.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling, who departed from responsibility to some considerable extent, made the classic statement that there were plenty of alternative arrangements for prisoners and nobody should be down in the horrible Curragh prison camp.  Deputy Dowling was in the Army himself.  He knows Mountjoy Prison was broken up and my predecessor was thanked today by the previous Minister for Justice for affording these facilities in the Curragh.  My colleague is in the <Col N="411" /> same position as Deputy O'Malley was in.  Deputy Dowling should not be so completely off the beam.  He also raised the question of the Army apprentice school at Naas.  I am informed that the erection of new billets to provide better quarters for the apprentices went ahead in the past year.  Stage one is now completed.  It is intended to complete the job in the present financial year.  In Longford billets were badly needed and have been built.  These billets provide a greater degree of privacy for the men.  They have better reading facilities and good shower and toilet facilities.  This seems to be a very practical approach to the problem of housing the men.  The billets are centrally-heated. They are not, of course, first-class hotel accommodation.  We are dealing with young men who are physically fit and are living outdoor lives.  The new billets are very satisfactory and should be the subject of congratulation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling picked up Deputy Coughlan's point about compulsory military service.  I want to assure the House that Deputy Coughlan was off the beam on this point.  Attempts by Deputy Dowling and others who were desirous of causing trouble will not have any effect on me or on the people of the country.  Deputy Dowling raised the question of resettlement.  I refer the Deputy to a reply which was given on the 6th July, 1972, to Deputy Michael O'Leary, now Minister for Labour.  It reads:</P>
    <P>The employment exchanges are available to all ex-servicemen as a means through which to secure suitable employment and they are advised to use them.  A scheme of concessions exists to assist former non-commissioned officers and privates of the Permanent Defence Force in securing employment with Government Departments, local authorities and semi-State bodies. The employment exchanges have instructions in regard to these concessions.</P>
    <P>  This is true, although in the course of my political life ex-Army men have <Col N="412" /> complained to me that they did not get these concessions, and others got the jobs.  Many of these men would be judging their own capabilities against those of others, and they might have been incorrect in their approach.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Army put at a higher level.  I would like to see the fact that a man is an Army man proving to be something worthwhile and the fact registering in the mind of an employer as a probability of excellence. It is a probability of attention to detail, discipline and thoroughness. There are excellent Army men and others who are not quite so good, just as there are similar categories of civilians.  We are not all built in the same way.  We cannot expect everybody who comes out of the Army to be an angel.  My experience as an employer is that Army men have thoroughness and pay attention to detail.  The years of discipline and of acceptance of responsibility for duties which had to be carried out to the minutest detail seem to lead to a situation where these ex-Army people can be trusted with duties of that order.  I hope that the difficulties of placement will improve.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have mentioned the horrible practice of district justices in years gone of saying to offenders: &ldquo;I will let you off if you join the Army.&rdquo; I want to give due notice that the Adjutant General wants a high standard of men in the Army.  I want to inform the district justices that if they make such remarks the offenders will not be let into the Army.  That is my information.  That is the way it should be.  The standard of man in the Army at the present moment is high, and I want it higher if possible.  I want to see the situation improved at the acceptance stage in relation to boys going in, and at the departure stage in relation to those on their way out.  I want to see those who depart getting good jobs.  We must keep entry standards high, educate the young men better, give them discipline and teach them attention to detail which will fit them for outside life so that they will depart from the Army better fitted for life than they were when they came in. That must be done and be seen to be done.  If the Opposition think I have <Col N="413" /> been a bit flamboyant in my first six weeks in office in &ldquo;selling&rdquo; the Army one bit better than it was &ldquo;sold&rdquo; in the last 16 years they must remember that without doing so I would not have done my job.  There is need for some degree of propaganda.  My propaganda will not be irresponsible.  I will not say to every parent that we can give a boy an apprenticeship in a certain trade, but an effort will be made to &ldquo;sell&rdquo; the Army.  If the Opposition do not like it, they can &ldquo;lump&rdquo; it.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the poor equipment at the apprentice school in Naas.  This matter will be the subject of investigation as soon as I can get around to it.  Deputy Brugha raised the question of the strength of the civil defence.  I have a note which I would be glad to read to him.  The note reads:</P>
    <P>A special check was made in 1969 of the effective strength of civil defence volunteer personnel throughout the country.  Of more than 26,000 trained volunteers who were asked in writing if they intended to continue membership of the civil defence organisation and to report for duty if required in an emergency, some 14,500 replied in the affirmative.  This result was regarded as quite satisfactory. Latest returns from local authorities indicate that the total active strength of volunteers throughout the country is over 23,000.</P>
    <P>Taking into account the hazards of modern thermonuclear warfare which could have very widespread effects, the aim is to have as many civil defence volunteers as possible trained in each of the civil defence services in every part of the State so as to ensure that trained help would be immediately available everywhere for the civilian population.  Even members who have lapsed could help.</P>
    <P>Mention was also made of sports facilities at barracks.  Deputy Brugha thought that a new barracks should be built in the country.  Swimming pools were mentioned.  I have some knowledge of this subject.  I am aware of the swimming pool in a college a few miles from this House.  The pool is used by the boys and is also leased <Col N="414" /> out to sports groups who pay rent for it.  This means that the pool is available not only to the boys but also to a number of sporting bodies.  This is happening at Castleknock.</P>
    <P>My thinking is that we should not be too restrictive in keeping everything within the barracks.  If I can devise a scheme, and have it implemented by commanding officers, under which the officers would be in a position to go out and hire fields from the local GAA or the local soccer clubs and use their pitches on certain occasions to provide facilities for the boys in the barracks, this will give them playing facilities.  Even if such playing facilities cannot be supplied inside the barracks we can provide some sporting facilities within the barracks.</P>
    <P>There are games at present, such as squash, badminton and volleyball, which young men would delight in playing and I expect to try very hard to increase the amount of sporting equipment available within barracks, but at the same time if it is possible to hire a swimming pool in Longford for an hour on a Wednesday evening if the boys want it, I am informed by my Department that there is no real problem.  It is merely a matter of implementation and of the bringing together of all ranks, commanding officer included, to get it done.  That is my thinking on it, in reply to Deputy Brugha whose contribution was most constructive.  Merely restricting it to a tiny swimming pool worth £10,000 inside a barracks is just not on.  While people 20 years ago might have accepted lesser facilities, they now demand the best, and if you cannot buy the best, hire it.  Probably I am a bit flexible in this regard but&mdash; not to worry.  Deputy Brugha also raised the question of free travel for IRA widows.  That is a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall be very glad to get them.  He also asked if, where the recipient of a military service pension dies, his widow gets no pension.  The answer is that a military service pensioner's widow is eligible <Col N="415" /> for an allowance equal to half her deceased husband's pension or £70.56 per annum, whichever is the greater. That is the present position.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coogan raised the matter of housing in Galway.  Housing, as I have said already, is largely a matter for the local authorities, but if it is, I think it is true to say that we may need to do more talking to the local authorities in order to get things through and at this moment in time&mdash; and I speak without the advice of my Department on this&mdash;I think the agency which might be used is the National Building Agency, if we did not build ourselves.  We are providing houses ourselves but if it is a matter of the local authority providing houses, in order to remove soldiers from this priority queue and to place them, if not in the position of a person buying his own house with a building society loan, somewhere in between, it may well be that the administrative way to do it is via the National Building Agency.  I shall be addressing myself to this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley referred to decreases in the Book of Estimates.  The first thing I would do is to refer him to the net increase in the Book which is £3,939,000 and to the fact that in dealing with an Army there is a very high degree of expenditure on stores and that if you buy certain stores once, you do not have to buy them again.  As regards the helicopters, in relation to which he pointed to a decrease of £81,000, the position is that the helicopter fleet had been largely bought&mdash;we are now up to six&mdash;and we did not have to buy three more.  That, coupled with the fact that we have the stores, is the reason for that decrease, but we are <Col N="416" /> going to have one extra helicopter this year and we shall have to look then to whether a replacement need arises next year or whether we should have more.  We are going to have one more this year but the reason for the decrease is that we did not have to buy things this year which we bought last year.</P>
      <P>The same is true of naval stores, the main item being the final payment on the <i>Deirdre</i> which was made last year and had not to be made this year but no decrease in the work of the Naval Service has taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahCronin" hpid="Mr. Cronin Mr. Cronin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cronin</NameTxt>
      <P>That shows that the previous Government had done their job in providing all these things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I freely admit that the previous Government did some of their job.  That is as far as I would go and if the Deputy likes to come in I will give him all those answers again and, if he does not like it, he will have to &ldquo;lump it&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Subhead D was also a matter of comment by Deputy O'Malley.  The question here is one of accounting only.  The position is that in relation to the Reserve and its use for security reasons, the practice last year was, because nobody knew how much it would cost, to include a sum of £5 and then pass a Supplementary Estimate. That practice was followed last year and I have been provided with the figures by my Department.  In fact, apart from that figure, which will be the subject of a Supplementary Estimate, if the Reserve is used, and there is no doubt that it will be used, the amount involved in the Reserve Defence pay is almost exactly similar. So these three little political bubbles are burst.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy O'Malley's further contribution to the embarrassment of the Chair, I will not embarrass the Chair except to say that what he said in relation to it, he being not only a former Minister for Justice but a noted lawyer, was politically dishonest and when the matter is removed from the <i>sub judice</i> situation, this will be proved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="417" /> Deputy Kavanagh from Wicklow has some considerable knowledge obviously of the sea and he notes and takes heed of the things that happen. He adverted to two occasions when the Naval Service had to be removed from its ordinary duties for special duty.  One of these occasions was when the Aer Lingus Viscount was lost near Tuskar Rock.  During that time boats of the Naval Service had to be taken from their normal duty of fishery protection and policing our shores and brought there for the purpose of trying to retrieve the wreckage of the Viscount in order to find out what had gone wrong.  It was a great national need and something which had to be done, and this pinpoints quite clearly the need for a Naval Service but it also draws attention&mdash;and I am indebted to the Deputy for bringing it forward&mdash; to the fact that there are occasions and circumstances when such a service, like the Army, is a necessity and must be provided on the spot.  This is an example of an occasion, which is not <i>sub judice</i> or anything else, when the Naval Service had to be taken off its ordinary duties.  It pinpoints also the need for very careful examination of what size it should be, remembering always the extraordinary amount of money this takes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh was also quite well informed in relation to forest fires and as to some Army personnel having to leave their posts last week to go to a forest fire which had been extinguished on their arrival.  He mentioned the Army in relation to these incidents, and also civil defence people and the amount of work which they have done in Wicklow.  This is an obvious place where mountain climbers might get into trouble or where there might be forest fires.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor and Deputy Davern made the point that the FCA gratuity should be doubled.  When he is on duty a member of the FCA receives the same pay as a member of the regular force.  The gratuities payable to the FCA and An Slua Muirí were increased substantially on 1st January, 1971; the maximum rates at that time were doubled.  However, we must look into this matter.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="418" /> Deputy Hegarty and Deputy Kavanagh spoke about small fishery protection vessels.  I am advised that fishery protection vessels should have reasonable sea-going capabilities and the present vessels fulfil this requirement. The point was made that small vessels might have a local use but we cannot accept that they would be absolutely everything.  The water-line length of a boat will limit her speed. For fishery protection we have the <i>Deirdre</i> with a capable speed of 18 knots and our minesweepers have a capable speed of 14 knots.  This is sufficient to cope with the modern trawler.  It is necessary to consider the water-line length of the vessel and its sea-going capabilities and make a balanced decision.  I imagine that a detailed and expert examination might decide against the views of Deputy Hegarty and Deputy Kavanagh but this matter will have to be considered further.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies raised the question of married men not being allowed to join the Army.  At the moment those eligible for enlistment are the following: single men from 17 to 28 years; from 17 to 32 years, men, whether single or married, who have had three years satisfactory service with the FCA or An Slua Muirí and who have completed a training course of not less than seven days; up to 38 years, men, whether single or married, who have had previous satisfactory service in the permanent Defence Forces.  That is the present position; we will have to look into the matter but there are certain difficulties.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank all the Deputies who made contributions.  They have helped me greatly in my first weeks in office. I was gratified to see a comment in a national daily paper today to the effect that the necessity for security duties in the Army is more clearly known.  It is important that this be recognised.  At the moment our first and paramount necessity is to preserve a high level of security.  I am aware that this means that some people will have to work from 80 to 100 hours per week unless we can improve recruitment. It is not pleasant to have to say that.  I hope we will improve <Col N="419" /> recruitment but, on behalf of the Government, the House and the people, I wish to convey our thanks to these people who are doing long periods of duty, sometimes in inclement weather conditions and at great personal inconvenience.</P>
    <P>I wish to be clear about the matter of security duties in the Army.  They are in aid of the civil power.  There is a clear distinction and difference between the situation here and the situation of units of the British Army in the North of Ireland.  Their legislation has placed them in a different position. We are providing patrols and road blocks in conjunction with the gardaí. We are doing it in aid of the civil power and in a situation where the Garda authorities decide there is a necessity for that aid it is provided on request from the Garda.  That point must be emphasised.</P>
    <P>Now there is acceptance of the need for the Army.  Some 800 people have been killed and many thousands have been injured in this island in the past three years.  The Army must do its job and there is no desire or intention on the part of the Government to change that position.  I would appeal to people to see that recruitment continues and improves.  If young men give a small portion of their lives to the State in return for good training we will have a much better Ireland in the years to come.</P>

      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 10, 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by Dublin Corporation that the total number of families on their approved waiting list for re-housing, following the revision in November, 1972, was 4,805; that there were then 411 elderly persons or couples deemed by them to be in need of re-housing; and that it was estimated that 91 families would need to be re-housed because they would be displaced by statutory operations of the corporation. The total of these categories was 5,307. There were 1,694 three-person families included in this figure regarded as eligible for re-housing.  I understand that the corporation re-housed 709 families, or approximately 13 per cent of the 5,307 cases, in the four months between the revision of the list and 31st March, 1973.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation's current local authority programme comprises a total of 17,563 dwellings to be built or sites to be provided, including 2,031 dwelling schemes in progress, and 963 ready to be started or at tender stage.  They indicated, some time ago, to my Department that they aimed to complete a total of about 4,400 new dwellings within the two-year period 1973-74 to 1974-75.  With vacancies in the corporation's existing estate arising at about 1,100 per annum at present, the needs of the families at present on the approved list should be satisfied well within that period.  I will, of course, be making every effort to get the corporation to increase this output in line with the Government's plans for the general expansion of the housing programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>At 31st March, 1973, Dublin Corporation's housing programme comprised a total of 17,563 dwellings to be built or sites to be developed, including 2,031 dwellings <Col N="428" /> under construction, 4,904 dwellings at tender stage or various stages of planning, and 10,628 sites available or at acquisition stage.  This programme included 266 flats under construction, 717 flats at various stages of planning, of which 190 are at tender stage, and a further 741 flats for which sites have been acquired or listed for acquisition. I am informed by the corporation that they are continuing the investigation of centre city sites to accommodate an on-going programme of approximately 200 flats per annum.  Referencing is proceeding, for compulsory acquisition purposes, of a site in the City Quay area with a view to comprehensive development, including housing.</P>
      <P>In the Westland Row district, the corporation have a scheme of 70 flats approaching completion at Fenian Street and have submitted for confirmation a compulsory purchase order for a site at Holles Street/Hogan Place, on which they propose to erect 60 flats. In this area also a tender for the erection of 20 old-persons' flats at Power's Court has recently been sanctioned by me.  I understand from the corporation that they intend to take steps for the acquisition of a site at Ringsend for the erection of 96 houses and that plans are being prepared by them for a scheme of 42 flats at York Street.</P>

Some applicants from the Clondalkin area have been offered rehousing by the council in the Lucan area where a scheme of 277 houses has recently been completed.  Four dwellings have been provided for itinerants in Clondalkin.  The council have also provided a fully serviced caravan site at Mayfield, Clondalkin, which accommodates 54 families.  They intend to provide more similar sites as and when suitable land becomes available.</P>

From the information available to me at present it would seem that some cost economies have been achieved on larger schemes by continuity of operations, better organisation of production and more rapid completion.  These are economies which it should be possible to achieve in any properly organised large scale <Col N="433" /> building project.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 29 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>I fully appreciate the problems that increases in mortgage interest rates involve for borrowers from building societies.  However, since the societies borrow on a short-term basis and lend, generally, for periods of 20 to 25 years, they have no option but to offer to investors rates of interest which, at any time, can be expected to compete successfully for an intake of funds with banks and other commercial agencies. Where the rate of interest paid by the societies to investors rises, an increase in their mortgage rates can hardly be avoided.  The consequences for the societies, for their borrowers, for the housing programme and for employment in the building industry would be extremely grave if the interest rates payable by and to them were not allowed to move with general trends in the money market.  I should point out in this connection that the societies are now the principal source of private housing finance and that their contribution in this respect is crucial to the housing programme.  In 1972, for example, they advanced a total of £41 million for house purchase and approved loans for about 7,700 new and 4,500 other houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are determined, however, to take all available measures to prevent unjustifiable increases in mortgage rates and recently authorised me to inform building societies that the special taxation arrangements which are operated administratively by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to them will henceforth be available only to societies which charge a rate of interest on house-purchase loans that does not exceed the rate which I may specify from time to time.  The societies were informed on the 23rd March that, in the existing circumstances, the maximum <Col N="435" /> rate specified for this purpose was 10 per cent.</P>

      <P>First of all, the building societies have recently been in consultation with the Department, with my colleague the Minister for Finance and myself, and all of them, with the exception of one society, who since have agreed, are prepared to accept that it is all right, that 10 per cent is a reasonable rate to which to have interest rates tied.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if he will state, in view of the fact that building societies are not making loans available for the construction of houses, his plans to enable people whose income exceeds £1,800 to obtain a house building loan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The income and loan limits, which were introduced last July for local authorities' house-loans schemes, are amongst the aspects of housing which I am examining in consultation with my colleagues in the Government and meanwhile, I am keeping the situation in relation to the availability of house purchase loans from building societies under close review.  I would however, like to point out that in 1972 the societies advanced £41 million for house purchase and allocated loans to a total value of £67 million.  At the end of that year, <Col N="439" /> they had unpaid applications on hands amounting to about £41 million.  Unpaid applications with assurance companies and local authorities at the same date amounted to a further £25 million.  On the basis of these figures, it is reasonable to expect that total expenditure on house purchase loans in 1973-74 should exceed the expenditure of about £60 million on such loans in 1972-73.</P>

Seeing the Minister has already regretted that an alleged lack of planning is holding up the very laudable desire to provide houses&mdash;and this is something he cannot overcome in a year&mdash;would he not agree that if he brought in such a provision now it would enable him to allow people to build their own houses and that they would overcome this difficulty in a year if he increased the income limit to £2,200 and let those who are anxious to provide their own houses but are debarred from doing so by the present regulations go ahead and do so?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>In their 14-point plan announced before the recent general election the Government indicated their intention to remove health charges and local authority housing subsidies from the rates over a period of four years.  The Government have since announced their decision that for the local financial year 1973-74 local authorities need levy rates for health and local authority housing services equivalent to 75 per cent of the rates levied for these services in 1972-73.  The immediate effect of this decision is to transfer from local rates to central Government taxation a burden in the sum of £10.8 million which represents 25 per cent of the rates provision in 1972-73 for these services, and in addition the full increase in costs for these services arising in the current and future financial years.  One result of this is that instead of being faced with enormously increased rates in the present financial <Col N="443" /> year, ratepayers in most areas of the country will have less rates to pay than in 1972-73 and in many instances the reductions will be substantial.</P>

    <P>As from the 1st April, 1973, local authorities have been given responsibility for the planning and acceptance of tenders in schemes of 24 dwellings or less and for all rural cottages, demountable and pre-fabricated dwellings.  It was intended that this arrangement would be extended to schemes of up to 50 houses as from 1st April, 1974.  However, I have <Col N="445" /> directed that this further extension be made effective as quickly as administrative arrangements will allow during the present financial year.  All the existing statutory duties and responsibilities with regard to the allocation and management of their own dwellings and in relation to other dwellings in their areas remain with the authorities.</P>

      <P>The only answer I can give is that at least we are giving them more consideration than the Deputy's Government did because we considered the position and we found that we have no statutory authority to give such rates relief.  The Deputy who asked the supplementary question had many years to consider the matter and, if he was worrying about his constituents, he could have done it then if he thought it worth while.</P>

      <P>The improvement or augementation of a public water supply is a matter primarily for the appropriate local authority.</P>
      <P>A scheme to improve the supply to Birr was approved in principle by my Department in 1969.  Contract documents for the scheme were received from the local authority on the 6th April, 1973, and are at present under examination.</P>

To date, 48 grants to the value of £3,936 have been paid and arrangements are being made for the payment of a further 50 grants amounting to £4,100.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department's inspector will shortly complete a detailed examination of the design for this <Col N="452" /> scheme and proposes to consult Galway County Council.  When the design is jointly approved by my Department and the sanitary authority, the group will be advised to seek quotations for the supply of the necessary materials and the execution of the scheme.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say.  The proposal was originally received in July, 1971.  I am quite sure the Deputy will remember that.  He must have seen it going through.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>No progress was made until April, 1972, when an inspector, having failed to contact the original organiser, made contact with another member of the group, who was interested in obtaining a water supply.</P>
      <P>Following this discussion interested members of the group had a general meeting at which officers and a secretary and organiser were appointed.</P>
      <P>The new organiser immediately carried out a canvass of the area and inspector called on the area and completed a survey scheme.  The local inspector called on the organiser at the end of May&mdash;that would be May, 1972&mdash;and found that a survey of the catchment area of the proposed lake source was under way and that the location of the houses was being plotted on the ordnance survey map.</P>
      <P>Galway County Council were asked on 12th June, 1972, to take samples of the water for chemical and bacteriological analysis and, at the end of July, the group were advised that the results of the quality tests were satisfactory and in mid-August details of the lake catchment survey, togather with completed ordnance survey maps and surveys were received.

      <P>My concern in matters of roads policy is not limited to the road classifications refferred to in the question, but extends to all the public road networks including county roads.

Particular consideration is beging given to the needs of the heavily trafficked routes and to measures to relieve congestion in the urban areas.</P>
      <P>Where new roads are required, construction to motorway standards, with access restricted to certain types of motor vehicle, will be considered, where projected traffic flows indicate that this type of road would be the most efficient and economical.  Legislation will be necessary to empower local authorities to construct motorways, and the introduction of such legislation is being examined.</P>
      <P>The maximum permissible grant allocation, consistent with needs of other areas will be made to enable Dublin County Council to proceed with their roads programme, including improvements to the main approaches to the city and to important surburban routes, as well as new road construction to serve the developing housing areas west of the city.</P>

Practice in these areas is at present being reviewed and contact will be maintained with developments of interest in recycling. For example, the draft environment programme proposed for adoption in the EEC. provides for examination of various aspects of the waste problem and we will have the opportunity of taking part in that work and benefiting from the result.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 to 73 together.</P>
      <P>The first part of the reply to Question No. 71 is in the form of a tabular statement which, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The strength of the staff of the fire service in any county is a matter for consideration by the local authority concerned in the first instance.  The Department have been urging local authorities to intensify their work on fire prevention generally and has encouraged county councils to make additional appointments at the second fire officer level for the purpose as an interim measure.  The whole question of fire prevention, and the structure and staffing of the fire service, are among the aspects of the service which are being examined at present by a working party.  Decisions on any legislative or other changes needed to improve the service will be taken in the light of the working party's report.  My concern with fire matters relates fundamentally to the functions of local authorities and, in particular, to their responsibilities under the Fire Brigades Act, 1940. to make provision for dealing with fires and for the protection of persons and property from fire injury as well as to <Col N="463" /> certain related matters such as the new building regulations which are at present being prepared.  It does not extend to questions of insurance or compensation in respect of loss or injury from fire or to the issue of licences under the dance halls legislation. A committee set up by the Minister for Industry and Commerce is at present examining various insurance questions and I understand that their programme will include examination of fire insurance.</P>
    <P>In regard to the fire in Kilcormac in 1967, the Department do not normally hold investigations into <Col N="464" /> particular fire incidents: it is seen as the task of the local authority to take whatever steps may be necessary to clarify the circumstances of an outbreak. In this case it is understood that the hall was inspected by the local authority prior to the fire and that the local authority also examined the facts of the fire.  As I have explained, the organisation and operation of the fire service are at present being reviewed, and in the meantime local authorities are being urged to increase their fire prevention work and are being facilitated in strengthening their organisations for the purpose.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government if, in the interests of the fishing and tourist industries, conservation, planning and recreation and the control of pollution and coast erosion, he will assist Dublin County Council, by the secondment of staff if necessary, to implement its initiative for the organisation of an Irish Sea Area Conference on Nature to be attended by representatives of all local authorities, Irish <Col N="472" /> and British, whose areas are bounded by the Irish Sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The scope of the subject referred to in the Deputy's question is clearly such as to indicate that any discussion should be on inter-governmental or international level and it would not therefore be appropriate for a local authority to organise such a conference.</P>
      <P>Pollution seems to be the chief issue concerned and one affecting the other issues referred to also.  In this regard I may mention that action has already been taken and will continue to be taken as developments demand them. Examples of action taken to-date are:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Both Britain and Ireland have signed the Oslo Convention on the prevention of the Pollution of the Sea by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft.  This Convention applies to the Irish Sea.</P>
      <P>(b)  Ireland and Britain are taking part in the preparation of EEC environmental policy, which is expected to include, among the subject matter, marine pollution from coastal installations and outfalls.</P>
      <P>(c)  Ireland was represented at an international conference held in London in March to consider safety and pollution safeguards in connection with the development of mineral resources off the shores of north-west Europe.</P>
      <P>(d)  There have been informal discussions with British Departments in regard to the question of arrangements for dealing with oil pollution at sea.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, as the local authorities are the planning authorities also for the various areas of which they are in control, it is appropriate that the local authorities would be the people involved in such discussions rather than that they should be held at national level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not so agree. While local authorities must of necessity be very interested, it would be <Col N="473" /> ridiculous to suggest that each local authority should make its own arrangements because we would then have a situation where it might interfere with a national or international arrangement made at a later stage.  However, recommendations from local authorities to the Department concerned would help considerably at this stage.</P>

It was for this sort of purpose that the question was put down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not had an opportunity of studying what the medical officer of Hull said but I would say that this is another example of the fact that it is a matter for national or international action and not local authority action.</P>

      <P>An unmarried parent who has the custody and maintenance of his or her child obtains the same tax allowance for the child as a married parent obtains for his child.  In addition, an unmarried working mother is entitled to the &ldquo;housekeeper&rdquo; allowance of £100 in respect of a female person or relative engaged to care for the child. This allowance is available to a widowed person or separated spouse who is maintaining a child, so that in relation to child allowance or housekeeper allowance there is no difference under existing law between the treatment for tax purposes of an unmarried working mother, a working wife separated from her husband and a widowed parent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy has in mind investments made by the general public with building societies.</P>
      <P>As regards the amount distributed as interest to these investors, all the Irish societies have voluntarily entered into an administrative arrangement with the Revenue Commissioners under which each society pays income tax at an agreed composite rate-at present 70 per cent of the standard rate of 35p in the £-on distributions to individual investors whose investments do not exceed £5,000.  This composite rate is designed to produce the same amount of tax as if there had been no arrangement and both the society and those investors were charged to tax on the statutory basis and investors claimed repayment from the Revenue Commissioners of whatever income tax might be repayable to them.  On distributions to other investors the society pays tax at the standard rate.</P>
      <P>On 23rd March last, as the Minister for Local Government has said this afternoon, the Government decided that the special arrangement would henceforth be available only to societies which charge a rate of interest on house purchase loans that does not exceed a rate specified for the time being by the Minister for Local Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have no immediate proposals in this regard, I consider it desirable in principle that the public be given the opportunity of purchasing shares in our State-sponsored bodies.  The sale to the public of shares in State-sponsored concerns should not only encourage more private investment in this country, through widening the field of investment, but would also free State capital for other desirable purposes. An inhibiting factor, however is that many State-sponsored concerns operate primarily in the public interest in activities which tend not to produce sufficiently attractive profit records.  A further consideration is, of course, that safeguards would normally be essential to ensure that any organisation concerned continued to be operated in the public interest, particularly where a monopoly situation existed.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of his statements on inflation, he supports the EEC recommendations on farm prices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the Council of Ministers for Agriculture have now decided on farm prices for the current year.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in the negotiations in the Council of Ministers reflected the Government's anxiety to balance the opportunity of improvements in farm incomes with the equally important objective of controlling inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be quite wrong to infer, as the Deputy's question would appear to do, that there is a conflict of interest <Col N="484" /> between higher incomes for farmers and the welfare of consumers.</P>
    <P>Of the produce of Irish farms about 50 per cent is exported.  Forty per cent of the working population and their families are dependent on agriculture &mdash;25 per cent directly and 15 per cent indirectly in related industries and services.</P>
    <P>The latest year for which full figures are available shows that 40 per cent of the State's GNP is imported and 35 per cent is exported.  It is apparent, therefore, that the national interest requires that this country obtains the best possible prices for its exports in order that it may be in a position to pay for its imports, including the raw materials required for many manufacturing industries. The Deputy will appreciate that as the home market is already fully supplied, virtually all increased farm output will be exported.  Therefore, the community as a whole will benefit.  I think it is important that this basic fact be clearly understood.</P>
    <P>I might add that the final terms of the agricultural prices policy, in the negotiations for which the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries worked tirelessly and effectively, are such that the maximum benefit has been secured for Irish farmers with minimal cost to Irish consumers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is asking a separate question but I should not like to be discourteous to him in not replying at length.  I think he understands what has now been arranged with the EEC and he will appreciate that, when we are a party to the Common Market policy, we cannot make decisions as freely as we might have in the past.  This practice of subsidising exports of food has been going on for very many years.  I hope that with the course of time we may have a situation in which artificial intervention is not necessary.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, this country is committed to increasing its aid to developing countries in so far as resources permit.  We have undertaken a general examination of this question with a view to determining how our commitment can best be met.  I should, perhaps, explain that the target figure for 1975 of 1 per cent of GNP which was adopted by the United Nations in 1970 as part of the international development strategy for the 1970s refers to total aid, i.e. official and private.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the principal factors responsible for the deficit of £27.8 million projected for the financial year 1972-73 being reduced to £5.4 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was indicated by my predecessor in the 1972 budget statement that, to the extent that the budgetary measures would give rise to increased economic activity, there would be a consequential increase in revenue.  This additional revenue, in fact, materialised and, together with extra revenue arising from a higher rate of price inflation than expected and certain once-for-all receipts, substantially exceeded the comparatively small increase on the expenditure side, leading, in the outturn, to the reduction in the deficit originally estimated to £5.4 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that answer is not very satisfactory.  Surely the Minister could give me, at least <Col N="488" /> very roughly, an outline of the headings of revenue which are accounted for in the very considerable reduction in the projected deficit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is, as I am sure Members will recall, that from the Opposition benches last year we pointed out that the expansionary nature of last year's budget was likely to produce increased revenue of anything from £12 million to £14 million.  In the event the very expansionary nature of the budget produced this yield and that represents the most significant contribution towards the deficit.  Apart from the overall increase when you have such a large quantity of revenue coming from indirect taxes it is very difficult to identify the particular matters which yield the additional revenue.  In addition to the across-the-board increase there was a steep rise in consumption of the old reliables, beer, spirits and tobacco, so that they produced in themselves, and they can be so identified as producing in themselves, an increase in the overall revenue figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that expenditure by and large was within the limits projected and, in fact, the deficit was reduced because revenue was very considerably increased over and above what was estimated?  Is that the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  There was of course, also an increase in expenditure in the course of the year but it did not run ahead at a rate as fast as the increase in revenue.  This is the reason why the figure turned out at the figure it did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated in his reply that in the budget statement last year it was specifically stated that the consequences of the reflationary measures were not taken into account.  Would he agree that substantially the reduction of the projected deficit is a measure of the success of the efforts made in that budget to stimulate the economy which was specifically envisaged in the budget statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Colley can have it both ways.  One can <Col N="489" /> appreciate that his attitude has changed since he crossed the floor of the House but last year he was not prepared to acknowledge the contention of the then Opposition that the expansionary nature of the Budget would mean an increase in revenue of £12 million to £14 million.  Today he is asking me to acknowledge that he was right last year when he would not acknowledge that we were right in making that claim. When the Deputy was Minister for Finance last year he was not prepared to acknowledge that it would have that expansionary effect.  That is one aspect of it.  The other is the unusual and extremely high rate of inflation which is not a sensible way to try to balance your budget.  That, in fact, is what has happened.  The budget has been partially balanced by depending on an excessive rate of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is not correct in stating that the then Minister for Finance refuted the suggestion made.  If he refers to the reply he has just given us he will see that he refers to the fact that even in the budget statement last year I said specifically that there were measures being taken in the budget to stimulate the economy which would have the effect of increasing revenue.  He will find that is in the budget statement and I think it is in the reply he gave us today so how can he say I did not accept this?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Mr. R. Ryan Mr. R. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>I think we should recall that in addition to that particular sum, which is an alleviation in relation to last year, the Exchequer has also absorbed in respect of the year 1973/74 the total increase of those items over last year.  If the Exchequer was simply to have confined its relief to removal of all expenditure on these items on the local rates for last year, yes, it certainly would have been four times that amount but having got that sum you would have to add another £12 million.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance his intentions with regard to the restoration of Swords Castle, County Dublin, in view of the contribution of some £3,000 by the local preservation society towards this work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Swords Castle is in private ownership and is a national monument in the guardianship of the Commissioners of Public Works. Under the National Monuments Acts the commissioners have the duty of preserving and maintaining the castle but they are not empowered under these Acts to spend money on restoration works.  A sum of £1,000 has been contributed by Swords Progressive Preservation Society towards the cost of restoring the chapel and main entrance of the castle.</P>
      <P>As this amount falls far short of the total estimate for the proposed restoration works which is of the order of £15,000, and as the owner's consent to the works does not yet appear to have been obtained, no further action can be taken at present.</P>

To give an example, if one were to give £16 to each cow up to 20, and full stop there, that in itself would add an extra £1 million to the scheme.

    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if continental potatoes will have free entry to Ireland in the future and thereby help to (a) reduce the cost of living, (b) allow the Irish housewife access to new potatoes at an earlier date in the year, and (c) help maintain employment at Erin/Heinz factories; and, if not, why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is at present no common organisation of the market in potatoes in the EEC.  Even if there were, this country's plant health requirements would be maintained and we would not accept potato imports from any country, EEC or otherwise, which could not meet them.  Continental potatoes will not therefore have free entry to this country in the forseeable future.  These considerations would, of course, also apply to early new potatoes and to potatoes for processing.</P>
      <P>Normally we can produce sufficient potatoes for home consumption much more cheaply than can be done elsewhere and therefore it cannot be contended that imports from the Continent would help to reduce the cost of living &mdash;the reverse would probably be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The intention in establishing processing plants for potatoes and vegetables was to provide an outlet for home <Col N="511" /> grown produce and future policy in relation to imports of potatoes will be considered in this light.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The biggest factor in the increasing cost of living according to the official figures is the cost of potatoes, which are at least three times as dear as they were this time last year. Can the Minister give me any reason why he cannot import potatoes from European countries now, thereby helping to bring down the price and enable Irish housewives to get new potatoes at an earlier date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have, I think, answered the question fully.  The Deputy must appreciate that one of the reasons why potatoes are so dear this year is the poor price last year.  As a result of that poor price there was a substantial reduction in acreage with a consequent substantial reduction in yield.  Because potatoes were not giving a reasonable reward to the farmers the acreage has been dropping.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole reason for the shortage of potatoes is, as the Minister said, that there was a very bad price last year.  If a floor price were put on there would be plenty of potatoes at a lower price than in any country in the world.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 157, 158 and 159 together.</P>
      <P>I have reviewed the distribution of salmon net licences as issued under the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order, 1972, and I am satisfied that the existing order has proved to be unduly restrictive on some persons who entered salmon fishing in recent years.  Accordingly, I have made a further order widening the range of eligibility for salmon net licences in 1973.  The effect of this amendment order will be to ensure the issue of salmon net licences to the greatest extent practicable to persons who depend mainly on fishing for their livelihood.</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Parliamentary Secretary if the Board of Conservators were not required by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries when dealing with this matter of issuing licences to bear in mind the very important factor of the livings of the people involved?  Is the Parliamentary Secretary not further aware that in the last three or four years the increase in the number of drift net licences which were being issued had got out of control and that licences were being issued to people with other means of livelihood and that stocks of fish were, therefore, being threatened?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that this order merely states that licences will only be issued to people who held a salmon licence in any one of the years, 1968 to 1972, and who derive their livelihood mainly from fishing.  The type of person the Deputy has in mind will not get licences under this order.</P>

I eased the conditions to ensure that that class of person would now be included.</P>

      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 160 and 161 together.</P>
      <P>The information furnished to my Department to date by Boards of Conservators who have completed their allocation of fishing licences under the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order, 1972, indicates that the boards generally have operated the order in a fair manner, within the limits of the maximum numbers of licences prescribed in the order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in view of alleged irregularities, I have asked the boards to review licences already issued or allocated to ensure that the licences <Col N="519" /> concerned are fully qualified in accordance with the criteria of eligibility in the 1972 order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions which up to now governed the issue of fishing licences for the use of salmon nets in public fisheries in tidal waters are laid down in the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order, 1972, which provides that an applicant to be qualified for issue of a salmon net licence should (i) have derived a substantial part of his livelihood from fishing for salmon and (ii) have been the holder of the kind of licence sought or have been a regular member of a salmon fishing crew in the prescribed datum years, that is two out of the four years 1969-1972 in the case of the Galway, Connemara and Ballinakill fishery districts and three out of the five years 1968 to 1972 in the case of the remaining fishery districts.</P>
      <P>As to the second part of the question, a few irregularities appear to have taken place and these are being appropriately dealt with.  As to the final part of the question, I am satisfied that Drogheda Board of Conservators observed the conditions laid down in the order in allocating licences.</P>
