      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £270,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1974, for contributions to the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the United Nations, Intergovernmental Legal Bodies, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Development Aid (including a Grant-in-Aid) and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe; and for other expenses in connection therewith.</P>
      <P>The amount of this Supplementary Estimate added to the original Estimate agreed to by the Dáil on 9th May, 1973, represents a total provision of £796,000 in the Vote for International Co-operation for 1973-74.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1380" /> The Supplementary Estimate covers two new headings-Development Aid and the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, which were not included in the ambit of the Vote already adopted.  When I introduced the Estimates for my Department and for International Co-operation on the 9th May, 1973, I indicated the place which these new activities would occupy in achieving the basic foreign policy objectives of the Government. The provision for development aid contributes to achieving another basic objective, that of helping the Third World, thereby meeting our obligations and satisfying the desire of Irish people to play a constructive role in this sphere.  The Government in providing development aid to the Third World, aims to have a comprehensive and coherent programme which will show balanced growth in its various sectors and be consistent with achieving the greatest benefit for developing countries, particularly in fields where Ireland has a special interest or competence. The establishment of an interim agency to sponsor Irish persons wishing to serve on economic and social development projects in developing countries has been approved by the Government as a first step in the advancement of this new programme. The Minister for Finance, in his budget statement on the 16th May, 1973, informed the Dáil that he was making increased provision for development aid in the current financial year and that some of the increase would go towards the creation of such an agency.  The Supplementary Estimate provides £100,000 for this purpose and its adoption by the Dáil at this time will enable the interim agency to be formed and commence operations without further delay.</P>
    <P>The interim agency will finance activities in fields which have traditionally been serviced by private voluntary organisations and by private individuals.  It will sponsor the sending of Irish personnel to engage on projects required by Third World countries and acceptable to their Governments, whose responsibility for the economic and social development of their countries must at all times be respected.  The interim agency will <Col N="1381" /> itself decide on the projects it will support and the personnel it will sponsor for them but I would envisage that it will work through multilateral as well as bilateral channels. On the multilateral side I would expect that the interim agency might help in appropriate cases in servicing requests for personnel which my Department might receive from time to time from Governments in developing countries.  However, I believe that it will find its most interesting and rewarding work at a non-Governmental level&mdash;finding teachers, nurses, local administrators and so on for modest projects in smaller communities&mdash;and it is at this level its activities would be in the great tradition of Irish missionaries, lay as well as clerical of many denominations, and would be an appropriate point of departure for the new aid programme.</P>
    <P>As far as the form of agency which I propose to establish is concerned, it had been my hope that the private voluntary organisations which have traditionally been engaged in this work in developing countries would undertake to form a central agency themselves with an assurance that Government funds would be available to them to supplement in a substantial way their activities in this particular field.  Because of the number of interested organisations it has not yet been possible for them to form an agency of this kind.  The Government have, therefore, taken the initiative to establish an interim agency as a State-sponsored body financed by a Grant-in-Aid to undertake activities connected with the sponsorship of temporary service by Irish workers on development projects in the Third World.  It is inevitable that a Statesponsored body in this field will operate under tighter Government control than might appear desirable to the voluntary organisations which it hopes to assist.  It will, however, actively seek to encourage the voluntary organisations to create a private agency to replace it at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the second aspect of development aid covered by the Supplementary Estimate, the provision for <Col N="1382" /> disaster relief in developing countries. The purpose of making provision under this heading is to have funds at the Government's disposal to give assistance for the relief of distress resulting from man-made or natural disasters in developing countries.  It is essential that the Government should be in a position to respond rapidly to requests for assistance to relieve the victims of such disasters.  This can best be done by voting funds in advance from which such requests can be met as they arise. The practice hitherto has been that on each occasion on which the Government wished to respond positively to an appeal for assistance, it was necessary to introduce a Supplementary Estimate. The arrangement proposed should also facilitate the early transfer of funds made available for relief purposes.  Senior international officials associated with emergency relief operations have repeatedly drawn attention to the failure of national administrations to follow-up pledges promptly by the transfer of funds into the appropriate account.</P>
    <P>During the period 1968 to date Ireland provided a total of £400,000 for victims of distress.  These funds were voted by way of Supplementary Estimates. Requests have recently been received for assistance for disaster relief in a number of areas.  The Government wishes to be in a position to respond quickly, on the basis of need, to such appeals.  Therefore, I propose to make provision for disaster relief in the Vote for my Department on a continuing basis, commencing this year.  Funds thus provided would be used for the purpose of making contributions and/or payments to intergovernmental agencies and other bodies and to individual governments for the relief of distress.  I propose to provide £100,000 for this purpose during the current financial year.  This sum would come out of the £1.5 million for development aid announced by the Minister for Finance in the course of his budget statement.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the second heading in the Supplementary Estimate, the provision for the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. I have already said in this House on <Col N="1383" /> the 9th May that the first of the basic objectives of Irish foreign policy is to help maintain world peace and reduce tensions between super-powers, blocs and states.  This conference, which is the first of its kind to be held in Europe, will, it is expected, contribute greatly towards this end. Several months of careful work have preceded the conference during which it was sought to establish whether there was the measure of agreement among states to make the holding of a conference feasible and desirable. This work took the form of multilateral preparatory talks held in Helsinki at ambassadorial level.  Ireland participated fully in these talks.  Their successful conclusion on the 8th June and the recommendations agreed on with regard to the agenda, scope and organisation of the conference give good grounds to believe that the conference will mark a real step forward in reducing tension among the participating states and promoting <i>detente</i> on our continent.</P>
    <P>The topics to be dealt with at the conference include questions relating to security in Europe, economic co-operation, co-operation in humanitarian and other related fields, and the possibility of a follow-up to the conference.  The subjects to be discussed under the security item of the agenda will include principles guiding relations among states, a proposal for the peaceful settlement of disputes and a limited number of measures designed to reduce tension in the military sphere and directed mainly at the members of the two military alliances.  The economic item will include co-operation in the fields of commercial exchanges, industry, science, technology and the environment. The third item of the agenda relates to freer movement of people and ideas in Europe, and increased cultural and educational exchanges. The fourth agenda item allows for the examination of measures to give effect to decisions reached at the conference and to continue its work.  Ireland, together with our EEC partners, believes that this agenda provides a sound basis for a conference which <Col N="1384" /> achieve the objectives I have already mentioned.  Other western states share this viewpoint.</P>
    <P>The conference will be held in three stages, the first and last in Helsinki and the second in Geneva.  The first and third stages are expected to be quite short, but the second stage will last some months&mdash;exactly how long is not known.  It is not, therefore, possible to estimate precisely the cost of the conference, although on the basis of available data the approximate projected cost has been estimated at £4,700,000.  Ireland's percentage contribution has been assessed at 0.6 per cent which would amount to approximately £30,000.  In addition, a further sum, at present estimated at about £40,000, will be required to meet the travel and subsistence expenses of our delegation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister introduced his main Estimate some time ago I indicated that under these particular headings he would have the full support of the Opposition.  I refer in particular to the programme for development aid and also to the provision for disaster relief.  The Minister's decision to establish what he called a State agency will have the full support of this side of the House. Obviously it is a matter a Government must consider.</P>
      <P>If I have any slight objection to the Minister's approach it is with regard to his previous speech where there was the implication that this was a matter that touched the conscience of the present Government only, that the previous Government had not given it any consideration or made any plans. For that reason, I should like some details from the Minister regarding the exact composition of the agency.  He has told us it will be an interim agency, a semi-State agency. I should like to know what type of personnel will be recruited to advise the agency and what kind of people will be on the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have in mind the fact that the previous Government had continuous discussions with the chairman of SFADCO, a man who has proved in his achievements in that area that he and those associated with him are <Col N="1385" /> eminently suitable to activate the best interests of those working with them and also to activate the commitment of the Irish people in this area.  I do not know if the Minister has had an opportunity of continuing those discussions. Significantly, the agency he has in mind is a semi-State agency and it appears there would be considerable benefits from consultations with the chairman of SFADCO and those who have been engaged in surveys in this area.  I should like to know if the Minister has considered this point.  No doubt he is aware that the chairman of SFADCO in recent years undertook a very extensive tour in Africa and the Far East and, having regard to our experience in developing our own resources with limited capital, personnel and know-how, he assessed how we could translate this by way of a semi-State agency to the benefit of the developing countries.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to be more precise about these points in his reply.  There are many State agencies.  Much will depend on the direction, the vision and the commitment of the people who will head the agency proposed, otherwise our good intentions will come to nought.  Of course, our good intentions must be backed up by actual experience in the field and also by a commitment of the type given by the people I have referred to already.  These people showed an interest in translating their experience to the benefit of the developing countries at a time when it was not fashionable to do so.</P>
    <P>I understand discussions had taken place between the Minister for Finance and people in the Department on the financial provisions necessary to fund a programme of this kind.  I am glad the Minister has been able to translate it into a proposal, although at this stage it is not as precise as we would wish.  However, perhaps there are reasons for this.  The Minister may be engaged in consultations but I should like some clear indications from him on the matter.</P>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate will have our full support.  That support can be confirmed from the attitudes <Col N="1386" /> we adopted and the programmes and examinations we undertook in the previous Government.  I hope the Minister will not imply that it is only now these matters have emerged and that it is this Government who have developed a belated social conscience.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said that the agency will sponsor the sending of Irish personnel to engage in projects required by Third World countries and which are acceptable to their Governments. It is very important that they should be acceptable.  From time to time much of the relief given to underdeveloped countries or to disaster areas to a certain extent was given to satisfy the demands the assisting country understood the country in need to have and on occasions there have been clashes between the country in need and the country providing assistance. From the point of view of the psychological reaction of the country being assisted there is a need to have active consultation; otherwise the donor country's ideas of what would suit could offend rather than assist.  A small country like Ireland operating through an agency as proposed by the Minister could work fruitfully.  It is not merely a question of giving money.  The energy that can be activated, the spirit of co-operation and understanding that can be promoted, will be the real proof of what such a programme can achieve.</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed to what has been achieved by our missionaries, lay and clerical, nurses, doctors, teachers and many others.  What they have achieved in the countries they have worked in is out of all proportion to the money spent.  The sense of pride which they have engendered in the people with whom they worked, the confidence which is so vital to a developing country, and the co-operation any man is entitled to expect from his fellowman, are vital.  They will accomplish much more than money that is simply applied in the terms of the &ldquo;Ugly American&rdquo; of years ago.  For that reason, I welcome the indication of the Minister that this will be done only in full co-operation and consultation with the Governments concerned.  It is up to the agency itself to decide on the projects it will support and the personnel <Col N="1387" /> it will sponsor but I would sound a warning to the Minister here that in this we may sometimes have to accept the views of the countries we are assisting even against the best judgment of our own advisers and of this Agency as to the priorities which they feel need to be adopted in any particular case.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned that there are a number of interested organisations in this area.  Here again, it is important that guidelines would be established as soon as possible for this agency.  Anybody familiar with community activities at any level in this country at present will see that if there is a constant pattern throughout the country it is the lack of co-ordination between various associations whose aims in many cases are directed to the same ends.  Whether one considers youth welfare, care of the aged or care of the handicapped or deprived, you find many different organisations with absolutely boundless energy and commitment working separately towards the same end.  This gives rise in many cases, even in small towns, to a dissipation of resources and a lack of co-ordination and clear programming. One cannot always put a clearly defined limit to the energies of human beings in this area but I suggest that now is a time, particularly when this agency is being established, when the need for co-ordination here should be clearly established.  Otherwise, we can dissipate financial and personnel resources and co-ordination and discipline, which are so vital to a programme of this type, could be lacking.  The overall direction which could come from an agency like this, which I greatly welcome, could also be absent.</P>
    <P>What I might call the enthusiastic &ldquo;do-gooders&rdquo; must be watched carefully in this connection; otherwise the potential which this agency has may be dissipated through a lack of overall plan and control.  The people to whom I referred earlier have every experience &mdash;I refer particularly to SFADCO&mdash;of forming that type of overall programme and harnessing that type of commitment.  They have proved this in many ways through their voluntary activities which they later channelled <Col N="1388" /> into full-time professional promotion of everything from banquets to cottage schemes.  It is that translation from the voluntary to the professional that one would hope would emerge in an agency of this type.</P>
    <P>In that connection I hope the Minister at a fairly early stage can give us a clear indication of the composition of the board of the agency, of who will be represented on it and how it can be hoped that it would effect this overall programming of the various voluntary activities of those concerned in this type of assistance.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the second aspect of this Supplementary Estimate, the provision for disaster relief in developing countries, particularly as the Minister has pointed out that disasters have a habit of occurring suddenly and the need arises sometimes before the money can be made available.  It is a very practical suggestion that the reserve fund of £1,000 in this instance should be on stand-by in the event of our being able to make, as I take it in this case, a direct financial contribution rather than through the agencies available to us internationally.  While generally disasters in our minds have an association with great tragedies happening suddenly you can also have disasters that are constant and chronic and whose presence we can see because they are always with us.</P>
    <P>Last week I asked a question of the Minister&mdash;unfortunately, I was not here for his reply but I was gratified by his reply to it&mdash;in regard to famine conditions brought about by the constant drought in West African countries. That condition has existed there for the past two years but possibly because it has not resulted from a major war such as we had in Bangladesh and Vietnam, it did not arouse the conscience of the world to the same extent. Disasters are nonetheless as critical&mdash;and in many ways even more so&mdash;when they arise from natural causes which are constant and chronic. One need only think in terms of places like Calcutta and other parts of India and areas like West Africa.  I do not think the Minister need, or that he intends to confine his assistance in this area, or regard himself as being <Col N="1389" /> confined, to the common connotation of disaster relief even though it may not be the connotation which those engaged in that work put upon it.  The Minister should keep constantly in mind, through an agency such as the one he intends to establish, through the association we have with the international agencies, how this country can, where necessary, help by direct financial assistance&mdash;which I think would be the least significant part&mdash; and personnel assistance in what would otherwise be termed disaster areas.</P>
    <P>The final element in this Supplementary Estimate is the conference which has been known as the Helsinki Conference although, as the Minister pointed out, the second and major stage of the conference will take place in Geneva.  We are all pleased to see the <i>detente</i> which has been emerging in Europe particularly, especially since Willi Brandt's initiative in the <i>ostpolitik.</i> We all know what divisions can cause in any country and we know, when those divisions extend beyond the confines of the country, the effect they can have on countries associated with the divided country. This in many ways has been at the base of the European problem, the division of Germany, and the fact that the Chancellor has taken the initiative that he has taken which demands, as all such initiatives must, a generosity and a new approach, has certainly created a condition where this conference on security and co-operation in Europe can take place and bring about meaningful results.  We are a party to it and we shall obviously be affected by the results of it for good or evil.  We all confidently hope that it will be for good because the terms of reference of the conference are framed in that direction.</P>
    <P>Our contribution can be made not in the sense of assuming the role of advising the Germans, the French, the Russians, the Rumanians, or the Poles, but in showing that we support any programme which will lessen the tensions between those countries and then lessen the tensions between the major powers.  I refer, in particular, to the third item on the agenda which <Col N="1390" /> relates to the freer movement of people and ideas in Europe, and increased cultural and educational exchanges.  Many of us know that tension and fear derive from ignorance more than anything else.  Our own little country has proved this very conclusively over a long period and, unfortunately, in one part is proving it more every day.</P>
    <P>The tensions between east and west derive, by and large, from the same source.  The self-righteousness of the attitude of one bloc or country in its own area is matched only by the self-righteousness of the other bloc or country in its area.  When a division occurs due to a major international upheaval such as the last world war &mdash;and that is very much at the base of the problems which this conference will face&mdash;obviously there are serious problems of human understanding to be overcome.  Those problems are still very active and in many ways are being aggravated in areas where they should not be aggravated.</P>
    <P>I cannot help remembering the atmosphere at the Munich Olympics last year when, despite the best wishes of sportsmen, in many ways amongst many of the European countries directly concerned in this area, sport became an agency of what can honestly be described as political domination, or political superiority. That is not the type of communication between people which is intended to be promoted in the third item of this agenda.  You must have goodwill. Young people are the ones who communicate and who move around from one country to another most readily, and who can break out of the shell which surrounded us in the past into new attitudes in the future.  They will achieve very positively in their own time what these conferences attempt to do.</P>
    <P>I have expressed reservations about direct diplomatic representation with some countries, not on the basis of principle, but simply having regard to the realities of the limitation on our resources.  I will continue to express those reservations.  When any such proposals are before the House I hope the Minister and I can discuss <Col N="1391" /> them in a positive and realistic way. I would suggest that student exchange programmes between east and west, between the countries of eastern Europe and western Europe, which are lacking at this time, could do a great deal to lessen tension.  Armies, whatever forces they represent, are there simply as a presence to indicate a commitment, as has been proved in this country, and sometimes to guard against an uprising.  Armies will not solve these problems.  They will be solved by the commitment of the people themselves directly involved. There is great scope&mdash;and this country is in a strong position to do something about this&mdash;for effecting communication between the students of Europe and the students of the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>At this time&mdash;and this is one of the sad things&mdash;there are two different world youth organisations operating which are not directed at lessening the tension which exists between east and west, or any other part of the globe, but to maintaining them, and to maintaining the supremacy of the groups involved.  There are two groups known as CENYC which represents, roughly, the western youth associations and WAY, which stands for the World Assembly of Youth, as far as I know, and represents the east European associations.  So far as this conference has talked in terms of increased culture and education exchanges, this is an area to which it could give some serious thought.  It is an area with which the Council of Europe have been concerned for a little while, and with our own National Youth Council are greatly concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposals this morning have the full support of the Opposition.  I should like the clarification I have asked for in connection with the nature of the board of the agency to which he referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanCoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to commend some aspects of this Supplementary Estimate.  On the question of assistance to the Third World, we have all seen the picture on our television screens of the poor old woman going <Col N="1392" /> 14 miles for a drop of water.  We cannot envisage that because we are surrounded by water.  We should not let this occasion pass without paying tribute to those voluntary organisations who have done so much.  I should not like Civil Service red tape and green tape to creep in.  I agree with the previous speaker that the experience of those who have served in these fields should be utilised.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second aspect of development aid covered by the Estimate in connection with disaster relief in developing countries, great work has been done by voluntary organisations.  Again, it is only right and proper that we should commend this work and not let this occasion pass without paying tribute to those who have contributed so much. Voluntary effort has done a great deal in this country to achieve our freedom.  Now that we have our freedom, are we going to sweep aside this voluntary effort and say : &ldquo;Let the State take over&rdquo;?  That is where the real disaster will arise.  Charity should come from the heart, and we should not leave it to the State which is a heartless piece of machinery.  I commend very highly the work involved in this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Deputy O'Kennedy for his support for what we are trying to do here.  I know there is no divergence between us on this.  He seems to feel that, in pressing ahead in this way, and in some of the things we may have said about pressing ahead in this way, we were suggesting a divergence between us and the previous Government. To some extent this is true. There is not a divergence of approach or attitude but we have, in fact, pushed ahead more rapidly than the tempo of events over the last couple of years in this sphere.  I found when I came into office on the question of this interim agency for personal service abroad, that it had been batted backwards and forwards for 18 months at official level without any great sign of Government involvement to break the deadlocks which had grown up.  I applied my mind to dealing with it and having a decision <Col N="1393" /> taken on it straight away.  It is fair to say that we have given a somewhat higher priority to it than the previous Government in that respect.</P>
      <P>We have also increased vastly the amount of development aid.  Much of this is due to our EEC obligations. Let us be clear about this.  We would have had to increase our development aid this year from £750,000 in the previous financial year to £1,250,000 because our EEC obligations required that.  The Government could have pursued the policy previously adopted of minimising expenditure.  In the previous year it had been cut-back from £850,000 to £750,000.  We could have pursued that policy and said that a two-thirds increase imposed by EEC membership is enough, instead of which we went beyond that to double the original sum of £750,000 to £1,500,000, leaving an extra £250,000 over and above the obligations imposed on us by membership to be available to us to make use of in additional forms.  One of the forms has been to set up this agency.  Another aspect is the question of disaster relief. We have, therefore, shown that we are giving particular priority to it. We cannot reasonably compare the performance of a Government which doubles the expenditure with that of the previous Government which reduced the expenditure by 10 per cent during the previous year.  There is not a difference in policy, but there is a difference in priority and emphasis. In fairness, that must be said because I think that political lights should not be hidden under bushels, nor should claims be made which are not correct. I will not go beyond making that minimal statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the agency, my view was that this is an area in which it is best to devolve responsibility as much as possible.  At the same time, the Government must have some say in the disposal of public money abroad in circumstances which could give rise to embarrassment.  It seemed that the best approach to this was to make some arrangement under which we would provide financial assistance to expand activities of the kind we are <Col N="1394" /> talking about here on terms that would ensure that the money would not be spent in a way that could be politically embarrassing, like spending it in a country where there is good reason for not wishing to have political involvement or where, more probably, in that particular country the government there did not want that particular kind of aid.  We must avoid embarrassment of that kind.</P>
    <P>It seemed to me, contrary to some of the views expressed, that it is best achieved by not having tight Government control in the form of Government appointments or Civil Service representatives on the board, but by giving clear terms of reference to the body to be established saying that the money must be spent in countries which exclude any country which the Government might wish, for some particular reason, to exclude at a particular time, and that the aid must be spent in ways which will be acceptable to the Government concerned. That has been laid down as a condition of the grant-in-aid.  It did not seem to me that further Government control was desirable.  On the contrary, what I would have liked would have been to provide this money in the form of a grant-in-aid to a voluntary agency established by the voluntary bodies concerned which they themselves would partly finance.</P>
    <P>The Government would generously supplement the financial provisions to these agencies.  The number of agencies involved is significant.  They operate in different ways.  Although I made this offer to them, they did not find it possible to establish a voluntary body and to plough part of their funds into such a body so that the Government would be in a position of merely supplementing generously the voluntary contributions.  That is a possibility for the future.  The reason why this agency is described as an interim agency is that we are asking it as part of its job to abolish itself as soon as possible.  If we can persuade the voluntary agencies to operate on a basis of contributing part of their own resources to a fund which we will supplement, the need for a Government agency would disappear and we <Col N="1395" /> could simply make a grant-in-aid to a private agency.</P>
    <P>It seemed to me, on balance, that we could not justify providing the total finance for an entirely private agency.  It is one thing to supplement the resources of such an agency several times over, not even pound for pound, but more than that, but it is not easy to justify providing the total financial support for a private agency where no money is being put in at all.  This was one of the problems to be faced.  We decided, therefore, that the best thing to do when the private agencies did not feel able to agree on such an arrangement at this stage was to establish an interim agency that would distribute the money until such time as, with their encouragement, the voluntary bodies concerned established a voluntary agency of their own and put enough resources into it to make it viable.  We could then plough our money into it and get out of the act.  So long as we can lay down the basic conditions which I have mentioned there is no advantage in having the Government involved and there may be possible disadvantages.</P>
    <P>This Government believe in the devolution of authority as much as possible to voluntary agencies where they are well-equipped to do a job.  In pursuit of that policy I adopted the approach I mentioned in this matter. We are now establishing this agency.  I will have to appoint the members of the board.  At the moment I am not in a position to name the people, because until the House passes this Estimate it would be inappropriate to invite people to be members of the board.  I know whom I intend to invite.  The board should be composed of people representing the interested bodies which are currently responsible for sending people abroad and for financing people sent abroad.  The board should include representation from the trade unions and public interests generally.  There should be representation of people who, although not directly involved in one of these organisations, have, nevertheless. shown themselves really interested in this whole question.  They should be given a part.  There should <Col N="1396" /> be some representation from Northern Ireland from people concerned or engaged there in similar activities.  Perhaps we could learn something from them and fruitfully co-operate with them.</P>

      <P>In view of the composition of the board, which seems to be pretty embracing as indicated now, is the Minister not a little concerned about the employer organisations and possibly the farm organisations.  Such boards have a habit of being balanced.  Perhaps this board would be ungainly.  Would the Minister not be better advised to confine membership of the board to those directly involved?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It need not be ungainly. It should have a trade union representative in view of the trade unions' interests.  We have to consider other economic interests.  We are not expecting the board to negotiate a wage round.  I do not think the board will be ungainly.  The number of organisations involved is only six or seven.  Representing them does not start with such a large nucleus that you have to have a large board to balance it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get into the question of the particular bodies.  It is, in fact, one of the bodies engaged in this kind of work.  I do not want to say more about that at the moment.  There must be a balancing between the particular interests and the public interest expressed in a number of different ways.  That is what we have in mind at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that the difficulty has been to get the agencies involved to operate themselves and he sees this interim agency operating until such time as they can speedily move out.  It would seem to be desirable at this stage to get a State body with personnel of the type I mentioned directing the energies of these agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the next point I was coming to.  There is need <Col N="1397" /> for co-ordination and overall direction and discipline.  I agree about the need for co-ordination.  It would be wrong that Government money should be used to assist two different groups to be in conflict with each other in an area in any way.  The value of having this agency is that some measure of co-ordination will flow from it.  I do not think words like &ldquo;direction&rdquo; and &ldquo;discipline&rdquo; are appropriate where you are dealing with voluntary agencies which are each imbued with enthusiasm, which gives value to a project and makes it successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When I use these words, I speak of direction and discipline in the broadest sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept them as defined as being similar to co-ordination. If this agency is deploying Government funds to help the different bodies who are concerned in this kind of work, then obviously, in doing that, it will be in a position to and will naturally wish to ensure a certain co-ordination and an avoidance of overlap. Indeed, there is merit on those grounds alone in having such an agency even if it were not thought to be necessary as a channel for Government funds.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy has not raised an issue which has been raised by others with me, that is the question whether it is appropriate to put so much emphasis on voluntary service abroad at this time, whether this is the right way to approach development aid.  The answer to this is a little complicated.  Personal service abroad is a diminishing proportion, perhaps, of total world development aid, and as developing countries do develop they become better able to cope with their own personal requirements, and there is a certain phasing out of the assistance given by people of other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a broad and general trend, but this country has such a small development aid programme at the moment and the enlargement of it is such a big job ahead that we cannot really look at it as being a balanced programme in line with the world pattern <Col N="1398" /> and one which should in its development immediately follow the world pattern.  We have to get our programme to a point where it bears some resemblance to the kind of scale of programme that there ought to be for a country at our stage of development and with our resources.  Within the general framework of a broad reduction in the role of the voluntary service in developing countries, there is room, at this stage, for a short-term expansion of its activity in the Irish case which, even when it takes place, will still leave our personal service activity relatively small when compared with other countries.  Therefore we are deliberately and consciously, if you like, going against a world trend.</P>
    <P>There is also the fact that we have resources of people rather than resources of wealth in Ireland.  We have this tradition of service abroad, a great willingness to help in this way. In certain areas we also produce rather more professional talent than we can absorb at home; some of it has to emigrate permanently.  For example, we have a surplus of doctors, whereas many developed countries have a desperate shortage of doctors, The particular situation in which we find ourselves, having a relative surplus of trained personnel, in some areas and having a very small development aid programme, justifies, I think, our going against the general trend in establishing this agency to develop our personal service to a level at which it may, in relative terms, become less important in our aid programme in the years that follow.  One can visualise a doubling of activity and that then that might, as a share of our total aid programme, tend to diminish as time goes on, although in absolute terms it might increase slowly.  I mention that because this is an aspect of the matter which has been drawn to my attention, and I would not want the House to think we are not conscious of the fact that what we arc doing runs to some degree against the world trend.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coogan referred to the desirability of avoiding red tape.  He said that charity comes from the heart <Col N="1399" /> and the State is a heartless institution. He was perhaps a little harsh on the State.  The State, after all, consists of people in Government, of people in Parliament and people in the public service, who have hearts that can display themselves through public policy at times.  Of course he is right in the sense that the whole system of administration of a State is not designed to cope adequately with the enthusiasm of people in seeking to serve, for example, in developing countries abroad.  The less red tape the better, and the less this is a State enterprise the better.  As I said already, that is the approach of the Government to it, and it is with some reluctance we have been forced back to establishing temporarily a State enterprise but one which will be certainly free of red tape and which will be, I hope, able to operate speedily and effectively and do the job to be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy raised the question of the Chairman of SFADCO.  I know he has been interested in these matters, having had considerable experience there.  That is something which I am bearing in mind, but I do not want to go beyond that at present.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have the support of the House on the question of disaster relief.  It has been a problem previously that we have had to go and get the authority of the House to assist in a disaster which often occurred suddenly; not always&mdash;the Deputy is perfectly right in saying that there are some continuing disasters which need assistance, but sometimes the position aggravates very rapidly indeed.  This House might be in recess, or even in session, and there might be difficulties in getting down to discuss a matter of this kind.  It is right we should have some money set aside which can be deployed immediately without having to come back to this House for detailed support, although the House must approve the total sum and the general principles in distributing it and it must be in a position to debate afterwards the Government administration of the sum of money involved.</P>
    <P>The need for this has been highlighted by the present situation in the <Col N="1400" /> southern part of the Sahara Desert.  It came very much to my attention when at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the EEC&mdash;not this one but the previous one some weeks earlier&mdash;a request was put forward by the Commission not merely for money to provide economic relief and to buy the particular form of foodstuffs needed but also for immediate assistance in getting the first cargoes of it out there by air.  Six aircraft were needed urgently for that purpose.  It did prove possible in that instance to go ahead rapidly with the provision of the aircraft; incidentally one of the six aircraft that flew out there was an Aer Lingus aircraft.  However, I can see from the situation that arose that we could be in a position of not being able to act quickly enough in certain circumstances in the provision of money, and it does seem right that we should be more flexible in this matter.</P>
    <P>The EEC itself is, in fact, thinking in these terms.  At the Council of Ministers meeting last Monday this question came up again in relation to the Sahara problem.  There are difficulties about co-ordination.  The European Commission sought and secured authority from the Council of Ministers to undertake a co-ordinating role in the area.  There has been a lack of co-ordination so far.  I did mention at the Council of Ministers' meeting that, at the EEC level also, we should have resources available which could be deployed rapidly without waiting for a Council of Ministers' meeting.  Therefore the same principle of rapid action in an emergency is being considered, at our suggestion, at the EEC level as it is being considered here in the House at this moment.</P>
    <P>The Helsinki Conference starts on Tuesday next, and that is why I was anxious to get the Supplementary Estimate through the House so that it would be approved before the conference starts.  There has been a preparatory period of some months and Ireland has been represented there, not at Ministerial level but at Civil Service level.  I must tell the House that the work we have done there has been fruitful.  One of the things to which we have contributed particularly is the location of the final stage of the conference. <Col N="1401" /> There were doubts as to whether it would go back to Helsinki for the final, formal stage of approval of what has been settled.  It was our opinion that, in view of the initiative taken and the work put in by Finland in the matter and the fact that the conference was opening there, it was proper that it should also end there and that the full credit for it should go to the country that mainly sponsored it.  I think that our effort had something to do with the fact that the decision was eventually taken that the final stage should be at Helsinki.</P>
    <P>We were also actively concerned that the issue of religious freedom should be placed on the agenda.  This is something that the Holy See was concerned about.  It has, in fact, been placed on the agenda with our support.</P>
    <P>The other area to which the Irish delegation has contributed notably in all the preparatory period has been in persuading the conference to move away from the concept of immutability of frontiers, which was being pressed by the Soviet Union, to a concept of inviolability of frontiers.  This we regard as important not merely because of our own domestic situation. The frontier between North and South is one which should not be violated by violence&mdash;on that, this Government and the Opposition are, of course, united&mdash;it does not mean that it should be immutable.  The principle of immutability of frontiers takes no account of the fact that times change and people change with them and that frontiers that at a certain moment may seem desirable may by mutual agreement cease to be relevant at a certain point in time.  We have pressed strongly for the replacement of the concept of immutability with that of inviolability.  We have had the support of other countries in this matter and that has now been accepted by the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>We have not been without influence in the preparatory stages of the conference in a number of ways, although, of course, the main initiative has come from elsewhere and our role must necessarily in this, as in other matters of world politics, <Col N="1402" /> be a small one.  We hope the conference will be a success.  The opening session may now be of shorter duration than was originally envisaged.  If this is correct it would suggest a greater degree of consensus about some of the issues than had, perhaps, been anticipated and it may well be that the conference may not run for more than next week or, if it does run into the following week, it may not run very far into it at ministerial level.  The issues which then will have been debated and the broad indications of policy which will then have been given will have to be translated into practical terms at the second stage of the conference.  We do not know how long that will take but it will probably last into the next year but some time, hopefully in the early part of next year, the conference will be able to reach agreement.</P>
    <P>It remains to be seen how much will come from it.  Like so many steps in world affairs it is probably a small one but a small one in the right direction. The very fact that it is taking place is an indication of a different disposition between the different blocs.  It is almost a symbolic ending of the cold war but that does not resolve many of the issues.  Of course, the Helsinki conference is only concerning itself with security up to a certain point.  It is not concerned with military matters except to a very limited degree in trying to ensure against misunderstandings and notification of manoeuvres and things of this kind.</P>
    <P>The real military issues of a reduction in forces are being discussed and will be further discussed after the Helsinki conference and we hope brought to a useful conclusion, under other auspices than the NBFR talks. Of course, there are also the SALT talks between the Soviet Union and the United States on the question of atomic weapons.  The fact that at three different levels these issues of relations between east and west are being pursued constructively is something which we certainly must welcome.</P>
    <P>Helsinki is only a small part of this. It is the only part we can participate in because the other discussions are <Col N="1403" /> taking place between military blocs. of which we do not form a part.  I must say I am glad that it is a forum on which as a non-member of a military bloc we, none the less like other countries, Sweden and Switzerland, can play a part, a part which is unusual in that we are the one member of the EEC which is not a member of any political alliance.  We hope to make some small constructive use of that particular position in the interest of world peace.  I think these are the main matters which I want to deal with and which are in reply to the various points raised.  If there is any point I have overlooked I would be glad to answer any question before the debate concludes.</P>

      <P>I move :</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann hereby confirms the Veterinary Surgeons (Confirmation of Agreement) Order, 1972.</P>
      <P>The order in question was made by the Government on 19th December, 1972, under section 4 of the Veterinary Surgeons Act, 1952.  It provides for the confirmation of a new agreement with respect to veterinary surgeons concluded with the United Kingdom Government on 1st December, 1972.  This new veterinary surgeons agreement, which is set out in the Schedule to the present order, is a consolidating measure.  It brings upto-date and consolidates in the one agreement the provisions of the two previous agreements, that is, the agreement of 1931 and the agreement of 1954, and at the same time makes some minor amendments relating mainly to procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new agreement continues the provisions of the two previous agreements relating to (i) arrangements for the acceptance of Irish University veterinary degrees as entitling the holders to registration in the UK Register of Veterinary Surgeons and <Col N="1404" /> to become members of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons; (ii) Irish representation on the Council of the Royal College; (iii) facilities for that council to visit and report upon the courses, et cetera, leading to our veterinary degrees; and (iv) arrangements for the investigation of allegations of professional misconduct by persons registered in both the Irish Veterinary Register and the UK Register.</P>
    <P>There were full consultations with the Veterinary Council, the statutory governing body of the veterinary profession, when the provisions of the new agreement were being drafted and the agreement was concluded with its concurrence.</P>
    <P>I now recommend this order to the House for confirmation.</P>

    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Labour).</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say, first of all, that I appreciate that this is the Minister's first brief and therefore I intend just to say a few words on the future rather than on the past.  I want to assure the Minister that if he is forward looking and if there is a general effort made to improve the Department then he will have my full support.  I should like to emphasise that in my opinion the reason for this Department is that job creation should be at the top of its priorities.  It would be ridiculous if we had a Department of Labour that could not say to an unemployed person : &ldquo;Look, in a reasonable time we can assure you that your prospects of being put into gainful employment are quite good.&rdquo;  I admit that is not an easy thing to do but I suggest that all our efforts must be governed and channelled towards this object.  Therefore, it may not be altogether the privilege of the Department of Labour to ensure that we will provide, as near as we can, full employment.  I realise there are many factors influencing the situation, factors in regard to which the Department is powerless unless the economy is, first of all, built up to such an extent that we can say to those who want employment that we can provide them with the opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the problem of jobs for young people.  I am sure everyone agrees with the Minister and shares his concern in this particular respect.  One of the worst things that can happen to a boy or girl is entering a blind alley occupation.  Sometimes youth do this in an anxiety to leave school or for the purpose of getting some kind of employment which will help to improve family circumstances.  I hope the Minister will tighten up the regulations with regard to the employment of youth and thereby ensure that the boy or girl who enters employment will have some idea of the <Col N="1406" /> future the particular employment holds for him or her.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister about the need for career guidance.  The Minister said that too few schools are aware of their obligations in this regard. I do not want to criticise the schools; it is almost a national pastime to suggest that all our problems should be resolved in the schools.  Teachers have a very onerous task and one would hesitate to impose any further burdens on them.  I think the Department could well have its own section for career guidance in the schools and the officers of the Department might arrange special sessions for pupils for the purpose of such guidance.</P>
    <P>With regard to manpower and manpower policy in general, this particular section is doing a good job.  I think its activities could be expanded.  Perhaps the Minister might tell us when the OECD Report on Manpower will be available.  I believe the report will teach us a great deal.  The experts have been here and they will probably be here again before they present the Minister with their report.  If the Minister could hurry up the report that could well pay a handsome dividend. The Minister says we are going through trying times.  I suppose that is part of life; times will always be trying, but because of the overall excellence of the matter emanating from the OECD, I believe the report will be of tremendous value in analysing the various problems associated with our lack of employment opportunities or, indeed, in one or two instances overemployment. I look forward to the report.</P>
    <P>A change has taken place recently in that employment exchanges are now under the auspices of the Department of Social Welfare.  This may or may not be a good thing.  I should like to see the employment exchanges developing into something more in line with their title instead of being places where men and women go to sign on and draw social welfare benefits. The exchanges here in Dublin do not look very inviting buildings.  The one in Gardiner Street is drab.  It <Col N="1407" /> certainly would not inspire confidence. The one in Werburgh Street is tucked away there.  The Minister might consider modernising the buildings.  They should be designed to inspire hopefulness. New offices might cost money but that is no reason why they should not be built.  The exchanges should have a 20th-century look.  One is 18th or 19th century in appearance.</P>
    <P>I noted with satisfaction the Minister's reference to our exiles.  We must face the fact that many of us do not really care very much what happens to our exiles.  I should like to see a greater consciousness of our obligations to emigrants.  The ideal would be to provide such conditions here that no one would have to emigrate.  I know that some people will always want to emigrate but we sometimes see families broken up because the father must emigrate in search of employment.  Very often middle-aged couples, who have reared families at great personal sacrifice, have no alternative except the emigrant ship or, in this more affluent age, the emigrant plane.  Is there enough awareness of the position of the unwilling emigrant? Are we doing enough for such emigrants. I have a feeling that the more affluent we become the less concerned we are with those who are not so affluent.  We let them emigrate; we no longer see them and our consciences are no longer worried.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on continuing the policy introduced by his predecessor of making grants available to the voluntary organisations dealing with emigrants.  If our people must emigrate they should emigrate fully trained for some particular craft or trade.  The Department have a task in the training and retraining of workers because although we do not wish to see our people going at all, if they do go we should see that they are properly trained to face competition in the foreign labour market.</P>
    <P>Now that we are in the EEC the call to Europe on our workers will be greater.  Until recent years our emigrants went to the UK or the US. I have met some of our workers in Europe.  Some of them went there <Col N="1408" /> from a sense of adventure.  We had a report from Denmark of some of our workers there being dissatisfied with conditions.  I made inquiries from the Minister and I have found that the problem now, if it exists at all, is of much less import than at the beginning.  The Minister now in the House and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will have a greater task than their predecessors to ensure that our workers who emigrate to the Continent will be given the best safeguards possible.  When they emigrated to the US or the UK they did not have any language problems.  In Europe this will be an added burden and the Department may well see their way not alone to train our workers technically but also in languages.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister for Labour introduced the Employment Agencies Bill.  I say with all modesty that I had some part in that legislation being initiated.  Although most of our employment agencies were first-class at that time, we had an alarming report on the activities of one.  Dr. Hillery was Minister for Labour at the time and he introduced the Bill which is now giving much more protection to people who seek employment abroad through these agencies. I would emphasise that having met representatives of employment agencies not so long ago I am satisfied they are good people who are giving a professional service and who always bear in mind the interests of the people seeking employment.  At the same time we must be constantly vigilant so that these high standards will be kept up.</P>
    <P>Only last week the Minister introduced a Bill to amend the redundancy legislation.  I welcome the fact that the number of redundancies last year fell by comparison with the previous year and that a greater number of people were using the Appeals Tribunal.  I have often wondered how many cases there are which are never appealed. Such people carry their grievances and this sort of thing could lead to strikes eventually.  Only the other day there was a strike and an injunction and I wondered whether that situation <Col N="1409" /> would have been reached if the person had appealed to the tribunal.  The Minister may tell us he cannot be responsible for people not using the Appeals Tribunal, but I wonder are the existence and functions of the tribunal publicised sufficiently as far as the workers are concerned.  I have not heard workers talking very much about it.  Workers should be properly informed of the existence of the Appeals Tribunal which is there for their protection and, also, of course, for the protection of the employers. The Minister has made an appeal for industrial peace and he should see that these possible abrasive elements, such as lack of knowledge of the tribunal, are eliminated.</P>
    <P>In the matter of safety and health for workers the Minister has promised new legislation.  I think this is essential because although the death-rate in industry is fairly low&mdash;we have had the figures for last year&mdash;far too many accidents, fatal and non-fatal, are occurring.  One accident in industry is one too many.  Some years ago when I worked in an industrial concern we had a work safety committee.  I do not hear any mention of these nowadays and I wonder if they have been dropped.  If only from the point of view that they brought worker and employer together they were an excellent idea. All efforts should be made for the safety and the health of workers and every means to inform workers and employers should be adopted.  We will become much more industrialised and therefore our workers will be open to much more risk in the future.  We should strive to reduce our accident rate by adopting all possible precautions.</P>
    <P>The Minister also has a heavy responsibility in regard to the health of workers.  Industrial growth has played a big part in creating the polluted atmosphere in which we have to live and although we live in one of the least polluted atmospheres, as we become more industrialised the problem will grow and there will be a greater risk of chest troubles for our workers.  This risk could be reduced very much if we had proper factory inspections and rigid rules being adhered <Col N="1410" /> to for the protection of workers' health.  I look forward to the Minister introducing legislation on health matters in industry at an early date.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that for the first time since 1923 we have a member on the governing body of the ILO.  I do not know why this should be but I welcome it because Irishmen have played a big part down the years in the ILO.  I hope we will maintain our interest in it.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister I welcome the drop in the number of man-days lost through strikes but I think the Minister is being a little naïve when he says that a little more give and a little less take would lead us further to industrial peace.  That is over-simplifying the cause of strikes.  From time to time we hear demands being made for the banning of unofficial strikes.  I often wonder how that could be done. One may say that unofficial strikes are wrong, wildcat strikes are wrong, but I have seen some of them erupt without any warning and then spread to a big industry.  They are not always because of wages.  The cause may be a grievance on the part of one person or it may be a big grievance.  We cannot over-simplify industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the two national wage agreements played a big part in bringing about this drop in the number of man-days lost through strikes.  We all hope that the Government and the trade unions will succeed in adopting a third national wage agreement because if this is not achieved I can see that there will be chaos here not only in the industrial sector but throughout our whole economic life.  Unless the Government rigidly control prices I can see little hope of a third national wage agreement. This has been the trouble in a country very close to us.  One cannot expect a man whether he is a worker or a man in receipt of a pension for work which he has done or because he is handicapped, to look kindly on any agreement which will allow his wages or his pension to be eroded by rising prices.  I wish the Minister well in his part in the battle against infla <Col N="1411" /> tion.  I believe that unless we succeed in pegging prices, the chances of reaching a third national wage agreement are very poor.  If we do not have such an agreement we are in for a trying time.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of this year the Labour Court was expanded slightly. I should like to see the Minister study all aspects of the Labour Court and come in here with legislation to remove what some of us see as weaknesses in the whole procedure.  For many years the Labour Court has served us well.  At the same time, I should like to see more recourse to the Labour Court.  It should be used by employers and employees from the word &ldquo;go&rdquo;.  The Labour Court officers, excellent men with tremendous experience, are available to industrialists who have problems but this court is not being used fully. Very often it is only used as a last resort.  People decide they will not give an inch and then they go to the Labour Court but this does not mean the end of the trouble because the court's decision is not binding.  It has been suggested that we should have an appeal from the Labour Court but I do not think this would serve any purpose because having tried the first court and not having succeeded in obtaining the increase the men wanted, or in the case of the employer not having succeeded in pinning the increase to lesser dimensions, there would be the human tendency to appeal.  It would simply drag out the whole process.  I am sure the Minister will get around to looking at the Labour Court, this tremendous institution which has served us so well but which could serve us even better with some slight adjustments. I look forward to the Minister bringing in legislation in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that in these trying times we must seek perfection. We must certainly seek perfection but we should never become so unrealistic as to think that if we do not have perfection we shall stop trying.  We must realise the task before us in the labour sphere and go ahead with perfecting our organisation, educating <Col N="1412" /> the people on both sides in industry. We will have the drift from the land continuing and we must find employment for many thousands of extra workers in industry.  This is happening in most countries.  We must up-grade our institutions to ensure that they can deal with the problems, some of which have been there since the industrial revolution and will be with us for some more years.  We now, as full members of the EEC, must assure the Europeans that we are fellow Europeans and that we intend to play as full a part as possible and up to European standards.  These are problems a previous Minister did not have to face up to but in their wisdom the last Government decided that our place was in Europe and succeeded, with the votes of the people, in entering Europe.</P>
    <P>If this new departure gives us some headaches I believe we will find that they are headaches worth having.  After solving the problem I believe we will have a more prosperous and happy country.  We can set a headline in this regard and be in a position to show others how we reduced the total number of days lost through strikes.  On two occasions this country won the OECD league for the number of man-days lost.  This year the number lost has dropped, and I look forward to the Minister for Labour being able to report next year that we have industrial peace, and harmony, and that we are well on the road to having full employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with apprenticeship generally in Irish industry and the role of the Department in relation to employment taking in the other employment agencies in the country, particularly the agencies which create and promote employment &mdash;for example, the Industrial Development Authority.  My concern in regard to apprenticeship arises from the fact that there is now a long overdue decision on the part of AnCO to review the current effectiveness of apprenticeship arrangements in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the fact that AnCO has decided to publish a discussion document on a new approach.  I note that the Minister, in his introductory <Col N="1413" /> statement, welcomed the document.  I also welcome the document for discussion purposes.  I have some reservations about the various proposals put forward in it.  I am not so sure that one might regard the proposals contained in the document as being very far-reaching, or major implications on the future of apprenticeship in this country, or major changes from the 1959 Apprenticeship Act.  I am not sure that one could regard these proposals as representing a new approach.</P>
    <P>The more one reads the document the more one becomes concerned that it may have the seeds of a very old approach.  I think that in some respects it has a rather out-dated approach.  At times I got the whiff of 19th century attitude of employers who merely wanted to have industrial workers, after the age of 15, trained in an industrial centre for 12 months, or two years, with a little theoretical training added on and then they were considered fit for industrial life.  I have the strongest reservations about that kind of approach.  Nevertheless, I accept the criticism of our existing apprenticeship system.</P>
    <P>I believe that it is inadequate that young boys should leave school at 15 years plus and then should be expected to get practical training on the job, and theoretical training on either day release, or block release, in our technical schools.  I believe it is wrong that they should be regarded as qualified skilled men having undergone an alleged apprenticeship of five years in industry.  I do not think that the system as has been devised from 1959 is adequate.  Equally, I am concerned about the extent to which we have managed to forecast the need for overall adequate intake with an eye to future needs of the country.  I am not sure that we have had effective, adequate manpower forecasting in this field.  I am glad to know that the Minister has laid special stress on the work of the National Manpower Service in this country in trying to undertake the necessary forecasting in the field of industrial skills.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the proposals put forward by AnCO in this document will not make an already difficult situation <Col N="1414" /> even worse.  This may be regarded as a peculiar statement but there is a great deal of confusion in the document. For example, it is suggested in this document that no young person should be refused entry into craft training by reason of failure to pass an examination.  This young person, however, would need to have completed either the group certificate or intermediate certificate course and to have undergone an aptitude test.  That is the double-barrelled proposal of AnCO.  In other words, one will not have any entry examination as such. One will merely go through the group or intermediate certificate course and then undergo an aptitude test.  If one is suitable at that level one is taken into apprenticeship.  On the other hand the person, having been taken into apprenticeship, AnCO finds it completely unsatisfactory that there is effectively no terminal testing in the current system.  It proposes to have continuous assessment of apprenticeship throughout the period of apprenticeship and terminal testing for qualification.  To me, that is a confusion.  One cannot have non-qualification entry and have terminal exit testing of an effective nature. Therefore, there is a confusion in the approach of AnCO.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about a good deal of the assertions in the document produced by AnCO which the Minister has urged us to consider.  I am concerned about how the document was compiled.  Reading through it there is no statistical appendix in it. There is little statistical information in it.  If one goes through the annual report of AnCO one gets a certain amount of information on apprenticeship and what is being done in various areas, but there is little of what one would call rigorous evaluation of the effectiveness of the apprenticeship system in this country.  It is difficult, therefore, for the politicians to assess the situation.</P>
    <P>I urge a certain caution on the part of the Minister because I have a horror that one might finish up with the situation where apprentices will be produced on a three-year basis, some in fact might be produced on a one-year <Col N="1415" /> basis, in different crafts with AnCO certification.  One would find a substantial number of skilled Irish workers caught in the narrow confines of an industry.  I want to see apprenticeship broadened in the educational centres.  I want to see apprentices receive qualifications&mdash; this will involve examinations or certification of some kind.  I want apprentices to participate fully in courses in the regional technical colleges; I want to see them graduate out of apprenticeship into the technological colleges. I want to see apprentices from 15 years onwards follow courses whereby they can finish their education at universities.  There is a great danger that if a narow approach is adopted on the educational front we will have skilled ghetto workers and nothing could be more disastrous for the future industrial development of the country and for the development of skills in Irish employment.</P>
    <P>If I am critical I hope it is in a constructive sense.  There has been a strong feeling that the AnCO document is an internal discussion document. I should like the Minister to ensure that the other Government Departments, notably the Department of Education, are involved.  I do not think AnCO can survive without the Department of Education.  There may be a feeling in some areas that AnCO could survive and develop their own training curriculum and work away on their own basis.  There must be the closest liaison between AnCO and the national manpower service in forecasting apprenticeship needs.</P>
    <P>There must be a relationship between AnCO and the National Science Council.  There is little point in training apprentices on a three-year basis in skills that will be obsolete at the end of that time.  Many Irish workers are being trained in skills that will be obsolete in five years.  This is the reason I argue that the broadest educational training should be given to young boys of 15 years and over to enable them to adapt in a changing technological situation.  They must be given a broad educational flexibility <Col N="1416" /> to enable them to adapt to a rapidly changing industrial society.  I would urge the Minister to ensure that this is the outcome of the approach of AnCO.</P>
    <P>The document is a training document, interspersed with conventional educational wisdom.  I do not think that is adequate.  One must have a balance between education, apprenticeship and training.  The responsibility of the Ministers for Labour and Education is to have the correct mix to ensure that this is obtained.  The socialist approach is that education concerns the whole person, not just training in an industrial training centre for a particular skill.  It is the complete development of a worker's personality up to the age of 18 and thereafter with retraining and further adult education to enable the worker to develop throughout his life.</P>
    <P>In the AnCO document there is reference to the AnCO special committee. I always have reservations about special committees.  I would ask the Minister to inquire about the special committee; what is its composition and are the people on the committee competent and qualified for the major proposals contained in the document?  The AnCO document has also stated that educational interests were consulted or were involved. I have considerable doubts that educational interests were involved to the extent suggested and I would ask the Minister to query AnCO on this point.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the proposals contained in the AnCO document relate to the proposals and recommendations made by the industrial training committees of AnCO.  There might be some divergence in that regard.  I regard the evidence in the document as rather inadequate.  It has taken several years to compile this document but we are expected to give our views on it in a few months.  The Minister can legitimately say that the discussion period should be extended to enable all concerned to consider the matter.  For instance, I should be interested to hear the views of the Department of Education.  I think many educationalists in the Department <Col N="1417" /> would have strong views on the matter.  The views of all the teaching organisations&mdash;not merely the Teachers' Association of Ireland&mdash;should be studied carefully.  Similarly, the Irish Vocational Education Association and the CEO's association would have some fairly tough comments to make regarding the approach adopted by AnCO.</P>
    <P>It is easy to be critical but I must point out that some of the statements in the document are not necessarily supported by hard evidence.  For example, it is stated that theoretical training in vocational schools and colleges can appear to many employers and apprentices to be irrelevant because often it is remote from practical job requirements.  Have we clearcut evidence that the theoretical training provided in the day-release and block-release courses is inadequate, unnecessary or irrelevant?  I have not found any evidence from the authorities concerned that this is so although this may be the view of some specialists in AnCO.  However, if we are to have adaptability and if the young people in industry are to have sufficient flexibility in skills in order to master the technology of the future they should look beyond the skills in which they are being trained at present.  Certainly they will need a thorough understanding of the social forces in society.  They may very well need considerable grounding in theoretical training at apprenticeship level to enable them to have this sense of adaptability that is necessary in modern industrial life.  I query the rather superficial dismissal of the theoretical aspects of training.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Minister achieving the correct mix in industrial training, I have no great objection to the development of aptitude testing.  My view is that a combination of certified examinations plus aptitude testing gives the best result.  I would not go overboard on aptitude training of either intake apprentices or apprentices themselves on certification.  It is important to point out that one of the pillars of the AnCO document is that aptitude testing is, one might say, becoming <Col N="1418" /> the be-all and end-all.  Personally, I have reservations about it because while aptitude testing is invaluable in many areas it is subjective and in Ireland we still need a great deal of proof of its effectiveness.  I have no objection to the introduction of the system of personal evaluation. I think it quite unfair that an apprentice should be thrown out because he does not pass an examination.  I think a combination of examination and aptitude testing is best but in the AnCO document the examination system is thrown out and aptitude testing rather superficially substituted. That criticism is entirely invalid.</P>
    <P>One of the frustrating aspects of the document is the absence of source information: how many apprentices have undergone aptitude tests?  How many were successful?  How many were not?  This information is not available in the document.  Let me refer to paragraph 19 of the document. There is a rather sweeping statement that 20-25 per cent of boys who leave school between the ages of 15 and 16 enter apprenticeship.  Who said so? What evidence is there that this is so? I shall accept that figure if somebody gives the source of it but I have not yet seen any source of an authoritative nature.</P>
    <P>That kind of sweeping statement is rather dangerous in a document which proposes major policy changes.  There is need to check such a statement put in as a positive statement in this document. Therefore, I suggest that in the final assessment of this document at departmental level there might be greater emphasis on the training of apprentices for an industry as a whole rather than on training for a particular job or skill.  This broad approach is necessary and is in line with the general principles of industrial training.</P>
    <P>One might query whether in 1973 we should worry about a new approach to apprenticeship as such.  Is there need for apprenticeship as such?  This is why I do not regard the document as a new approach.  There is certainly need for a tremendous development in industrial training.  Workers should be trained in a broad range of skills in a given industry and given a substantial  <Col N="1419" /> general education.  Then one would have mobility of skill within an industry as a whole and comprehensive, on-the-job training will enable them to specialise at individual firm level.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to consider a different line: educational training should be relevant to the work undertaken in the apprentice's industry, not just a narrow craft.  Is there much point in training a worker purely as a carpenter or bricklayer when one should be training him in the broad range of skills of the construction industry? Is there much point m training him in the narrow skills of a particular trade in the engineering industry which might be obsolete in a few years time when there is need to train workers in the broad skills of that industry as a whole?  That kind of approach would be the most helpful to Irish industrial workers in the future and would ensure mobility of the work force within the industry as a whole.  This will be necessary. If we are to have that approach there must be basic educational training on the scientific and industrial principles underlining the industrial processes for such workers.  That is necessary if we want to have a broad industrial training approach rather than an apprenticeship approach.</P>
    <P>I am certain that the Minister, if I know his past statements in this regard, is in full sympathy with my views.  The education of the apprentice should and must include suitable basic training in what one would call the broad general educational humanities.  It is preposterous to suggest that one takes a young worker at age 15-plus, gives him one year or three years of training, much of it on the job and the minor aspects of it theoretically, and then assumes that he is an adult industrial worker of a skilled type.  This is undemocratic and a denial of the right of the individual.  People should not be narrowly trained, narrowly apprenticed and educated in a very narrow rigid framework.  I am adamant that young industrial workers have a social right to be trained and given basic education in the broad general <Col N="1420" /> humanities even if they end up as skilled industrial craftsmen.  We owe to the Irish people a very broad progressive approach in this regard and I think we can provide it because we have the advantage of learning from the mistakes of the Continental countries, the mistakes of Germany for instance.  With due respect for AnCO their rationale, to quote just a summary, is: &ldquo;In most European countries there are compulsory tests and certification during and at the end of apprenticeship.  Here the only qualification is to serve five years as an apprentice.&rdquo;  They are critical of the five years but I do not particularly like what I have seen of German apprenticeship nor am I particularly impressed by the French or the Dutch.  I would recommend some Members of the House to go and see some of the Continental apprenticeship training systems where men are slotted into a narrow, ghetto craft, a module, one might say, for life.  That is their inheritance as Continental workers.</P>
    <P>In Ireland we can have a broader approach without losing the specialised skills of an industrial worker in his particular job.  Perhaps the most important aspect of this approach is one I commend to the Minister: it will provide and be so designed that automatically if adopted, a worker will, if he is a successful student, have an opportunity to progress to further education.  This is important. He will have the prospect of further education opened up to him.  Educationally and socially it is regressive in any document to suggest that what may eventuate&mdash;and I see this kind of approach developing&mdash;is that a worker will be apprenticed for life, one might say, to work for a single firm rather than for an industry. That is the danger and it is a denial of a worker's rights in the development of education.</P>
    <P>I am giving the Minister my views because he has asked for the views of Deputies.  There is no departmental or ministerial policy on this as yet.  I am grateful that the Minister has not done the trick-of-the-loop of announcing policy decisions, and that is <Col N="1421" /> the end of it.  We now have an opportunity to form policy in Dáil Éireann by putting forward our views.  The broad approach which a craftsman will have to labour mobility across an industry will appeal to the trade union movement.  It has always been a besetting problem of trade unions in relation to crafts, redundancy and individual firms, that workers have been trained narrowly for particular firms and trades.  Without mobility and flexibility the unions have found themselves with redundant members on their hands with nowhere to go for other work.</P>
    <P>The broad approach would be beneficial for Irish industrial workers in the years ahead when they will probably work abroad&mdash;not that many of them.  Many of them now work in Britain and some may yet work in the European countries.  Why should we not train Irish apprentices in a foreign language?  We are in the European Economic Community.  The technocrats in AnCO probably would be aghast at the idea of an apprentice of 16 or 17 years of age learning a foreign language, but this is the type of broad education we should give Irish industrial workers.</P>
    <P>We are in the Common Market. Skills and employment have become multi-national, and why should not an Irish tradesman be able to speak French or German, and learn it as a part of his general apprenticeship education?  I would recommend that the broad skills of the humanities should be opened up to industrial workers.  That recommendation regarding languages is now 12 years old.  Twelve years ago this was a recommendation to the Apprenticeship and Vocational Educational Authority at a congress in Trieste.  In 1962 they asked for a second European language as a common European qualification to ensure broad mobility.</P>
    <P>The Minister might inquire from AnCO what precisely they have in mind in terms of the general education of apprentices in future.  The answer to that question would be illuminating.  I am not on what I would call a critical kick against AnCO.  Tremendous work is being <Col N="1422" /> done on the apprenticeship and industrial training sides by this organisation. It would be dangerous if these proposals were allowed to go through without public discussion.  Therefore, I suggest that a good standard of general education for apprentices, to use a classical Irish phrase, would not be incompatible or irreconcilable with the proposals of AnCO.  This would be a far better preparation of the individual for his future life.</P>
    <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;I feel these proposals are very worthwhile and should be carefully studied by all Deputies.&rdquo;  I accept that many proposals in the AnCO document are worthwhile, particularly those relating to the forecasting of apprenticeship needs.  This is a major issue and one which will merit the full support of this House.  I accept that there is a need for more flexibility on entry standards.  I support the desirability of an entry examination together with an aptitude test.  One often finds that a particular individual can pass an examination but fail an aptitude test. There should be a flexibility and an openness in providing apprenticeship entry for young people.</P>
    <P>I agree with the general concept in the document of continuous assessment techniques being used.  This is good.  It is not what one would call window-dressing, but an essential need.  I would not be happy with the proposal in the document that all one needs at the end of a three year period at a post-primary school is a certificate of attendance which says that one has attended a day group certificate course, or an intermediate certificate course and, hey presto, one gets a certificate of attendance and one can start one's apprenticeship. That would not be satisfactory in the long-term because it would lower standards, if anything, and would be ineffective.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education is making what I would call a very interesting approach to closing the gap between the post-primary secondary and the post-primary vocational technical sides.  One of the measures I would strongly urge on the Minister is late entry to apprenticeship.  Why <Col N="1423" /> should a person not with the leaving certificate start off an apprenticeship? Is there anything wrong with that? We have thousands of young men and women emerging from the leaving certificate course with pass leaving certificates.  They and their parents are at their wits' end to know what they will do in future life.  We have thousands of young men and women also emerging with honours leaving certificates.  They do not belong to the upper middle-class income group and they have not got the money to go to university, even with a grant.  It is quite expensive.  Why should they not have an opportunity of a short accelerated apprenticeship entry and, over a period of two years, become a qualified apprentice?  Age of entry should be substantially higher.  I agree with AnCO that age of entry into apprenticeship should be much later if necessary.  Why should a man not become a craftsman at the age of 21 or 22 or 23?</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Brugha that, on the trade union side, there must be greater flexibility and a much more open approach has to be teased out inside the trade union organisations.  I see nothing wrong with a person of 18 years entering an apprenticeship. Why should he not if he is a late developer in life or if he wants to get an industrial skill?  Equally, there should be an opportunity for women to take up apprenticeships.  It is a scandalous situation that apprenticeship, by and large, is overwhelmingly confined to boys.  Why should we not have young women apprentices as in any modern European state?  The denial of opportunities of apprenticeship to women in this country is scandalous.  We are going to provide equal pay for work of equal value in employment opportunities which are of themselves of the lowest possible grading.  That is not equality of opportunity. It is not even equal pay.  Equal opportunity in apprenticeship must be provided for women in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1424" /> I would ask the Minister to ask AnCO whether they are happy about the idea that young men and women with leaving certificates should have the opportunity of entering industrial apprenticeship.  The Minister should ask the trade unions about this point. Are the unions prepared to accept people with leaving certificate for apprenticeship?  Are these people wanted?  I hope that they are.  Apprentices with leaving certificate are, in some instances, better equipped to proceed to technician grade or up to the first level in technological grades. A man with leaving certificate can proceed rapidly to that level.  He is on the first rung of the ladder into a technological college.   A young apprentice with a good broad leaving certificate, having gone through an ancillary period of apprenticeship, can become one of our finest technicians or one of the finest qualifiers on the technological front, equal to a man in first or second year in university.</P>
    <P>One of the problems about the AnCO document is that it would seem to depress the opportunities open to young people to go further in the educational field.  I would urge the Minister to have a variety of methods of entry to apprenticeships. If the Minister concentrated on that type of approach we could enrich enormously the skills of the country. We could not merely enrich the skills in the vocational schools and in the industrial training centres but also in our technological colleges and in our universities.  I have some very strong views about the role of the universities in this regard.  I accept, however, that it is not appropriate to speak on these views in the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister in his discussions with AnCO to be flexible on the duration of apprenticeship.  Some people regard apprenticeship as a five-year training period in a job before one becomes, for instance, a motor mechanic and feel that if this period were shortened to three years everything would be all right.  This is a superficial approach.  We find various people in various trades <Col N="1425" /> having certain views about the length of apprenticeship.  There may be over-emphasis on this in the AnCO document.  I do not think the length of apprenticeship is over-important; what happens during that apprenticeship is very important.  It could be that 12 months would be adequate as an apprenticeship period in certain trades, while two years or three years would be necessary in other trades and five years would be necessary in highly specialised trades.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that we should not have a global three-year period.  I would be opposed to the current five-year period.  What is sacrosanct about three years?  Why not three months?  Perhaps a short period would be sufficient if one could get the fundamentals of training into a young man's head in three months. The length of apprenticeship should be flexible.  There are 90,000 workers in the construction industry.  The constructional engineering industry is expanding. The printing industry has great potential.  We have a textile industry and a shoes and leather industry.  All these industries are quite definite and a wide divergence of skills is required.  The length of apprenticeship in the various trades should be discussed with trade union officials or mature craftsmen.  The length of such apprenticeship should be flexible and should be the subject of consultation.  The Minister would be surprised to know of the problems facing him in respect of some of the trade union attitudes.  Some unions would regard five years' training as sacrosanct.  It is really a question of what length of apprenticeship is necessary in industrial training.</P>
    <P>These are some of my views on one aspect of the Minister's speech.  The speech was very comprehensive, detailed and thorough.  It was refreshing in that regard.  I would not be disposed to comment on various aspects of the Minister's speech.  Many of the Minister's proposals are forward-looking and comprehensive.  I hope that during the Minister's term of office some of the schemes will come to legislative fruition.  We know there is a difference between making a <Col N="1426" /> speech and producing a Bill.  The Minister has my sympathy in that regard. Social and industrial legislation are required in this country.  During the lifetime of this Dáil we will probably have a Bill for industrial training and safety legislation, and legislation about holidays and conditions of employment.  There is a wide range of legislation.  A different approach is required on each legislative front.  My experience has been that during my public life, in the short period since 1959, no Minister is judged on his record for making speeches inside or outside Leinster House.  The only consolation a politician has comes from his record of having brought in a piece of legislation as a monument to his efforts.  This is where we wish the Minister well with the actual legislation he will bring in over the next few years.  I look forward to the House having an opportunity of discussing such matters.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am pleased to note that the Department of Labour have their own Minister.  It is a growing Department which is not, perhaps, the most expensive Department in terms of expenditure from the budget, but a Department which has been progressive in relation to redundancy payments, an area in which the Minister has substantial control on an agency basis, one might say, and an area in which the Minister for Finance would regard budget responsibility as being in some respects rather limited.</P>
    <P>However, there is one aspect on which I would encourage the Minister to lay emphasis, because I would be worried in case the Department of Labour became a compartmentalised Cabinet portfolio.  As in Britain, the Department dealing with employment should have a broad scope.  For example, in the employment creating agencies, particularly the Industrial Development Authority, I would hope that there would be departmental involvement.  If we are to develop effective regional policies we cannot have a situation in which the IDA will decide on a particular regional strategy, the Department of Labour will simultaneously decide on a different regional training <Col N="1427" /> and manpower strategy, while at local government level there is another regional arrangement.  There is need for co-ordination, and that can be brought about by the Department having consultative and even policy-decision involvement in the work of the Industrial Development Authority. That is one way of giving the Department an opportunity to co-ordinate policy at a national level.  It may be yet another burden on the Department, but it will at least mean that an employer setting up a factory in Ireland will get everything in one package. Therefore, I would urge not just liaison but statutory involvement.  That is just a passing comment I would make arising out of the views of Deputy Moore which I heard earlier on, and which I support.</P>

    <P>I do not intend to go into the controversial areas in which the Minister may have responsibility for the coming 12 months, although it would be easy to do so.  I wish the Minister well in the fulfilment of his responsibility and would, perhaps, take a brief look at the Department of Labour as it is now.  It started off like a Department that would be called at the last moment to try to deal with a strike.  At least that was the public impression of the Department.  Over the years it has expanded into something which is of tremendous importance to the community.  It is possible that even the people deeply involved in the Department and ancillary bodies may not appreciate how vitally important is the work they are doing. Next to the Department of Education the Department of Labour is, I think, the one Department that can help to create a better social atmosphere and a happier community.  It is a Department that can help to generate a better attitude by management towards <Col N="1428" /> workers and by workers towards their job.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects in which the Department is now involved, through An Chomhairle Oiliúna, through research, through the work of the Labour Court, which is independent but which is attached to the Department, which are of the utmost importance to all of us.  Deputy Barry Desmond referred to the need for a liaison between the Department of Labour and the Department of Education and the need for a broader general education for people, perhaps before they become involved in training for work.  I feel the Deputy is correct in this in relation to many areas which I have observed around me in recent times.  I know it does not relate to the Department of Labour, but the atmosphere which develops in any community derives from the type of education which young people get. The education they get in the humanities and the values of life they acquire inevitably influence their attitude. Society, therefore, gains or loses, depending on the quality of that education.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in any research he might direct, should try to find out how many young people in this city today have been given the habit of reading books; how many young people are going into jobs and going from work to play and to drink and have not been given the sort of education which would encourage them to read books and to learn about nature, art and so on.  We ourselves are responsible for the sort of society being created, and certainly some of the atmosphere around us is not very encouraging.  On the other hand, there are good aspects.  There are many young people engaging in fruitful and even constructive pastimes, but the sort of education that is being given is very important to the success of the Department for which the Minister is responsible.</P>
    <P>The EEC membership which we have now acquired is, I believe, dynamic in its effect, not only on our social outlook but in regard to our efforts to make a success of ourselves in this country.  The decision to <Col N="1429" /> join the European Community was based on the belief of most people engaged in industry that Irish management and workers could be as successful as others provided we had access to markets.  It was believed we had for too long been dependent on the British market for work for emigrants and also for Irish goods which would keep people in jobs at home. In this sense we have been, and still are, far too dependent on the British economy and on the ups and downs of that economy.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister appreciates that the objective of the industrial drive which started many years ago was to create industry, to slow down the enforced emigration and to provide for the natural increase in the agricultural population who would need work.  Things have changed considerably during the past ten years. The Minister referred to the fall in emigration and recent statistics indicate a fall in redundancy.</P>
    <P>The work of AnCO is very important in regard to the training of workers for better and more efficient production and retraining workers to fit them for alternative jobs.  I regard the retraining of workers as of the utmost importance because if a man or woman loses his or her job through redundancy he or she has the right to a new job.  This is a top priority.</P>
    <P>A good deal of work has been done in the training of managers by the Irish Management Institute.  This is certainly as important as, if not more important than, the training of workers.  It is important to understand that more of the responsibility for the success of an enterprise can lie on a manager than on those who have to work with him. The first rule of any manager should be to create an atmosphere in which workers are glad to work with him. Much of the cause of discontent and dissatisfaction in the past has arisen from bad and sometimes arrogant management attitudes.  There has been a considerable improvement due mainly to the influence of the Irish Management Institute.</P>
    <P>It is important that industries which are running into trouble in regard to markets should let AnCO and <Col N="1430" /> the Industrial Development Authority know as soon as possible so that diversification or alternative industry can be brought in in time.  Management have to recognise that they have the responsibility to create new jobs rather than let things reach the stage where it is too late and people become redundant.</P>
    <P>The work done by the National Manpower Service is very good but I do not think enough is known about it. The Minister should try to get more publicity for it on radio and television. I imagine very few people know that there are now six regional directors working in 13 different centres throughout the country.  The work which is done here in the proper placement of people in jobs is very useful in the interests of those people and is essential in the interests of our economy.</P>
    <P>It is essential to bring career information into every school and I am glad to note in a reference to this that the aim is that in the Department of Education there should be a career guidance officer in every school.  There are too many misfits and, indeed, some parents are foolishly over-ambitious for their children and disregard the true welfare of those children by not ensuring that those children are doing what they are fitted to do rather than what their parents may think they should be doing.</P>
    <P>The good work of the Labour Court does not get enough publicity.  We know that bad news is always news and good news is seldom heard but the record shown by the Minister of 78 per cent acceptance in disputes last year is a good one and it highlights the importance of the Labour Court as a consultative body which brings people together.</P>
    <P>I would like to urge the Minister to have a look at the very large number of people who retire at 60 or 65 years of age.  The Department, An Comhairle Oiliúna, employers and trade unions should engage in some sort of research into what people in this category should be doing after they retire.  I believe here you have years of accumulated experience going to waste because many of those people have not thought about what they should be <Col N="1431" /> doing.  They have not been conditioned towards undertaking some kind of fruitful work.  In many cases people look after this themselves but I have come across cases in the course of my political work where people who have retired are doing absolutely nothing. I believe these could make a considerable contribution and both they and the country would be the better for such a contribution.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to give special priority to the finding of alternative employment for those affected by takeovers.  We all know takeovers are undesirable and, if we could prevent them, I am sure we would.  The fact is that they are with us whether we like them or not.  I have come across cases of personal tragedy, of bitterness and disillusionment as a result of the buying out of firms of one kind or another.  It is not enough to ensure that the correct redundancy payments are made.  The individual who has worked for ten, 15, 20 or 25 years has a right to continue working; he has a right to some sense of fulfilment.  I should like to see this particular area getting some kind of priority.</P>
    <P>We have now had the Employer/ Labour National Agreement with us for a couple of years.  The Minister may have difficulties here and inflation will do nothing to help these difficulties but I would urge him to try to ensure the continuance of this kind of agreement. It is a tribute to the workers, the employers and the trade unions that the agreement introduced a couple of years ago has survived to date.  It is very important, not just to industry but to all people, that there should be that degree of harmony in the area of pay.</P>
    <P>I was glad to note the Minister's reference to his intention of having a survey conducted on mental health and stress in industry.  I think the responsibility of management is quite considerable in this particular sphere.  In any employment sphere those in control can help to a great extent to create conditions which will go some of the way towards reducing the monotony of work.  The manager or, indeed, the managing director can help by talking <Col N="1432" /> to the workers, by being a bit more human in his approach and that, in turn, will increase the interest of the workers in their particular jobs.  I believe that many of the difficulties and many of the disputes which arise are not just motivated by a desire for more money; they very often arise from dissatisfaction due to a lack of thought on the part of management and a lack of interest on the part of the workers because of that lack of thought.  New thinking on this is beginning to develop in Europe and the social policy there is following on that development.</P>
    <P>Pollution by industry has been mentioned. This is not the direct concern of the Minister, but it could concern him indirectly in the sense that, if we do not control our environment and keep industrial expansion to some particular pattern and order, life itself would become more drab, more monotonous and, therefore, less interesting for workers with a resultant loss in the quality of performance.</P>
    <P>I should like again to wish the Minister well in his Department.  The work of the Department is essential to the future welfare of all the people.  I also wish the bodies attached to the Department well in their work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputies for the various comments they have made on the working of my Department and to assure them that these comments and the queries raised will have our close attention.  As I said in my introductory statement, we have been at pains in the Department to have a general review of the entire working of the Department and it is our intention, in the course of that general review, to subject to a similar examination all legislation affecting the working population.  This is essential because a great deal of our legislation is antiquated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>General factory legislation in the 1955 Act in turn, however, is based to a large extent on British legislation of 1936.  The 1955 Act was brought in by the late William Norton and basically it incorporated a good deal of British thinking around the year 1936.  Therefore it is necessary to update all that <Col N="1433" /> legislation, and I am sure Deputies on all sides would give general support to this idea.  Attitudes of society change. Justifiably, higher expectations come with the changing situations of changing times and it is clear and right that our legislation should mirror the justifiably higher expectations, demands and requirements of people working in 1973.</P>
    <P>As I explained in other venues, in this struggle of the working people for better conditions in their places of work, for better legislation governing their conditions of work, the Department of Labour are not neutral.  We are squarely on the side of all those who work for a living in Ireland, of working Ireland.  It is our ambition in the Department that this commitment of ours will be enshrined in up to date legislation wherever that is appropriate. I would hope that in the coming months we can at least begin the process of bringing the equal pay legislation, for instance, into law.</P>
    <P>I have taken the opportunity in other places to explain that this legislation will not automatically give us true equality of the sexes in their places of work.  We do not claim that for the legislation.  Obviously, true equality of people of the two sexes in their places of work, doing the same kind of work, who are at present receiving different rates of pay, will not be achieved overnight by the passage of any equal pay legislation in this Parliament.  True equality in the place of work or anywhere else will only be achieved on the basis of the general conviction that equal opportunity should be afforded to members of both sexes.  This fundamental granting of equal opportunity to women will be in the long run far more important than any legislation and it will be far more difficult to achieve.</P>
    <P>It has been noted by people who have examined this contentious question of equality of opportunity that it has its origin in home attitudes, in school attitudes and finally in the general attitude of society.  If our legislation goes through all stages in this Parliament and goes out to be law in a society which still holds outmoded ideas of the woman's role, then that <Col N="1434" /> legislation will be ineffective.  If it goes out to working places in which the majority of trade unionists have prejudices on the matter, then it will not be as effective as we would desire it to be.</P>
    <P>In other words, for such legislation to be effective and for true equality of the sexes to be achieved, we require nothing less than a revolution in the attitude of people in our society.  It is a remarkable paradox that in the part of this country over which this Parliament has jurisdiction at present, in the struggles earlier this century to give us the measure of freedom and political independence we enjoy, women played an important part.  People have commented on the seemingly strange paradox of women's leading part in the founding years of this State and their apparent departure from decision making positions in this State in the late 1920s and 1930s.  How is it that women who in the 1920s or earlier were prominent in what we know as the National Movement, that women who were given equality of leadership in that movement, by 1937 could be relegated in our Constitution to their place in the home?  What had happened to national attitudes in that brief period?</P>
    <P>One does not suggest that legislation based on bringing about equality of the sexes should mean women abandoning their homes.  That could not possibly happen nor would it be desirable that it should happen, but it is strange that this view of women could be expressed in the 1937 Constitution in which they were given no other dimension than their role in the home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am drawing attention: to the contrast in attitudes to women in the founding years of the State and later.  In the Constitution of 1937 the emphasis is that a woman's main role is in the home and there is a total absence in that Constitution of <Col N="1435" /> any role for women beyond being confined to the home.  I think that provision in the 1937 Constitution reflected the views of the majority of the Irish people.  It seems strange that women should have had a leading role a short time before&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister was making the point that, because ladies had identified themselves in certain fields of activities, there should have been general acceptance that the ladies' place was outward.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good point, that whatever about constitutions or the general opinions of society there will always be individuals who will be exceptions to the generally expressed attitude.  This was true in the case of the 1937 Constitution.  We did have exceptional women throughout that period who continued in leadership positions in the Irish Trade Union Movement&mdash;Louise Bennett, Helena Maloney.  There we're other names also which do not come to mind, women who continued that tradition of earlier in the century.</P>
      <P>The general point I was making was that we may proceed now with equal pay legislation, my intention has been expressed to proceed with legislation as rapidly as possible, but in the absence of any charge in public attitudes in the country as a whole towards acceptance of the idea of women as equal partners in the progress and development of our State any legislation will be severely limited in its beneficial impact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>That change is with us now.  There is a notable change in attitudes and indeed the attitude of <Col N="1436" /> women towards life is changing fairly rapidly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, perhaps I am being overpessimistic about it. If the Deputy is right in that society in general now has a proper appreciation of the relevance of the women's effort in the national economy, accepts them as equal citizens in our State, then our legislation will fall on fertile ground and it will have some effect.  They have discovered, in other countries where they have brought in equal pay legislation, that old prejudices die very hard and it has been necessary to tackle the more fundamental question of equality of opportunity.  There we very rapidly come up against the accumulated traditions of centuries and James Connolly remarked in his day how difficult it was to overcome those.  We will not escape that predicament even by bringing in legislation.  This attitude is rooted in particular approaches to education.  It was mentioned in the Hyland Report on Education.  The Lynch Report referred to the parental attitudes to the kind of education suitable for girls and boys. This is seemingly a parental predetermination of role, an assignment of role at parent level, which extends throughout society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are problems that cannot be tackled by Government action alone and will require some fundamental changes in attitude in society at large.  However, we, in so far as it is within our capacity to act, are acting on this matter of equal pay for equal work.  It may be necessary later this year to consider general anti-discrimination legislation.  While we do not have discrimination of the vile kind which has been in existence in the Northern part of the country on religious grounds, there are other forms of discrimination which have been noted in recent years.  There is discrimination on grounds of age.  We have the problem of workers leaving their jobs as a result of redundancy, technological change, and we find an unhappy prejudice growing up on the part of employers against reemploying people in their early forties.  Properly trained men, good <Col N="1437" /> workers, with almost a whole lifetime of productive work before them, are turned down on grounds of age. It may be too heavy a comment on the situation to say that it is discrimination but literally that is what it amounts to.  It is quite useless for the State to embark on a policy of training and retraining workers if there is an unwillingness on the part of the employers to take on such workers on the grounds of age.</P>
    <P>Another discrimination, maybe not as widespread, which the Equal Pay Bill would be designed to help towards solving is the discrimination on grounds of sex.  I believe this discrimination may continue and it may be necessary to introduce general anti-discrimination legislation to incorporate this question of refusing employment on the grounds of sex to individuals.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the question of age, a matter often complained of to me, and other Deputies may have had complaints from their constituents. We find, in a particular part of the country a factory closing down and, with IDA assistance, another factory opening up nearly a year later.  In the meantime, we may have provided retraining facilities for the redundant workers.  Then we find that workers are rejected in the new factory on grounds of age.  I am not clear yet on what is the answer.  I do not believe we should move to legislation until a case is proved for the necessity of such legislation, but the problem undoubtedly exists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. G. Fitzgerald Mr. G. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister is exaggerating?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am. All I am saying is that I am having the matter examined at present.  I have had reports from many areas of this kind of difficulty.  It may be that the problem is not as widespread as my reports suggest but I am having it examined anyway, because it would be very foolish to have workers with almost a whole lifetime of work before them turned down on grounds of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another problem I am having <Col N="1438" /> looked at at present is discrimination on the grounds of address.  In the Dublin city area, and perhaps in other areas, young people from particular areas do not appear to get the same treatment in terms of interview time or possibilities of employment as young people from more socially accepted areas.  I do not know what the answer is.  It is a very real problem if a young person is refused an avenue of employment simply because, in the view of the employer, the area from which he comes is not quite suitable.  We must not permit social prejudices of this kind to deprive any young person of gainful employment.  This would be quite unfair to the individual concerned.  The answer is that it may not be as widespread as certain reports at my disposal appear to suggest.  I do not think we can permit the situation to continue and if there is any wide application of this, or if wide areas, or sections of the people are affected, the answer would seem to be to remedy the matter by way of legislation.</P>
    <P>I have already announced my intention of bringing in legislation to provide for the employment of a certain quota of handicapped persons.  This legislation provides that employers be asked to employ a certain quota of handicapped persons.  Up to now we have been following voluntary methods in this country.  There is an argument as to which is the best for the handicapped person.  Some arguments suggest that voluntary methods of asking employers to take on handicapped persons are the more effective in the long run.</P>
    <P>In 1967 the late Deputy Seán Dunne introduced a Private Members' Bill dealing with this matter but it encountered certain opposition.  The Minister at the time argued his case that it was better that voluntary means alone should be depended upon to ensure that handicapped persons would receive fair play in terms of employment. Our experience of the voluntary system at work since that date does not leave us with any choice in the matter. Looking at the experience of Britain and other countries, we do not <Col N="1439" /> see any great extension in the kind of occupations granted to handicapped persons, or the numbers employed.  We see handicapped people being restricted to a few of the traditional occupations with no expansion into the other occupations we have seen in other countries in recent years.</P>
    <P>Those who have considered this subject in other countries insist that the properly trained handicapped person, in the appropriate job, may do every bit as good a job as the person with no physical handicap.  This is two way traffic and we must have this willingness, and this possibility of avenues of employment, for such people.  This possibility of employment must exist before we can see the training opportunities opening up for the handicapped persons to give them the necessary skills.</P>
    <P>I have come to a decision, in the light of our experience over the past few years, that we must proceed to legislation which will ensure that a certain quota of handicapped persons will get a chance of employment.  I do not believe that this measure will encounter appreciable opposition on the part of employers.  I believe most employers will welcome this opportunity.  We will look, in the experience of the legislation, to see what changes may be necessary later.  I do not believe that we can any longer content ourselves with voluntary means alone.  The record suggests that some change is needed and it would appear that the direction should be in the legislative line.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore spoke of the necessity of the Department of Labour having a connection with employment creation.  We have a good informal relationship with the IDA. but I agree with the Deputy that it would be necessary to have a more correct institutional relationship with this body.  The IDA is the premier employment creation body for attracting industry from outside.  I will be looking into this question shortly.  It appears that it will be necessary to have an organic connection between my Department and the IDA to ensure that when an industry is going <Col N="1440" /> to an area the labour possibilities are a factor in the IDA'S decision-making process.  There could then be a close link-up between the manpower section of the Department of Labour which examines the labour market in its national profile.</P>
    <P>It would seem common sense, and a rationalisation of effort on the part of State Departments, that there should be a close organic connection between the manpower section of my Department, and the IDA, on this matter of setting up of industry.  I appreciate, and I do not wish to evade my responsibilities in this matter, that crucial to the success of all our plans is the attainment of a rapid advance towards full employment.  This is a goal which has eluded every administration in the history of this State, some worse than others.  It is true that this goal of reducing unemployment to acceptable levels has eluded all administrations of the State so far.</P>
    <P>During this period of early EEC membership it is obvious that the entire economy is undergoing severe strains, strains which nobody, looking at the situation a year ago, could have anticipated.  There is no reason why, however, with the correct policies in the years ahead, the goal of full employment cannot be achieved. What I have stated is that it must be achieved and all our efforts must be directed towards achieving it sooner rather than later because everything is dependent on that progress towards full employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore raised the question of the OECD manpower examination. For his information a meeting will be held on the report of the examiners in Paris the week after next and a report of this meeting will be published some time later.  That report contains a great deal of illuminating material which has been of immense assistance to my Department in seeing more accurately a way ahead for the manpower section of my Department. Deputy Brugha is correct in saying that the manpower section has received little public attention, even though it is the kernel of the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1441" /> Most people, when thinking of the Department of Labour, see it as dealing solely with industrial relations.  Because so much bad news is involved with industrial relations the Department of Labour, in the manner that the news comes out, must be seen by the public to be solely concerned with the matter of industrial relations.  In fact, the real kernel of the Department's work is in the manpower area.  I am looking at this matter.  I agree with the Deputy that little is known of the Department's work in the manpower area and that there is little appreciation of what its objectives are.  These objectives are intimately connected with the achievement of full employment and are crucial to the success of the social and economic policy of the State.  Whatever administration is in charge, manpower policy will continue to be a major area of importance.  Yet, we have the absurd situation where its activities are seemingly clouded in semi-secrecy and it appears to lead an anonymous twilight existence in that its activities are not known to the public.</P>
    <P>I am having this matter closely examined.  Accepting the importance of public awareness of the manpower section, I have assigned a press officer to that section as I regard it as the kernel of the Department of Labour, I have discussed projects that would lead to greater public interest and co-operatiton. It is essential for the success of any manpower policy that trade unions and the general public know exactly what is implied in uninteresting terms such as &ldquo; manpower policy &rdquo;.  The real economic battle of the State is joined to the question of the provision of full employment.  It is in our advance towards that goal that we can say if the State is advancing and meeting all the requirements of a modern State, whether we can afford the socially desirable things all of us want for the less privileged in our community.  The achievement of full employment is crucial to these social objectives.  The social bill for any socially just society can only be paid when the employment situation reaches the stage where we can pay the full social bill.</P>
    <P>We are also involved in the social <Col N="1442" /> policy of the Directorate of Social Affairs in the EEC.  Deputies will have noted that the consultative procedure set up for the passage of the social document has been upset somewhat by the failure of the European trade unions to agree on representation for the tripartite meeting which was to be held this week in Luxembourg.  At our last Council of Ministers meeting quite an amount of time was spent on the question of representation at the tripartite conference.  That conference was to be composed of employers and trade unions; the general idea was that what is referred to in EEC parlance as the &ldquo; social partners &rdquo;&mdash;the employers and trade unions&mdash;would consider the draft document and give their opinions on it.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, as a result of the difficulties of representation of managerial grades in France and Germany the majority of European trade unionists found it impossible to agree to the representations of these organisations and, therefore, the tripartite conference was postponed. At the Ministers meeting we had ensured that there would be Irish trade union representation in the tripartite meeting but the meeting was postponed because of failure to agree on representation.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, it was laid down in the communiqué of the summit meeting of heads of state in Paris last October that the social document should be ready in December, 1973.  Whether this schedule can be met at this stage as a result of the consultative procedure being upset by the postponement of the tripartite conference in Luxembourg is an open question.  I hope that the deadline set by the Summit Conference last October can be adhered to. There appears to be no good reason why there cannot be another Ministers meeting at which there could be a fuller exchange of views on the document.  Such an exchange of views took place at our last meeting but it was a necessarily restricted meeting largely because the problem of representation took up so much of our time.</P>
    <P>As the agency that processes the <Col N="1443" /> national claim on the social fund, we are anxious to see that social document become a reality.  As I stated on my return from the last Ministers meeting, we are anxious to see the social policy become the pace-setter for all other Community policy.  The Department of Labour, while looking after the interests of working people in Ireland, are also anxious to preserve their place in the EEC.  It is an important aspect of the Department's work that not alone must we look after the interests of Irish workers in Ireland but we must not restrict our efforts on their behalf simply to the home front.  The Irish worker is aware that what happens his counterpart in France, Belgium or Holland has an impact on his own conditions. We maintain a permanent representative in Brussels and at the International Labour Organisation in Geneva.  Our effort in these areas is to ensure that in the European Community the rules of the Community will be advantageous to Irish workers.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate a Deputy referred to safety committees.  There will have to be a change from the old voluntary principle on this matter.  In the entire country there are only 145 safety committees.  The 1955 legislation gave trade unionists and people in the work place a right to set up safety committees and full authority to proceed on this matter.  However, this legislative right has not been exploited to the full&mdash;in fact, if one looks at the figure of 145 safety committees one realises it has not been used adequately.  Even though there were only 24 fatal accidents at work last year this was 24 too many.  It is only fair to say it was a decrease on the number of fatal accidents in the previous year but it means there are too many fatal accidents in industry.  We had 3000 non-fatal accidents last year. It is obvious that we cannot remain complacent when we see that the response to this figure on the part of industry has consisted in a token 145 safety committees being established throughout the country and consideration will have to be given to making safety legislation mandatory.  It is <Col N="1444" /> questionable whether we can permit a state of affairs to continue such that when left to the goodwill of those concerned the response is only 145 safety committees.  This is irresponsible in view of the number of accidents still occurring in industry.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, at the presentation of certificates to 15 safety-first personnel who had gone through a course in Semperit, the tyre manufacturers, in Dublin I mentioned that there should be a medical kit attached to each factory.  From some of the reports at my disposal it would appear that the medical equipment of many of these kits would be more appropriate to Crimea war conditions than the requirements of industry in 1973. Obviously, consideration will have to be given to giving these medical kits greater medical relevance.   According to the reports I have the contents of many of these medical kits are only of antique value and of little help to any person involved in an accident.  Legislation may have to be continued in this area also.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond spoke of the apprenticeship document circulated by AnCO.  I have stressed that this is solely a discussion document prepared by the executive of AnCO and it does not represent the views of bodies represented on the AnCO council.  On the other hand, I stress that it is a document of immense value because it is obvious that the role of the skilled person in our work force will continue to be of great significance in the future and, it may be argued, will be of even greater significance.  The IDA and other employment-creating agencies, industrialists coming here and officials of my own Department have noted that, frequently, nothing prevents industry being set up in a particular area only the absence of skilled personnel.  In many parts of the country at present there is a scarcity of certain skilled key personnel which, if it continues, will constitute a severe brake on employment expansion.  There has been a sharp drop in the intake of apprentices; the number going through training schemes has dropped and unless this can be corrected our plans for full employment, a more just distribution of <Col N="1445" /> wealth in our society and for growing prosperity will be curtailed.  In view of these incontestable facts I think AnCO are to be commended.  It was highly praiseworthy on their part to produce and promote this document among the interests concerned and have it discussed.  I invite Deputies to discuss it in this House because questions like apprenticeship, manpower and employment policy may not make immediate headlines and the material in these areas may not particularly interest the media for a lunch-hour or evening programme and may not particularly interest the general public but the elements involved are of immense importance to the future of our economy.  I again commend this AnCO document.  The proposals, I stress, are for discussion but I hope that after discussion by all interests involved, trade unions, employees and Members of the House, we can come to some generally agreed decision to ensure that national progress is not held up in the future and that the best training facilities are provided and the highest standards followed, to ensure as Deputy Desmond said, that the training given to our young people will permit them to have adaptability as industry changes.</P>
    <P>The basic secret of teaching a skilled discipline at present is to be able to impart the core of necessary central educational material.  The person with this basic training, this necessary conceptual element of his training, is equipped to be adaptable and change as circumstances change in industry. Obviously the time has gone when we can hope that our progress can be assured by teaching by traditional methods in apprenticeship.  I hope these AnCO proposals will be considered constructively by all.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moore spoke about the redundancy appeals tribunal which has been used very widely and successfully by workers.  It deals with the eligibility of workers for redundancy pay.  Deputy Moore appeared to think the tribunal was concerned with questions as to whether the employer should or should not let workers go. That question is a main cause of disputes but the tribunal deals with <Col N="1446" /> eligibility for redundancy pay and not with this question of whether the worker should or should not be made redundant.  That is a matter of contention. The tribunal has been working successfully, I have been examining this area also to see if there are any amendments necessary.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Brugha who mentioned the problem of take-overs. He mentioned that the one human consequence which causes a great deal of hardship in such take-overs was that workers may find themselves looking for another job without having the appropriate skill.  The problem raised by Deputy Brugha is very real. As he correctly pointed out, in this area we will need a vast expansion in training and retraining facilities.  I am conscious of that.  As Deputies are aware, we have gone to the World Bank for certain financial aid for the expension of the building programme and the training programme of AnCO. Over the next few years we hope to treble our training capacity.</P>
    <P>Progress has been made in this area but not sufficient to accord with our plans for the future.  If the economic lodestone to which all our policies are directed is the attainment of full employment, obviously we cannot attract the necessary industry unless we have the appropriately trained force.  We cannot have the appropriately trained force unless we have an expansion of the training facilities. This is a big question.  Discussions are taking place on whether industry comes before the trained worker, or <i>vice versa.</i> My opinion is that we must train the work force because a trained work force is as big an attraction for industry as any financial incentive.</P>
    <P>It could be said that our State policies in general have neglected this human factor in the question of the establishment of industry.  While adequate attention is paid to the financial side of inducing industry to come here, by the IDA and other agencies of the State, and while financial policy has been well researched and well implemented&mdash;and it is recognised by all sides of the House that it is successful&mdash;we have not adequately stressed the human training side.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1447" /> There is no point in having sophisticated financial methods of inducing industry to come to a particular part of the country if we lack the necessary skills to make that industry a going concern.</P>
    <P>I made this point earlier this week at the opening of the Ballyfermot AnCo Training Centre.  I do not know whether Deputies would consider it over-Utopian to think so, but we must approach a stage where, when a worker is forced into a period of unemployment&mdash;perhaps as a result of technological change&mdash;that unemployment period is not seen simply as a period of waste.  We must transform that period of unemployment into a period of gainful productive training for the worker. I made the point in Ballyfermot that, in the academic world, it is considered that every so often the academic should have a Sabbatical, a recharging of his intellectual batteries, although the results of this recharging are often questionable.</P>
    <P>It should not be over-Utopian to suggest that it would be more in the State's interest to have an unemployed worker retrained over that period and given a new skill, rather than that he should receive State money in a barren position of unemployment.  It would be better if we could have training benefits paid to that worker so that over that unemployed period he would undergo training.  He would be in a better position to re-enter the labour market.  He would have a better chance of more skilled employment after his period of unemployment.  At present the unemployed man can only re-enter the labour market at the same level of skill as he left it.  These may seem to be over-ambitious plans but this is the direction of the thinking of my Department. We are seriously considering experiments in this direction.  I have arranged in 50 different centres around the country to have short periods of training for groups of unemployed people.  The manpower section of my Department is co-operating in this experiment. We should learn a great deal in the course of this experiment-enough to know whether we can expand this idea.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1448" /> One of the things which has always struck me as a waste of the human individual is the involuntary unemployment forced on so many Irish men and women.  This has been an area of gross failure of all Governments: the predicament in which State policy has left so many of our fellow citizens, the dead end of no job, no possibility of a job, and the unimaginative manner in which we have left it just at that level.  It is not sufficient to say to the unemployed: &ldquo; We will give you higher benefits.&rdquo;  What the unemployed man and woman want is a job.  They wish to leave their unemployed position as rapidly as possible.  The most beneficial way we can help their return to the labour market is to give them an additional skill and train them over that period.  This is the best way to build up confidence.</P>
    <P>Sociologists have noted that where there is unemployment over a long period affecting large numbers of people, the greatest casualty is the loss of self-confidence of those who are unemployed.  Sociologists have also noted that there is a malaise, mental and physical, afflicting the unemployed after a period, in which they become unemployable.  After a sufficient period of hopelessness, of despair, the unemployed man or woman becomes unemployable.  If it is national policy to bring about full employment sooner rather than later, obviously we cannot permit any longer the large-scale human misery that unemployment causes.  We cannot any longer relegate the unemployed to a No Man's Land in official thinking, to a Limbo, a place in which they are forgotten by the policy-makers.</P>
    <P>Instead, it must be our objective not to forget citizens simply because they are out of jobs but to bend all our energies to providing them with new jobs as rapidly as possible and to giving them over this period the skills that will be necessary.  We must get rid of the Victorian idea that unemployment is a kind of economic punishment doled out to those who deserve it because, as we know, part of the price of the coming of prosperity to our economy, the price of <Col N="1449" /> our economy's development, will be that there will be pockets of unemployment in the years ahead.  Because of technological changes, because of amalgamations of firms, because of job changes, and so on, certain workers might find themselves out of work over a particular period.</P>
    <P>We must not say that these people should while away the wasted hours in thinking about the past, or walking down sunlit streets, or watching their fellow-citizens at work, and generally having nothing to do.  Since unemployment as a result of structural change will be a feature of our future economic development, we must ensure that, over these periods, they take part in training which is of benefit to them and permit them to re-enter the labour force.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 7 and 8 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that, for a number of years, nursing as a career has a special attraction for Irish girls.  The demand far exceeds the number of places available.  An Bord Altranais have responsibilities in connection with the approval of curricula for nurses' training and the number of student nurses in training hospitals, but the recruitment of trainee nurses is a matter for each training hospital.  The <Col N="1452" /> present method of recruitment appears to be reasonably satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I am not clear what the Deputies have in mind in regard to the setting up by An Bord Altranais of a central register to assist applicants seeking to pursue a career in nursing.  If the Deputies have in mind a register of the hospitals which provide nurse training, such a list is contained in the career leaflet regarding nursing issued widely by the Department of Labour.  If they have in mind a register on which would be entered the names of persons who notified An Bord Altranais that they were anxious to train as nurses, such a list would be of use only if training hospitals asked for copies; but according to my information all such hospitals receive directly more applications than they can deal with.</P>
    <P>The approximate number of nursing personnel employed at present in Irish hospitals is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <i>Health Board and Voluntary Hospitals</i>
    </P>
    <P>(General and Children's)</P>
    <P>Number of qualified nurses&mdash;5,650</P>
    <P>Number of student nurses&mdash;3,500</P>
    <P>
      <i>Psychiatric Hospitals</i>
    </P>
    <P>Number of qualified nurses&mdash;4,020</P>
    <P>Number of student nurses&mdash;1,280</P>
    <P>There is no precise information available of the number of persons awaiting places in nurse training schools, as persons apply to a number of training schools in the hope of being accepted by one.</P>
    <P>While no specific study has been undertaken of the implications, in so far as nurses are concerned, of the policy decision to extend employment opportunities for married women, the matter is being kept under close surveillance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is widespread hardship by reason of the fact that large numbers of girls, who are educationally equipped, have a vocation for nursing, and who want to nurse cannot enter nursing because of the lack of facilities?  There are no openings for them in training hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1453" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is perfectly true. I remember it myself from the days of my early career.  Nursing as a career appears to have a special attraction for Irish girls.  Unfortunately, the facilities for such training are not sufficient to absorb all the girls who want to become nurses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>An Bord Altranais have functions in relation to the curriculum for nursing training and the number of student nurses appropriate in each training school.  That is their function.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some health boards have suddenly changed their requirements. They now require a student nurse to have the leaving certificate as an essential qualification for training. There were a certain number of girls who had their intermediate certificate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister any say in the qualifications?  A number of these girls were let go from the hospitals.  They had been working in them temporarily for a number of years.  Great hardship has been created among them.  I know of one hospital where ten girls were let go. There should have been a phasing-out of such girls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That would increase the problem to which Deputy Pattison referred.  Each school is responsible for recruitment and the general educational standard has been that of the leaving certificate.  If the necessary qualification was only the intermediate certificate there would be thousands more girls wishing to enter training in these nursing schools.</P>

      <P>I propose, with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>In the preparation of the recent budget the Government decided that provision should be made for the introduction in the current year of a new allowance for severely physically and mentally handicapped children under 16 years of age who are living at home and who need constant care. This was announced in the budget statement.</P>
      <P>In the course of my own contribution to the budget debate I stated that the scheme of allowances should be designed specifically to help the parents of severely handicapped children, that a sum of £450,000 would be made available for this purpose in the current financial year, and that the scheme would be introduced before 1st October, 1973.</P>
      <P>Details of the new scheme are now being worked out in my Department. When the procedures have been settled the scheme will be given appropriate publicity.  I can say at this stage, however, that it is not contemplated that the means of parents will affect the eligibility of children to participate in the scheme.</P>
      <P>As from 1st July, 1973, provision will be made for the payment of maintenance allowances to disabled persons over 16 years of age where neither the person nor the person's spouse, if any, is able to provide for maintenance.   In determining the amount of a maintenance allowance health boards will have regard to the income of the disabled person and of the spouse, if any, of that person, but income from public assistance or the means of near relatives will not be taken into account.</P>

      <P>I recognise that dental treatment facilities for medical card holders are not adequate at present. Considerable delay before treatment is received is a common feature of the present system and is a feature which I would wish to do away with at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>However, it will not be possible to introduce a scheme such as that envisaged by the Deputy in the current year, since there is no provision for such a scheme in the Estimates for my Department. The estimated cost of a service for medical card holders similar to that provided under the Department of Social Welfare's dental benefit scheme is in excess of £1 million.</P>

If the persons concerned are in receipt of <Col N="1465" /> institutional assistance it is a matter for the health board concerned to decide how much, if any, of the increases will be appropriate towards maintenance charges.  If they are in receipt of hospital treatment they would, in most cases, be entitled to services free of charge, but if a charge can be made the amount is a matter for determination by the health board.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will prepare a White Paper on the question of national pension schemes with a view to the introduction of a comprehensive occupational pension scheme which, together with the State retirement pension scheme, would provide an income amounting to two thirds of earnings at retirement and also that such schemes would provide for full transferability.</P>

      <P>As I stated in reply to a question from Deputy Briscoe on 5th June, 1973, one of my priorities in regard to social policy is the introduction of a comprehensive social security system covering all citizens and that in moving towards this objective all relevant matters, including the question of a national pension scheme would receive careful consideration. I have no plans at this stage to publish a White Paper in the matter but it is my intention to keep the public informed of all developments in regard to social policy.</P>

      <P>That is so not alone in respect of members of a trade union but there are industrial pensions as well given in total or contributed to by employees.  I have not made up my mind definitely on this yet.  The Department, probably in the Deputy's time, received a deputation from a group calling themselves the Irish Association of Pension Funds and they say they represent all organisations administering from between 60 to 80 per cent of such funds.  I would be very interested in their view on such a scheme.  I am informed they will submit proposals to my Department in the autumn and these will be considered in conjunction with the trade unions as well.</P>

      <P>Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas will not be included in the proposed extension of coverage of the social insurance scheme.  It is assumed that the second part of the Deputy's question refers to persons who became voluntary social insurance contributors when their remuneration went over the limit for compulsory insurance.  Such voluntary contributors who are employed under a contract of service will again become compulsorily insurable when the income limit is removed.

It arose on an unemployment benefit claim made on 9th March, 1973 and duly allowed from that date.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Individual meter readers employed by the ESB have recently raised again the question of their insurability under the Social Welfare Acts.  This question was the subject of a decision by an appeals officer who decided in a test case that an employment of contract of part-time meter readers by the ESB is not under a contract of service and, therefore, is not insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the plight of a meter reader who would become unemployed or have to retire due to old age.  Unfortunately, he and others like him, like the school bus drivers, are employed under a contract but not necessarily under a contract of service and insurability applies only to contracts of service.  The actual terms under which ESB meter readers are paid I am not aware of but I know it is on contract rather than contract of service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The prisoner refused to get off his bed so that the cell could be searched.  Members of the prison staff lifted him from his bed and placed him on the floor of the cell.  About 30 minutes after the search was completed the Governor received word that the prisoner was complaining of an injury to his back.  A medical officer arrived within 30 minutes but the prisoner refused medical attention on that night.  The prisoner complains that he suffers from a bad back and he was receiving medication for that back both before the date and after it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is what puzzles me. If he was suffering from a bad back and if his condition was, as I understand it to be, a condition of slipped disc, and as he had been an inmate for some time, surely it was a most unreasonable, perhaps even a dangerous procedure, to seek to have him searched in his own cell?  What was expected to be found other than that he had a slipped disc?</P>

      <P>I want to assure the House and the Deputy that I have addressed myself to the problems of the prisoners in the Curragh Camp as assiduously as I could since I became Minister for Defence.  I am trying to give them as humane treatment as is humanly possible.  The position is that this is not a proper custodial prison. Heretofore detainees there, after they had their breakfast, were brought out around the Curragh Camp.  One of the things they did over the years was to improve all the football pitches.  On wet days they worked inside in gymnasia, prepared walls for painting and so on.  It never was meant to be a custodial prison and there is a necessity to search the prison regularly. The Deputy will be aware that, last October, 11 persons attempted to escape and seven of them escaped. One person has since been apprehended and there are still six people at large.  The prison was never intended <Col N="1479" /> as a custodial prison that would stop people from escaping.  For that reason it is necessary, when the prisoners are in their cells, to search both the prison itself and the cells and this is done in the most humane way possible.</P>

      <P>I am not in any way reflecting on the overall statement that the Minister has given, but I am still puzzled as to the situation in which it was necessary to search underneath a prisoner who was already receiving treatment for a bad back.  Generally the treatment for a bad back is to stretch it out and keep it there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The file I have with me does not indicate that the prisoner had any serious condition of his back. In fact, he was playing football regularly and that sort of thing but he had complained&mdash;whenever they have their medical examination&mdash;of a bad back and he was given a rub for his back. I do not want to use a trade name here but he was also given what appear to me to be penicillin tablets, because he complained of this both before and after the incident.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The case received very careful consideration but the granting of temporary release was not considered appropriate.  I might mention that attendance at the funeral would have involved travelling outside the country and also that the prisoner in question had served less than three weeks of a five-year sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that even since this refusal other inmates, who had not been terribly long in, have been given parole to attend funerals of relatives even where it was known that the funeral was not within the boundary of the Twenty-six Counties?  This <Col N="1480" /> particular case is one of a long line of applications, most of which have been granted over the years; and, to my knowledge, no parole has ever been broken by any of these Republican prisoners.  I cannot understand why an exception should have been made in this case where the brother was tragically killed in England.  His time in or anything else would not seem to alter the merit of his case for parole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was extremely sorry that, after serious consideration of the matter, the decision that was arrived at had to be arrived at.  Indeed, I placed at the disposal of the prisoner anything that was needed in the way of visits or telephone calls or anything like that.  I instructed the Governor of the camp to provide him with anything that could possibly alleviate his distress at the time of the death of his brother.  The Deputy must remember that the request that was made&mdash;I want to be specific on this&mdash;was that he should go to Liverpool, where his brother was tragically killed.  This would have involved leaving the jurisdiction.  The prisoner who was on parole just recently did not leave the jurisdiction.  I am not saying that prisoners may not do so, but there would be a risk perhaps in the case of this prisoner that he might be apprehended in Liverpool and that perhaps even an international incident could be caused.  I was very sorry that I could not do what I would wish to do but, bearing all the facts in mind and having examined the files very carefully, the decision, which was made in line with the Department of Justice, was the only decision that could be made.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister accepts that it is not my wish to blacken the members of the Defence Forces who have this disagreeable job to do.  Will the Minister accept that in both of these incidents which occurred on the same night that the man complained of in both incidents is one and the same person?  This is something which the Minister should investigate further because of the fact that it is the same person who is complained of.  It does not appear that anybody else is assaulted when he goes into the cells of prisoners except this particular gentleman who, on both occasions, from the information I have, abused the prisoners.  I will give the Minister the name of the persons concerned so that he will investigate it.  I am not giving this information to do anybody any harm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refute any allegation that any member of the armed forces treats any prisoner improperly. However, if the Deputy wishes to give me any information on matters about which he is concerned I will be happy to accept such information. With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle I should like to give the facts of this case to the House. The prisoner continually kicked the <Col N="1483" /> cell door while the search of other cells was in progress.  I have already informed the Deputy that it is necessary at least once a month to search the prison.  There were seven escapes last October.  The governor ordered that the cell be opened so that the door could be inspected for damage. The prisoner struck the NCO who opened the door.  Two other members of the prison staff held the prisoner against the wall of the cell while the door was being inspected and subsequently the prisoner complained that his ear had been bitten.  The governor could find no evidence to substantiate this allegation.</P>
      <P>The prisoner refused to allow the medical officer to examine him on the occasion in question.  On the following day he was given an injection, at his own request.  He was seen by the doctor on duty on the evening of the 27th April, 1973.  He refused treatment. He was seen on the 28th April by the prison medical officer and was treated for a small laceration on the lobe of the left ear with a surrounding area of inflammation.  At his own request he was given a tetanus injection and he made a quick recovery.</P>

      <P>It is not the practice to make a formal allocation of capital to Dublin Corporation for local authority housing.  Because of the special urgency attached to the Corporation's programme, the position is reviewed early in each financial year by officers of the corporation and of my Department and whatever capital is required is advanced during the year. Issues from the Local Loans Fund to Dublin Corporation for local authority housing (including land acquisition) in 1972-73 amounted to £6.5 million.  The corporation's estimate of capital requirements for this purpose in 1973-74 is £12.35 million.</P>

      <P>Details are not available in my Department of the nature and extent of the consultations with housewives by housing authorities and their technical advisers in connection with the design of the house plans used in their schemes.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may be assurred, however, that there is a constant feedback to local authorities from their tenants of reactions to the design and layout of housing schemes.  This feedback comes through the elected representatives and the officers and consultants employed by the authorities, normally from consultations with individual tenants, including housewives, in their homes.  Special joint surveys have been carried out from time to time by bodies such as the Departments of Social Science and of Business Administration, in UCD, An Foras Forbartha and the Irish House Builders' Association.</P>
      <P>The National Building Agency have also carried out special surveys of housewives' reactions to the house designs used in agency schemes. Special attention has been given to the results of these various surveys and of similar surveys carried out in Great Britain in the preparation of the new range of generic plans which are to be used in the Government's special emergency housing programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary not consider that while the request for the lump sum might not be altogether usual, it was a 2 per cent request to cover them on specific items and that this decision conveyed to Kildare County Council last April means that reservoir which would provide water for industrial development and new housing and would obviate a fire hazard which certainly exists in Kildare at present will now be delayed for one or two years?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Final contract documents for this scheme were submitted for approval on 7th May, 1970, and approved on 2nd June, 1970.  Work commenced on the scheme in October, 1972.  The townlands directly served by the project are Kilkieran, Ardmore, Callowfinnish, Rusheenamanagh and Carna.  It is to be expected that the provision of this headworks and trunk mains scheme will, as in other areas, lead to considerable group development in the neighbourhood including the Loughaconneera and Moyrus areas.</P>
      <P>The 1970 scheme was not curtailed but I understand that a scheme mooted in 1965 envisaged the provision of water direct from public mains to the following additional townlands : Loughaconneera, Kylesalia, Rusheenyvulligan, Rusheenacholla Island, Mweenish Island, Letterdeskert, Coilleen, Moyrus, Dooyeher, Halfmace, Mace, Ardwest and Ardeast.  Schemes of that type were not proceeded with since it became necessary to reserve available capital for the financing of priority projects such as the current scheme, which encourages group development over a wide area.</P>

      <P>The <i>Third Programme Review</i> 1972-73 stated that practical work on the development of programme budgeting commenced on an experimental basis in the Departments of Education and Lands in 1969.  This statement is correct.  Some of the elements of programme budgeting-management accounting, budgetary control, performance measurement and review&mdash;have been practised in the Office of Public Works for some years but it was not until June, 1972, that work commenced on the development of an integrated programme budgeting system in that office.</P>

      <P>Presumably the advertisement to which the Deputy refers is that published in the daily newspapers on 7th June, 1973, explaining the new provisions for obtaining a refund of the proposed increase in social welfare children's allowances through the income tax system in the case of individuals whose income in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Acts exceeds £2,500 a year.  The advertisement did not state that only a small number of taxpayers earned in excess of £2,500 net income. It did, however, indicate that while all families with qualified children will receive the increased social welfare children's allowances a small group of high-income people will not benefit from the proposed increase.  This statement is based on estimates which at this juncture are necessarily tentative and which suggest that only about 5 per cent of the total number of taxpayers will be affected by the new refund provisions.</P>

      <P>With your permission, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 94, 95, and 96 together.</P>
      <P>To take the last question first, I presume that the Deputy has in mind a private research publication of last year which was based on an analysis of estate duty statistics.  This analysis suggested that 5 per cent of the population owned 72 per cent of the personal wealth.  As the author himself pointed out, however, the results of his study, based as they were on a small sample of estates examined for estate duty purposes, are subject to so many reservations that they must be approached with caution.  Apart from the statistical limitations the results are subject to other limitations-for example in regard to the valuation of assets for taxation purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly, it has by no means been proved conclusively that 72 per cent of the personal wealth of <Col N="1516" /> the country is owned by 5 per cent of the people.</P>
    <P>As to the estimation and distribution of the national wealth as a whole &mdash;which embraces as well as personal wealth other forms of wealth such as hospitals, schools, State forests, and so on&mdash;the information sought by the Deputy is not available.  The task of estimating national wealth with a reasonable degree of accuracy would be a long and complex one and has never been officially undertaken.</P>

      <P>The European Community's commitment to create a regional policy by the end of this year and in particular to bring into operation by then the principal instrument of that policy, the Regional Development Fund, is not dependent on the realisation of a particular stage of economic and monetary union.  The evolution of Community regional policy, although related to economic and monetary union, should be looked at as separate and distinct from progress towards that union.  Indeed, the realisation of an effective and stable union by 1980 presupposes in large measure the elimination during the intervening years of the major regional imbalances that exist today within the enlarged Community.  Thus, following their Summit Conference in Paris last October the Governments of the Nine recorded their agreement &ldquo;that a high priority should be given to the aim of correcting in the Community the structural and regional imbalances which might affect the realisation of economic and monetary union.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>The fulfilment of the modern, progressive and expansionary policies of the Government do not call for bans of the kind contemplated by the Deputy.

      <P>Does this mean that the people who rear these young calves will not be in the position in which we thought we would be when we went into the EEC and would get the benefit of the EEC prices?  Now, if they want to stop the export of young calves from this country, then pay a bonus or something of the kind to the man who buys them at home, but do not put a tax on the people.  I come from an area where the people are in either milk or in a small way in beef and they <Col N="1528" /> have to sell these calves.  When we went round looking to get into the EEC we told them they were going to get the benefit and apparently now it is the man who finishes the beef who will get the benefit of the full EEC prices. The man who sells the calf will not get the benefit.  I should like to get the Minister's views on that because, after all, what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander and I am speaking on behalf of the low income farmer, the man who produces the calf.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister is there any real justification for this?  I may say I have read what was said about it as published in the newspapers at the time, but is there any real justification for this tax?  Secondly, if there is justification for it, and it is something within these various regulations and laws that should be done or must be done, then I would ask the Minister to consider the restoration of the cut imposed last year to take effect this year in the beef cattle subsidy scheme which, surely to God, is cutting off the benefits to these same people who will now have this additional tax.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputies opposite know how this has arisen.  The Italians always have had the privilege of getting young cows and cattle up to six cwt.  This was temporarily suspended on account of the scarcity regulations being put into operation and they felt they were having difficulty in getting young cattle.  In France they had more than enough young cattle and this regulation came in which would enable the Italians to pay £8 more on a six cwt. animal.  I have discussed this with the farming organisations and the feeling all over the country is that the effect of this would be to drain the country of young cattle and that it would be to the benefit of the country to have the added value provision in operation before cattle left the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely nobody will disagree with the situation as outlined by the Minister, but is he not completely overlooking the obvious remedy and the benefit of doing something to encourage increased production of calves rather than restricting production by coming along now and adding an imposition of 7 per cent or 8 per cent on young cattle being exported? Surely he must realise this will have a bad effect.  His predecessor cut the subsidy and he is continuing that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The present position regarding the eradication of brucellosis is that Counties Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Mayo, Monaghan and Sligo have been declared brucellosis free and compulsory eradication measures are in operation in Counties Clare, Galway, Longford, Louth, Meath, Roscommon and Westmeath, in north-west Offaly and in that part of County Limerick west of the Shannon.</P>
      <P>Good progress has been and is being made in the eradication of the disease in the counties I mention but even in the declared brucellosis free areas, such as County Donegal, the situation must of course be carefully watched all the time to ensure that the disease free status is being maintained. It is well known that the main problem areas are in the south and I will not be fully satisfied until the task of eradication is completed there also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the incidence of brucellosis in County Donegal in the recent past and would it be fair to say that that incidence is probably as high today as it was before there was any eradication scheme when we were one of the lowest, if not the lowest, in brucellosis incidence?  Would the Minister agree that the factors that have contributed to the serious outbreaks that have arisen and which render it necessary to have a tightening up, is the movement of cattle both from the south and from the north-east?  There is said to be a racket in it and I am afraid it is having bad effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is right in saying that there is what I would describe as smuggling into Donegal from areas which are not free, but it is a very difficult matter.  There is a lot of switching of tabs.  I have gone to a considerable amount of trouble, with experts in the Department, to see if it is possible to get a foolproof tag but so far it has not been found possible. However, the position in Donegal is not as bad as Deputy Blaney's statement might give people to think.  In all, in County Donegal there are only 35 herds restricted and as the Deputy will agree there is an enormous number of herds in the county.</P>

      <P>The incidence in County Donegal may be low from a national point of view, but the incidence at the moment is not a great improvement, if an improvement at all, on what it was when the eradication scheme was initiated.  The outbreak I have referred to is of a most virulent type which has wiped out complete herds and which is being brought in, I have no doubt, not only by smuggled herds but also by cross-Border trade.</P>
