      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he will state (1) the date of commencement of the bovine tuberculosis <Col N="2" /> eradication scheme (2) the annual average number of veterinary surgeons engaged in the scheme since it commenced (3) the current size of his Department's task force and the plans, if any, for expansion of the force.</P>

      <P>The bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme commenced on 1st September, 1954.  The annual average number of veterinary surgeons engaged as principal practitioners on the scheme was 470 but, in addition, these veterinary surgeons employed about 200 veterinary practitioners as assistants for varying periods each year.  At present the task force consists of 12 veterinary surgeons but it is not proposed to expand this force as such.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries if he is aware of the steep drop in the price of fat pigs; and if he will state if this reduction is of a temporary nature, the reason for it and the prospects for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The fall in the price of fat pigs from the very high levels they had reached in recent months has been caused by the reduction in bacon prices in the British market.  This in turn arose from a surplus supply of bacon in that market.  I am advised that the present situation is of a temporary nature and that prices should improve within the next few weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that this is very serious for pig fattening units who fix their bonham prices on a two-months or three-months basis and had them fixed when this fall came? These fattening stations were already only struggling along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that it is a rather serious position but it is one that is outside our control because the trouble has arisen due to the decrease in prices in our main market, the British market.  However, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the Pigs and Bacon Commission believe that bacon prices on the British market have reached their lowest level and that in about two weeks time prices will have increased to more economic levels.  The position, of course, is not right just at present but it is pleasing to note that it is likely to change and that pig prices are likely to increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnCallanan" hpid="Mr. Callanan Mr. Callanan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callanan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary ask the Minister to consider doing something of a temporary nature for those stations to take them over this period?  This is a terrible setback for those stations, which are barely getting on their feet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is quite anxious about this position but, unfortunately, it is beyond his <Col N="4" /> control as the drop in prices is due to the fact that the price obtaining on the British market has reduced considerably during the past few months. However, as I said, this is the darkest period and we expect an improvement, taking present indications into account, in the not-too-distant future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>On what does the Parliamentary Secretary base his expectation of a betterment in the market position in the future?  Could I ask the Parliamentary Secretary for an assurance that the relativity between the price of bacon and the price of feed will be maintained at a level that will be profitable for pig feeders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that neither the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries nor the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries determines the price of bacon; that price is determined in our export outlets and the price on the British market has dropped quite recently.  But the report available to us indicates that there is a likelihood of an increase within the next few weeks.  I hope that likelihood will be realised and that there will again be an upward trend in prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary has not said on what he bases that belief.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am basing it on the report we have had from the Pigs and Bacon Commission and on whatever information departmental sources could obtain so far as the likely price trend on the British market for Irish bacon is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not so that the reason for the drop in bacon prices on the British market is the importation into that market of large quantities of Polish bacon and could the Minister make representations to the EEC Commission in Brussels to prevent this dumping of third country bacon within the EEC?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="5" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is doing just that but we cannot, of course, dictate to Britain as to how it should conduct its business.  If, as unfortunately is the case, it is purchasing bacon from other sources at present with a consequent reduction of our prices here, I suppose the Minister can make representations at EEC level but I am sure there is nothing further we can do but we are mindful of this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMGibbons" hpid="Mr. J. Gibbons Mr. J. Gibbons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Gibbons</NameTxt>
      <P>The general understanding of our entry into EEC was that our markets would not suffer by the importation into the Community of cheap supplies of bacon or any other commodity from outside the Community. What the Parliamentary Secretary seems to be saying is that, while this is in fact happening, there does not seem to be a lot he can do about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>My query is much the same as that of Deputy Gibbons.  By way of gloss I should like to ask why <Col N="6" /> such a large importation of Polish bacon was permitted at one time and so affect the London market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The lower level of bacon prices in Britain resulted from over-heavy supplies and price resistance by consumers.  The British consumers, like Irish consumers, are anxious about the price of their bacon and that militates against us.  Naturally the British Government are anxious.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPatMurphy" hpid="Mr. M.P. Murphy Mr. M.P. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Quantitative restrictions on cereal imports cannot be applied in the EEC.  Imports from third countries are subject to levies which ensure that imported grain will cost well above intervention prices and, consequently, will not depress the market for home produced cereals. Prior to accession imports of cereals were limited to quantities required to supplement home production.  That is not the case at present.  Licences prior to this were issued only to persons engaged in the cereals or feeding stuffs trade.  Now that this country is a member of the EEC we must comply with rules and regulations that are in operation within the Community.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary, and the Department of Agriculture, to show in greater detail what aids are available and how those anxious to avail of them may seek them.  Through what agency should such people make their applications?  The farming community should be given guidance as to what is available through Brussels.

It is not necessarily confined to the Department of Agriculture <Col N="11" /> and Fisheries.  Half-yearly reports are available and a White Paper is published half-yearly.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs outlined proposals in the Seanad on the 20th June.  I should like to inform the Deputy that all documentation, and official publications, are available in the Library of this House.</P>
      <P>It is the intention of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries to keep people informed of fluctuations or changes in any trends as far as that Department is concerned. Changes arise so frequently that it may be difficult to issue statements daily.</P>

I understand quite an amount has been missed already.</P>

      <P>The resolution relating to aids for farming in less favoured areas which was adopted by the Council of the EEC on 1st May, 1973, will fall to be implemented by a directive to be adopted before 1st October.  This directive will lay down criteria to be used for defining the areas which will qualify for special aids as well as the nature and level of the aids and the activities to which they can be applied.  Until the terms of the directive are finally settled, therefore, it will not be possible to draw up a list of the areas which might be eligible for these aids.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.P. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department do, in fact, subsidise loans made to farmers by the banks and the Agricultural Credit Corporation. These loans, up to a maximum of £1,000, are available to small and medium-sized farmers with gross margins not exceeding £1,500 to enable them to increase their breeding herds. The interest subsidy is 4 per cent per annum.  Under the scheme about £3.5 million has been advanced to some 5,000 farmers since its introduction in June, 1972.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, under various schemes operated by the Department substantial grants are provided towards the cost of agricultural investment.</P>
      <P>Under the EEC farm modernisation scheme, expected to come into operation early next year, investment aids equivalent to an interest rebate of 5 per cent will be provided for developing farms complying with certain conditions.</P>

In fact, while there is agreement in principle the regulations have not yet been finalised.  The Minister is watching the position carefully to ensure that when the regulations are drawn up they will be as favourable as possible so far as we are concerned.</P>

Additional moneys are being provided for investment, about which the Deputy is so anxious.</P>

      <P>In future, under the EEC programmes and policies, will not the situation be that the main aid to farmers will be in the form of cheap and readily available credit rather than any other kind of assistance? In that situation, will the Parliamentary Secretary tell us what steps he has in hand at the moment, either in regard to the credit machinery or towards enabling farmers throughout the country to prepare the development plans on which credit will be made available.</P>

We are satisfied that people are preparing for and that farmers are taking cognisance of the situation that is likely to arise as we move closer to the EEC.  I am satisfied with the progress to date.  So far as concerns the schemes the Deputy has in mind, some of them will be dealt with in a later question.  We are taking note of such schemes and the Minister will advise the agricultural sector from time to time of their rights and the effects of any changes that are likely to arise because of new conditions.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries whether a draft or drift net salmon licence has been or is intended to be issued to a minor by the Letterkenny Board of Conservators; and, if so, if he will give details of and reasons for this unusual occurrence.</P>

      <P>Applicants for salmon net fishing licences of any kind are not required to comply with a minimum age limit or furnish details of their age, and the information sought is not available.  If the Deputy has a particular case in mind and is willing to let me have the details, I will arrange to have the facts ascertained for his information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this is a matter of some importance that would require further amendment of any order made by the Parliamentary Secretary or the Department?  The Parliamentary Secretary is telling the House that there is no age limit in regard to the licences and yet we are given to understand that the main criteria on which the right to a licence is judged is on the basis of earning a living from fishing.  This is what we have all been talking about.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately, there is not an age limit, but I accept the assertion of the Deputy that it is something which must be looked into. Unfortunately, it is not there at the present time.  If the Deputy has any particular case in mind where he thinks a licence was granted through fraudulent representations, say, a person representing that the licence was in his son's name, as is alleged to have happened in some case, that is the only way it could have arisen.</P>

      <P>I made the necessary inquiries from the Letterkenny Board of Conservators.  If the Deputy had been more precise in his question, I could have been much more definite in my answer.  This question relates to the fact that there is no qualifying age for a licence. That is correct.  There is no qualifying age for a licence, but if there is some irregularity by virtue of the nonexistence of a qualifying age, and if the Deputy informs me of the irregularity he has in mind, I shall be pleased to deal with the matter without delay.</P>

      <P>While it is a matter for the board of conservators I have this information.  One applicant, who is about 17 years of age, got a licence.  His submission to the board was that he held licences in 1970 and 1972.  Deputy Blaney is in a much better position to tell us about that.  I shall not give the Deputy his name.

      <P>My Department's programme for the development of the sea fishing industry envisages a substantial expansion of the fishing fleet.  Increased State funds are being made available to an Bord Iascaigh Mhara this year for the provision of grant and loan assistance to fishermen towards the cost of new and secondhand vessels.  At present the three boatyards operated by the board are working to full capacity and I understand that the privately-owned boatyards which engage in the construction of fishing vessels are also heavily booked.</P>

In practice, <Col N="36" /> if the charity funds cannot be applied, <i>et cetera</i>, for the benefit of the charity, the commissioners will only authorise their application for a charitable purpose similar to that of the charity concerned.  In the circumstances, the specific restriction in relation to educational trusts is unnecessary for ordinary cases, and it could limit the powers of the commissioners in special cases.  The Charity Commissioners are in agreement with the proposed amendment.</P>

      <P>I am glad to agree to these amendments which are in line with what I recommended during the debate on the Committee Stage.  They get rid of what I pointed out on that occasion appeared to be an anomaly in regard to educational charities in that the proceeds of the sale of property which was held subject to an educational trust was confined to further educational purposes even though there might not be any educational purposes available.  I pointed out the last day that the three other categories of charity were not subject to that limitation.  I am very glad that the Minister accepts that now and puts educational charities on the same basis as other charities.  The two amendments have the same effect in relation to different types of charity but I would like to point out that there appears to be a printing error in the second amendment inasmuch as the proposal is to delete lines 27 and 32.  That should read lines 27 to 32.  I do not think it would make sense otherwise.</P>

If a charity is for a specific purpose and property belonging to that charity is sold then the proceeds can only be applied for that charitable purpose or as near as may be if the original purpose has failed.

      <P>In page 7, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) Notwithstanding anything previously contained in this section neither a Court nor the Board shall invest or authorise the investment of charitable funds outside Ireland unless it is satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of the charity to do so.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises out of what I said here the last day and what Deputy Haughey and other Deputies on this side of the House said.  On that occasion I did not oppose the Minister's amendment designed to broaden the <Col N="38" /> category of potential investment of charitable funds by allowing them to be invested outside the country because the Minister told us on that occasion that some charities were meeting with some difficulty in trying to find suitable investments for their funds.  I asked if it would be possible for the Minister then to tell us in some more detail what the difficulties were.  One difficulty he mentioned was the fact that we did not have a unit trust here.  I pointed out to him that we now have such trusts.  He also told us the commissioners were aware of instances in which apparently a number of small charities wanted to pool their resources and invest them together and they thought they might do it more beneficially outside.  For that reason I was loathe to oppose the Minister's amendment on the last occasion but, at the same time, I had a very considerable reservation about giving the board and the court and, through them, the trustees of charities a sort of blanket power to invest outside this country because, practically all their investment being in this country at the moment, if there was a major swing to investment outside the country that could have a damaging effect to some extent on the economy generally. I tried to meet both points of view as best I could by putting down this amendment which says that &ldquo;neither a Court nor the Board shall invest or authorise the investment of charitable funds outside Ireland unless it is satisfied that it is necessary in the interest of the charity to do so&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to try to cover the case where there is a genuine need in the interests of the charity to invest outside the country and, at the same time, I want to try to encourage the board, the court and the trustees to keep as much of their funds as possible in the country. For that reason my amendment specifies that the court or the board, as the case may be, will have to be satisfied that it was necessary to make this investment outside of the country.  The amendment is reasonable because it allows any charity which genuinely has to invest outside the country to do so and, at the same time, it does not give <i>carte blanche</i> to the court, the commissioners <Col N="39" /> or the trustees to invest outside the country.  This is a reasonable limitation on their powers of investment outside the country.</P>
    <P>As I said on both the Second and on the Committee Stages of the Bill, the Irish stock market is far bigger and far stronger and has considerably more variety of potential investment now than it had ten or 20 years ago and the number of cases in which it would be necessary in the interests of a charity to have to go outside the country would be small.  I think everybody could be happy with the partial limitation that the board and the court would have to be satisfied.  A new freedom is given to the trustees and to the board but that freedom is limited to those cases in which there is a genuine necessity.  I would ask the House to accept this amendment as a reasonable effort to meet both sides of the particular argument.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what Deputy O'Malley is getting at but, by virtue of this amendment, he will possibly preclude very good opportunities for charities to invest in new issues which come on the market because, if an application has to be made to the court or the board, the trustees may not be in time to avail of the situation.  It is a very common thing for issues to be put on the market on a certain basis and the issues very quickly stand at a premium thereafter. If this amendment were accepted that type of opportunity would be denied to charities.  I would also think that the board or the court, by virtue of their responsibility in the matter, would not sanction investment outside the country unless there was no other alternative.  They would do it for purely commercial reasons in the interests of the charity and this amendment, therefore, might be unnecessarily underlining directives to the board or the court dealing with the matter.  I would imagine that the court and the board would take the advice of those concerned in the charity before passing judgement or issuing directives.  The normal principles of patriotism would apply and the home market would be used where <Col N="40" /> possible.  For those reasons I regard the amendment as unnecessary.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by Deputy O'Malley but I cannot see the need for the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point behind Deputy O'Malley's amendment but I regret I cannot accept the amendment. As matters stand, the court and the Charity Commissioners are in duty bound to invest or to authorise the investment of charity funds only where they are satisfied that such investment is necessary and is for the benefit of the charity concerned.  The commissioners and the court have a legal obligation. Perhaps it is unfair to say it is a legal obligation, but they have an obligation in the matter of the prudent discharge of their duties and that would ensure that an investment would only be made where they were satisfied that the investment was in the interests of the charity.  To suggest that they should get a direction, as laid down in the amendment, would be to do less than justice in acknowledging the service given by the court and the commissioners over a number of years in the administration of charities.  All acts in relation to a charity must be done in the interests and for the benefit of the charity.  In addition to the protection afforded by the court and the commissioners to the beneficiaries of a charitable trust, the Attorney General has the overriding power to come to the rescue in the unlikely event of a beneficiary thinking his intervention necessary for the protection of the charity. It is, of course, preferable that investment should be made in this country and I have not the slightest doubt that this is where the commissioners and the court will direct investment.  All that is being done is restoring the pre-1961 position so that the court or the commissioners will be in a position to take advantage of more advantageous investment outside the country.  This is where the amendment is somewhat objectionable because it goes without saying that advantage will only be taken of that situation when it is in the interest of the charity.  I do not think it should be spelled out for the commissioners or the court that this is how they should do their duty.  They <Col N="41" /> have been doing their duty for a great number of years in a very satisfactory way.</P>
      <P>I shall not decry the merits of the Irish Stock Exchange as an investment medium.  It is a small stock exchange and the amount of money which could be put into it by the amalgamated charities to which he referred in the previous stage could have a serious effect on the balance within that stock exchange.  It is eminently desirable that the court or commissioners, in the odd situation which might arise, where it would be advantageous to go abroad, should be permitted to go abroad.  For the reason that it does less than justice, to the record of the service of the courts and the charity commissioners, this amendment is unnecessary.  The courts would not invest in any investment at home or abroad unless it was satisfied that it was in the interest of a charity to do so.  I regret I cannot accept this amendment because I consider it unnecessary.  Although I sympathise with the motives of Deputy O'Malley in putting it down, it is unnecessary and reflects, perhaps unfairly and unintentionally on the commissioners and the courts.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister distinguish between the court and the board as regards the information about investments?

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister has seen fit not to accept this amendment.  The reason he gave were not valid.  He suggested that <Col N="42" /> there is, in his opinion, an unintentional implication that the board or court would not do their job properly.  I do not think there is any such implication, intentional or otherwise. As I have said before on more than one occasion in this House and in the Seanad, I am well aware of the excellent work done by the board. This amendment does not in any way reflect on their competence in making investments.  It makes investments abroad somewhat less than automatic. The only requirement would be that the court or board should be satisfied that it was necessary to do it. It in no way impairs their freedom because, as the Minister says, it was the normal practice by the board in the period up to 1961 not to invest abroad anyway.  The case I made is that there is even less need to invest abroad now and my amendment would not limit their power to invest abroad in suitable cases.</P>
      <P>Deputy Esmonde made the point that this amendment would preclude trustees from subscribing to new issues. That is quite wrong because the Deputy is, I think, reading the proposed subsection on its own.  It should be the fifth subsection of a new section 32 and the question of the board being satisfied would only arise after an application was made.  It is one of these cases where an application would have to be made because the section as amended relates to cases where the powers of the trustees to invest are limited and where they apply to the board or the court for permission to go outside their existing powers.</P>
      <P>Therefore, to say that this subsection would delay the taking up of new issues or make it more difficult for trustees to subscribe to new issues is wrong because this proposed subsection would arise only when the trustees had made an application either to the board or the court to widen their powers of investment or allow them to invest in a different type of security to those which they already had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Esmonde also made the point that the board could invest outside their jurisdiction only if they have to. That is what the amendment specifies. Therefore, the points made in relation <Col N="43" /> to the amendment do not invalidate it. The amendment is on all fours with the position stated by the Minister and Deputy Esmonde.  Since this amendment would not hamstring the Commissioners or trustees, but would give a desirable guideline which ideally should be included in legislation and was put in specifically in much narrower terms in the 1961 Act, I do not see why it should not be included in this amending Bill.  I should like to ask the Minister and the House to reconsider and accept the amendment which I think desirable and can do no harm.</P>

      <P>(a) the letting of the land (including letting on leases for working any mine),</P>
      <P>(b) the digging or raising of stone, clay, gravel or other minerals on the land,</P>

    <P>(a) the Board, if they think that the doing of the act to which the statement and proposal relate (with or without modifications or alterations) would be beneficial to the charity, may make such order for or in relation to the doing of the act and any circumstances connected therewith, as they think fit, though the act is not authorised or permitted by the trust;</P>
    <P>(b)  the Board may by that order authorise the application of any moneys belonging to the charity for the act.</P>
    <P>(3) If it appears to the Board in respect of any charity comprising land of which they are trustees that the doing of any act to which this section applies would be for the benefit of the charity, they may do that act.</P>
    <P>(4) The Board may, if they think proper, authorise, with retrospective effect, any act to which this section applies done without such authority.</P>
    <P>I should like to have amendment Nos. 4, 5 and 6 taken together.  These are drafting amendments and provide for a full restatement of sections 37, 43 and 52 of the Charities Act, 1961, incorporating the amendment contained thereto in sections 13, 14 and 16 respectively of this Bill and the repeals contained in paragraphs (b) (c) and (d) of section 17.  The purpose of the amendments is to make the law easier for the reader to comprehend and to avoid legislation by reference. The House will recall that on Committee Stage there was a complete restatement of one section and Deputy O'Malley drew my attention to the fact that this principle did not seem to be carried through to other sections. The matter was re-examined and an entire new section has been written in to avoid referring back to other sections to make sense of them.</P>

      <P>The Principle Act is hereby amended by the substitution of the following new section for section 43:</P>
      <P>43.  &mdash;(1)  Where for any reason the appointment of a new trustee or new trustees of any charity appears to the Board to be necessary, the Board&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  on the application of the trustee or trustees of the charity, or</P>
      <P>(b) if there are no trustees of the charity, or they cannot be found, on the application of any person having an interest, or</P>
      <P>(c) in any case, of their own motion,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> may make&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) an order under the seal of the Board appointing a new trustee or new trustees of the charity either in substitution for or in addition to any existing trustee or trustees, or although there is no existing trustee, and</P>
    <P>(ii) an order under the seal of the Board which shall operate to vest, but subject where necessary to transfer in the books of any bank, corporation or company, the property of the charity in the persons who on the appointment are the trustees, and in so far as the property is comprised of land it shall be so vested for such estate as the Board may direct, and the order shall have the same effect as if the persons who before the appointment were the trustees (if any) had duly executed all proper conveyances of the land for such estate as the Board direct, or if there is no such person, or no such person of full capacity, then as if such person had existed and been of full capacity and had duly executed all proper conveyances of the land for such estate as the Board direct.</P>
    <P>(2) Every trustee of a charity appointed under this section shall, as well before as after the property of the charity becomes by law vested in him, have the same powers, authorities and discretions, and may in all respects act as if he had been originally appointed a trustee by the instrument (if any) creating the trust.</P>
    <P>(3) The Board may order the costs and expenses of and incidental to any application or order under this section to be paid or raised out of the property of the charity or the income thereof or to be borne and paid in such manner and by such persons as the Board may consider just.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="47" /> (4)  The Board shall&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) not less than fourteen days before the date on which they propose to make an order under this section, give public notice of the proposed order, and</P>
    <P>(b) within ten days after the date of the making of the order, give public notice of the making, and of the date of the making, of the order,</P>
    <P>in such manner as the Board consider most effectual for ensuring publicity for the proposal or order, as the case may be, and for bringing it to the attention of persons interested.</P>
    <P>(5) (a) Any person having an interest may, within twenty-one days after the day on which public notice of the making of an order under this section is given by the Board, appeal to the High Court against the making of the order.  In case the High Court is satisfied, in the circumstances of a particular case, that it is reasonable to do so, it may extend the time for bringing an appeal under this subsection.  On any appeal under this subsection the Court may make such order confirming, annulling or varying the order under this section and such order as to costs as it thinks fit, but in the case the High Court annuls or varies an order under this section which has become operative, the annulment or variation shall be without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder.</P>
    <P>(b) The Board and the trustees (if any) of the charity shall be entitled to be represented and heard on any appeal under this subsection.</P>
    <P>(c) An order under this section shall, if no appeal is brought against it within the period of twenty-one days mentioned in paragraph (a) of this subsection, become operative at the end of that period, and an order against <Col N="48" /> which an appeal is so brought shall become operative&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i) if and so far as it is confirmed by the Court, from the date of the final determination of the appeal, and</P>
    <P>(ii) if the appeal is withdrawn, from the date of the withdrawal.</P>
    <P>(6) An order under this section shall not operate further or otherwise as a discharge to any former or continuing trustee than an appointment of new trustees under any power for that purpose contained in any instrument would have operated.</P>
    <P>(7) Nothing in this section shall give power to appoint an executor or administrator.</P>
    <P>(8) Where a body corporate is appointed by order under this section to be, or a body corporate appointed under this section becomes, sole trustee of a charitable trust the terms of which provide for or require the appointment of more than one trustee, then during such time as the body corporate holds the office of trustee of the trust&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the terms of the trust shall be deemed to provide for or require the appointment of one trustee only and</P>
    <P>(b) one trustee only shall be deemed to have been originally appointed under the terms of the trust.</P>
    <P>(9) Where any land of which the ownership is registered under the Registration of Title Act, 1964, becomes vested, by order under this section, in any person or persons, the registering authority under that Act shall, upon production of a copy under the seal of the Board of the order and upon payment of the appropriate fee, register that person or those persons in the appropriate register maintained under that Act as owner (within the meaning of that Act) of the land.</P>
    <P>(10) Where an order is made by <Col N="49" /> the Board under this section, all property transferred by the order which immediately before the date of the order was standing or registered in the books of any bank, corporation or company or was entered in any register kept in pursuance of any enactment shall, upon production of a copy under the seal of the Board of the order, be transferred into the names of the persons appointed trustees by the order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill provides for the setting up of a new Department of Government to be known as the Department of the Public Service.  The establishment of this Department is an essential step in the implementation of the recommendations of the Public Services Organisation Review Group.  As Deputies are aware, this group, under the chairmanship of Mr. Liam St. John Devlin, was set up in 1966 with a very wide mandate to look into the organisation of the public services; I might quote that mandate to give some indication of the size of the task facing the new Department:</P>
      <P>Having regard to the growing responsibilities of Government to examine and report on the organisation of the Departments of State at the higher levels, including the appropriate distribution of functions as between both Departments themselves and Departments and other bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="52" /> The group reported in 1969.  Its recommendations are far-reaching and comprehensive, ranging across the whole field of our administrative institutions. There has been general agreement that this report is one of the most important public documents produced since the foundation of the State.  Before I deal with what has been decided and with what is being done on foot of these recommendations, I would like to give a brief overview of the report.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the report may conveniently be grouped under three main headings.  The first group of proposals are concerned with the structure and organisation of the public service.  They include what are, possibly, the most radical recommendations in the report&mdash;recommendations for the division of each Department into an Aireacht, responsible for policy formulation and appraisal and overall management, and a number of executive units responsible for the execution of settled policy.  Other recommendations of a structural or organisational nature deal with the creation of an appelate system and with the attainment of the unity of the public service.  This unity of the public service would be achieved, partly, by greater staff mobility and, partly, by the creation of effective systems of management and communication.</P>
    <P>This leads to the second broad group of proposals which deal with the management of the public service. They are built around the idea that the managerial functions of planning, finance, organisation and personnel should operate as communication channels through the whole public service.  In each Department, each of these functions would have is own specialist staff unit, answerable directly to the permanent head of the Department and co-ordinated on a service-wide basis by the Departments of Finance and the public service. Another important recommendation in this area is for the creation, in each Department, of a management advisory committee, consisting of the top staff, to assist the secretary, finally, there is a third and wideranging group of recommendations <Col N="53" /> for the redistribution of functions between Departments and between Departments and other bodies.</P>
    <P>Although this is only a very brief summary of the recommendations in the report, it is clear that fundamental changes are proposed in the structure and operation of our public services.  It is clear too that the management machinery of the present public service was not designed for the management of the type of public service envisaged in the report.  The Government feel that any approach to the enormous task of restructuring our public service should begin with the machinery of management and, in particular, with the central institutions. They have, therefore, decided to accept the recommendation to set up a Department of the Public Service. The implementation of this decision is the main purpose of this legislation and before I discuss this matter, I should, I think, briefly mention the other steps that are being taken.</P>
    <P>First, all Departments have been instructed to set up management advisory committees consisting in each Department of the Secretary and the top staff at assistant secretary level. In the absence of any change in the position where the secretary of a Department is the accounting officer and is, under the Ministers and Secretaries Acts, the principal officer of the Department who bears all responsibility under the Minister, it may be argued that this is not a significant innovation.  This, however, is to miss the point.  The creation of management advisory committees implies the involvement of the higher staff of each Department in the overall management of the Department's business.  I intend to take an active interest in the operation of the management advisory committees and I would hope that they would become the starting points for further development of participative management practices.</P>
    <P>Secondly, as a preliminary to the installation of the new system of management proposed by the report, specialist staff units for the functions of planning, finance, organisation, and <Col N="54" /> personnel are being set up in each Department.  There are two main problems to be faced here at the outset. The first is to decide on our initial requirements of people with the necessary skills, to see what resources of such skills are available within the public service and to supplement these resources by training and by the recruitment of any additional staff required.  The second problem is that of working out the complex pattern of communications and relationships, between these staff functions and, on the one hand, the line units of their Departments and, on the other, the Departments of Finance and the Public Service.</P>
    <P>Although the matter is more relevant to a discussion of the functions which will remain in the Department of Finance, I might mention also that the report advocated that the traditional methods of financial control should be supplemented, and perhaps eventually replaced, by a system known as programme budgeting. Programme budgeting is now being introduced in all Departments and has, in fact, made considerable progress in a number of them.  Substantial returns by way of improved planning and budgeting procedures are likely to result.</P>
    <P>A high priority was given by the report to the immediate development of a system of promotion by merit in the higher Civil Service and to the removal of all barriers to promotion arising from the concept of Civil Service class or from the Departmental location of civil servants.  Promotion is a very delicate subject in the public service and before taking any action as regards the higher Civil Service, as a first step, it was necessary to consult the staff at the levels involved.  While the complex problems have not yet been solved, the discussions have produced a joint consultative body through which the staff concerned may be able to participate in the process of public service adaptation.</P>
    <P>At the same time, Departments have been looking at the redistribution of the functions of the public service proposed in the second part of the report. While some of these proposals could <Col N="55" /> be considered on their individual merits, it would be preferable that they should be considered in the context of a unified public service in which they were made.  In particular, they should be considered in the light of one of the main themes in the report&mdash;the recommended separation of policy and execution through the division of each Department into an Aireacht and a number of executive units.  This is, as I said, probably the most radical and difficult area of the group's proposals and it has been the subject of much consideration by the Government.  While the changes proposed would ultimately involve legislation and a final decision could be made only by the Oireachtas on the Government's proposals in the matter, I would at this stage direct the attention of Deputies to two important associated issues.  First, if, as seems likely, the separation of policy and execution would produce a more efficient public service, it would be necessary and desirable to consider what changes, if any, should be made in our political procedures to take advantage of this increased efficiency.  Secondly, the highly sophisticated machinery for the public service which is entailed in the proposals for the separation of policy and execution will require an intensive programme for the development of the managerial skills of the public service.  A limited experiment on a non-statutory basis is being carried out in a few selected Departments so that the proposals can be tested by hard experience before the Oireachtas is asked to commit itself to radical change.  The Departments of Health, Industry and Commerce, Transport and Power, and Local Government were selected and joint teams from my Department and each of these Departments are at present examining the problems involved in the experiment. It is hoped that the experiments will commence to operate in some of these Departments at an early date.  This question of the structure of our public service is one which concerns all our people and I would be glad to have the opinions of Deputies on a matter which will be a primary concern of the new Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="56" /> In fact, everything done so far on foot of the report brings us back inevitably to the need for a central unit of Government to co-ordinate the process of restructuring to be carried out by the various parts of the public service.  Indeed, experience has underlined the wisdom of the statement in the recommended implementation programme given in the report that &ldquo;the first essential is the establishment of the Public Service Department&rdquo;. The Government have decided to establish a Department of the Public Service and the first purpose of the legislative proposals now before the House is to give the necessary statutory authority for this Department.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the responsibility for the staffing of the Civil Service has always been vested in the Minister for Finance.  The functions of organisation and personnel were assigned to a division of the Department of Finance originally known as the establishments division and more recently styled the personnel division. The case for the assignment of these functions together with responsibility for the co-ordination of organisation and personnel matters for the whole public service to a separate Department of the Public Service is based on a few fundamental considerations. In the first place, the review group found that, in the past, these functions have tended to be subordinated to the financial and economic responsibilities of the Department of Finance; secondly, the skills employed by the organisation and personnel functions are so different from those required by the finance and planning functions that they should be under a separate permanent Departmental head and, thirdly, it is essential that the organisation and personnel functions for the public sector should be given the status they have acquired in the private sector.  The eventual assignment to the Department of the Public Service of responsibility for the co-ordination of all public service organisation and personnel practices is a logical consequence of the acceptance of the idea of a unified public service.</P>
    <P>The assignment of the Department <Col N="57" /> of Finance and of the Public Service to the same Minister also follows the recommendations in the report.  Planning, finance, organisation and personnel are interdependent functions and it is essential that they should be co-ordinated by the same member of the Government.  Since, in our system, planning and finance are the responsibilities of the Minister for Finance, organisation and personnel must also be assigned to the same Minister.</P>
    <P>The new Department will have divisions responsible for the functions of organisation, personnel, and remuneration in the public service. Remuneration, which is really part of the personnel function, is of such importance that it merits a separate division in the new Department.  In fact, I would see this division as primarily responsible for staff relations and as providing the location where the co-operation of the public servants in the re-organisation of our public service will be secured.</P>
    <P>The report had also recommended the incorporation of two other functional units in the new Department&mdash;a procurement division and a commissioner for administrative justice. Action on these recommendations is being deferred for the moment.  The future organisation of the units of the public service dealing with such matters as accommodation and supplies must await a decision on the future of the Office of Public Works and other purchasing units in the service. As regards the commissioner for administrative justice, the net point at issue is the creation of some form of appellate machinery to deal with the complaints of those aggrieved by administrative decisions.  In the report, it was recommended that this machinery should be co-ordinated by a commissioner of administrative justice associated with the Department of the Public Service.  I propose that the relevant recommendations should be considered at an early date by the new Department in light of the experiments which I mentioned earlier are being conducted in relation to four Departments.</P>
    <P>The Government have designated the assistant secretary in charge of the personnel division of the Department <Col N="58" /> of Finance for appointment to the post of secretary to the new Department. The post of deputy secretary in charge of remuneration has been filled by promotion from within the Department of Finance and the two posts of deputy secretary for organisation and personnel have been filled by a competition which has been held by the Civil Service Commission and which was open to civil servants and noncivil servants.  The officers appointed are, of course, serving in the Department of Finance at this stage.  This opening of eligibility for the higher posts in a Department is a departure from normal practice, but it follows logically from the reminder in the report that &ldquo;In the establishment of a Public Service Department a great responsibility rests on the Government to select the right men for the top posts in this Department&rdquo;.  The open competition ensured that each appointee to these posts would have demonstrated his suitability in competition with all comers.  The need to bring the organisational and personnel skills of the public service to the highest possible levels makes it essential that these posts be filled with people with the skill and competence to begin the transformation of that service.</P>
    <P>The second main purpose of this legislation is to set up the Public Service Advisory Council&mdash;Coiste Comhairleach na Seirbhíse Poiblí&mdash;to advise the Minister for the Public Service on organisation and personnel matters in the public service.  It is proposed that this council shall report to the Minister each year and that the Minister shall cause copies of every such report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.  It is of interest to note that the review group commented, in connection with this proposed report of the Public Service Advisory Council and other material about the activities of Departments to be submitted to the Oireachtas, that</P>
    <P>While it is for the Oireachtas itself to determine its own procedures, the existence of this volume of information opens up the possibility of having Parliamentary Committees to review the activities of the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" /> Generally, the provisions relating to the council follow the recommendations of the review group.  There is to be a chairman and seven members; the chairman may not be a whole-time public servant and one of the members shall be the secretary for the time being of the Department of the Public Service.  The report recommended that four of the members should be from the private sector and four including the secretary of the Public Service Department should be from the public sector.  It would be difficult to give a satisfactory definition of the boundaries of the private and public sectors; in fact, as I shall mention later, it is difficult to give a precise definition of the public service. Consequently, the recommendation for the four and four representation is not being written into the legislation but it is my intention that four of the members will not be serving whole-time public servants in the commonly accepted sense of the term. The other four will be public servants. In advising the Minister and his Department and in keeping the Oireachtas informed on the progress of the continuous process of re-organisation of the public service, the council will, therefore, combine a wide range of experience from the public and private sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude by giving an outline of the way in which I see the new Department operating in the public service of the future, I might, perhaps, deal with some of the difficulties that arise in defining the public service. If, as recommended, we are to aim at a unified public service, we must consider carefully what the constituents of that public service are to be.  There will be no doubt that the public service includes the Civil Service and few will dispute that the officers and employees of local authorities and health authorities and of bodies financed from public moneys and established to perform functions which might well be performed by the Civil Service, are public servants. Furthermore, those semi-commercial bodies established by statute and dependent to some extent on public <Col N="60" /> funds are, in some sense, part of the public service although they may operate in a purely commercial environment.</P>
    <P>It would, however, be stretching things too far to maintain that all bodies in receipt of aid from public funds are part of the public service. Another problem arises in relation to such bodies as the Defence Forces, the Garda and the teachers whose members are undoubtedly public servants although it is hardly appropriate that they should be reviewed by the Public Service Advisory Council.</P>
    <P>On the establishment of the Department of the Public Service, all the existing organisation and personnel functions for the public service at present discharged by the Department of Finance will be transferred to it by order.  If and when it is decided to assign any further functions in relation to any other body in the public service to the new Department, this will, in almost all cases, require further legislation.  Whether or not particular public service bodies are to be designated as being within the public service in the sense in which this expression is used in the context of the Public Service Advisory Council will be decided by the Minister, and confirmed by regulations made by him in each case.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the institutions proposed, I would like to give a brief outline of how I foresee the operation of the new Department.  Its first task will be to equip itself for the renewal of the public service.  As the central unit of service-wide systems of organisation and personnel, it must first of all ensure that the levels of skill it possess and which are possessed by the organisation and personnel units in all Departments are equal to the best available.  Secondly, it must press on with the re-organisation of the public service on a fundamental basis on lines like those suggested in the report of the review group.  Finally, it must guide and co-ordinate the general structural changes required to produce a public service combining unity of purpose and efficient and effective deployment of resources with diversity of initiative <Col N="61" /> towards the attainment of national goals.  In this it will, as I have indicated, have the assistance of the advisory council.</P>
    <P>The council's functions are primarily advisory; in fact it might well be regarded as another of the channels of communication needed to secure a unified public service properly integrated into the machinery of government in the widest sense.  On the one hand, it will advise the Minister and the Oireachtas on progress in the continuous process of updating public service structures and staffing; on the other hand, it has the equally important function of keeping the public service in touch with developments outside.</P>
    <P>In the same way, the functions of organisation and personnel will be channels through which, in conjunction with the functions of planning and finance, the management of the public service is unified.  If we can succeed in building an efficient management structure for the public service, we can then proceed to use this structure to enable the Government, and the Oireachtas, to take the appropriate major policy decisions while allowing the maximum discretion in execution.  In all this, our aim must be to see that our people are served by a public service which is sensitive and responsive to their needs and aspirations and, at the same time, which is capable of initiative and the exercise of discretion.  As we move over the threshold of the European Communities, it is more than ever necessary that we should have a public service at least as good as the best European model.  The Report of the Public Services Organisation Review Group has charted the way for us; what is first required is the building of the necessary management structures and this legislation is an essential preliminary step.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeColley" hpid="Mr. Colley Mr. Colley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is, potentially, one of the most important which has ever come before this House.  It could well, not just of itself, but in consequence of what will flow from its implementation, affect the lives of every man, woman and child in this <Col N="62" /> country.  Consequently, it behoves us to give more than cursory consideration to its provisions.  I should like to mention also, for the record, that it is a Bill which was originally introduced by the previous Government.  It was impossible in the last Dáil to get time for its discussion.  I do not want to be controversial by entering into a discussion on the reason why it was not possible: the fact is that it was not introduced.</P>
      <P>In anticipation of the consideration by this, and the other House, of the Bill certain preliminary and necessary administrative arrangements were made in the Department of Finance for the setting up of the Department of the Public Service.  The result is that the principal importance of this Bill and its passing into law in so far as the Department of the Public Service is concerned is that it will give to the nucleus which already exists a legal existence and, I hope, a fillip to its activities.  It will provide for the setting up of the Public Service Advisory Council which has been dealt with in the Schedule to this Bill.</P>
      <P>I think it is appropriate that I should refer to the fact that this Bill, as everybody knows, is based on the Devlin Report on the Reorganisation and Review of the Public Service. That task was a huge and daunting one.  It was accomplished with great effectiveness and the report on it was one of tremendous clarity which is all the more creditable when one considers the complexity of the issues which were being dealt with.  Whether we agree with all, or some, or none of the recommendations we should pay a tribute to Mr. Devlin and to the members of his group.  What they attempted was to look at the whole structure which we had inherited from Britain and which was not new at the time we inherited it.  Their task was to try to revamp the whole structure of the public service in line with the requirements of a modern society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the most fundamental concept involved was the concept of what was the public service.  The Minister has indicated certain difficulties which arise in defining what is the public service.  There is a basic concept involved <Col N="63" /> in the Devlin Report.  It is impossible, in my view, to deal with this Bill without referring to the Devlin Report.  The most fundamental concept in this report is the concept of the unity of the public service.  That is which is clearly recognised as the Civil Service, the local authorities, semi-State bodies, and a number of much greyer areas, being included in the one concept of the public service.</P>
    <P>This is a concept which does not commend itself to everybody, as I am well aware.  When dealt with in practice it does produce a number of difficult problems.  Nevertheless, I am convinced that it is the right and only concept which enables us to approach any far-reaching review of our public service.  It is also essential as a concept if one is to achieve some of the things which are recommended by the Devlin group and which I think are worthwhile.  For instance, the achievement of mobility within the public service is not possible unless one can view the whole range which I have mentioned as part of the one public service. It is also not possible to ensure that there will be comparable remuneration for comparable work, without this overall concept.  These are two matters I have chosen at random to illustrate the importance of the basic concept.</P>
    <P>I am well aware, and the Minister has touched on this, that when one talks about mobility in the public service one is also talking about promotion, which is a delicate matter.</P>
    <P>What is involved here is a radical reappraisal of concepts which have been long held and have been regarded as sacrosanct.  I can see that for people who entered the public service quite a number of years ago on the basis of its existing structure and in expectation of a continuation of that structure with, barring accidents, a consequential climbing up the scale of promotion, the concepts involved in the Devlin Report may appear to be a fundamental threat to their well-being and to their well-founded expectations.</P>
    <P>There is a very delicate problem <Col N="64" /> here.  When I was Minister for Finance I was concerned about this matter and certain steps were taken. The Minister touched on this in his speech and with regard also to the consultation with the Civil Service groups involved to try to achieve an equitable solution to the numerous problems that arise under this head.  This is the right approach.  A considerable amount of give and take is required. Nevertheless, when these matters are being considered it is important that we do not lose sight of the overall objective, namely, to bring about a fundamental restructuring and improvement in the efficiency of the public service, in the service it can give to the community.  It is easy to lose sight of this overall objective and we get bogged down in the details of what people may claim to be their fundamental individual rights.  As I have indicated, the problems that arise in this regard require a high degree of consideration, of consultation and, in some instances, of generosity but we must not lose sight of the overall objective, namely giving a better service to the community.</P>
    <P>There is little doubt that at this stage in our history and when we have become members of the European Community we need to restructure the public service.  The need to do so would be even more compelling if we had not become members of the European Community.  The pressures of the modern world on the resources of the public service, the kind of tasks being set for it and the things expected from it are such that even with the highest degree of talent available in the public service we cannot get the results we want and expect unless we ensure that it is so structured as to enable public servants to give that kind of service.</P>
    <P>In modern times there have been vast advances in various techniques of management.  Some of them have been applied in the public service but some of them cannot be applied effectively without the kind of structure which is envisaged in the Devlin Report.  It is our duty to provide the <Col N="65" /> public service with the institutional framework which will enable these management techniques to be applied to the public service for the benefit of the community and of public servants. I have already referred to the problems which arise for people in the public service but it opens up a vista for them if they approach this problem properly.  If the Devlin Report is implemented, there are much greater possibilities for men and women of ability to achieve the highest posts in the public service if there is mobility of employment within the entire service.  Furthermore, the possibilities of more interesting work and of the suiting of work to the aptitude of public servants are much greater if the problem is approached on the basis recommended in Devlin.  For that reason, it would not be true to say that the possibilities for public servants are diminished in any way by the implementation of the Devlin Report.  On the contrary, they would be considerably enhanced.</P>
    <P>There are certain aspects of this Bill which, at first sight, may not indicate the very serious implications they carry.  Perhaps one of the most fundamental matters that is involved is the concept of the Aireacht.  It is true that the Bill does not contain a reference to the Aireacht but, as I said earlier, it is not possible to discuss the Bill without reference to the report from which it has its genesis and the Minister has found it necesary to refer to that.  It would be quite unreal to discuss the Bill without referring to the concept of the Aireacht, the small group around the Minister in each Department concerned primarily with policy making, as distinct from the numerically much more substantial group in the Department concerned with the execution of policy.</P>
    <P>This is a fundamentally different concept from that operated heretofore. Certainly it is possible for people to take differing views as to whether such a proposal, if implemented, would be effective and many people differ in their views on this.  I recognise a number of the difficulties that are involved in implementing the concept of the Aireacht but I am still firmly of the opinion that we should <Col N="66" /> implement this concept.  In that regard, the former Government made the decision that the concept should be implemented on a trial basis in certain selected Departments, as indicated by the Minister in his speech.</P>
    <P>There is much to be learned about how this concept would operate in practice and that is the reason we took the decision to do it on a trial basis. As in any case where a fundamental change is being made, it is simply not humanly possible to anticipate all the problems which will arise.  I have no doubt that on the operation of the experiment in the selected Departments some problems will come to light which certainly have not occurred to anybody yet.  Nevertheless, there are some problems which we can visualise and these in some cases are problems which go to the root of our concept of democracy and parliamentary control in relation to the Government and its activities.  For that reason I think we should give some consideration to these problems when discussing this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a reference in the Devlin Report&mdash;and one of the criticisms of the report was that in this regard it did not go into sufficient detail and I noticed that the Minister in his speech made only a very passing reference to it&mdash;to this problem which arises in regard to setting up some form of appeal tribunal or appeals commissioner.  What is involved here is fundamental because if we accept the concept of the Aireacht what will happen is that very many matters which are at present the subject of parliamentary question, the subject of representation, on implementation of the Aireacht concept would cease to be matters for which the Minister concerned had any responsibility. Clearly, in these circumstances the role of many Deputies might well change fundamentally.  The public would, I think, take quite some time to get accustomed to the idea that if you had a complaint about the way some Department had administered some particular scheme you were not entitled to have it raised in this House or, if you complained to the Minister concerned, he would have to <Col N="67" /> tell you that he had no function in the matter.</P>
    <P>To me this is something that needs to be considered very carefully.  So far as I could weigh it up I have done so and have come down in favour of the Aireacht principle but I am not trying to minimise the difficulties that will arise.  Apart from practical difficulties, so many people in this House and outside it have been for so long conditioned to accept the sort of structure we have and the sort of responsibility that is placed on Ministers and the Government, that to depart from that concept in relation to what numerically will probably be the great bulk of matters which are raised by way of parliamentary question or representation and to take them out of the area of Ministerial responsibility seems to me to be something that will require a great deal of education of people just to understand the theory of what is happening, not to mention the practical difficulties that can arise.</P>
    <P>Clearly, to implement this concept, even on an experimental basis in one Department, on a sufficiently full basis to enable a real trial to be made involves some legislative changes and I think also changes in the Standing Orders of this House.  I think this matter should not be left too long because, if an experiment is carried out in certain selected Departments and if at the same time we do not provide the full machinery for operating the Aireacht concept, the experiment will fail and the whole concept may be thrown out as unworkable when it will not have been fully tested.  Consequently, I urge the Minister to give urgent attention to the legal and other problems which will arise regarding the operation of the Aireacht concept even on an experimental basis.  Apart from the difficulties I have indicated of getting people to change their whole thinking and the approach they have been conditioned to have, it is essential that the form of appeal tribunal or office of appeal commissioner that is set up must be, and must be seen to be, effective in remedying the grievances of citizens.</P>
    <P>I would greatly fear the operation <Col N="68" /> of the Aireacht concept on an experimental basis unless I were satisfied that anybody who&mdash;take the Department of Industry and Commerce because it is one of those mentioned as a subject for the experiment&mdash;was dissatisfied and had a grievance about some activities of the Department, say for granting a duty-free licence, such a person should be, and should be seen to be, in a position to get satisfaction quickly in regard to such grievance.  The theory is that the Minister would lay down the policy to be followed in regard to the issue of duty-free licences for particular classes of commodities but that the executive branch of the Department would carry out that policy on a day-to-day basis and that if somebody applied for a duty-free licence and was refused it while believing, on the terms of the Minister's directive that he was entitled to such a licence, it is essential&mdash;I am taking this merely as a small example of the kind of thing involved&mdash;that the machinery be provided to enable such a person to have determined independently whether the Minister's directive had been complied with and have this done quickly so that if the directive had not been complied with the situation could be remedied without any delay.  If it transpires that the Minister's directive has been complied with, and there is a grievance about the actual directive, that is another matter.  This brings it back into the realm of this House and the responsibility of the Minister for the policy being followed.  I have taken a very simple example&mdash; perhaps it is not the best one&mdash;to try to illustrate in simple terms the kind of problems which will arise on the implementation of the Aireacht concept.</P>
    <P>I have an open mind as to the actual form of appeals tribunal which should be available, but I think two things are essential.  First, it should be seen to be independent of the executive branch of the Department and, secondly, it should be able to provide speedy redress for anybody who has a complaint to make.  It has not yet been spelled out what the relationship of the Deputies to the executive branch of Departments will be. <Col N="69" /> If one takes the kind of example which I have mentioned, if the citizen concerned goes to his local Deputy, can the Deputy or should the Deputy take up his complaint in the first instance with the executive branch of the Department?  In practice, I suppose this will happen.  The unsatisfactory aspect of that is that if the Deputy does not get satisfaction he cannot go to the Minister to complain about it, because the Minister will have no responsibility or function in relation to that particular operation.  We all have a good deal to learn about how to handle these problems and this structural machinery which would ensure that the citizen concerned can get satisfaction quickly.</P>
    <P>The Delvin Report recommended, in detail, a number of redistributions of functions of various Departments. The Minister did not touch on this matter.  I do not propose to go into it now either.  Whether one would agree with the recommendations made&mdash; and I have some reservations about a few of them&mdash;the fact remains that a great deal of time has elapsed since the recommendations were made and certain changes have occurred in our society and in our situation in the EEC, as a result of which it might well be that a fresh appraisal of the problem would produce somewhat different recommendations.  I say that merely to indicate that I think that if and when we reach the stage of distribution of functions we should not regard the Devlin recommendations in this regard as being 100 per cent sacrosanct.  A number of recommendations made in that report should be looked at again.</P>
    <P>There is also the problem that touches on the nature of our Constitution and that faces any Taoiseach, if one were to adopt in full the recommendations made in the Devlin report in regard to the redistribution of functions in Departments.  There would be a pattern of distribution of functions. It seems to me that any Taoiseach, in considering these matters, would have to consider the effect of changes which have occurred in our society, as I have indicated, and also the material available to him, and which of the Ministers available to him is most suited <Col N="70" /> for one particular area, and which Minister for another area.  A completely rigid structure would tie the hands of any Taoiseach in this regard. The Taoiseach is tied by the provisions of the Constitution which limit the number of Ministers he can appoint.  That is another reason for not approaching the Devlin recommendations in this regard as a completely rigid blueprint.  When I say that, I do not want to give the impression that I disapprove of the recommendations made because I do not.  I agree with most of them but I have reservations about some of them.</P>
    <P>While this part of the report is interesting and caught a good deal of public attention, it is by no means fundamental in relation to the rest of the recommendations in the report.  In the Bill there is provision for the setting up of the Public Services Advisory Council.  The Schedule sets out the details of the structure and operation of that council.  I regard such a council, especially in the early years, as being absolutely essential to the effective operation of the Department of the Public Service if one regards the operation of that Department effectively as fundamentally constituting the implementation of the Devlin Report in the public service.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister say that although the Schedule does not spell out what is recommended in the Devlin Report, that is, that there should be three persons from the public sector and four persons from the private sector, plus the secretary of the Department of the Public Service, the Minister intends to follow that recommendation in the setting up of the council, as I understand him.  I was glad to hear him saying that.  I think it is important that this should be so. While I appreciate that there are difficulties in defining what is the public sector and what is the private sector, nevertheless there is one aspect of this which I would urge very strongly on the Minister, and that is that it should be quite clear to everybody when the personnel of the Public Service Advisory Council is announced that the four members, as against the three members from the public sector, should be seen to be what are <Col N="71" /> commonly understood as being people in the private sector.  In other words, there should not be any suggestion, or suspicion, that the council has been loaded with people who would have a bias towards the public sector as against the private sector.</P>
    <P>I do not say this in any carping spirit.  I say it because it is perfectly understandable in human terms that when one is faced with the prospect of having implemented such a fundamentally different system from that to which one has been accustomed and in which one has grown up, for most people there is a built-in resistance to the change involved.  I believe that the Department of the Public Service are going to have an enormously difficult task in trying to bring about the changes which they must bring about. The difficulties will exist because of this in-built resistance to change and because of the belief generally held in many places that the implementation of the Devlin Report is going to downgrade and affect adversely the interests of people in the public service.</P>
    <P>For all of these reasons there is going to be a major task for the Department of the Public Services to put across the concepts in the Devlin Report, and to implement them is going to be an even greater task.  That being so, I believe it to be vitally important that the advisory council, which, in effect, is going to advise on and observe, for the benefit of the Minister, according to the Bill, but also for the benefit of the public and the Members of this House, the implementation of the Devlin Report, should be seen to be so constituted, as was recommended in the Devlin Report, that there is no apparent weighting of it in favour of the public sector, some members of whom could, as I say, have a built-in objection to the changes proposed.  Therefore, to reiterate briefly, I would regard the functions of the advisory council as being vitally important, and almost equally important I would regard the clear demonstration to the public that the constitution of the council is such that the public sector is not loading, or thought to be loading, the council in its favour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="72" /> There is one other matter I want to touch on.  From time to time, indeed, for many years, there have been talks and speeches on the possible role of parliamentary committees in relation particularly to the operation of our semi-State bodies.  This is an extremely vexed question, and I do not want to embark on that at this stage, but what I do want to say is that if the Devlin Report is implemented on the lines I have been discussing, this could well change the thinking in regard to Parliamentary committees.</P>
    <P>The Minister said something in his speech which suggested that one of the effects might be to produce parliamentary committees to examine the operations of government.  This may be so but, it seems to me that another effect, on the contrary, could well be to bring about less of a requirement for parliamentary committees in relation to semi-State bodies.  The reason I say that is that, if this concept is properly operated, then the policy terms of reference under which semi-State bodies operate will be spelled out much more clearly than they are at present in most cases, and the day-to-day operations of those bodies will be subject to the review and appeal of some kind of appeal commissioner. That is something that does not happen at the moment, and that is the main reason I think there has been such a demand from time to time for the operation of parliamentary committees to supervise semi-State bodies because their day-to-day operations are not matters which can be dealt with in this House.  It is simply as an effort to get around that difficulty, I think, that primarily there are these demands for the operation of parliamentary committees.</P>
    <P>In fact, this is one of the areas that has never been really spelled out by most people in dealing with these demands for parliamentary committees, as to whether they envisaged that the terms of reference of the committee should cover the day-to-day operations of these companies.  I would think people might, in theory, say it should be to deal with the overall policy of these companies, but in practice what most people have in <Col N="73" /> mind is the day-to-day operations to question the kind of things that cannot be questioned in this House.</P>
    <P>If, however, we implement the Devlin Report and we treat these semi-State companies, certainly the non-commercial ones, in the same way as we would treat the executive branch of any Civil Service department, then their day-to-day activities will become subject to review and appeal by whatever body or commissioner is set up to deal with this precise function.  That would be a completely new situation and would, I believe, be a considerable improvement on the present situation.  In this area you can see that the pendulum is swinging from side to side.  Originally these semi-State bodies were set up because the structure of the public service did not enable the work that was required to be done by the Civil Service with all the checks and balance and responsibility to Parliament that is involved.  But now the pendulum, having gone so far, is going back the other way. People are concerned, and rightly concerned, to ensure that the operation of these semi-State bodies should be subject to some kind of review. I believe the full implementation of the Devlin Report by the Department of the Public Service should bring about a situation where these day-to-day activities, in so far as they would depart from the terms of reference, the policy laid down for them by the Minister or the Government, as the case may be, would become subject to review.  That is a good idea and might well lead to a lessening of demand for parliamentary committees in that context, not necessarily in regard to other operations of parliamentary committees which have been envisaged from time to time.</P>
    <P>There are very many other complex aspects of this matter with which one could deal but with which I do not propose to deal here, because I realise the difficulties involved under the rules of order in dealing with this Bill and at the same time dealing with something which is not officially before the House.  Nevertheless, I hope what I have said has been sufficient to indicate, first, that I agree entirely with <Col N="74" /> this Bill, which was produced under my ministry.  I believe what is involved is of fundamental importance to everybody in this country, that it is necessary that this Department be set up, that it be given sufficient resources&mdash; and I am not merely talking of money when I say that; I am also talking of political backing&mdash;to enable it to do its job.  It has an enormous task ahead of it, a very difficult and important one.  I believe the proposed advisory council is essential in enabling the new Department of the Public Service to do its job, and that the advisory council, if constituted as visualised in the Devlin Report, will ensure that the maximum help that can be given by the advisory council will be given.</P>
    <P>I do not want to mention any names in this regard but I would strongly urge the Minister, when he is considering the appointment of members of the advisory council, to consider the appointment of some people, at least, who might be said to have a vested interest in ensuring the success of the Department of the Public Service.  He would be doing a good day's work for the new department and, indeed, for the whole community if he approached the task in that way.</P>
    <P>I have tried to indicate some of the complexities and ramifications involved in this but I have only touched on an outline of them.  I hope I have made it clear that what is involved fundamentally is so important that it could mean a complete change in the matters of ministerial responsibility to this House and of the remedy which the ordinary citizen has in dealing with any part of the public service.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the change will be detrimental, although it will be difficult to put it across.  On the contrary, I believe the change will be extremely advantageous both for the efficiency of the public service and indeed in the long term for the remedying of legitimate grievances of citizens.  But I am afraid we are a long way from that point.  This Bill is designed to get the operation more under way than it has been, to give it more firm standing and commitment. For that reason I welcome and support this Bill.</P>

      <P>My welcome for this Bill must be much more qualified than Deputy Colley's.  I have the advantage in this case of talking as an ordinary Deputy who never held office.  I should like to suggest, in the first instance, that this Bill is preeminently one which, if our democratic parliamentary life was functioning properly, should go to a Special or Select Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas and be thoroughly examined there.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a typical example of an efficient Bill produced from the point of view of the administration, and I do not quarrel with it from that point of view.  Neither am I to be taken at this particular point as criticising.  I am saying in a much more positive sense that this Bill is of such an important nature and involves in itself such a possible revolution of the administration and running of the State that if Parliament is to be anything more than what it is degenerating into, a rubber stamp for the administration, if Deputies are to be any more than this, this Bill should be submitted to a properly selected Committee at least of this House for quiet, careful analysis as to its implications.</P>
      <P>This is clearly a Bill into which a lot of thought and work has gone.  I have no doubt that its advocates will be able to make a very careful case for its provisions when they are spelled out.  It has its origins back in an excellent piece of work which resulted in an excellent report, the Devlin Report, which has been referred to here.  I want to stress that there is so much involved and so much affecting the effectiveness of the Parliament of this country and the constitutional set-up of this country implied in this Bill that we should not merely pass it as a routine measure setting up another Department. That is the first point I want to make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember, when the Deputy who is now Minister for Finance and his colleagues were on this side of the House, being very concerned, in regard to a Referendum Bill, about the generality of the provisions and <Col N="76" /> about what was not explicitly written into it.  This is a Bill of somewhat the same nature.  When looking at it, one has to look at it very closely to see what may be involved in it.</P>
    <P>First of all, the Bill sets up a Department within the meaning of the existing Ministers and Secretaries Acts.  It does not say what the functions of this Department are to be. It says that the Minister for the Department will be the same as the Minister for the Department of Finance.  You get a clue as to what the functions are in the definition section where &ldquo;public service&rdquo; is defined. Here it is defined wide enough to bring in the semi-State bodies.  It says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Public Service&rdquo; means the Civil Service of the Government and the Civil Service of the State and such bodies established by or under statute and financed wholly or partly by means of grants or loans made by a Minister of State or the issue of shares taken up by a Minister of State as may stand designated for the time being by regulations made by the Minister after consideration of the advice (if any) of the Council in relation to the matter.</P>
    <P>First of all, we are giving a blank cheque in that we set up a Department. We are not offered in the formal way in the Bill itself an explanation as to what the Department is to be.  We have to wait until we get from the Minister an explanatory statement, which is not part of the Bill, as to how he sees this Department will function and operate.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets up a Department. Section 3 states:</P>
    <P>On the appointed day a Department of State to be styled and known as Roinn na Seirbhíse Poiblí or (in English) the Department of the Public Service shall stand established.</P>
    <P>I will leave out for the moment the second part of the Bill which deals with the establishment of the Council. That is simply setting up a separate Department.  I can read nothing more out of the Bill except that in the definition section its scope is broad <Col N="77" /> enough to cover semi-State bodies and anything else the Minister or the Civil Service administration wishes to cover.</P>
    <P>I now come to the Minister's contribution on this Bill, which is not statutory, is not mandatory and, as the lawyers say, is not evidence.  I get some clue in this as to the thinking, which is to separate the policy from the executive functions.  One can clearly see a trend through the Minister's speech to separate the financial or accounting function from the executive functions. I do not have to be told in detail the very good reasons for that line of thinking and I am not criticising efficient organisation here.  It may be an excellent idea for every Minister to organise his Department into a headquarters staff&mdash;call it Aireacht or whatever you like to call it&mdash;into executive units for carrying out the policy end.  It may be a good thing to have alongside that financial accounting structure.  That I do not quarrel with.  In fact, I commend the work and the thinking that have gone into the approach to the problem.  I want to look at it for a moment, and no one else has adverted to this so far, from the point of view of this House.</P>
    <P>If one does that, then who will be the accounting officers?  Will we find ourselves in the position in this House that the only people who will answer as accounting officers will be only those on the financial end and the whole executive end of the Civil Service will have the same alibis and the same defences as semi-State bodies have at the moment?  If we carry out the line indicated by the Minister and if the Bill is implemented on that particular basis, then it will be open to those concerned to take the same approach to whole areas of activity of the State and simply say to us that we can ask questions only in regard to the actual finances and the accounting of the finances; the money went to a particular source and that is that.</P>
    <P>If I seem to have taken a belligerent approach to the Bill I think I have revealed now the reasons why I have taken such a line.  It is not in any criticism of the excellent desire to reorganise the Civil Service and it is certainly not in any criticism of the <Col N="78" /> excellent staff work done and all the thought.  The Administration has as usual minded its business.  If I may say so, without disrespect to either the Chair or the House, I do not think we mind our business as efficiently and it is time we adverted to that aspect of our work when considering legislation of this kind.  I concede the Civil Service is doing its job from its point of view and organising itself efficiently.  It behoves us who have the responsibility of keeping the balance and making democracy work to see that our side of the work is done as efficiently.  I asked who will be the accounting officers.  In what position will this House be in future? What will the Committee of Public Accounts do in regard to any Department? What questions can legitimately be asked here in this House?</P>
    <P>It is understandable that no Government wants delays in getting work done.  No one wants delays in getting a job done and all of us have to perform our functions to the best of our ability and all of us do not want to be interrogated about our work and all of us resent any interference, if I may so describe it, in our work. But interference is part of the balance in a democratic State and democratic life generally.  It is one of the principles operating to ensure fair play and let a man be a man and not just a communal machine.</P>
    <P>I should like to press home the point about accounting to Dáil Éireann.  A great deal has been said about the accounting of semi-State bodies.  Every reasonable person will agree it would be an impossible position if, so to speak, there had to be an accounting of the smallest day-to-day expenditure. But there have been complaints from time to time about the inefficient use of money.  Mistakes have been made.  That is inevitable in any organisation, public or private.  In effect, what this House is being asked to do is to sign a cheque and ask no questions.  The House has honoured me by appointing me to the Committee of Public Accounts and, as a member of that committee, I received a letter and when I opened the envelope I found it contained the published schedule of the already published accounts of the various State <Col N="79" /> bodies.  I admit this is a courtesy, but no member of the committee may ask a question about these accounts and, if a question is asked here in this House, we are told it is not our business. We have legislated ourselves out and the accounting officer will simply give the answer that he is not accountable. That is already happening in regard to the Committee of Public Accounts, the only watchdog this House and the people have on the spending of their money.  It is the people's money that is being spent. But the people's representatives can make no further inquiry.  Indeed, there are some who will view the courtesy of being presented with these documents to which I referred earlier as not a courtesy at all but an insult.</P>
    <P>I may seem to be a little over forthright in all this but attention has to be called to the matter.  The possibility now is that the principle operating in respect of semi-State bodies will be extended to large areas of the public service and that may be done by the simple expedient of separating the financial form from the executive functions and carrying out a re-organisation or a redelineation of who accounting officers are and what their functions are.  I presume, and I hope I am right in this, that the secretary of the new Department will be in every respect on the same footing as are the secretaries of existing Departments in their capacity as accounting officers. The very fact that I pose these questions is enough to draw attention to a facet of this problem which we might easily overlook.</P>
    <P>Therefore, when the Minister comes in here and asks us to pass an efficient Bill of this nature&mdash;it is highly efficient&mdash;I think the House is negligent if it does not investigate thoroughly the mechanics of the measure and carry out that investigation in a helpful way.  I am not approaching the Bill from the point of view of saying: &ldquo;This is a Bill we will not have at any cost.  Throw it out.&rdquo;  This is not the approach of this party.  Deputy Colley was the Minister's predecessor and it is extraordinary&mdash;and the present <Col N="80" /> Minister is young enough in office to think it is extraordinary&mdash;the change that takes place in thinking by the transfer from this seat to the seat the Minister is occupying opposite. I am sure the Minister has not yet become so acclimatised to the seat he is sitting in that he will not listen to an echo from the past, if I might put it in that way.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that this Bill should be rejected.  I think it is high time we reorganised.  It is probably high time we reorganised ourselves in this House.  The question of Parliamentary Committees has been adverted to by the Minister who referred to the passage in the Devlin Report where the work of Parliamentary Committees is advocated.  If I could feel confident that the Minister, and whoever might succeed him whenever he may be succeeded, would wholeheartedly subscribe to that principle I might be converted to the idea of a speedy passage of this Bill through the House.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Colley said, I do not want to wander out of order, but the trouble about this Bill is that it does something as part of something overall that needs to be done but in the doing of which it will be committed to other factors, and one of the reasons why I should like to see it examined in the quiet of a Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas is that I feel there are in this Bill matters which need to be committed to a committee.</P>
    <P>I hope the House will sometime arrange its business so that it can be an effective instrument of democracy, so that it will not degenerate into a rubber stamp for a Government which are maintained in power because they have a couple more Deputies to vote for them, right or wrong, when they propose legislation.  The Minister quoted the report of the review group:</P>
    <P>While it is for the Oireachtas itself to determine its own procedures, the existence of this volume of information opens up the possibility of having Parliamentary Committees to review the activities of the Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="81" /> In so far as it can do this, I say &ldquo;good&rdquo;, but in so far as such a procedure could easily become one by which a committee would get only what was considered to be good for them, I should like to consider such a statement for a moment in other language.</P>
    <P>I should like to repeat that I have no intention of casting aspersions on anybody.  I accept wholeheartedly the integrity of the administration and of the people who made the report.  That is not in question and I agree with Deputy Colley's commendation of them.  However, I want to deal with the realistic factors which come into play, how machinery put up theoretically and designed to give practical effects can operate to defeat some fundamental principles.</P>
    <P>After all, democracy in its nature is an inefficient thing.  It involves a certain amount of waste and inefficiency and possibly involves incidental injustice here and there.  We then come to the question of whether it is democracy we want or whether democracy is to be thrown over for another system.  There can certainly be another system but I think our people have wanted democracy, and I am going on the basis that the people of this country want democracy to be a real thing. Indeed that is my only apology for the approach I am taking here.</P>
    <P>I might at this stage mention the points on which I question the Bill and on which I reiterate the request that the Bill should be examined by a committee, preferably a Special Committee of both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The first point I would make is that in its definition we do not know what the consequences will be in regard to the mechanics, the realities and the practicalities of responsibility to Parliament.  I have pointed out the case of semi-State bodies and I should like to know who will be the accounting officers and so forth and what their limitations will be in so far as responsibility goes.</P>
    <P>The second point is the possible pre-emption of the subjects open to Parliament in the revision of procedures and in which way Parliament can be effective.  Even the most casual observer will have noted the system by <Col N="82" /> which the State has been run in the past ten years or so.  The business of Government has become so intricate that the procedure by which the Bill comes before us means that there will be a debate on the Second Stage and a section by section debate on the Committee Stage.  Through this procedure, Deputies are not in a position to have enough information.  I have not enough information on this Bill notwithstanding the published reports and notwithstanding having listened to the Minister and his predecessor.  The most I can do is to ask for information, and unless I am given affirmative answers to questions I will not be in a position to question the provisions of the Bill, much less to contradict them.  In this situation the House becomes reduced to Deputies being able to make only incomplete contributions and the House becoming merely a rubber stamp of Ministerial proposals.  This cannot go on indefinitely.  It has not gone on indefinitely in other parliaments. The Bill should be examined from the point of view of ascertaining how far it pre-empts the options open when that fundamental problem that I have touched on is approached.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley made some interesting comments on the question of the function of the local Deputy.  In a sense, they were complementary to the questions I have asked in relation to the functions of accounting officers and who will be accounting officers and, particularly, the question regarding the separation of the financial from the Executive, to put it broadly. This being the case, I do not follow how the Aireacht or the policy section of the Minister would block questions but Deputy Colley seems to envisage this happening.  If that should be the case, this is something we must consider.  By and large, it raises, again, an interesting question for the parliamentarian.  I do not wish to go out of order on this but I hope the Ceann Comhairle will bear with me to the point that I must touch on. Deputies are extremely busy in the carrying out of personal representation work for individual constituencies but we are not as official in doing the work of Parliament for the reason I have mentioned.  I am <Col N="83" /> not sure whether our approach here will minimise the role of the Deputy as the constituency representative in the sense of the individual advocate of a constituency and maximise his role in this Chamber which is where the important work must be done in modern times when one must deal with modern, complex organisation and legislation.  I do not see that as a great objection to the Bill but I see it as something that concerns us very closely, that concerns the function of the Deputy and something that this House should decide and should not be pre-empting even in default of our own negligence to provide for the problem ourselves.</P>
    <P>Regarding the setting up of an advisory council, I see nothing wrong in such a proposal but I wonder why he must go to the trouble of setting up the council legislatively.  I think that he could do that administratively. However, I ask why he is setting up the council.  The Minister tells us that the council is to report once each year.  Is this council to be something that is interposed between this House and the Executive functions of the State?  Here is an opportunity to make a point that is very relevant in so far as semi-State bodies are concerned.  It is both wrong and dangerous to employ the devices of commissions, eternal committees, councils or advisory bodies to interpose or go alongside the simple direct constitutional relationship between Parliament and Executive.  We would get along much better and more efficiently if that direct relationship were maintained fearlessly and straightforwardly with the functions of the two parties being fairly clearly defined.  I would much rather agree among ourselves here that there are certain things we should not interfere with from day to day.  This might even concern certain types of questions with which we should not harass Departments. Rather than interpose something, let us deal straight with Ministers and Departments and let them deal straight with us.  Let us realise that they have a very definite function and that from the formation of the State they have discharged that function <Col N="84" /> very well.  Let us cut out the frills. The Minister will get no better advice in his Department than that which he receives from the head of his Department and from his senior officers in the Department.  We will get no better answers nor the country will be no better served in any way than by way of our direct relationship with the Minister, the Minister answering for his Department.</P>
    <P>What is required is organisation of both sides.  By all means let the public service procedure be reorganised and adjusted in the interest of efficiency. Let the Aireacht within the Department, if it is composed of the Minister's own officers and his headquarters staff, be made a working unit. That is efficiency and is commonsense. Let us also separate in a realistic way the accounting function within the Civil Service from the Executive function but then let it always be remembered that in the last analysis the Minister is neither the personnel manager, the production manager nor the chief accountant of his Department. He is, so to speak, the managing director of his Department and, as such, responsible in all respects and responsible to the Dáil.  It is my opinion that this Bill provides rightly when it provides within the service itself for the separation of the financial and Executive personnel into these rather closely linked units.  There must be closely and complicatedly-linked units within such a big organisation as the Civil Service but the point I wish to make is this: what we must guard against is that the ministerial responsibility to this House is not only in regard to a first portion of that function, that the responsibility to the House will not be cut down merely to an accounting responsibility and that what accounting responsibility is there is complete as it has been in the public service prior to the institution of this device of semi-State bodies which was a device which had much to recommend it from one point of view but much to criticise it from another point of view.  These, generally, are the comments I offer in respect of this Bill which is simple on its face with a definition of public service that is wide. It has laudable aims when looked at <Col N="85" /> from the point of view of the public service and from the Minister's point of view when looking inwards into his own Department.  Our function is to survey the whole field.  It is from the point of view of surveying the whole field that I make these remarks.</P>
    <P>I am always a little dubious about councils, commissions and all that.  If it is advice the Minister wants he will not do better than to listen to the experienced people around him who are also carrying responsibility.  It would be unworthy of me even to make the suggestion that it was done deliberately, but if this were to work out as a device to minimise the powers of Deputies and of Parliament to inquire into things then I would deplore it greatly and I would say you would be better without it.  In any event, I wonder how much it adds to the whole procedure.  However, there may be good internal reasons for it.  In fairness, I would be inclined to take the view that where it is something completely internal to the Civil Service and its working I would indeed be guided by the people who know most about it, that is the people working the system.</P>
    <P>If the Ceann Comhairle will pardon me I will make this concluding remark which is a little beyond the Bill.  This is yet another indicator to point out to this House the need for considering its procedures and remind it that time will not wait for it.  This Bill is relevant to that point in that I fear it pre-empts our options in that regard but this may be a suitable time to do it because the Minister has not been so long in office and the natural resistances that an officeholder or an executive has towards a parliamentary function has not, I hope, conditioned him completely. I would exhort him to recall some of the thoughts that emanate from this side of the House on this. Lastly, I should like to say something in all earnestness, not in any spirit of criticism of the sponsors and authors of the Bill, but because of what is involved. Great staff work has led to the presentation of this Bill before the House.  A great and sustained and praiseworthy effort was made to bring this Bill here.  The form of the Bill does not in that sense do justice to <Col N="86" /> what is behind it.  It would be a tribute to and a participation in that work if this House were to shake itself and to say: &ldquo;Yes, and now let us take it up here.&rdquo;  I have no doubt that there is much in what is proposed to be done. Perhaps most of what is proposed to be done should be done.  In the doing of that we could do a great deal for the effectiveness of Dáil Éireann and of parliamentary democracy in this State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach (Mr. Kelly)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had not intended to intervene in this debate and I shall do so only briefly in order to comment on the two speeches that have just been made.  So far as the words of Deputy de Valera are concerned I hope he will not think I am making a small-minded point when I say that his points of view are ones which were consistently put forward inside and outside these Houses by members of the party to which the Minister and I belong before the change of Government.  All the indignation which he expresses in regard to getting the reports of semi-State bodies, many of which, if not all of which, are working with the people's money, into the day-to-day operations of which he is prevented from inquiring, is the same indignation as we felt and expressed over many years.  I do not at all mean that as an imputation against Deputy de Valera's sincerity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know he is concerned in his heart for the welfare of the institutions of this State and I have heard him make speeches which must have been uncomfortable even for members of his own party when they were in Government so I accept entirely that what he says is sincerely intended.  I merely think it right to say that his concern about the non-accountability, and as he apprehends it the progressive non-accountability, of people who spend the people's money is not peculiar to himself alone.  Indeed, I wonder to what extent this Bill is an appropriate occasion for raising the matter in the acute form that he has done.  I can almost see the papers tomorrow giving deserved prominence to Deputy de Valera's remarks.  I do not begrudge him that prominence but I would be sorry if anything he said were to lead <Col N="87" /> the public into the belief that the Bill now before the House is an instant and powerful engine drawn up at the bastions of this democracy and with concealed battering rams inside for knocking them down.  I cannot see that in the Bill myself.</P>
    <P>I realise, although I am not as conversant with the problems as Deputy de Valera is, and certainly not as conversant with them as Deputy Colley must be, that this Bill is only the tip of the Devlin iceberg, but as a Bill it must be taken for what it says and I do not think we need concern ourselves now with what the rest of the iceberg may or may not contain.  This Bill involves in no way the shedding of the responsibility of the Government or of members of the Government to this House.  It does not itself involve, or even explicitly foreshadow, the diminution of the system of parliamentary question and the right of the individual Member to have his questions answered publicly by the Minister in charge of that branch of the public service but if and when the time comes that such legislation is before the House the remarks of Deputies de Valera and Colley would be certainly very apposite and I would have a lot of sympathy with them.  I would be very surprised&mdash;I say this as an ordinary Deputy and not as an office holder&mdash;if this Government were characterised in the future by any move towards reducing the accountability of Ministers to this House.  I do not think that is going to happen and while I do not accuse the two gentlemen who have just spoken of trying to raise a scare in that direction&mdash;Deputy Colley was very measured in what he said about the implications of the Aireacht concept and I do not at all accuse him of raising a scare&mdash;it is worth emphasising that this Bill does not carry any explicit statement or any implicit requirement that the accountability of Ministers to this House, and ultimately to the people, is going to be diminished.  I make that statement as a corrective to two very well-informed speeches that have been made before me.</P>
    <P>I am not as worried as Deputy de Valera is by the fact that the Department <Col N="88" /> of the Public Service is merely described as such while its functions are left undescribed.  I am aware that there is always a fear, and it lurks in the mind of everybody, perhaps in the minds of lawyers more than others, if he finds that a blanket institution or blanket concept is being created and he is not exactly being told what this thing is to do.  In fact, there is a sort of precedent for this.  The last occasion on which a separate Department was created was in 1956 when the Department of the Gaeltacht was set up.  The Act which established that Department described the function of the Department but in terms so general as to be merely padding.</P>
    <P>The official version of the Act is in Irish.  It is a very rare bird for that reason.  The official translation of the Act describes the function of the Department as being:</P>
    <P>to promote the cultural, social and economic welfare of the Gaeltacht; to encourage the preservation and extension of the use of Irish as a vernacular language; and, to such an extent as may be necessary or appropriate, to consult or advise with other Departments of State in respect of services administered by such Departments which affect the cultural, social and economic welfare of the Gaeltacht or which concern the national aim of restoring the Irish language.</P>
    <P>That subsection, subsection 2 of section 3 of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1956, might just have easily been left out because it did not tell the Dáil or the Seanad in 1956, and it does not tell me now, anything about what the Department of the Gaeltacht actually does.  It is a piece of padding.  It is true that the section would not have been susceptible to quite the same criticism as Deputy de Valera levelled against the Bill before us.  I feel that if the Minister, or his officials, in drafting the Bill had inserted something to the effect that the function of this new Department was to improve the standard of the public service and to co-ordinate and restructure this and that it still would not have told us anything of what was going to happen once the Department got moving.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="89" /> I understand the Deputy's concern about generalities which are put before this House and do not tell the House exactly the way things are going to work.  I have often made the point in the Seanad that what the Minister says by way of explanation in introducing a Bill is not part of the law and it will not be part of a law and nobody will be able to rely on it in any court. There is ample precedent&mdash;and precedent created by the Deputy's own party as well as by mine&mdash;for this.  The Department of the Public Service cannot without further legislation develop horrible dimensions which encroach on the institutions of the State which we have come to regard as essential.</P>
    <P>My intervention was to try to alleviate any anxiety in the minds of the public which may have been caused by the well-intentioned words of Deputy de Valera and Deputy Colley in their contributions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>The speeches that have been made during the discussion on this Bill have been very useful to me.  One thing that strikes me forcibly is that we have had fairly serious discussions about what I believe both sides of the House agree is an important Bill but yet not more than five or six Members of this House have been present during the past two hours.</P>
      <P>Having studied the Devlin Report and then having read the Bill I was surprised that the Bill contains no reference to Aireacht.  It contains no reference to the separation of the policy side and the executive side.  It contains something new, a Public Services Advisory Council.  However, as far as I can see, the essence of the Bill is in section 3, subsection (1), which states that:</P>
      <P>on the appointed day a Department of State to be styled and known as Roinn na Seirbhíse Poiblí or (in English) the Department of the Public Service shall stand established.</P>
      <P>In fact this does not specify what that Department is for other than it is a Department of the Public Service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Listening to the debate, and going back on my own experience, I agree that the examination of the public <Col N="90" /> service gone into by the eminent people who sat on the Devlin Commission was an essential and a very useful exercise.  It is obvious to anybody who has seen the increasing complexity of the different Departments of State, not to mention the semi-State bodies, that an examination of this kind was necessary.  I do not wish to engage in any sort of criticism other than to be constructive but it seems to me, looking at the Aireacht concept of having a separate advisory side to a Department of State in addition to the executive side, there is the advantage that one is not judging the execution of one's own functions.</P>
    <P>Looking at it from the point of view of a business man, one employs a person to do a job and one thinks out the policy that is to be carried out and holds that person responsible.  It is true to say that, with the increasing complexity of the Departments of State and with the broadening of their various functions, it has come about that Secretaries of Departments, and Deputy Secretaries, have found themselves in the position of having to advise Ministers and think out policies while, at the same time, having to try to execute them.  I understood that the concept of the Aireacht was to try to separate these two so that the adviser to the Minister would have the time to think out what sort of advice he should give and the person to be carrying out the policy would not be the person who would be advising.  One would then have a situation where the adviser to the Minister would be in a position to advise the Minister as to whether the policy in the developing situation was being properly carried out.  That is the concept of the Aireacht as I understood it.  Some major changes are needed in the system of appointment in the higher levels of the public service.  We should be able to call on the best talent in the country.  The existing structure has not necessarily fulfilled this function and for this reason I welcome the reference by the Minister to the question of promotion by merit.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we have mobility in the public service and this has been referred to by several speakers.  I know from personal experience that <Col N="91" /> frequently a change of job is very good for a person.  Public servants could gain if they were given an opportunity to move from one Department to another, or from a semi-State body to a similar organisation. This should be done by way of interview and, possibly, promotion and it would be helpful if there were a period of, say, three to five years in a particular job.  It would be desirable to consider the idea of promotion within the service for a limited period of time and subject to review.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach seemed to think the previous speaker had been taking an exaggerated view of the Bill but the previous speaker was right in one respect. I am sure that members of the Government parties are aware that Deputies generally are not able to give the amount of time that is necessary to legislation which could be very important. Although the Bill does not spell out the matters Deputy de Valera referred to, to some extent the Minister has referred to them and in that sense perhaps Deputy de Valera was entitled to raise the points he mentioned.</P>
    <P>It is not because I am in Opposition that I am raising anything similar. For some time I have been an advocate of the committee system&mdash; not the committee system to which our Bills are subjected at present but rather an informal committee system where Deputies who were interested in the subject matter of the sections of a Bill could tease them out with other Deputies and the Minister's advisers.  That would be a useful exercise and it would not necessarily be a major departure from the practice in this State in the last 50 years.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has referred to the Devlin Report, it may be appropriate to refer to it also.  With regard to ministerial responsibility, at paragraph 7.1.1 of the Report of Public Services Organisation Review Group it is stated:</P>
    <P>The primary influence on the present organisation of the Departments of State is the doctrine of Ministerial responsibility.  ... <Col N="92" /> Furthermore, each Minister is a corporation sole and normally all the Department's acts are the acts of its Minister.  He is responsible to Parliament for these acts and cannot devolve that responsibility on any member of his staff.</P>
    <P>7.1.2.  With the modern complexity of administration and the mass of detail to be covered, it would be impossible for any Minister to have direct personal knowledge of all the operations of his Department.</P>
    <P>That goes without saying.  Anyone with experience in administration knows that a Minister could not be in direct touch with all the matters dealt with in a large Department.  The report states:</P>
    <P>His task is not materially eased by having a Parliamentary Secretary. Nonetheless, he is not empowered by statute to delegate his powers to his civil servants.  Yet the work has to be done.  The <i>modus operandi</i> which has been adopted is to issue letters, minutes and instructions, in the name of the Minister.  An official signing the letter expresses himself as having been &ldquo;<i>directed</i> by the Minister to say&rdquo;.  The official does not sanction, he conveys the sanction of the Minister.  He does not describe himself as authorising, he speaks of the Minister authorising.</P>
    <P>With regard to the separation of policy and execution, I should like to quote Dr. Whitaker on the matter. At paragraph 13.1.1 of the report it is stated:</P>
    <P>I am not sure now if the biggest problem after all will not be one of organisation&mdash;how Secretaries and other senior officers can organise their time and work so as to get away from their desks and the harassing experiences of everyday sufficiently to read, consider and consult with others in order to be able to give sound and comprehensive advice on future development policy.</P>
    <P>Devlin savs that unless this defect is remedied the other reforms that were <Col N="93" /> suggested at best will be palliatives. The report continues:</P>
    <P>13.1.2 The problem is not new but it is now urgent.  In the Constitution it is provided that the executive power of the State should be exercised by or on the authority of the Government and the Ministers and Secretaries Act originally produced the concept of the Minister as a corporation sole responsible for every executive act of his Department.  This concept would be unworkable if literally interpreted and the civil service works on the convention that the individual civil servant acts as directed by his Minister who, when these acts are questioned, accepts responsibility. The working of such a system depends on keeping the number of cases in which the Minister is directly involved within manageable proportions; that the system still works, despite the increase in the volume of public business since 1924, can be attributed to the adoption of two devices which keep down the volume of cases for direct Ministerial attention. The first of these is that of the commission to which executive functions are assigned; the second is the State-sponsored body.  Without these devices, it is doubtful if the system could have survived.</P>
    <P>The data introduced by the Minister in his speech does not relate to anything spelled out in the Bill.  It might be a useful exercise on the part of the Minister if he were to consider an exception in this area and have some informal discussion on his opening speech.  I know that there is and has been a great deal of contention about the semi-State bodies.  From personal knowledge those I know in semi-State bodies from top executives down are doing a very tough job but I also know that the degree of accountability &mdash;I do not say this in any controversial sense&mdash;which would help to satisfy me, for instance, that the work being carried out was as efficient and as good as one would expect on behalf of the public, is not there.  If, as has been suggested, there is any possibility that the reference in the Minister's <Col N="94" /> speech to the introduction of the Devlin concept would mean that the accountability which we are not able to get in relation to the day-to-day working of semi-State bodies at present will embrace Departments of State&mdash; I can see the Minister shaking his head and I do not see this in the Bill, so I do not accept it&mdash;it would be a matter that would require reconsideration.</P>
    <P>I am very much attracted by the idea of the appointment of a Public Service Advisory Council.  The form of the council also appeals to me although I do not know why the Minister has selected four&mdash;perhaps he would enlighten me when replying &mdash;from the public sector and four from the private sector.  It is a council of seven plus the secretary of the Department.  The Bill does not say that there should be three from the public service.  I am not quarrelling with this but I should like to know the Minister's thinking on it.</P>
    <P>I am also curious to know why a member of the council who ceases for any reason to hold office cannot be eligible for reappointment as a member until the period of such cesser has elapsed.  I do not regard that as very important but wonder why it is introduced. A person might have resigned because he was ill or he might take six months leave but, perhaps, the Minister's advisers had something else in mind.  Paragraph 7 of the Schedule refers to expenses but I cannot find any reference to salaries.  Has the Minister decided that such a council would be on some sort of salary basis? Paragraph 14 (1) says that the council shall report annually to the Minister: could the council report to the Minister other than annually at his request?</P>
    <P>I should also like the Minister to spell out what exactly he is referring to when he speaks about a commissioner for administrative justice.  At first, I thought this referred to something within the public service as between civil servants and their superiors but on second thoughts it seems to refer to the public.  I should like to know what is intended.  It sounds like some kind of tribunal.  I should like to <Col N="95" /> know who will appear before the tribunal and for what purposes.  That is all I intend to say until Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to take the opportunity, on my first occasion of speaking to a Bill introduced by Deputy Ryan as Minister for Finance, of wishing him every happiness and success during his term as Minister.  I hope he will have a long term as Minister and that he will have an opportunity of implementing many of the ideas he spoke about while he is Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>At this juncture of our history this is a very important and significant Bill.  It deals with our Civil Service and appears to affect also people involved in the administration of public funds such as, I understand, people in the semi-State bodies.  Since I became a Deputy I have heard the Civil Service being complimented on many occasions for their dedication and loyalty to the country down the years.  Without doubt that is correct.  I think it will be seen that this Bill recognises this is so.</P>
      <P>This Bill is essential following our entry into Europe.  There will be changes in the administration of many Departments. This Bill is connected with the Devlin Report which was published in 1969.  It deals with our Civil Service. In his opening speech the Minister mentioned Government Departments &ldquo;and other bodies&rdquo;.  This is significant. One should take cognisance of this.  The Bill refers to semi-State bodies which distribute public funds.  This House has not the power to debate adequately on this subject.</P>
      <P>It appears that we will have an opportunity of debating many of the functions of the semi-State bodies in the future.  I do not know whether I am correct in taking that interpretation from the Minister's speech.  From the Minister's use of the words &ldquo;and other bodies&rdquo; I believe this is the proper interpretation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a Deputy I find that when one comes to deal with legislation affecting different Government Departments the rules of the House restrict <Col N="96" /> the debate.  We find different Departments being responsible for particular subjects.  No one Government Department has sufficient power to deal completely with some subjects.  This is noticeable particularly in regard to pollution.  The Department of Local Government have certain powers in regard to pollution, while the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries appear to have some power also in this regard.  The Department of Lands and the Fisheries Trust also have powers in regard to pollution.  The subject of pollution cannot be debated properly because more than one Minister has functions in this regard. The new Government Department which is being set up may make it permissible to debate such a subject when discussing the Estimate for that Department.  There are a number of subjects which are similar to pollution and which I will list later.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said:</P>
    <P>This unity of the public service would be achieved, partly, by greater staff mobility and, partly, by the creation of effective systems of management and communication.</P>
    <P>I hope this is true.  There should be proper co-ordination, communication and management.  There should be liaison between all the Departments.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that Departments have been instructed to set up management advisory committees, consisting of the top staff, to assist the secretary of the Department.  This should include the top personnel of each Government Department.  Co-ordination is essential.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that the new Department will plan for the future.  There should be a certain section in each Government Department preparing and planning for developments which will take place in this country in the future because we are now members of the European Community and must watch developments throughout the world. It is not sufficient for any Government Department to deal with a limited range of subjects.  Each Government Department should know what is happening throughout the world. There will be many changes in agricultural <Col N="97" /> trends, and in marketing and packaging of products.  The personnel in the Department of Industry and Commerce should be aware of what is happening throughout the world.  The personnel there should read papers and periodicals giving information on changes abroad.  They should be in contact with our embassies and with bodies such as Coras Tráchtála and the IDA.  The staff in such bodies should report to the Government Departments.  There should also be close liaison between the Departments.</P>
    <P>Plans have been made in various Departments which occasionally it has not been possible to carry out.  Public opinion may not have been ripe for accepting such plans.  However, it is essential that Government decisions should not be arrived at until proper consultation has taken place with people who are interested in the policy, and that when a decision is taken the plans to implement it should be properly formulated and administered.</P>
    <P>Programme budgeting, one of the matters dealt with in the Devlin Report, has been spoken about consistently over a number of years.  It is difficult to know whether any Government can plan for a number of years ahead.  Our Government makes its plans for the year ahead in the budget which is introduced in the spring of every year.  Sometimes supplementary budgets are necessary if targets have not been achieved.  Programme budgeting as outlined by the Minister in his opening address is desirable. The Government may make a decision in regard to say, milk or beef for four or five years ahead.  Such a decision should give people the confidence to invest and encourage more farmers to enter into that sphere of agriculture.  Some millions of pounds would be allocated for such a programme, and this should lead to greater stability in market and in regard to the whole structure of the Department.</P>
    <P>If programme budgeting is adopted all our embassies throughout the world should study the implications of the Government decision, knowing that this decision will be adhered to and that the programme will be carried <Col N="98" /> with effect.  Coras Tráchtála, who are represented in most of the capital cities in Europe will know, for instance, that a decision has been arrived at in regard to industry and commerce, that this will be part of our industrial policy for four or five years ahead and that this will not be changed except in the event of a change in Government. It is essential that the programme should be strictly adhered to.  We have had the First and Second Programmes for Economic Expansion.  The First may have reached some of the targets aimed at but the Second did not reach the targets set.  If programme budgeting is to operate successfully the Department of Finance and the other Departments will have to work in close communication with one another. We are not long in Europe, and our European partners will be taking a great interest in what is happening in this country.  If proper programmes are outlined by each of our Government Departments and if those programmes are strictly adhered to, this can be of immense benefit to the country.</P>
    <P>I presume the line of command in the new Department will be similar to that in the others&mdash;a secretary, assistant secretaries and so on down the line.  I note from the Minister's speech that a competition has taken place for the post of secretary of the Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned the question of promotion.  I agree with a great deal of what Deputy Brugha said in this connection.  Promotion on merit alone is absolutely essential.  I believe the vast majority of the members of the Civil Service will be pleased that promotion will be on that basis.  Because of our entry into Europe there will be greater scope than ever for any young man or woman entering the Civil Service. The number of opportunities for promotion will expand.  It will be essential for our Civil Service to be in close touch with Europe.  It is vital that people with drive and those with the best brains should obtain the top positions in the Civil Service so that complex and difficult matters can be dealt with and proper decisions arrived at.</P>
    <P>The Schedule to the Bill states that <Col N="99" /> the seven ordinary members of the Council shall be appointed by the Minister.  This is very necessary.  Many people regard civil servants as faceless people who have very little liaison with the general public.  It is healthy and good for the people to have close liaison with their civil servants.  If people come to Leinster House on deputations Ministers are quite willing to meet them.  That is a very good idea. It is desirable that our Civil Service should be in a position to explain their points of view at certain times and to explain many different decisions which are taken.  Some time ago there was discussion about one civil servant who was not able to explain his point of view.  This can happen no matter what Government are in power.</P>
    <P>Our Civil Service should have much closer liaison with the general public. An attempt was made in regard to this on the question of the community schools but I do not think it worked out very well at the time.  It was a very hot subject and I do not believe the Irish public got as good a view of the Civil Service as one would have wished. Our civil servants on many subjects would be able to give much useful information as distinct from the information given by the Government Information Bureau.  I hope in the future they will have closer contact with the public.</P>
    <P>I should like if the Minister would set out the actual direct line of command in regard to this Department. In the course of his speech the Minister dealt with the powers of Parliamentary Committees in this Department. They are certainly a very good idea.  It is essential that we have them.  Dáil Éireann should have regular debates on the activities of certain semi-State bodies.  I am not sure if this Bill will allow this to take place.  It appeared from the Minister's speech that other bodies will be included and that the Parliamentary Committees will be able to review the activities of the Government. I hope they will be able to review the working of the semi-State bodies.  Deputy de Valera and Deputy Brugha mentioned this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="100" /> Every year millions of pounds are spent by the different semi-State bodies.  While at times we may be able to review the policies of these bodies we are restricted by the rules of this House in regard to either criticism or praise of them.  Some of them are our biggest employers and they spend vast sums of money every year. They have a very important effect on the lives of every one of us.  It is a poor reflection on this House if we are not able to have very full debates on the working of those semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>We often find that there is an Estimate for two or three million pounds for some of our State Departments and debates of three or four days take place on them, but some of our semi-State bodies get millions of pounds and we are not in a position to say one word about them.  I am not happy with this situation and I hope the Parliamentary Committees mentioned by the Minister will allow us to review the workings of the semi-State bodies such as CIE, Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna, the ESB and Bord Fáilte.  It is good that the elected Members of this House should be able to air their views on the policy, the management and the complete structure of these bodies.  Some of these matters may be raised at the Committee of Public Accounts but I believe this is the only place where real power lies and where policy decisions should be made.  I should like the Minister to state in his reply if the semi-State bodies will be reviewed by these Parliamentary Committees.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with the commissioner for administrative justice. He stated:</P>
    <P>The net point at issue is the creation of some form of appellate machinery to deal with the complaints of those aggrieved by administrative decisions.</P>
    <P>I am not certain what the Minister means by this.  I hope he will enlarge on it.  I am not certain if it means a form of ombudsman, who would be in a position to deal with complaints.  I do not think he intends to go that far, but I should like the Minister to tell us exactly <Col N="101" /> what he means by this commissioner for administrative justice.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Schedule dealing with the members of the proposed Public Service Advisory Council, there will be a chairman and seven ordinary members appointed by the Minister; four will be from the private sector and the chairman, the Minister says, shall be a person who is not a fulltime member of the public service. This pleases me.  It is in keeping with the thinking behind the Committee of Public Accounts; the chairman of that body is a member of the Opposition of Dáil Éireann.  That is a good idea.</P>
    <P>I would be happier if in subsection (1) it was specifically stated that the number appointed from the private sector would be four.  This is not specified at the moment.  It is desirable that it should be.</P>
    <P>I would hope for two results from this.  First, I would hope that our semi-State bodies would be subject to review by this House.  This would be the beginning of parliamentary committees and I would hope that in time these committees would progress to debate in this House.  Whether or not that can be done under this Bill is not clear to me at the moment. Perhaps the Minister will clarify the position.  These bodies spend millions of pounds and if we cannot discuss their workings then democracy is not functioning properly, functioning as every Member of this House would wish it to function.  Secondly, it is absolutely essential to have a Public Service Department competent to review the workings of every other Department and plan for the future. I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichieRyan" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan) Richie Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the House for the manner in which Deputies contributed to the debate.  The Bill marks a point of very significant departure for the whole public service, a body to whom this State owes a very great deal.  We have every reason to be grateful to our civil servants, to everybody engaged in semi-State bodies and allied organisations for their integrity and devotion to duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="102" /> Unfortunately, the immense personal sacrifices and extraordinary application of these people often goes unhonoured. The most common reference to them in public places is usually one of derision, associated with little ladies running around with cups of tea to public servants with their feet resting comfortably on their desks.</P>
    <P>Those of us who have been privileged to be associated with civil servants know that they are in fact seriously overburdened with the weight of work which falls upon them.  This happens at most levels but particularly at the level of senior civil servants who are obliged because of our failure to reorganise the structure of the public service to deal with a mass of trivia and everyday administrative practices which become such a burden that it is virtually impossible for them to do the kind of thinking and research so very necessary if our public service is to render the best service possible to our people in these challenging times.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, if I were to list the problems, which people may not readily consider come within the ambit of the Minister for Finance, it will give some idea of the extent of the jurisdiction of the Department of Finance, a jurisdiction which extends far beyond the control of the Civil Service, planning and economic policy and the control of our finances.  The Minister for Finance, with the assistance of his advisers, is responsible for the Irish bloodstock industry through the National Stud.  He has responsibility also in the sphere of culture, since he is involved in the problems which affect both the Abbey and the Gate Theatres. He also has responsibility for Gaeleagras and particularly for the promotion of Irish throughout the whole public service.  He has responsibility for the National Science Council and for that area which has been so sadly neglected, namely, the application of science to the technological and physical requirements of this modern age.  He also has responsibility for the Sugar Company, for the Racing Board, for western development, for Ceimicí Teoranta, the Stationery Office, Fóir Teoranta, <Col N="103" /> that organisation directly concerned with collapsing industries, an organisation one might consider proper to the Department of Industry and Commerce and yet, like Ceimicí Teoranta, it comes within the direct ministerial responsibility of the Department and Minister for Finance.  He also has responsibility for the B &amp; I Shipping Company, the Valuations Office, the Office of Public Works, and all that office does, such as arterial drainage, the care of national monuments, marine works, the Shannon navigation.  He has responsibility for the Irish Life Assurance Company and the State Laboratory.  I am certain that, if I had more time, I could add to that list. That list is surely proof of our failure to reorganise and restructure our public service to meet the requirements of the present day.  We have several other Departments of State far better geared to deal with many of these problems which are still the ministerial responsibility of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a move in the right direction, in the direction of carrying out the process of restructuring the whole public service.  We are anxious to achieve unification of the Civil Service to prevent the best brains being locked away in small locations or in particular classes, unable properly to use their skills and energies because, through the laws of chance, they were recruited to a particular section. In the past men and women have been doomed to remain in unsuitable locations while other sections have been starved of the skills and expertise these people could have contributed to improve the public service if only they could have been released from the stranglehold existing structures imposed upon many of them.  We want, therefore, to achieve greater mobility which Deputy Brugha, Deputy Enright and others identified as something highly desirable.</P>
    <P>It is only through a restructuring of the whole Civil Service that we can get an adequate application of the principle of promoting people by merit.  This is not in any way to denigrate <Col N="104" /> the recognition that ought to be given to people in respect of experience and service.  As one recognises the value which can come from promotion by merit, one does not wish to stimulate fears or resentment which might arise if people thought the principle of seniority was to be totally overruled.  It is not necessary to do that, but in order to respect the principle of seniority and the value of merit it is desirable to separate the executive and policy-making functions of the Civil Service.  There are people who are more than adequate to serve on the executive side who might not be qualified to serve on the policy side.  By keeping these two wings so closely interwoven in the past we have done injustice to some people, and at the same time depreciated the value of services which the State could have got from many people with policy making aptitudes.</P>
    <P>Our anxiety is to remove the barriers to promotion caused by the location of public servants and the ancient and anachronistic classification of civil servants.  We want to redistribute the functions of the public service, but on account of the multitudinous pressures to which all Ministers and Departments of State are subjected, the truth is that nobody has yet had the time or sufficient detachment to make the right decisions in this sector, or having made them, to implement them.  We believe that the creation of this new Department will enable these decisions to be taken and implemented.  Were it to remain totally within the Department of Finance, we fear that what would happen in the future would be the same as happened in the past, that is, that this very important priority would be forced to take second place to the financial and economic demands which are made at present on the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>The private sector has long since given new status to organisation and personnel problems.  The two Houses of the Oireachtas through various measures of legislation have recognised the importance of properly organising our living national wealth, that is, our own people and their skills.  The new <Col N="105" /> Department of the Public Services will do for the public service what the Department of Labour have done for the private sector, by promoting new personnel policies which can greatly enhance our economy and make the people engaged much happier in their work.</P>
    <P>One of the principal functions of the new Department will be to promote happiness and a spirit of co-operation in the public service which, if properly operated would work to national advantage. There is a need to promote better staff relations and the Department of the Public Service will give constant attention to this point.</P>
    <P>I accept the sincerity of the words of caution uttered by Deputy Colley, Deputy de Valera and other Members of the Opposition and from this side of the House about the hidden dangers there could be in implementing legislation of this kind.  As Members will readily realise from reading this Bill, the Bill itself does not contain any dangers whatsoever.  There are no risks attached to the establishment of a new Department of the Public Service although there might well be difficulties if everything recommended in the Devlin Report were to be implemented without Parliament concerning itself with what was happening. In recent months I may have changed hats, but the head is still the same head.  I want to assure Members of the Opposition and everybody else who might be concerned that the changing of hats might change the heads, that as far as I am concerned, and I speak for my colleagues also, we are anxious to maintain the supremecy of Parliament, believing in the long run that this is the only security for the liberty of the individual and for the proper development of our society.</P>
    <P>I hope that as we are strengthening the ability of the executive to manage the affairs of State, Parliament will also revamp its own procedures.  It is no disrespect to Parliament to say that it is incapable today of applying itself in a way which will achieve maximum benefit.  I accept what Deputy Enright and others have said about the need to supervise the parliamentary children <Col N="106" />&mdash;the children which are brought into the world by statutes of Oireachtas Éireann.  I do not wish to devalue the importance of looking at the way in which money has been expended when I say that it is of very great importance to do something which the House is not doing, that is, to look ahead to what our statutory bodies should be doing next year, three years, five years or ten years ahead.  Too little attention is being given to consideration of the problems which this society will have to face as it continues to develop.  If we had proper co-operation between these statutory bodies and Members of this House through working committees we would avoid a great deal of the unnecessary carping criticism and distrust which arises because of the inadequate flow of information which exists at the present time.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise that there is nothing in this Bill or in any proposal which this Government have in mind which would in any way inhibit that process.  We are anxious to encourage it.  We are not so long in office to fear that our Ministerial wings would be clipped or our contribution in any way diminished or devalued if we had Parliamentary Committees.  We believe it would be the reverse.  We were disappointed when we were in Opposition that there was not greater speed in adopting the idea of working at Parliamentary Committees.  Now that we are in Government we will not hinder this development which we consider to be of great importance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley thanked Mr. Liam St. John Devlin and his colleagues for their monumental work.  On behalf of the Government, which were not in office when the work began and finished&mdash;some four years ago&mdash;we appreciate and express gratitude for the great sacrifices which were made by Mr. Devlin and his colleagues to produce this work.  It is important that people should recall that their services were given without monetary benefit.  Indeed the eight-member council which it is proposed to establish under this Bill will not obtain any fees or monetary reward for the services <Col N="107" /> which they will perform.  We know from experience that it is often the hard-working horse that is the one called upon when a job needs to be done well.  We anticipate it will be similar in the future.</P>
    <P>The level of fees paid to directors of State-sponsored companies is not such as will tempt the best people to give us the assistance and the advice we are looking to.  We have not made any provision for tempting them.  We believe they will be satisfied in ensuring that the job is well done, and we are sure it will be done very well indeed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley was concerned about the possibility of the Aireacht developing before it would be given legislative authority.  When I outlined the intention to allow the Aireacht idea to develop, I did so only to recommend its operation so that we would have some hindsight and some experience whenever we would come to introduce legislation to give the Aireacht concept statutory form.  It is better to do that rather than to introduce the Aireacht by legislation which would be coupled with this Bill.  In the meantime Deputy Colley and the House can be assured that Ministers will retain full responsibility for all that happens in their Departments and they will be answerable to this House for everything that happens within their Departments.  There is no intention on the part of the Government to diminish accountability in any way. It is only when the idea of the Aireacht and of Executive agencies has been tried and proved that they might, perhaps, be given legislative form.  If, in the light of experience it is considered that the recommendations, which are certainly worth trying, cannot be justified, we would not proceed with legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Colley expressed the view, also, that the Devlin recommendations concerning the distribution of functions of Government may need to be looked at again.  I assure the Deputy and the House that this is an on-going review so far as the Government are concerned.  I gave a list earlier of the many functions which fall to be performed <Col N="108" /> by the Minister for Finance. I am sure that Deputy Colley, when he held that portfolio, must have wondered also why many of them have been left in the hands of the Minister for Finance.  They were left there solely for historical reasons because many of the Departments of State which exist now did not exist in the 1920s or 1930s when these functions were first assigned to the Department of Finance.  This emphasises again the need to bring about a whole restructuring of the public service and a thorough review of the functions that are at present allocated to different Departments.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I should emphasise that before the new Department of the Public Service, which is being created in this Bill, is empowered to exercise any of the functions it is proposed to give it, an order will have to be made by the Government and it will be placed before the House.  The House can then consider it.  But I thought it only proper, when discussing the bones of the new Department, that we should indicate the flesh we propose to put on them.  The flesh will be simply, as recommended by Devlin, the transfer to the new Department of the organisational and personnel responsibilities which at present lie within the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, the review body recommended also that other functions be given to the Department of the Public Service, including those of the commissioner for administrative justice.  His function would not be that of ombudsman but rather to create the machinery which would allow a system of appeals by citizens against what they consider to be administrative malpractices.  That is something that would necessitate separate legislation after the problem had been examined carefully.  Many Members of this House on all sides have been of the opinion for a long time that there is a need to have an ombudsman system here.  However, the daily pressures imposed on every Department of State inhibited people from standing back and considering the best way of going about this.  The new Department of the Public Service <Col N="109" /> will give attention to this problem and, in that way, will probably devise the best system to ensure justice for the citizens without jeopardising in any way the efficiency of the public service.  These two are not in conflict. They should not be thought to be in conflict but the best way of not generating any conflict between them is to study the matter carefully before bringing in such a very important functionary.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera, in a speech which is very worthy of careful study by everybody concerned with our public institutions, emphasised the importance of parliamentary supervision. Much of what I have said already will have answered a great deal of his criticisms, which, I accept, were made in good faith; but I would ask the Deputy to accept the assurance from us on this side of the House that we value as much as he the standing of our parliamentary institutions and we will not do anything which could be regarded as minimising in any way their importance.  I would refer the Deputy to what I said in my opening statement.  He will find there all the assurances which any reasonable person could require.</P>
    <P>In any event, before there could be that limitation on the powers of Parliament which seems to him could arise, we would have to come into the House with new legislative proposals; Certainly, while this Government are in office, no such move will be made from this side of the House.</P>
    <P>The same Deputy and also Deputy Brugha asked why the council will report only once a year.  Deputy Brugha asked whether this would be the only communication between the council and the Minister.  I would refer the Deputy to section 5 where he will note that the general function of the council shall be to advise the Minister on the re-organisation of the public service.  The report would simply indicate the progress which had been made in the re-organisation of the public service.  It is not proposed for one moment that the council would come between the Minister and the Parliament&mdash;far from it.  The <Col N="110" /> responsibility of the Minister will be direct to this House and to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Deputy de Valera made the point that it might not be necessary to give the council statutory form.  That is a reasonable view and I accept it but, at the same time, there is as good an argument to be made against having advisory bodies unless this House has created them, because to create them without the House having control over them or responsibility for them would be to create other dangers of the kind that Deputy de Valera feared could arise.  It does not strengthen in any way the powers of the council to make it statutory.  Its function is to be an advisory one but it will in no way dictate policy.  It will be open to this House to review the council's annual report or to take any other action it may wish in regard to the council.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brugha was anxious to know why four experiments had been taken to try out the restructuring and the Aireacht idea.  One, perhaps, could have chosen some other Departments as the guinea pigs but there were valid reasons why these particular ones were chosen.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health were chosen because they are concerned with regional matters in the regional health boards and hospital boards and, therefore, have a considerable regional impact.  The Department of Local Government were chosen because, in part, they also have regional interest but they are also the Department concerned with the operation of local democracy.  We wanted to be in a position to study the consequences of this reorganisation on the operation of democracy at local level.  The Department of Industry and Commerce were also brought into the scheme to test the ideas of State-sponsored bodies, the Department of Industry and Commerce having quite a considerable number of such bodies.  The Department of Transport and Power have not merely State-sponsored bodies but they have the principal nationalised industries and all of these posed particular problems in addition to the ordinary <Col N="111" /> ones of the Civil Service, as we know it, which made it worth while to choose them.</P>
    <P>I trust I have covered the principal points raised by Members and that they will see their way to support our endeavour to bring this Department into existence at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister a question please?  I do not know if I made the point clear but I was trying to indicate to the Minister in regard to the Departments in which the Aireacht idea is to be tried out on an experimental basis, that it seemed to me that while there was a danger in trying to bring in legislation to cover the appeal situation and so on, which would arise out of that just on an experimental basis that, on the other hand, failure to do so could lead to the assumption that the experiment had failed.  I wanted to urge the Minister to consider the possibility even of temporary legislation to test the experiment. You are not really testing the experiment and in a position to make a judgement on it unless you go the whole way, which involves what I said earlier about the question of Parliamentary Questions and the effect on that.  I would like the Minister to consider that and to consider that you cannot get a fair judgement of the experiment without it.</P>

      <P>I can understand the point which Deputy Colley is making and I should like to give him the assurance that we will keep this developing situation under very close examination.  I certainly would not wish the idea to get abroad that the Aireacht was failing if it was not, nor would I like it to be thought that something was being done secretively which ought to be done in the open. However, in no way can I visualise that the right to ask Parliamentary Questions can in any way be curbed by the experimentation that is taking place at the present time.  It would not be open to a Minister to say, for instance, without legislation that he has no responsibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Col N="113" /> Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £5,627,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1974, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Lands and of the Irish Land Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick, Cavan) Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. T.J. Fitzpatrick</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Cavan</i>): Turning to the Forestry Vote, the total net provision for 1973-74 is £7,812,000, an increase of £313,000 over the 1972-73 provision. The increase of £313,000 stems largely from increased provision for wages and salaries of some £693,000 arising mainly from the impact of pay increases and price increases partly offset by a reduction of £160,000 in the grant-in-aid for land acquisition and by £216,000 expected increases in income from sales of timber.  The following is the position regarding the individual subheads:</P>
      <P>Subhead A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash;at £2,204,000 shows an increase of £331,000 over the provision for 1972-73.  The increase is mainly due to the effect of pay increases, some increase in staff numbers and an increase in the provision for housing allowances due to a change in policy whereby foresters are now encouraged to provide their own houses.  The effect of this can be seen in a reduction in the provisions for new buildings in subhead C.2.</P>
      <P>Subhead B.1&mdash;Travelling and Incidental Expenses&mdash;at £459,000 shows an increase of £74,000 over the 1971-72 provision due mainly to increased travelling costs and an increase in miscellaneous expenses such as contract cleaning.</P>
      <P>Subhead B.2&mdash;Post Office Services &mdash;at £67,000 shows a decrease of £2,000 on the 1972-73 Estimate.  The reduction is due to a decrease in the charge for postal services, partly offset by increased costs arising mainly from the extension of forest telephone services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="114" /> Subhead C.1&mdash;This is the grant-in-aid for acquisition of land.  The balance remaining in the fund at 1st April, 1973, was £575,697.  In view of the size of this balance I am providing in this Estimate a sum of £560,000 only, giving a total sum available for land acquisition for the current year of £1,135,697.</P>
    <P>The gross areas acquired in the years 1971-72 and 1972-73 were 15,076 hectares, 37,253 acres, and 14,761 hectares, 36,474 acres, respectively.</P>
    <P>Price agreement for the purchase of land for State forestry is becoming still more difficult to achieve and there is a trend towards a slower rate of closing of sales.  The scale of land valuation was, in fact, increased during 1972 and some temporary easing of the difficulties of acquisition may be expected as a result.  However, in a market where rising land values persist, it is very difficult to predict future acquisition prospects but Deputies can be assured that no effort will be spared to attain our targets for acquisition.</P>
    <P>So far as availability of money is concerned, I should point out that the total of £1,136,000 available for land acquisition in 1973-74 is the highest figure made available in one year, so that the purchase of land will not be inhibited by lack of funds.</P>
    <P>Subhead C2, Forest Development and Management, this is the main expenditure subhead in this Vote.  The major provisions in the subhead relate to the raising of nursery stock in the State forest nurseries, the establishment costs of all new plantations including ground preparation and fencing, road and bridge construction, the development of facilities for public recreation in our forests, the purchase and maintenance of all forest machinery and the hire of suitable machinery from outside sources, the general cost of maintaining and protecting all our existing acreage of forest plantations, and, finally, the cost of such timber felling and conversion as we undertake by direct labour in our forests.  The total provision for the current year at £5,527,000 shows an overall increase of £238,000 on the provision for 1972-73 and this arises largely from the cost of wage and price <Col N="115" /> increases partly offset by a reduction in building expenditure.</P>
    <P>Turning to the individual parts of this subhead, the provision under C2.1, State Forest Nurseries, at £340,000 shows an increase of £46,000 attributable to wage and price increases. Provision is made under C2.2, Establishment of Plantations, for a full planting programme of 10,000 hectares, 25,000 acres, although the sum provided at £1,636,000 is only £25,000 in excess of the 1972-73 provision.  Continued attention to the efficient use of resources has in this case largely offset the effects of rising wages and prices.</P>
    <P>Under the heading of New Roads and Buildings, C2.3, the provision of £467,000 shows a decrease of £48,000 on the 1972-73 provision.  The decrease is mainly due to a saving of £81,000 arising from a decision to encourage foresters to provide their own houses rather than to pursue a house building programme.  There is, of course, a rise in the cost of house allowance which is included under subhead A, Salaries Wages and Allowances, as a result.</P>
    <P>Provision of £826,000 under C2.5 for the replacement and maintenance of Mechanical Equipment for Forest Development and Management shows an increase of £124,000 arising partly from price increases and partly from replacement of heavy plant and machinery.</P>
    <P>Provision for general Forest Management C2.6 at £1,725,000 shows an increase of only £14,000 despite an extension of 10,000 hectares, 25,000 acres, in the area of woods and plantations to 241,782 hectares, 597,443 acres, and other increased costs.</P>
    <P>The provision for Timber Conversion C2.7 at £360,000 shows an increase of £14,000 attributable also to wage and price increases.  The provision for Amenity Development C2.4 at £171,000 shows an increase of £43,000 on the 1972-73 provision. Deputies will be aware of the many areas of &ldquo;open forest&rdquo; which have been opened for public use in recent years.  Facilities for public recreation and amenity can be provided in our <Col N="116" /> forests at a relatively low cost having regard to their value to our own people and as a tourist asset.</P>
    <P>Most towns of significant size are now within easy reach of an open forest area be it a forest park such as Lough Key, Avondale or Gougane Barra, or a more modest development providing picnicking or other facilities or simply a pleasant area to walk through.</P>
    <P>While we will continue to open new areas it is proposed that in the immediate future more emphasis will be placed on the provision of additional facilities for the visitor in areas already developed.</P>
    <P>I feel sure that Deputies will be appreciative of the work being done by the Forest and Wildlife Service in this field and will endorse the modest increase proposed to enable the work to continue.</P>
    <P>Subhead C.3, Sawmilling, at £79,000 shows an increase of £11,000 on the 1972-73 Estimate due to wage increases, increased running expenses and provision of new machinery and improved water supply.</P>
    <P>Subhead D, Grants for afforestation purposes, at £35,000 shows an increase of £10,000 over the 1972-73 provision. The increase is in line with the increased scheme of grants for the private sector of forestry announced last year.</P>
    <P>It is too early yet to measure the effects of the grant increases which were introduced only in the current planting season and are hardly likely to be fully effective until next year.</P>
    <P>In view of the fact, however, that we have had almost 1,000 inquiries for further information and that already 150 applications have been made for advisory inspections, I am hopeful that the revised grants will have the desired effect of encouraging our farmers and landowners to lay down plantations and so improve the beauty and amenity of their holdings and at the same time add to their economic value.</P>
    <P>Subhead E, Forestry Education, at £52,000 shows a decrease of £2,000 on the 1972-73 provision.  Under the arrangements initiated last year the <Col N="117" /> first group of 14 final year trainees completed their course in March, 1973.  A second group of 17 trainees will be due to complete their course in March, 1974, and a further group of approximately 14 trainees will be recruited early in the coming year.</P>
    <P>Subhead F, John F. Kennedy Park, at £48,000 shows an increase of £2,000 on the provision for 1972-73, due to wage increases and an increase in development costs.</P>
    <P>The park, while still in the developmental stage as an arboretum and forest plot area, continues, nonetheless, to attract large numbers of visitors annually.  There is little doubt that as the park is developed there will be a steady increase in the number of visitors who come to use its scientific, research and educational facilities as well as those who come merely to enjoy its recreational features.</P>
    <P>Subhead G, £107,000, relates to game development and management and provision for the current year represents an increase of some £13,000, mainly to meet rising costs.  The main expenditure under the subhead is on grants to regional game councils to assist game development schemes throughout the country.  These schemes, which are formulated and operated in consultation with the Department's advisory staff, cover a variety of activities including restocking programmes, habitat development and control of predators.  Some financial provision for tourist projects, such as the provision of shoot facilities for visiting sportsmen under a scheme sponsored jointly by my Department and Bord Fáilte, is also made available under this subhead.  The final elements in the subhead relate to game development in a number of State forests and other minor expenses affecting the game development programme.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the system for dealing with game councils' schemes has been substantially improved in recent years in consultation with the National Association of Regional Game Councils and I look forward to a continuation of the harmonious relations which have been established with that organisation as a step <Col N="118" /> towards improving and accelerating the game development programme.</P>
    <P>Each year a Game Birds Protection Order is made setting out the open seasons for the various game species and also defining &ldquo;no-shooting&rdquo; areas or sanctuaries.  The 1973 order will be made by me at an early date.  This means that it will appear somewhat later than last year but the extra time will permit the current year's breeding success to be more fully assessed and should eliminate the need for an amending order such as had to be made last year.  The number of sanctuaries established throughout the country to date stands at 26 but I hope to be able to add a few more to this network under the forthcoming order.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, my Department and Bord Fáilte are jointly engaged in stimulating the development of shooting facilities for visiting sportsmen.  A scheme is in operation whereby grants are made available to assist projects catering for out-of-State &ldquo;guns&rdquo;, subject, of course, to the maintenance of high standards of sportsmanship.  In this sector, however, there is a very clear need for strict control over people who come here to shoot&mdash;not only in relation to the numbers coming and the shooting pressure which they would exert but also as regards the actual places over which they shoot and their general attitude to shooting in Ireland.  There can be no welcome for visitors&mdash;and particularly large groups&mdash;who arrive here for game shooting without first having made <i>bona fide</i> arrangements for their shooting holiday: certainly any hotel or agency who might wish to give the impression to outsiders that there is an abundance of free game shooting in this country will get no encouragement from me, nor to my certain knowledge, from Bord Fáilte.</P>
    <P>Subhead H&mdash;is a grant-in-aid to finance a comprehensive national programme for conservation.  This year, a further £100,000, or a repeat of last year's provision is proposed.  As the Book of Estimates shows, expenditure under this subhead is not confined to the Forest and Wildlife Service; for which operates in conjunction with <Col N="119" /> example, a substantial allocation has been earmarked for the establishment by the Department of Education of a field study centre in Country Donegal.</P>
    <P>In addition to the establishment of sanctuaries to which I have already referred, the Forest and Wildlife Service has a number of important projects in hand in the wildlife conservation sector.  The most important of these is the development of a major national Wildfowl Reserve on the North Slob, Wexford, with the Greenland Whitefronted goose as the predominant feature.  Already much development has taken place and some essential buildings are at present in course of construction.  The possibility of a formal opening ceremony next spring is under consideration but this will depend largely on progress on building work.  The development of Portumna Forest as a wildlife park, in which deer will be the main&mdash;but by no means the only&mdash;attraction, was commenced during the year, A more modest development is taking place on another forest property at Lissadell, County Sligo where the primary concern is for barnacle geese.  In all of these developments the objective is not merely the obvious one of species conservation but, perhaps more important, the creation of facilities whereby the public can see and enjoy our wildlife in circumstances which will be educational as well as recreational.</P>
    <P>The research and educational aspects of wildlife conservation are continually expanding.  Some research projects, for example on native oak woodlands, deer, pine marten, <i>et cetera</i> are undertaken by Forest and Wildlife Service personnel while other aspects for example, grouse, mallard, peregrine falcon, squirrels, <i>et cetera</i> are entrusted on a commission basis to outside agencies.  In addition, some financial assistance has been made available to conservation organisations in connection with their survey and census work on numbers and distribution of certain species of wild birds.  In the educational sphere, a mobile exhibit depicting some ecological aspects of the work of the Forest and Wildlife <Col N="120" /> Service makes an annual itinerary of post primary schools and agricultural shows; an annual series of weekend residential courses at Avondale, aimed at affording youth leaders an opportunity of improving their knowledge of wildlife conservation, is now a regular feature; an information service for the public, in the form of handouts, brochures and other suitable literature is being gradually developed.</P>
    <P>On the subject of wildlife conservation generally I should perhaps say that it is quite clear to me, even from my short association with the Department, that the existing statutory framework is completely inadequate to permit a comprehensive programme to be undertaken and there is no gainsaying the need for up-to-date legislation if worthwhile progress is to be made in this very wide field.  As I indicated to the House recently, there are, in fact, draft proposals for such legislation in my Department and I am at present studying these with a view to making an early submission to the Government in the matter.</P>
    <P>Subhead I&mdash;Agency, Advisory and Special Service&mdash;at £60,000 shows an increase of £14,000 on the 1972-73 provision.  The main element in this subhead is the timber technology research programme being undertaken by the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards on behalf of the Forest and Wildlife Service.  The increase arises mainly from increased salary costs of institute staff.</P>
    <P>Subhead J&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid &mdash;at a figure of £1,486,000 shows an increase of £216,000 in estimated revenue over the estimate for 1972-73. Sales of timber at a figure of £1,383,000 account for £195,000&mdash; most of the increase anticipated.  The increase reflects partly the increase in the quantity of wood coming on the market and partly provision for an increase in timber prices which have been very buoyant in recent months.</P>
    <P>In my predecessor's speech on the Estimate last year reference was made to the Forest and Wildlife Service's programme budgeting system. This system was further developed during the year and the computerbased management information system <Col N="121" /> programme budgeting furnished monthly reports on the cost of manual operations in the forests together with the outputs achieved under the various operational headings.  Considerable benefits in planning and control continue to derive from programming budgeting and its ancillary techniques.</P>
    <P>Everyone is aware of the value of the forest as a source of raw material and wealth and in recent years the public has become more conscious of the forest's potential for recreation and amenity and of its resource use in the conservation of wildlife.  The major enemy of our forests is, of course, fire.  Every year through carelessness, thoughtlessness or wilful selfishness hundreds of acres of forests &mdash;in which the Irish taxpayer has invested many millions of pounds&mdash;are destroyed by fire.  With the destruction goes not only a loss of hard cash but of amenity and wildlife potential also.</P>
    <P>During the last year&mdash;and in particular the last few months&mdash;when our forests were particularly vulnerable because of late growth and drying winds&mdash;damage was very severe.  In the year 1972-73, 292 fires were reported in the vicinity of State plantations. Ninety-five of these actually entered the plantations and destroyed 1,300 acres valued approximately at £40,000. The greater part of the damage occurred in March when 950 acres were destroyed.  Already in April and May of this year a further 630 acres have literally gone up in smoke so that some £63,000 worth of damage has occurred in less than three months. Admittedly in the prevailing conditions forests were particularly vulnerable at that period.  For the most part, however, these were fires which could have been avoided by a little foresight and care.</P>
    <P>We are sometimes criticised for not spending more money on protective measures.  I must point out, however, that sums in excess of £300,000 annually are spent on the safeguarding of plantations.  Such expenditure includes the provision of firelines and water supplies, co-operation with farmers who are moor burning, payments for firewatching and advertising aimed at <Col N="122" /> warning the public of the dangers. There is a limit to what can reasonably be spent in protecting the widely spread State plantations and further substantial increases in such expenditure would, in my view, be subject to the law of diminishing returns and would not be justified.</P>
    <P>Forests which are normally located in remote areas far from water supplies and with limited road access must continue to depend largely for their safety on the common sense and goodwill of their owners&mdash;the citizens of this country.  I would urge again that the forests are there for economic benefit and public enjoyment.  We must not endanger them through carelessness in lighting of fires or discarding of cigarettes or matches.</P>
    <P>To the hill farmer I would say: if you feel you must burn to improve grazing, then follow the simple rules of notifying the Garda and your local forester in writing.  Co-operate with your local forester in fixing a suitable time and date to do the burning, thus enabling him to have staff on hand to cope with the fire danger.</P>
    <P>I would like to give an assurance that any farmer who follows these simple rules and who burns under arrangements with the forester even if his moor burning should, unhappily, get out of hand and cause damage to a State forest need have no fear that any action for damages will be taken against him by the State.  Failure to follow the rules can, however, involve fines and heavy damage claims.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFlanagan" hpid="Mr. S. Flanagan Mr. S. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I am right in saying that the Department of Lands was the last Department discussed here during the previous Dáil. This was in December, 1972, and for that reason one would not expect a protracted debate at this stage.  However, the capacity of Members of the House, particularly rural Deputies, to express their views especially about the Land Commission is virtually unlimited and therefore I have very little hope that we will get away with a brief discussion on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time when I thought that this Estimate would not be reached I put down questions to the Minister on some major aspects of the work of <Col N="123" /> his Department but since the Estimate has been reached we have an opportunity of bringing the situation up to date for the benefit of all interested, not merely Members of the House.  At the outset, I should like to say that whatever remarks and suggestions I make are intended to be helpful to the Minister and his advisers.  The Estimate speech by the Minister is to a large extent a report on what had been settled about the end of the financial year when I was Minister although the present Minister had already made one significant change. That is the inclusion of Longford, Cavan and Westmeath in the congested areas and he has undertaken to bring in an order under section 4 of the 1965 Act to give effect to this proposal.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to this and consider it reasonable and perhaps, in the circumstances, somewhat predictable. I do not think any Members on this side of the House will have any objection either.  Since last December we have been, and continue to be, to some extent in a quiet period, because all our thinking is necessarily dominated by the fact that we are members of the EEC and that the draft directives mentioned by the Minister on modernisation of farms and on incentives to leave farming will radically affect the work of the Land Commission and ultimately the whole land reform programme as it operates on the lives of individual farmers, especially in congested areas.</P>
    <P>I was glad to learn from the Minister's reply a couple of weeks ago that some progress has been made in drafting these directives.  I now learn from the Minister's statement that it is not expected that the drafts will be finalised before 1974.  That this is so does not reflect any inactivity on the part of the Minister or his officials because this is primarily a matter for the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  The function of the Department of Lands is a relatively minor one at the negotiations stage although the function of the Land Commission and the Department in the implementation of the directives when eventually finalised will be anything but minor.  The Land Commission <Col N="124" /> will then become the major instrument for the due implementation of these vital directives.</P>
    <P>It is not unfair to say that this gives point to what I said almost four years ago as regards the amalgamation of the functions of the Land Commission under the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  Speaking on this Estimate last December Deputy Cooney now Minister for Justice said&mdash;perhaps he was wondering aloud:</P>
    <P>Is there any point in ever saying anything in this House?  Does anybody ever listen?  Are we merely talking in a vacuum?</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the logic of what I have been saying is inescapable: so, whether in a vacuum or not, I beg leave to repeat it now and to say that when it comes to the implementation of the EEC directives in regard to farm modernisation that inescapable logic will be hammered home inexorably.</P>
    <P>Today we had the Ministers and Secretaries Bill, Second Stage, the main purpose of which is to set up a new Government Department, the Department of the Public Service.  I know that this will yield immediate benefits to the Civil Service.  That is taken as obvious and I do not wish to sound catty when I say that.  The creation of a new Civil Service Department obviously creates opportunities for a very large number of jobs, not to mention the consequent filling of vacancies elsewhere.  I wonder to what extent will the new Department be able to exercise its influence to prevent the duplication of effort which appears to me to be inescapably involved in the future if you have a Department of Land's official taking particulars from each individual farmer in a particular locality to decide whether or not he is the sort of person who should have a farm development plan, while on his heels there would be another official from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries who would be concerned to protect his function in the matter of grants for this, that or the other.  Inasmuch as he has, or will have, the power to recommend to his seniors whether this person should get a grant, he would feel that he also should have a say in <Col N="125" /> the decision as to whether a person was suitable to become a development farmer.  Are we going to have two officials from two different Departments, each with a proportion of a share in a decision about an individual farmer's future, and the possibility that these officials will disagree? Is this a sensible situation to allow to develop?  Is there anything we should do in this hiatus period to try to obviate such a happening?</P>
    <P>I wish to make it clear that I am not suggesting that the Land Commission should cease to be an independent body.  I am not suggesting that the reports of an official from any Department, once they reach the commissioners' desks, should not be subject to the independent determination of the commissioners on the same basis as has obtained since the creation of the Land Commission many years ago; I am saying that duplication of activity among officials is something we must try to avoid.  I assert that there is very little evidence that anything said about this matter over the years has had any effect whatever.  The Minister should do everything in his power to prevent the development of a situation in which there would be yet another internal fight between two Government Departments, involving still more waste of public funds.  If democracy is to survive, it is already in enough danger from bureaucracy.  It is not our function now, when we are trying to gear ourselves towards efficiency in our farming methods in order that we can compete with our counterparts in Europe, to make life difficult for those who wish to continue farming.</P>
    <P>The importance of the EEC directives is bound up with the development of an EEC regional policy.  I am pleased that the Minister has reiterated in his speech the proposition that I so often put to the House, namely, that it is not possible to solve the social problems, especially of the poorer rural areas of this country, with land alone. I thank the Minister for including his very positive statement of his own attitude. It is a statement which goes to the root of the problems of his constituency and of mine and also of similar areas in this country.  Following <Col N="126" /> on that, there is the determination that we should be able to offer to those who leave farming an alternative, reasonable livelihood in their own locality or province or, at the very worst, their own country.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to his decision to include as congested areas Counties Monaghan, Cavan and Longford, and said that in two of these counties the population declined in the inter-censal period 1956-1961.  One of the other counties where population has declined is Mayo.  I am discussing regional policy in the EEC, not because the Minister for Lands has any responsibility in regard to its formulation but because the attempt by the Minister and the Land Commission, however successful, in regard to the reorganisation of land in these counties, and the implementation of the land reform programme, cannot yield the full results required, which are the stabilisation, first, and then the increase in the population of the counties, two of them mentioned in the Minister's speech. This cannot be done unless a vigorous regional policy is adopted and unless those of us who represent those areas are quite firm that special attention will have to be paid to these areas in the implementation of the regional policy.</P>
    <P>This point was brought home to me recently when I was on a deputation in regard to the extension of a pig cooperative which is at present based in County Mayo.  It was stated that the ultimate decision in regard to it and all other similar projects for the development of the pig industry in this country, would be made in Brussels. I contest this statement, no matter how distinguished the person who makes it, and I contest it, I hope, with the support of the Minister and his colleagues in the Government, and of everybody who has the interests of the balanced development of this country at heart, for it does seem to me that these projects, provided they are inherently sound, which are based in the areas I have mentioned demonstrably require special help from the Government and from the EEC, should have priority, by the insistence of the Government and of those of us who represent those areas, over projects equally soundly <Col N="127" /> based, which, however, happen to be located in the more fortunate parts of the country which are already doing well.</P>
    <P>I am not prepared to accept the proposition from the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries or from anybody else that ultimate decisions in matters so vital to our success, to the retention of our people and to the development of our farming prospects in the poorer counties rest solely with people in Brussels.  I do not accept it, and I hope the Minister does not accept it.  I know that he sees the logic from his own point of view of trying to insist on special measures of this kind, because otherwise he, like all his predecessors, will come into this House year after year with a report of progress, yes, but not with a report which envisages simultaneously setting up farmers in a way that they can hope to make a decent living and at the same time offering no diminution of population in the areas from which those farmers come.</P>
    <P>Early in his speech the Minister pointed out that a change was being made this year in regard to the money made available for cash purchases of land, that these are for the first time being treated as a capital item.  I am not boasting about the fact that I was responsible for persuading the Fianna Fáil Government to set aside £1 million for this year for cash purposes, because goodness knows it is only a start, but at least it is a start.  It is a significant step forward, and as well it was surely sensible that this money should be put under the capital and not the current heading where it has anomalously rested for so many years. I hope that the Minister will be able, when he comes to battle with his Minister for Finance later on, to have that £1 million significantly increased for next year.  I do not have to argue the merits of that development with him.  It is a pity that Deputy L'Estrange is not here tonight after all the hard work he did trying to persuade me when I was over there that this was the fit and proper thing to do.</P>
    <P>There was one other question that <Col N="128" /> occurred to me.  A statement was made by Deputy Bruton, I think, last year about the official policy of his party.  He was at that stage a member of Fine Gael; he is a member of a National Coalition now, so, perhaps, we can absolve them.  I think it was Deputy Bruton said it was the official policy of his party to set up a rural development authority.  Would the Minister be kind enough to tell me, not necessarily in reply but at his convenience what the present position is in regard to the establishment of such an authority and, if it is to be set up, what its likely functions will be.</P>
    <P>The question of the control of the right of foreigners and others to purchase land has been discussed at length in this House in recent years, and I pointed out last year that the emphasis has now shifted from foreigners to natives.  Again, last week or the week before Deputy James Gibbons articulated the fears of the farming community that speculators, businessmen, solicitors, barristers, veterinary surgeons, everybody and anybody other than a person who has been in farming&mdash;are buying up more and more of the land without which the farmers themselves cannot hope to have holdings of sufficient size to guarantee them the parity of income with those very people which is envisaged in the philosophy of the EEC.</P>
    <P>I pointed out then, and the Minister repeated two weeks ago, that this is a very difficult problem and one which appears to raise constitutional difficulties, and I know that the officials of the Land Commission themselves are very reluctant to extend their powers so that they would have a say in every sale and proposed sale.  I appreciate the reasons for this reluctance, and I can only say that they will be aware &mdash;and the Minister, in his capacity as a solicitor before his appointment, will be very well aware&mdash;of the increasing tendency to sell land privately without the benefit of an auctioneer, advertising, and through direct negotiation, thereby presenting the Land Commission with a <i>fait accompli</i> presenting the neighbours, who had their hopes pinned, perhaps, on certain local land <Col N="129" /> becoming available sooner or later, with a <i>fait accompli,</i> and preventing the Land Commission from using the section 40 procedure which was designed in the 1965 Act to prevent sales taking place in areas and circumstances where the Land Commission deemed it right and proper that the holdings should be acquired for the relief of congestion and the improvement of the farm structures in those areas. Solicitors, increasingly nowadays, are approached by two people who have already made the bargain and they are told to finalise the contracts.  The Land Commission, while still having certain powers over the purchaser of the land are not, as the Minister knows, in anything like as strong a position as if they got in in time through use of the section 40 technique. I am not pressing the Minister to make a final statement on this matter when he replies to this debate.  It would be unreasonable to ask him to do so.  It is a very complicated matter and one which requires a great deal of thought.</P>
    <P>We will, if we are to give practical effect to the EEC directives, when they are in operation, particularly that in regard to farm structure, have to have some greater powers than we now have to prevent still more land from falling into the hands of people who do not require it for the purpose of making a living.  The distinction ultimately surely is between the person who needs land in order to enable him to make a living and the person who does not need it but, of course, would have a dimension added to an already successful life.  In the last analysis we must consider the person in need as against the person who can afford to add the dimension of pony riding for his children, fishing in the stream and so forth and that the time has come when we should strengthen the legislation, in whatever way it is possible to do so, to achieve this end while at the same time doing the best we can to avoid running into constitutional difficulties.  I can assure the Minister of practical support from this side of the House in the preparation of any proposals to deal with the situation I have outlined.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a word about the farm modernisation scheme.  We <Col N="130" /> all know that the retirement scheme in the 1965 Act did not work.  It was well meant and it had precisely the same philosophy as the envisaged EEC directive.  It did not work because farmers in that age group have such a deep attachment to land that even when they are tottering on the edge of the grave they are determined to hold on to what they possess.  No matter how good the incentives in the new scheme I am still dubious about how effective it will be because those same farmers are just as determined to hold on to their possessions.  I sincerely hope I will be proved wrong and that land will, in fact, be released as a result of this directive, and people in this age group will retire if they are unable to carry on and release land to the young and ambitious farmers of the country.  Habit dies slowly, particularly with people of that age group, and, of course, there is no question of compulsion, no question of the EEC, this Government or any government seeking to compel these people to give up their land.</P>
    <P>It seems a great tragedy that, particularly in the congested areas about which we all talk so much in this House and about which we are all so genuinely concerned, so much land is left lying idle, accumulating rushes, almost totally non-productive and at the same time in the hands of people who for humanitarian reasons the Land Commission cannot touch.  There are, perhaps, hundreds of such areas in the congested districts of this country. I hope, when the directive on incentives to leave farms eventually sees the light of day, these people will also see the light of the national interest and the light of the interests of the youth of this country rather than their own selfish determination to hold on to what they have.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about the Forestry Estimate.  Has there been any noticeable improvement in the applications for private planting following the increases announced last year?  I am very happy to note that almost 1,000 inquiries for further information were received and 150 applications made for advisory inspection.  I hope this trend will continue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="131" /> The Minister mentioned in connection with the overall subject of forestry, which depends ultimately on the acquisition situation, that his Department is experiencing increasing difficulty in persuading people to close sales.  This will be a continuing problem because of the increase in the value of land, including land which a few years ago would have been regarded as completely valueless or, if not completely valueless, virtually of no value.  Since the acquisition programme will determine the success or failure in future of this very vital service, perhaps the Minister would tell me what has happened in regard to a proposal of mine some time ago that a simplified procedure should be adopted for acquision purposes.  When I first raised this matter I was told by the legal section that it appeared to be impracticable, in fact, impossible.</P>
    <P>My idea was that the forester would go along to the person who had signified his willingness to sell, would bring a piece of paper with him setting out the essentials of the contract and the owner signifying his willingness to go ahead, both would then sign, the piece of paper would be lodged with the county registrar or some responsible person or institution and, at the expiration of a stated period, a short one of four to six to a maximum of eight weeks, in the absence of claims against the fund the money would be paid to the apparent owner who was the vendor.  I continued to press for a system of this kind and was finally told that it was, in fact, practicable and possible and the legal section were working on the formulation of proposals to implement the scheme.</P>
    <P>I hope that they are going ahead with this because if such a system were in operation it would give a great boost to the acquisition of land for forestry purposes since the vendor would know he was going to get his money within a very short predictable period.  I pointed out that in my experience and in the experience of everybody involved in the acquisition of land, particularly land for forestry purposes, in 98 per cent of cases the <Col N="132" /> person who said he was the owner was, in fact, the owner.  He might not have his name registered but he was the beneficial owner.  There might be an equity against him by someone living in New Zealand or New Jersey, but this claim would never be made. The percentage of cases giving rise to any real dispute was miniscule and my idea was to capitalise on that situation while, at the same time, providing machinery through advertising and lodgment of funds which would protect the genuine claim.  In such cases when a notice appeared the money would not be paid and the ordinary court machinery would be used to decide whether or not the claim was legitimate.  In all other cases the vendor would be paid in a short time and would, therefore, be able to prepare his plans for the development of his farming operations on the basis that a given sum of money would be there to be used at a certain date. It is not much use going to a bank looking for money and saying one has sold a particular piece of land but one does not know when one will be paid; it might be this year, next year, two, three or five years' time.  The bank manager in such circumstances will say he is sorry that he cannot give the applicant the money but, if the applicant can tell him that he will have the money in two months' time, then the bank manager will be able to do something for him.  That is the difference between the farmer who can organise his business on a sensible basis for whatever period it may be and the farmer who has to go back and start all over again.</P>
    <P>On the subject of legal procedure, if I understand the position correctly &mdash;if I do not, then the Minister will tell me I am wrong&mdash;the Examiner's Branch has statutory authority and cannot be shifted without legislation. It is fair comment to say that at the time the Land Commission was set up and the Examiner's Branch given the responsibility of vetting titles which came into the Land Commission machine the Land Commission were after huge estates, farms of 2,000, 3,000, 4,000 and 5,000 acres. The situation has completely changed now.  There are very few, virtually <Col N="133" /> no big estates left now and the Land Commission are operating, particularly in the congested areas, in the Minister's county and in mine, on quite small parcels of land, the big estates having been taken over 40 or 50 years ago.  These small cases could be dealt with as cash cases by the solicitor's branch of the Land Commission.  The <i>raison d'être</i> of the Examiner's Branch has ceased to exist.  As well as that, we are vigorously abolishing things like quit rents and tithe rents.  The Minister had his progress report in regard to these. It is time he did away with it and hurrah for the day when we see the last of it.  This will simplify the work of the legal section.  We will no longer find an owner being asked if there are quasi-tithe rents in a ten acre farm somewhere in the west end of Cavan.  If I may digress, I am sure the Minister will not fall for the recommendation which he will find in one of the policy reports on his desk that the Land Commission should cease to concern themselves with farms under a certain valuation and size.  I cannot remember what the figures are, perhaps 30 acres, 20 acres or thereabouts.  I am sure the Minister will not fall for that, even though Dr. O'Donovan spoke here and ridiculed the Land Commission going after an estate, of some seven, eight or nine acres in Galway, Mayo, Clare or Cavan.  It is absolutely vital to the continued success of the Land Commission that they should not merely have the power to do so but that their policy should be to go after these small farms and at the same time give every incentive and encouragement to the people concerned, thus obviating the necessity for Land Commission activity by doing the work themselves.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission should not have to go in and buy smallholdings but it is important that they should have the power to do so and when necessary it is equally important that they move in.  The success or failure to acquire perhaps 40 or 50 acres in five small pieces may mean the success or failure of the entire re-arrangement scheme or the ultimate aim to <Col N="134" /> provide farmers and their families with a decent livelihood.</P>
    <P>Coming back to forestry, another question raised here last week, or the week before, was in regard to game legislation.  Of course I thoroughly agree with the sentiments expressed by the Minister about the necessity for this legislation and that it is overdue. I do not care very much what people say, but I should like to give the history as far as my tenure of office is concerned about wildlife legislative proposals.</P>
    <P>I inherited a situation in which a Bill was virtually ready, and a very short time after I was appointed the Bill was, in fact, ready.  It had gone through all the usual stages of submission to other Government Departments and so on.  I wish to thank my predecessors and the officials concerned for the comprehensive work done before my time on the preparation of that Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill was rejected by the Government&mdash;this would have been late in 1969 or early in 1970&mdash;and the major row that developed was in regard to responsibility for environmental conservation. To try to resolve the difficulties, the Government set up an inter-departmental committee who met and deliberated over a very long period in an attempt to resolve the question of environmental conservation. They ultimately reported, but before they reached agreement I gave instructions that the preparation of the alternative Bill was to continue and that the draft proposals were to be finalised in respect of a couple of outstanding issues of disagreement between representatives of the Forestry Division on the one hand and other Government agencies on the other.</P>
    <P>Speaking on this Estimate last December, Deputy Haughey raised serious doubts about the wisdom of the decision at that time that the Department of Local Government should have primary responsibility in the environmental field.  I am sorry I do not have the reference to Deputy Haughey's speech, but it was on the Estimate for the Department of Lands <Col N="135" /> last December.  He pointed out that the main instrument of the Department of Local Government in the exercise of their functions in regard to environmental matters would be the local authorities and he went on to say:</P>
    <P>We all know our local authorities have such a variety of commitments and are subject to so many social pressures that conservation and the control of the environment may not receive in their scale of priorities the place they urgently need.  I have had some previous experience that this is the case.  ... We may very well drift into a situation of paying lip service to the conservation ideal without making enough practical effort to achieve it.</P>
    <P>I do not for a moment wish to take away from the Department of Local Government such functions as are appropriate to their work, in particular in regard to pollution at sea and matters clearly pertaining to planning. Far be it from me to purport to take away from the Department of Local Government any of their legitimate functions.  I share Deputy Haughey's concern in respect of the decision that the Department of Local Government should have prior responsibility in the environmental field.  I share that concern for the reasons that the Deputy put forward so cogently in his speech last December.  He went on to say that he had personal experience to back up his views.  I believe that this will be the experience of hundreds of people who will find that in the scale of priorities of the Department of Local Government and because of the pressures mentioned by Deputy Haughey, conservation will be something they will talk about but will do nothing to bring about its achievement.  I speak, of course, about those matters which are outside the direct ambit of the Department of Local Government but which, in my view, should be more properly within the ambit of the Forestry and Wildlife Service of the Department of Lands or, perhaps, some other Department.  It has been my opinion for a long time that the most appropriate body to have the <Col N="136" /> main responsibility for environmental and conservation matters is the Forestry and Wildlife Service of the Department of Lands, and that a Department consisting of forestry, fisheries and conservation would represent a logical unit.  Perhaps those who will be taking over the Department of Public Service might consider it worth their while to consider that proposition.</P>
    <P>I put forward these views because of the obvious direct involvement of the Forestry and Wildlife Service in certain aspects of conservation, because of their demonstrable success in the operation of the policies of the service, in particular, with regard to conservation and because Local Government, through the local authorities, are too close to the problem of conservation, the environment and pollution to be able to observe them with dispassion. The Forestry and Wildlife Service are not too close to them to do so and, armed with a broadly based national advisory committee&mdash;I stress &ldquo;advisory&rdquo;&mdash;they would be the best instrument to operate a coherent conservation policy; that is, of course, if we are serious about environment and conservation.</P>
    <P>I hope that I will not be accused of being anti-civil servant, or of being anti-bureaucrat, if I repeat what I said earlier in a different context.  The way that the civil servants battled out of their towers like medieval knights to protect and expand, if possible, the small bit of a foothold they had in the conservation area was a shame and a disgrace and they will continue to do so unless the Minister and the Government, perhaps with the help of the new Department of the Public Service, will bring these people together and say: &ldquo;Do you realise that the more important thing is to achieve a public objective to which both Governments have been committed?&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, with the permission of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to continue along those lines and to say that when there is obdurate determination on the part of officials to hold on to any foothold they have in any particular field and then to try to expand that foothold at the ultimate expense of the achievement of declared policy, it is a sad state of affairs and that it is necessary to set up a Department of Public Service.  The facts set out, argued and adumbrated in the Devlin Report justify the statements I have made.  I express the sincere hope that in the future it will be possible for Ministers and, indeed, for Governments to exercise more direct ways of achieving the objectives of agreed public policy.  I will leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is very much more that I could say on this Estimate but I have been talking for too long so I propose to sit down very shortly. However, before concluding I would like to pay tribute to the officials of both the Lands and Forestry sections of the Department for their co-operation with me during my term of office and to say how deeply I appreciated at the time, and continue to appreciate, their sincerity, their dedication and their devotion.  I have always thought that the officials in the Lands section have, by the nature of their work, a more difficult and less rewarding task than officials in the other section because, as the House knows, it is impossible to satisfy people in relation to the division of land.  No Minister, however angelic he might be, and no officials, however celestial <Col N="138" /> might be their ideas, will ever satisfy the people where the acquisition and division of land is concerned.  On the other hand, people engaged in the creation of forests, beautiful forest parks and sanctuaries are doing work which adds to the enjoyment of daily life, particularly the lives of the children. It is a great source of satisfaction. This does not take away from the fact that they deserve every possible praise for the quality of their work and for their dedication and devotion.  I have no doubt that the Minister will have the same experience and I wish him well in the discharge of his obligations.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, so far as land is concerned we are now and will, to some extent, continue to be, in a hiatus, a sort of hyphen of history, until the EEC directives are first finalised and then put into operation. When that happens it will be a very exciting time indeed.  The first few years of the operation of the directives will bring about tremendous changes not just in farm structure but in the structure of the lives of the people.  I have no doubt that the Minister will find the discharge of his office during that period immensely satisfying.  I wish to say that whatever help I can give from this side of the House towards the realisation of the shared objectives I will give.  Whatever criticism I will offer will be constructive and will be directed towards the ultimate achievement of these objectives.  If on the other hand, I think that these objectives, some of which I have mentioned, are being lost sight of or not being actively pursued then I will say so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGrattanEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Lands and its Forestry Division have always had political connotations, party and otherwise, so far as rural constituencies are concerned.  The Department does not deal only with the areas or parts of the country that may be of immediate interest to the last speaker or to the Minister, the areas of smallholdings and congested areas.  I should like to say to the Minister that there are plenty of congested areas in my constituency in which there are smallholdings and <Col N="139" /> holdings obviously below a viable level.  I understand the question of what is or what is not a viable holding has been mentioned and debated in this House before but I can find no reference in the Minister's speech to what is the present policy of the Land Commission in relation to what is a viable holding.  Fifty acres in one part of the country could have quite a different connotation to fifty acres in another.  Land varies, climate varies and this has an effect on the cropping system and farm management procedures in different areas.</P>
      <P>So far as my constituency is concerned, I should like to mention a matter now, for fear that I might overlook it, which is of considerable concern.  That is the matter of the Forth mountain in Wexford where moderate and small holders have traditionally had the right to graze. In recent times either the Department of Lands or the Forestry Division or their agents proceeded to take steps to fence off part of this mountain.  I regret to say that I asked for information on that matter quite some time ago and I was promised it but I have no information to date on what the position is.  I would ask the Minister to state what is the policy or the intentions of the Department in regard to the Forth mountain.  There are about 200 acres involved and quite a number of moderate and small holders are interested in this matter. If the facts given to me are correct my advice to the Minister and his Department would be: &ldquo;Hands off the Forth mountain&rdquo;.  I may not have been given the correct information but the people who approached me seemed to be very perturbed about the situation and they asked me, as a Deputy for the constituency, to ascertain what the position is.  I would prefer if possible if the information could be communicated to me earlier in the event of this debate not being completed in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Deputies, except strictly urban Deputies, have had experience of the matter of the acquisition of land.  This is a matter that is often fraught with a considerable amount of strong feelings. <Col N="140" /> I have the feeling, perhaps mistakenly, that those making decisions about the acquisition of land have not taken into consideration the fact that it is a native Government that is acquiring land not from foreign landowners but from Irishmen who have lived on the land, families who have owned land and have worked the land.  Therefore, when the decision to acquire lands is made it is very wrong that the people should be paid in land bonds, land bonds which have shown over a considerable period of time a chronic tendency to depreciate.  If people's lands are being acquired they should be compensated in such a manner that they can put the compensation they receive into something else and can keep pace with inflation and the depreciation of money.</P>
    <P>A matter of general complaint in my constituency is the delay before land is re-allocated or vested in owners.  It seems to have been the policy, so far as County Wexford is concerned, to hold on to the land as long as possible and to get as high a rent as possible. There is the feeling in Wexford that the land acquired by the Land Commission is being used as a source of income.  People feel that it is being utilised by the Land Commission in its capacity as a landlord and not in its capacity as a Department of State trying to assist farmers with small holdings and that the rents obtained from these lands are being utilised for the assistance of farmers outside of County Wexford.</P>
    <P>As a Deputy from Wexford I have strong feelings on this matter.  I feel that if the land of my constituents is acquired and is held by the Land Commission and high rents are obtained, that money should go back into the farming land in Wexford. This business of holding on to land for an undue length of time has had the effect that every contractor or man with any machinery literally tills the heart out of such land with the result that when it is being allocated it is run out.  It has been heavily tilled and not properly manured or fertilised.  This means that when this land is allocated to a farmer he starts with a handicap of run-down <Col N="141" /> land.  I cannot see what the reason is for this long delay in re-allocation of land.</P>
    <P>Another matter that I should like to put on public record, and I hope note is taken of it, is that a lot of people who have applied to the Land Commission for an allocation of land seem to believe that if they take 11-month lettings from the Land Commission they are improving their case, helping themselves up along the ladder of priority, to obtain an allocation of land from an estate held by the Land Commission.  This is a complete falsehood and I should like the Minister to make it clear that whether a man bids for a letting of Land Commission land or not has nothing to do with the final decision of whether he gets an allocation from the estate concerned.</P>
    <P>I feel that this situation has had the effect of inflating the price of land.  I have heard of prices paid per acre for land taken on the 11-month system from the Land Commission and I cannot see where one halfpenny profit has been made at the end of the day.  These people take the land in the hope that it will better their case with the Land Commission.  The right person to put the record right in this matter is the Minister for Lands.</P>
    <P>I have been told recently that there is a fear in so far as the Forestry Division is concerned that some timber put on sale on a commercial basis may not have been cut at the right season.  I should like the Minister to look into that particular aspect of the Forestry Division's activities.</P>
    <P>The position of the commissioners of the Land Commission has, for a long time, been a bone of contention.  At present there are four commissioners. I should like to make it clear that I am not levelling any personal criticism on any individual commissioners. I feel that it is not right, and it does not look right, to have the secretary of the Department of Lands a commissioner. This attitude, and judgment, has been quite freely expressed by people outside of this House.  In so far as the function of the commissioners is concerned I should like to see that, when land is acquired and objections <Col N="142" /> are put in by the person whose land is being acquired, those objections are heard by an independent tribunal.</P>
    <P>Human nature is such that a man cannot detach himself from his previous judgment.  In many cases one of the commissioners has been involved in making the original decision to acquire the land.  We like to observe democratic procedures and I hope that when people talk of democracy in this country they are not just paying lip service to it.  The present procedure in the Land Commission, in my view, is not democratic.  I think that it is subject to any possible error that could be made by virtue of human nature.  If I was a commissioner and I decided to acquire a person's lands and that person came in with his barrister or solicitor to present a case objecting to that acquisition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the procedure of the court.  The procedure of this court is that somebody makes a decision and that court virtually hears the appeal again.  This is an incorrect procedure to adopt.  It may have been an easy procedure to conceive when a lot of land was being acquired.  I believe that when one comes to the question of land now being acquired, with its value and the amount involved, there should be a completely independent body to deal with objections.  The position is that the court, in my opinion, is trying to defend itself.  This, I believe, is a wrong procedure, legally speaking.  As a lawyer, I believe it is very faulty.</P>
      <P>So far as the Land Commission are concerned, it appears that in the day-to-day business the Minister in many cases acts merely as a rubber-stamp to a greater extent than applies in other Departments. The Minister lacks everyday administrative powers concerning the acquisition and disposal of land.  This is undesirable in that matters of policy might be difficult to change when decisions are made by people other than the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Geoghegan</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  He has a difficult task facing him but he will have a fresh <Col N="144" /> approach to all the problems that confront him and I wish him well.</P>
      <P>We have had a very elaborate statement from the Minister but it is the same kind of statement that is circulated to Deputies each year.  It is time for some Minister to take a step forward, to point out to us where activities are taking place rather than merely refer to subheads.  For instance, the Estimate should explain the area and location of plantations and similar matters.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister what is being done about the programme of migration from the west to the midlands, from north to south, or from the south to the midlands.  I should like to know the position in this regard.  The Minister comes from a county where it might be considered that land was scarce.  Perhaps he would like to see some migration from his own county so that the Land Commission could sub-divide the land among local congests.  Up to a few years ago families in my constituency were given land in Counties Meath, Kilkenny and Wexford and 99 per cent of those people settled in the areas and prospered.</P>
      <P>The Forestry Division should take some interest in the roads leading to the plantations.  They are transporting heavy machinery through local townlands and, as a result, the roads are impassable for the local people; in particular, car owners cannot use the roads because they are broken by the heavy machinery.  Local people find it difficult to go to Mass or to the market.  The Forestry Division should arrange that the roads are repaired immediately damage is caused by the heavy machinery and ensure that the local people can use them.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the width of the machinery that is used.  They sink on the two-wheeled tracks and, as a result, the local farmer who owns a small car cannot use the roads without causing damage to his car.  The Minister should ensure that the Department of Lands repair any damage to these roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the distribution of land, in some cases the Land Commission <Col N="145" /> have had land for 20 years and have not sub-divided it.  It is all very well to put down a question to the Minister asking him when the Land Commission will rearrange certain estates; the answer or the excuse given is that it is expected that more land will become available so that a greater portion can be given to the people.  I am sure the Minister will agree that it should not be necessary to wait 20 years to do this.</P>
    <P>I beat a track to the Minister's predecessor and I am now pursuing it again in regard to one serious defect in the Forestry Division, as I see it. They take over land for forestry, fence it and plant it and after a few years it is overrun with foxes.  Local farmers may keep sheep for breeding purposes, and the sheep is a very valuable animal now in EEC conditions, and yet a farmer who may have seen five to ten lambs with the sheep in his field at night may find nothing left the following morning but the sheep.  I am sorry to have to say this but let me make it clear that I gave examples of what happens to the Forestry Division and described the plight of the farmers from Cong, County Galway to Cong, County Mayo.  Forestry workers were prepared to trap these foxes but I got no co-operation whatever.  The people of the area got no co-operation and if it did not happen in the last few months of the year, as far as I am aware, a fox trap was never set to catch the foxes so that the farmers could at least have the young lambs to sell later in the year in order to make a livelihood.  While it was Cong that was mostly involved in the last few years I fear this trouble has spread throughout all the West at present.</P>
    <P>I once suggested that immediately the Forestry Division took over a mountain side, for afforestation before planting it they should go where the foxes have their dens&mdash;this would be well known to the local people and to the foresters there&mdash;and set them alight, ensure there would be no cover for them and where possible close any dens they found with stones or otherwise. This would not cost much but <Col N="146" /> would save many young lambs in the locality, save the farmers money and save fowl for their wives.  It has now reached the stage when farmers' wives cannot rear poultry in areas near afforestation.  I should like action to be taken on that matter.</P>
    <P>Where there is afforestation and, by accident or otherwise, fire occurs and young trees are burned, perhaps two or four acres beside a main road&mdash; it may involve trees of four, six or eight years' growth&mdash;I think something should be done shortly after these trees are burned, to pull them up or cut them in the ground so as to take the bad look off the forest. Perhaps they are left for some purpose, to show the public the damage the burning caused and the result.</P>
    <P>Many years' ago on this Estimate I asked if any maps were kept either in local authority offices or in the offices of the foresters which would show, in the event of fire, the location of lakes or rivers so that when a fire occurred and a fire brigade arrived they would at least know where to get water. Naturally, there is no piped supply along the roads where the forests are and I think it is essential this information should be available to the fire brigades so that they could put down a hose without loss of time and save the remainder of the forest.  The burnt trees, as I said, should be taken away so as to get rid of the bad appearance. A black and bare tree standing eight or ten feet high with beautiful young trees around it, one must agree, is not a pleasant sight and should be eliminated.</P>
    <P>I understand the Department of Lands is responsible for the building of new roads into turbary plots throughout the country.  The roads are provided with money from the Department but when they are completed they seem to be nobody's baby.  There should be some arrangement between the Department and the local authority, between the Department and the Department of Local Government or between the Department and the Department of the Gaeltacht to ensure that these roads would at least be repaired when necessary so that people who have to travel miles to cut turbary <Col N="147" /> would be able to use them to take out turf by lorry or tractor.  I speak particularly of the roads that have to be used by people in the parishes of Carraroe, Lettermore and Lettermullen who must go some 20 or 30 miles when they want to cut turf.  As a result of the continuous cutting of turf and the soaking of water from underneath part of the road sinks and perhaps trucks or tractors cannot get over it in the following year.  These roads do not all require a major job but some repairs are required to keep them in a satisfactory condition so that lorries and tractors can travel over them to bring home the turf for the people who need it for their winter fires.  In the Gaeltacht the Department of the Gaeltacht generally come to the rescue, but they do not do so quickly.  The state of disrepair of the roads may only come to the notice of the people who go in in March to prepare the bogs.  The damage may have occurred in December or November.  The people have turbary rights but they do not visit the bogs until March and it is then that they find that parts of the roads have subsided and that no trucks can get in.  There may be only one or two spots like that on a road.  There should be some arrangement about this between the Department of Lands and the Department of the Gaeltacht. In non-Gaeltacht areas the Department of Local Government look after the roads with the help of the local authority.  The local authority do all repairs but the money they get for these repairs may come from either the Department of Local Government or the Department of the Gaeltacht. The roads should be repaired quickly so that the people can get their turf out when the weather is dry.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give us more local information.  He mentioned a few places of scenic beauty such as Gougane Barra and the Kennedy Memorial Park.  It is vital to country Deputies to know about local beauty spots and also about the forests and how they are getting on.  Are the forests a failure in some areas or are they doing well?  What is happening? I myself often see the Cloosh Valley <Col N="148" /> area.  What information have we for the people about this area?  What is happening the young trees which are being planted in all the forests?  Are they the right type of tree?  Should a different type of tree be planted?  I do not mind whether spruce or any other kind of tree is planted; I only want to know should any alteration be made. Is there any danger of any of the trees toppling over?  Has any toppling over taken place?  I remember asking questions about places offered to the Forestry Division for afforestation and the replies given indicated that the bog was too deep for planting.  It was said that there was fear of toppling if trees were planted.  Are the trees showing any signs of falling over after they reach a height of 6 feet?  How are they developing?  There is an area of afforestation in Cloosh Valley.  It stretches over a wide area around Lettermore na Coille.  I keep an eye on this area. Is it going to be a success?  What will happen there eventually?</P>
    <P>Great strides in afforestation are being made in the west.  There are forests in Glann, Ross, Derryclare, Ballynahinch, Knockboy, Glenarud and Derreen.  There should have been something in the speech on this Estimate telling us whether these forests are a success.  What future programmes for afforestation exist?  How many acres have the Forestry Division? Have they enough land to carry on with?  Have they been offered land for forestry purposes which the Land Commission or the Forestry Division have not looked at yet?  When people offer land for forestry purposes they are not told whether it will be accepted or otherwise.  I know of cases where land was offered for forestry purposes and it was five or six years before a decision was taken in regard to it.  If a person has to wait five or six years for a decision in regard to land offered for forestry purposes he can get uneasy and say: &ldquo;I offered it to the forestry people and they have not had the courtesy to tell me whether they are going to take it or not&rdquo;.  There should be some agreement reached within two months.  The title could be fixed up after that.  The matter should not be left two or three years.  The Department <Col N="149" /> should not say: &ldquo;We will take it, but we do not know when we will take it&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  It is a simple matter.  It may be of great import in regard to what lies behind the decision of (a) the Minister or (b) the Cabinet.  I hope to elucidate from the Minister the answer to my question of Thursday last.  Is this a personal decision of the Minister that no more public buildings should carry the names of living or deceased patriots, or was it a collective decision of the Cabinet?  What puts that into ones mind is, first of all, the Minister's statement at the opening of the new computer building when he said that his Cabinet colleagues had agreed with his decision but his Parliamentary Secretary, in reply to my question last Thursday, said he thought it was only a personal decision of the Minister. Then, to cause more confusion in the matter, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Deputy Clinton, disputed the fact that this had been a Cabinet decision or that they had all agreed to it.</P>
      <P>I hope when the Minister is replying he will tell us (a) whose decision this was and (b) why such a decision was necessary.  It is common knowledge that the Government intend to launch a kind of debunking programme in which many things which people held in reverence will be toppled.  The Minister said that modernisation must be our whole approach to life.  The Minister is again showing his arrogance if it is his own decision that no public buildings should in future be named after patriots dead or living.  The public buildings belong to the people and if the people, or even a large section of them in the city or elsewhere decide that they want a building named after somebody, the Minister cannot act as a dictator and decide they cannot have their wishes granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" /> I can see great scope for the Minister's debunking process so that even the calendar that we use will not be safe, because it has such Roman overtones. The Romans were powerful many centuries ago, and I can see the Minister coming in here some day and saying that this is the Eighth Republic, dating it back to the first Coalition Government, and a new era will start from then.  The Minister suggests the Cabinet discussed this matter and agreed with his proposal.  I doubt very much if they did.</P>
    <P>This computer building has the awful name of &ldquo;Central Data Processing Services Computer Centre&rdquo;.  It would be much shorter to call it after some patriot, thus having just two names, even in the cause of modernisation. If some of the suggestions for names for this building were repugnant to the Minister&mdash;and I would say one name was very repugnant to him &mdash;he could perhaps have named it after Rowan Hamilton who was a patriot but also a famous mathematician, and computers have something to do with mathematics.  The mathematics of the Minister's politics, as shown up now, has wrought confusion whereby he is disbelieved by two of his colleagues, and not mere backbenchers but one ministerial colleague and his Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <P>One wonders, with the problems facing the country and the Government in particular, that the Minister takes time off to open this computer data processing centre and then makes a statement that there will be no patriot names for new public buildings. That may not be a matter of great importance, but what is important is the fact that a Cabinet Minister can make a speech, a very arrogant speech indeed, in which he states he has decided that in future, whether it is a computer data processing services centre or some new administrative building for the Government or even a new school or university, it will not be called after a patriot.</P>
    <P>Orwell suggests that by 1984 we shall all have numbers.  We can see the time approaching when not alone will our public buildings just have numbers but, if the Minister keeps on <Col N="151" /> with his declared policy of debunking, even the Members of this House will have numbers instead of names. No politician would like such anonymity, but the Minister, in his arrogance, is quite capable of knocking some of the institutions further, because he has decided, in his narrow way&mdash;it may give him a greater sense of importance&mdash;that the names of men and women who have served the country are not to be used.</P>
    <P>I know what has prompted the Minister to go on this line.  He simply did not want this building called after a very famous Irishman, so instead of saying he does not agree with this man's name going on the building, he tries to cloud the issue by saying in future &ldquo;no public buildings&rdquo;. Of course the Minister can only speak for himself and for the time he is Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;so I am not being rude to him.  I do not think it is of much importance anyway.  What I challenge is the right of the Minister, without the consent of his Cabinet colleagues, to decide that the names of good Irishmen and women will not be honoured, that they have all been honoured sufficiently&mdash;all the deceased ones&mdash;and it is not the Government's intention to go on honouring them.  The Minister is arrogantly saying that he knows what is good for the country, in this respect anyway, when he says he is going to ensure that buildings built with public money will not be named after patriots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You will recall what happened in other countries where there was a new <Col N="152" /> regime, as in Russia after the 1917 revolution.  All signs and marks of the previous administration were swept away.  When the Nazis got into power in Germany, they swept away all the old democratic landmarks and institutions. Then, after the war, people decided they would sweep away all signs of the Nazis.  To my mind, there is much more important work to be done than this debunking of people who are your political opponents.  If the Minister has nothing else to do but devote his time to making speeches unsupported by Cabinet unity, I would suggest a few problems to him that he could well deal with and where he could try to bring some order where chaos exists.</P>
    <P>I deny the right of the Minister to make any such decision.  It is ministerial arrogance.  We must make it clear to the Minister now that he will not get away with this type of malpractice, that he is the servant of the people and not the master; and if the people want names or numbers on buildings they are the people to decide, not the Minister on his own.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier that a new policy is being adopted by the Government or the Minister to erase many marks of commemoration by the people in this country.  It may be that because of modernisation these services will no longer have any place, but it is for the people to decide this.  We know the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. That is why I went to the trouble of tabling my question last Thursday and raising it on the Adjournment.  I think this is the start of the Minister's dictatorial and arrogant programme. Each time he tries any of these new practices I am sure there are many people in the House who will draw the attention of the public to this and let them see that we do not share the Minister's views on this matter.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will tell me, when he is replying, if (a) he is right when he says his Cabinet colleagues agree with him, (b) his Parliamentary Secretary is right when he says he thinks it was the Minister's own decision or (c) the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries is right.  All three cannot be right and, therefore, it pinpoints the <Col N="153" /> confusion which exists in the Cabinet even on this fairly minor matter.  We have three voices speaking with different tongues and you cannot suggest that there is any unity on this issue in the Cabinet or even among Parliamentary Secretaries.</P>
    <P>There is Cabinet disunity on this point.  I wonder if the Minister and the Cabinet have discussed this matter.  If they have, surely they could come forward with a united front on it.  If they feel that the names of patriots must not adorn any public buildings then let it be a Cabinet decision and not a decision of one Minister on his own.  Unless this is stopped now we will have various decisions made by various Ministers. If the people are not aware of these matters they will accept them as Cabinet policy.</P>
    <P>The first duty of any Minister, if he is going to make a speech like this one at Kilmainham, is to ensure that what he is saying is the truth and that it is made with Cabinet approval. If he suggests by innuendo that he has got Cabinet backing on this he should also ensure that his Cabinet colleagues know about it and that his Parliamentary Secretary is quite clear whether or not the Cabinet decided on this matter.  If the Minister has taken it on himself to enunciate new policy on this matter without the backing of his colleagues in the Cabinet then the Taoiseach has a duty to take a look at his Cabinet. If the Minister can censure the names being put forward to adorn public buildings, the Taoiseach might censure the Minister's speeches before he makes them.  It would not make him less boring but it would, perhaps, make him accurate and we will not have the spectacle we had in this House last Thursday when I quoted from the Minister's statement where he said the Cabinet had backed him in this action in regard to the non-naming of public buildings.  His Parliamentary Secretary, according to the Official Report, stated that he believed it was the Minister's private view.  The Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries came in and cast further doubt by stating that the Minister for <Col N="154" /> Finance had, in fact, the backing of the Cabinet.</P>
    <P>If my question last Thursday and this Adjournment debate tonight do not make the Government or the Minister change their mind I hope the Minister will make a statement as to (a) whether this was his own decision or the decision of the Cabinet, (b) was his Parliamentary Secretary wrong when he stated it was the Minister's private opinion and (c) was the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries right or wrong when he cast doubts on the backing the Cabinet gave to the Minister.  I hope that the Minister, apart from making a general policy statement on the matter, will answer those points.  The public deserve an answer from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. R. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Most people are anxious to get on with the job of living and they expect the Government and their leaders to be similarly concerned.  Unlike Deputy Moore and the Fianna Fáil Party, the Government have no appetite for resurrecting the dead to make political capital out of them.  There are far more important things to be done, like overcoming poverty, providing employment, expanding industry and agriculture, finding new markets for our produce, modernising the economy and restructuring society so that equality of opportunity for all our children will be a reality and not something to be merely mouthed by a latter day verbal hero.</P>
      <P>When the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Kenny, replied on my behalf to a question which asked if I would confirm that it is the policy of the Government to ban the use of patriots' names in giving titles to public buildings the reply was:</P>
      <P>The fulfilment of the modern, progressive and expansionary policies of the Government do not call for bans of the kind contemplated by the Deputy.</P>

At the same time, there seems little purpose in applying to a building like a computer centre somebody's name merely to commemorate events that have little bearing on the building's function or present day life.</P>

The best interests of Ireland today require an end to emotive titles and ceremonies.  The discontinuance of indiscriminate application of the names of deceased patriots to buildings is not, as Deputy Moore suggests, to debunk the dead.  It is not to denigrate them: it is to respect in a positive way their love of country by turning our eyes in hope to a harmonious future instead of a divided past.  When Deputy Moore expresses his great desire to see Irishmen's names attached to buildings, would he, I wonder, include Carson and Craigavon and Roaring Hanna and those who represent a philosophy and an outlook in a part of this island which has the respect of a million of our people?</P>

      <P>It is surely pathetic that at a time in Ireland when hundreds of children, of women and of men, most of them innocent, some of them policemen and soldiers in the execution of their duty, and many misled activists, have been killed, brutalised and maimed in a ghastly tragedy generated by glorification of the dead and callous disregard of the living&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we are asked in our Parliament to waste time witnessing this Fianna Fáil shadow-boxing, this display of sham patriotism, in an effort to try to belittle the efforts of our Government to create harmony in our island, the creation of which will not be assisted by the miserable extraction of names from the dead simply to get some passing credit for a currently surviving political party. The dead of this island of all communions lived and worked for ideals in which they believed.  That should be the preoccupation of the patriot today and, in declaring our Government's policy to look to the future, I was declaring the unanimously held view of the Government.  This does not mean that we forget the dead.  It does not mean that anyone will try to debunk anybody, least of all our dead; what it does mean is that we will respect the dead by not misinterpreting what they did, by not misinterpreting their motives and, above all, by not mischievously and irrelevantly applying their names to something for some petty advantage.  We believe in a policy of honouring the <Col N="157" /> dead by promoting positive patriotism. That was the essence of what we said: we would promote positive patriotism.  One does that by looking after the interests of those who are alive just as those who are dead did in their day.  We honour them because they did it in their day for the people who then lived with them.  We can best look after the people now living and those yet to come by turning our eyes on the hope of a united future instead of on a divided past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever Deputy Moore may wish, the truth of the matter is that if we select people from only one section of the communities in this island that will be misinterpreted by the other.  It is time, we believe, to honour them all.  It is not necessary to honour the dead in the way Deputy Moore suggests.  The best way to honour them is to study what they did and try to understand their motives.  That is not to suggest that the problems of today can be solved merely by imitating the motives and the decisions of people who can no longer answer for themselves.  If <Col N="158" /> I were to fulfil my own wish I would name a public building after the innocent victim or the hero who died in vain because what he desired to achieve, a united Ireland, has not been achieved, or the innocent father of the young family brutally exterminated, or the broken-hearted mother and widow, or the orphan children who have suffered and are still suffering because their father or mother died in a fruitless cause.  I would call it after the dead ones who, if they could come back, would come back to ask us, for God's sake, to stop the sham: work for the living and work for the future, and stop playing on the dead.  They would say: &ldquo;We are dead and gone.  Work for the future.  That was the ideal for which we worked and died in our time.  That is what we expect you to do and stop carrying on this sham patriotism in the year of Our Lord, One Thousand Nine Hundred and Seventy-Three.&rdquo;</P>
