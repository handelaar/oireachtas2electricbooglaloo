    <Speaker pid="DickBurke" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke) Richard Burke">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. R. Burke)</NameTxt>
      <P>When I reported progress on the 8th November I was dealing with secondary school buildings and I had reached the point at which I was outlining that we had increased the cost limit per square foot from £5.50 to £7 since 1969 and I had mentioned that, while the £7 is now getting tight and will have to be reviewed in January next, it reflects school building costs to a satisfactory building standard.  If there are raw beams in some schools this is not because of the cost limit but rather because of the way consultants opted to spend the available money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Community schools, which are being built below the cost permitted, <Col N="1135" /> have carpeting and high cost acoustic tiles on ceilings, as well as a very high quality of blockwork.  The Castledermot school was mentioned particularly and it was suggested for favourable comparison with other similar projects.  Of course, this school also was built in accordance with the cost limits obtaining at the time when the tenders were obtained.  It was a satisfactory project but not an exceptional one in the sense suggested.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons for the community school project was to find ways to offset escalation in school building costs.  As an example, the tenders for the Kilbarrack school worked out at £5 per square foot in the summer of 1973.  This is a figure which compares very favourably with figures several years ago in this country. No one approves of prefabs but they are necessary in Ireland, as well as in every other country, in the context of a major school building expansion. They are necessary where time will not allow of the erection of permanent buildings, when the future of the school has yet to be determined or where money is not available for full permanent buildings and a limited amount of temporary accommodation will meet needs.</P>
    <P>The mobile prefabs have a life of ten years or more if well maintained. The idea of mobiles was to ensure that they would not be left on site indefinitely, as was happening with traditional prefabs.  Prefabs cost about one-half of the traditional building costs.  The comparison is not meaningful since only minimum accommodation is being provided where with a permanent building, a full development would be in question.</P>
    <P>I must protest at the exaggeration on the part of some Deputies in reference to schools without windows in this context.  I would agree that the creation of so-called windowless schools with dependence on artificial lighting and ventilation would not be appropriate in Ireland.  Community schools are not designed on that basis as the following extract from a recent newspaper article in regard to Tallaght school will indicate:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> Certainly the design of the new building, spacious with plenty of windows which let light in, makes it a very pleasant place to be.</P>
    <P>Reaction to this building has been very favourable from staff, parents and students as well as from visiting educationalists and architects from Spain, The Netherlands and Finland. All this is not to say that I am committed to a particular design.  We will be looking at other design concepts which satisfy, first, the educational requirements and, second, which keep within our cost limits.</P>
    <P>I want now to refer to a number of cases which were raised specifically. With regard to Loughrea, the existing vocational school is situated on a one-acre site which is completely built over and would be unsuitable to take a school extension.  The question of building a new vocational school on another site arises.  The vocational education committee have an 8.5 acre plot across the road about two-thirds of a mile away.  It is 300 yards from a mixed secondary school&mdash;The Mercy&mdash;De la Salle.  This school has been established on Mercy Convent property.  It is probable that the new vocational school will be built on a site immediately adjoining the secondary school.  The 8½ acre VEC plot could then be used for playing fields. The VEC would be asked to explore the possibility of acquiring the rest of the land for the Mercy Sisters.</P>
    <P>In regard to Ballygar, the facilities which can be provided are related to the number of pupils in the school. Only limited facilities can be provided in a small school such as Ballygar with 200 pupils.  The school has ten classrooms, including a metalwork room and a woodwork room, and this accommodation is sufficient for upwards of 225 pupils.  The proximity of larger secondary centres such as Roscommon is bound to have an adverse effect on the Ballygar enrolment of pupils in the Ballygar catchmen area, as the pupils in that catchment area are attracted by the wider range of subjects in the larger centres.</P>
    <P>The vocational school is the only secondary school in Scariff.  There <Col N="1137" /> are 225 pupils in the school this year, and it has a senior cycle.  The number of pupils in the school is not sufficient for the provision of an adequate range of subjects, so rationalisation is necessary. The two secondary centres nearest to Scariff also have only one secondary school each.  They are Tulla, which has a mixed convent secondary school with an enrolment of 229 pupils, and Killaloe, which has a mixed convent secondary school also, with an enrolment of 209.  No definite proposals have been formulated for the area.  A possible course would be to have two of the three schools as junior cycle schools which would feed into the third centre for senior cycle courses.  This third centre would cater for junior and senior cycle pupils.  Tulla is about 12 miles to the west of Scariff, and Killaloe is about 12 miles to the south.  Mobile classrooms have been provided for Scariff National School pending rationalisation of secondary education in the area.</P>
    <P>In regard to Newbridge Vocational School there are difficulties not unconnected with the course of the Liffey.  The site available to the VEC is too far from the other schools in the town.  An alternative site was being sought, but this site, though convenient to the Dominican College, is separated from the college by the river.  An inspection of the alternative site has been made and the architect reports that, while the land involved is suitable for building, there would be difficulty regarding access because it has no road frontage.  Access would have to be by right-of-way through the Patrician Brothers' property or by means of a bridge over the Liffey.  In either case the cost involved would be very heavy.  The architect recommends that the new vocational school should be built on the Patrician Brothers' property and that the site to be bought from the Dominicans should be used for recreation purposes.  It seems that because the Dominican College is primarily a boarding school and because of the high cost of building a bridge over the Liffey, that school should be regarded as a unit in itself for planning purposes.  This leaves the convent, the Patrician <Col N="1138" /> Brothers' school and the vocational school, none of which is really fully viable on its own.  Between them these three schools have about 600 pupils.  Quite obviously, we must give some further thought to the possibilities inherent in having the three schools on conveniently adjacent sites.</P>
    <P>The secondary curriculum was raised by Deputy Wilson and others. Academic and practical subjects are by no means mutually exclusive. Ideally second level education should have a good mix of both types of subjects.  Vocational schools, with long tradition in the teaching of practical subjects, have always included a reasonable proportion of academic subjects in their day school programme.  Since the introduction of the intermediate and leaving certificate courses in these schools, the proportion of academic subjects has been substantially increased.  Secondary schools, on the other hand, even before 1966, included practical subjects in their programme.</P>
    <P>Since the introduction of the common intermediate and leaving certificate programmes in all post-primary schools, there has been a noticeable increase in the number of secondary schools presenting students for examination in practical subjects at leaving certificate level.  The new curriculum for the leaving certificate examination includes a number of practical subjects which were not previously provided for.  A basic aim in promoting proper education is to ensure that the school programmes will provide a big range of subjects, practical, academic and artistic, and so make possible a range of subject options which will suit the particular aptitudes of different students.</P>
    <P>On the subject of school-based training after the leaving certificate, there are, of course, honourable precedents. We have had secretarial sections in which students who have secured the leaving certificate returned to school to prepare for the secretarial certificate examination of the Department of Education.  There is no doubt that a case exists for some specialised pre-employment training after the leaving certificate, and it can <Col N="1139" /> be argued that a post-leaving certificate year of specialised study would be of advantage to those proceeding to third level education.  However, it should be noted that the first year of the third level course in regional technical colleges is a form of introduction to specialised pre-employment training.</P>
    <P>Since entrance to university must be 17 years of age, graduates will be at least 20 years by the time they emerge, and the tendency is for the courses to be extended to four years. In this area, while I can appreciate anxieties about a too-early commencement of third level studies, I must point out to Deputy Wilson that, perhaps, he does not do service to his cause by exaggerating references to completed university courses at 19 years of age.  Moreover, it pushes us to the extremes which operate in some countries where qualification is not obtained until 26 or 27 years of age, and he seems to ignore the efforts those countries are themselves making to remedy what they do not regard as a desirable situation.  Above all, Deputy Wilson seems to confine his thinking to those students, very much the minority, who go on to higher studies.  It is quite unrealistic to suggest we should concentrate on general studies to leaving certificate level and then think of preparation for industry.  Indeed, it is so unrealistic in regard to the great majority of our school population&mdash;and, incidentally, out of line with what Deputy Faulkner said on the balance in our education between the more academic and the practical sides&mdash;that I wonder if Deputy Wilson, on reflection, might revise his thinking on this matter.</P>
    <P>I must say I was surprised at the suggestions on streaming in regard to the junior cycle.  It is not desirable that students should be streamed up to intermediate certificate level, if by streaming is meant concentration on a limited number of subjects.  However, &ldquo;setting&rdquo;, which allows students to follow alternative subject courses which suit their intellectual ability is an acceptable alternative to <Col N="1140" /> subject streaming, and the provision of higher and lower courses in three subjects for the intermediate certificate examination establishes a basis for such procedure.  In this connection my Department is looking into the question of greater integration of subject areas at junior cycle level, and a number of projects are at present being undertaken on this matter.</P>
    <P>There is full agreement that agricultural education is desirable in all rural schools and, indeed, in urban schools which pupils from rural areas attend.  This can be done by following one of the science subjects, particularly syllabus E, up to intermediate certificate level, and agricultural science and agricultural economics up to leaving certificate level.</P>
    <P>It should also be pointed out that woodwork and metal work are subjects of much benefit to future farmers and that these are being provided on an increasing scale in all secondary schools.  On the wider issue I must, of course, keep in close touch with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney castigates me because I have not at once come up with a syllabus for Irish studies.  The House will remember that I spoke about this last April when introducing the changes in regard to compulsory Irish.  When I spoke about Irish studies I knew what I wanted and I indicated what my concept embraced &mdash;a knowledge of Irish history and Irish culture, as well as a knowledge of Irish.  I did appeal, and I make no apology for it, for suggestions and advice in regard to the development of my concept.  Deputy Tunney said that I had not any ideas about Irish studies because I asked teachers for suggestions.  Deputy Tunney does not recognise consultation when he hears of it.</P>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Tunney's statement about my claim to have introduced real consultation, I might say that at a teachers' meeting in the Gresham Hotel on 25th October one of the representative speakers, Father Hughes, S.J., thanked me for introducing consultation and asked me to be patient because they were not used <Col N="1141" /> to being consulted.  I have sent out a document on regionalisation as a draft for discussion and invited all participating bodies to discuss it.  I have invited all local interests which have expressed anxiety about educational proposals in their areas to come and talk these over in the Department. In fact, I had a group to see me on the very day that Deputy Tunney was speaking.  This was a representative group of the VEC in County Waterford discussing the leaving certificate cycle in Kilmacthomas.  I have not made a list of all our efforts at consultation but I venture to say that the list would be substantial.</P>
    <P>Deputies Hussey, Coughlan and Haughey, among others, spoke about free books in the second level sphere. The only significant difference between the administration of the free book scheme in secondary and in vocational schools is that while the grants are paid directly to the school headmasters in the case of the secondary schools they are paid to vocational school principals through the vocational education committees as, of course, are all other State grants for vocational schools.  As far as the operation of the scheme within a school is concerned there is no difference. The principal teacher, within the overall allocation of money made available, has discretion in the selection of pupils to be assisted and in the amount of assistance to be given. There is no discrimination against vocational schools pupils.  While under these arrangements an occasional anomaly is possible, such as different treatment being given to two members of the same family in different schools, and, of course, such a case should be capable of being resolved locally, the scheme works well in the great majority of schools and great credit is due to the teachers for the care with which they administer this scheme in schools generally.  A centralised scheme administered from Dublin with a formal means test would be impersonal and inflexible and would probably provide a less effective means of meeting the needs of the needy pupils in the matter of books and accessories.  It is not correct to say <Col N="1142" /> that money is left unspent each year out of the allocation in the Vote.  In an open-ended scheme such as this it is not prudent to estimate for the minimum expenditure expected.  While in the last financial year the original voted provision for this service in the secondary schools, £230,000, was found to be insufficient and a Supplementary Estimate was passed by the Dáil, there was a saving on the total provision as thus increased but this is characteristic of such open-ended schemes. It is important also to realise that text books for secondary and vocational school courses are not prescribed by the Department.  The only prescribed material is the literary content of language courses and, therefore, there is no departmental control over the books which individual pupils have to have or over the cost of the books to the student.</P>
    <P>Deputies Mrs. Desmond, Coughlan, Hussey, Power and other Deputies spoke about transport to second level schools.  Indeed, many Deputies referred in one way or another to this problem.  The references in my introductory speech to the cost of this scheme were intended to draw attention to an important aspect, that is that it is easy to ask for extensions of the scheme and improvements to the service while ignoring the very high share of total educational expenditure which has already been spent on the transport scheme.  We must be conscious of the cost of the service and try to make it as efficient and economic as possible but it goes without saying that I do not want to do this at the expense of the children. At the secondary level there has been a good deal of complaint about catchment areas and catchment boundaries. It must be borne in mind that these catchment areas were drawn up after consultation with all the interests involved and that alteration of catchment boundaries and the provision of transport from one catchment area to another can have very serious consequences for the school in the catchment area which is losing these pupils.  In the circumstances, it is not difficult to understand that managers and teachers are very <Col N="1143" /> seriously concerned where proposals of this nature are made and that my Department cannot over-ride their wishes unless they are satisfied that the services being offered are not adequate. Moreover, Deputies will readily appreciate that a series of crisscross transport services would be very wasteful and extremely expensive. The original purpose of the free transport scheme was to assist pupils in rural areas, particularly those who lived a considerable distance from their nearest school and where, very often, there was no bus service available even if the parents could afford to pay for it.  It is basic to the scheme that transport be to the nearest suitable school and, indeed, many of the complaints made during the debate arise from concessions which have been made from time to time, for example, catchment boundary facilities for pupils not attending their nearest school and special fares for children who are not eligible for free transport.  This, perhaps, points up the fact that concessions, however well-intentioned, often only succeed in creating dissatisfaction and generating pressure for further concessions.</P>
    <P>There are a number of specific points to which I want to refer.  Minimum standards have been laid down for these transport services: (1) no pupil shall have more than three miles to walk or cycle either to school or to a pick-up point on a school bus route; (2) no pupil shall spend too much time per day between waiting and travelling time.  Waiting time arises because many buses double trip in the interests of economy.  Some pupils arrive before school opens while others must wait after school closing time.  Generally those who are brought in first in the morning are brought home first in the afternoon so as to minimise the inconvenience. Double tripping must continue to be a feature of school transport services if costs are to be kept within reason.  Pupils not eligible for free transport to and from school public transport to and from school benefit from the subsidy of £3,54,000 per year paid by the Department to CIE.  The effect of this subsidy is that the general fares increases in the CIE <Col N="1144" /> network which took place in October, 1970 and in August, 1971 did not apply to school-going children.  The subsidy was not increased to meet the fares increase of August, 1973 and school-child fares increased accordingly.  Nevertheless, these fares are now only 37 per cent of the adult fare compared with 50 per cent for any other child.  In no instance was the increase more than 1 p per journey.</P>
    <P>Transport catchment areas were based on the location of national schools to their nearest secondary centres and were finally drawn up only after full consultation with the local interests involved.  Pupils eligible for free transport but not attending the school or schools serving their own catchment area are given concessionary transport from the catchment boundary of the centre at which they attend school.  Less than 7 per cent of the pupils eligible for free transport have availed of this concession.  This indicates a fairly general assessment of catchment areas.</P>
    <P>We have no evidence that catchment areas are &ldquo;chaotic&rdquo;.  They are determined on the basis of the distance. Pupils who are attending their nearest school but who are less than the qualifying distance from it are allowed to travel on the school buses at a nominal fare provided that the space capacity is available.  Transport routes are organised so as to ensure that as far as possible the vehicle is used to its full capacity.  Where spare seats happen to be available noneligible pupils along the route are given the concession of travelling as farepayers up to the limit of the spare capacity available.  These spare seats are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis.  When all spare seats have been occupied, there can be no question of providing larger vehicles to provide for additional pupils seeking transport as farepayers.  The provision of larger vehicles in such cases would involve additional costs which would not be covered by the nominal fares charged to farepayers. These fares are justified only by the fact that it is costing us nothing extra to fill empty seats.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1145" /> A minibus licensed to carry 21 passengers is carrying nine eligible pupils plus 12 farepayers to Ballyrassan National School.  A further seven or so children are also seeking transport as farepayers but to cater for these would involve putting on a bigger bus at an extra cost of about £40 per term.  Any examination of the offer by the parents to pay the extra cost would have to take all the cost factors into account and would necessitate some rethinking of the basic principles of the scheme.  I am not sure that the suggestion would be possible but I shall have it considered carefully.</P>
    <P>Handicapped children, mercifully, form only a small portion of schoolchildren and their dispersion over wide areas means that transport is difficult to organise.  While efforts are made to convenience pupils to the greatest extent feasible, in most cases a door-to-door service would not only be extremely costly but would add to the travelling time of the other pupils. This is a factor that must be borne in mind by those who advocate such a service.  Modification of the services to St. Anne's School for moderately-handicapped children has been made recently in an effort to convenience pupils further.</P>
    <P>On the point raised by Deputy Mrs. Desmond regarding weekend transport for a group of pupils who are only 12 miles from pick-up points, my Department are in touch with CIE and expect to have a report as soon on the possibilities.</P>
    <P>On the question raised regarding two children in one family being eligible for free transport while another in the same family is not so eligible because the school concerned in the latter case was within the three-mile limit, I would point out that such a case should not arise.  Where different schools are involved in the one town the distance is measured from a central point.  So far as possible a point that is approximately equidistant between all schools and which is identifiable readily is selected, for example, a post office, a church, <i>et cetera.</i> The object of this is precisely to avoid the splitting up of families.  By working to a central point <Col N="1146" /> all members of the one family are either eligible or not irrespective of which school they are attending.  If this practice does not obtain at any centre it should be introduced.  The matter is one that should not have to be raised in Dáil Éireann.  I would like Deputies to bring any such cases to my attention.</P>
    <P>On the question of the position of parents, teachers and students in regard to secondary level education, I would point out that parents are provided for on the boards of management of community schools.  Teachers are not on these boards but in some cases are appointed secretaries to the boards. This is a matter on which I, as a teacher, in common with many of my professional colleagues, have considerable reservations.  There is room here for a further examination of the implications in this regard both for the teachers and for the management boards.  There is no provision for student participation in management. The formation of student councils which would make suggestions to the board should be considered.  Such councils exist in many secondary schools.</P>
    <P>Regarding slow learners, there is provision for guidance teachers outside the quota for schools having more than 250 pupils.  The Department are agreeable also to two schools having less than 250 pupils each sharing a guidance teacher.  In this respect there should be no difficulty arising from two systems, vocational and secondary, because a guidance teacher could be employed by either the vocational education committee or by the secondary school. People spend a proportionate part of the time in each of the schools.</P>
    <P>I mention especially the question of Clonakilty because during the course of the debate some rather impassioned pleas were addressed to me as if I were the only arbiter and also because the issues here indicate fairly clearly the extent to which many of these matters are so firmly in the hands of the local parties as to defy all attempts at a solution from a distance by an outsider, however interested or disinterested, according to one's point-of-view.  Most Deputies are <Col N="1147" /> aware now that there are three schools in Clonakilty&mdash;the convent school which caters for about 420 girls including about 100 boarders, the vocational school which caters for 210 boys and girls and a lay secondary school which caters for about 100 boys.  The Department suggested a community school to cater for all 730 students but the convent have refused consistently to accept such a solution. The other two schools would accept that solution.  The major religious superiors proposed then that the convent school be allowed to continue as it is and that the other two schools be amalgamated to form one vocational school.  This school would be sited close to the convent school and co-operation established between both of the schools.</P>
    <P>The former Minister agreed to proceed on this basis and for my part I am prepared to honour his decision. However, the trouble is that there is substantial opposition to this course. When I use the word &ldquo;school&rdquo; in this context I am referring to the whole entity concerned, the management, the teachers and the parents. The three parties in each case must consider the future welfare of the children of their school and no one should forget that each party has its own difficulties in facing up to an arrangement aimed at the future welfare of the children of all three schools.</P>
    <P>While taking account of these difficulties, an outsider, even the Minister for Education, may be forgiven for suggesting gently but firmly that the problem is one primarily for the people of Clonakilty and that the solution must come from them.  To those continuing to press for a community school I would say, therefore, that I would be glad if this solution were acceptable generally.  However, if this is not the case I cannot impose it.  To those resisting that solution I would say that deference to their wishes on the matter of principle places on their shoulders a serious responsibility for willing co-operation in arriving at the closest possible alternative solution in the interest of <Col N="1148" /> all the children.  To all I would say that my Department should be as flexible as possible in arriving at an alternative solution but that they must be able to count on similar flexibility from other interested parties.</P>
    <P>Deputy Staunton referred to the system for the selection of the teachers for appointments to schools under vocational educational committees.  It is my impression that there is general satisfaction with the present arrangements for the making of such appointments. A procedure for the constitution of appointment selection boards has been adopted by all 38 vocational education committees and has operated for the past six years.  The function of the board is to determine the relative merits of the applicants for each post and to make a selection accordingly.  The understanding is that in the normal way the vocational education committee will make the appointments in accordance with the selections of the board.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power principally, and other Deputies, spoke about teacher training.  I have already announced the setting-up of a committee who had their first meeting on 26th October, 1973, to do the following things: (1) examine the functions proposed by the Higher Education Authority; (2) consider how its powers and functions should be defined to enable it to achieve its objectives; (3) consider its composition and structure; (4) consider its relationship with other involved interests; (5) consider how it should be financed; and (6) report to the Minister when it has finished its work.  It is too early yet to comment on any of the detailed functions which it may have.  I do not want to go further into general issues at this time but there are a number of points arising out of the debate on which I wish to comment.</P>
    <P>In regard to singing for girl candidates for national teacher training colleges.  I must repeat that singing is an essential element in the curriculum of the primary school.  I think few will doubt that it should be so.  Further, in junior classes particularly it is integrated <Col N="1149" /> with the teaching of other subjects as, for instance, in the singing of simple rhymes in Irish or in English. It is necessary, therefore, that as many teachers as possible should be able to sing to the extent necessary to enable them to teach the primary school curriculum in full.  Audio-visual aids, though extremely useful in education, would not compensate for a lack of ability to sing or to teach singing on the part of the teacher.  For these reasons I am not prepared, at this stage at least, to modify the requirement that girl candidates for admission to training must qualify in a singing test unless they have attained a very high standard in the other subjects which comprise the competition.</P>
    <P>On the question raised as to whether the increasing intake of candidates to these colleges was affecting quality, and specifically as to the comparison with ten years ago, I can say that (a) in the case of girl candidates in 1963 the standard reached by the last entrant to training was four honours, Irish, English, history and Latin, plus pass mathematics, domestic science and geography, and in 1973 the standard achieved for last candidate entering training was three honours, Irish, English, and French, plus pass mathematics, history and home economics: (b) in the case of boy candidates, in 1963 the position was four honours, Irish, history, geography and Greek, plus pass mathematics, English and history, and in 1973 the position was four honours, Irish, English, Latin and accountancy, plus pass mathematics and chemistry.  Deputies can draw their own conclusions from those facts.  I do not think there is such a great disparity in the quality of entrants.</P>
    <P>In regard to teachers coming from England the position is that teachers who have successfully completed a full-time course of teacher training of not less than two years duration at a recognised training college in England will not be permitted to teach in a recognised capacity in a national school until they pass the preliminary test in oral Irish.  These tests are, however, arranged in such a way as to facilitate English trained teachers who may be interested in coming back here to teach.  It would, for example, be <Col N="1150" /> possible for such teachers to take the oral Irish test during the Christmas or Easter holidays and to commence teaching here on the following 1st July. English trained teachers may, of course, seek appointment in special schools for the deaf, emotionally disturbed and mentally handicapped, where qualifications in the Irish language are not compulsory.</P>
    <P>On the matter of in-service training the question was asked why this could not be done during school term.  The position is that courses for teachers with few exceptions are held during holiday periods.  The number of such courses held during school terms is kept to the minimum to avoid, as far as possible, disruption of school work. Another reason for holding these courses during holiday periods is the easier availability of instructors and lecturers.  If it were decided to extend the number of such courses held during the school terms it could cause considerable disruption in the work of the students even if substitute teachers would add very considerably to the over all cost of instruction in the schools.</P>
    <P>Ninety-six approved courses of at least one week's duration were organised during the vocation periods this year, involving some 9,000 teachers. In addition, a series of evening lectures was conducted at various centres throughout the country.  It is obvious that if these courses were held during the school period it would involve a considerable disruption of normal school organisation to the detriment of the children's education.  Where the full expenses of a course are not recouped by the Department, extra personal vacation, usually three to five school days, may be allowed to the teachers who attend such courses.  The future development of in-service training will fall to be considered by the proposed Foras Oiliúna.</P>
    <P>In the matter of teachers of elocution, I must say that there has always been official recognition of the importance of speech training as a fundamental part of the work in primary schools.  It is for this reason that so <Col N="1151" /> much attention is paid to speech and drama in the course of study in all teacher training colleges.  Highly qualified lecturers have recently been appointed in colleges and speech and drama is an integral part of every primary school teacher's training.  As speech is a matter of habit it must be recognised that all teachers have a role to play in the raising of standards and something as important as speech training could not be left as the responsibility of the occasional visiting elocution teacher.  Elocution, verse speaking, drama, <i>et cetera</i>, do not constitute a separate recognised subject in second level schools.  They may be recognised only to the extent that they form part of the recognised subjects, Irish, English or whatever the language may be.  There is a general feeling that it would not be desirable to have a particular aspect of a subject isolated from the teaching of the subject as a whole.  Elocution and speech training should be given by teachers generally in the normal course of educating their pupils.</P>
    <P>In secondary schools only teachers who hold qualifications acceptable to the registration council and who are engaged full-time in the teaching of recognised subjects may be paid incremental salaries by the Department. This council is statutorily constituted and comprises 18 members, only two of whom represent the Minister for Education.  The question of the acceptance of qualifications in speech and drama for registration purposes was fully discussed by the registration council in 1968.  The council, however, decided against recognising such qualifications.  Schools are, of course, free to employ speech and drama teachers and to pay them such a salary as may be agreed on between the teachers and the manager of a particular school.</P>
    <P>The introduction of guidance and remedial teachers in second level schools means that pupils with speech handicaps, who would require specialised help, would be referred for appropriate treatment if such were readily available.  Assistance with technique in relation to interviews and <Col N="1152" /> competitions would normally come within the ambit of the guidance teacher.  It could, of course, be a matter for each individual guidance teacher to assess the needs of the children in a particular area and to organise his programme accordingly.</P>
    <P>By the way, the status of the subjects speech training, and so on, might be enhanced for boy students if the word &ldquo;communications&rdquo; were substituted for the word &ldquo;elocution&rdquo; for reasons which are obvious to Deputies who may think about it.</P>
    <P>References were made by Deputy Wilson and others to the National Museum and the National Library. As I said at the opening of the debate, I have devolved responsibility in my Departments to my Parliamentary Secretary for these matters. However, I want to make a few comments. I am afraid that the references made by the Opposition Deputies to the plight of the National Library and the National Museum cannot be regarded as other than cynical.  Comments including words like &ldquo;atrocious&rdquo; and &ldquo;distastrous&rdquo; could scarcely be regarded as relating to recent history. These Deputies spoke as if to infer that bad conditions began with the change of Government.  Surely they could not have been ignorant of the fact that criticism inside and outside of the House has a lengthy history and that their own party had many years in office in which to do something positive to remedy these matters.</P>
    <P>It was quite extraordinary&mdash;and I say this with all respect&mdash; to hear Deputy Wilson return to this topic again and again and, indeed, even resume it on the radio the following day as if his party had not been in office.  In this connection Deputy Faulkner, with characteristic honesty, admitted that he might have been able to do more in his time in office. I am not criticising him.  I am just stating the situation.  Of course, as a community we cannot be proud of the conditions in which these two premier national institutions have to subsist, however proud we may be of what they contain as repositories of our national heritage in one form or another.  It would not be going too <Col N="1153" /> far to say that we should be thoroughly ashamed that they have been allowed to fall to such a low ebb in terms of physical accommodation.</P>
    <P>It was precisely because I recognised that urgent action would have to be taken if both the library and the museum were to recover the prestige which is rightly theirs that one of my earlier decisions after taking office as Minister was to assign special responsibility for both and for the National Gallery to my Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Bruton.  He has approached that task with an equal sense of the urgency attaching to a solution of the problems affecting both the library and the museum.  The assignment is not an easy one.  It would not be realistic to expect that the neglect which has characterised the life of the two institutions for such a long time, and the inevitable consequences of that neglect, could be remedied overnight.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the Parliamentary Secretary has applied himself energetically to the problems involved over the past few months.  He has, at his own instance, personally interviewed persons and bodies who are in a position to offer useful suggestions in regard to the short term and the long term development of both the museum and the library.  He is currently reviewing the position in each case in the light of the suggestions he has received for the purpose of formulating positive proposals for my consideration in due course.</P>
    <P>Limited accommodation, of course, lies at the root of the difficulties in each of these institutions.  How this problem is to be satisfactorily resolved in the long term requires, and will receive, serious consideration.  There are negotiations in progress to acquire additional space for both the museum and the library in the new Setanta building in Kildare Street as a partial amelioration of their accommodation shortcomings until a decision is reached on the question of providing improved long-term accommodation for both.  A satisfactory outcome to these negotiations will necessarily be <Col N="1154" /> dependent upon the financial terms being reasonable and acceptable.</P>
    <P>There are also plans for the building of a book repository at Santry, the facilities of which will be shared between the National Library, the city and county of Dublin public libraries and Trinity College.  Although accommodation restrictions seriously impede the potential of both the museum and the library for full development they are not, of course, the only limiting factor.  Consideration will also have to be given to the staffing and equipping of the two institutions on lines which will enable them to fulfil their roles adequately in the modern world.</P>
    <P>These desirable improvements cannot be carried to their full extent until suitable permanent buildings have first been made available.  Of paramount importance, too, is the desirability, one might even say the necessity, of availing to a far greater extent than at present of the contribution which these and other cultural institutions can make to the general system. Serious consideration is being given at present to the feasibility of establishing an educational service associated with appropriate cultural institutions at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>While I have laid particular emphasis on the physical shortcomings of the museum and the library because, understandably, they are the facets which have attracted most vigorous public comment and criticism, I would not wish to let this occasion pass without paying a well deserved tribute to those most immediately associated with each of these institutions, the directors and staff of both, the Council of Trustees of the library, and the Board of Visitors of the museum, for their continued dedication to, interest in, and work for the institutions, notwithstanding the disappointments and frustrations which they have had to face.  I hope they will understand that there is now a serious intention on the part of the Government to do something positive towards a realisation of their hopes and ideals and that, in the interim, they will continue to devote their talents to the well-being <Col N="1155" /> of the institutions as assiduously as they have done in the past.</P>
    <P>Some criticisms were directed at the National Museum during the course of the debate which I do not think I should let pass without comment.  It was stated that there was no general guide to the collections.  This is true, but there are very good reasons for it. It must be remembered that the museum collections number between 3,500,000 and 4,000,000 items.  These are, of course, all duly numbered and registered in the records of the museum.  Obviously, it would neither be feasible nor desirable to publish so comprehensive a catalogue.  Such a catalogue would be so large and expensive that there would be virtually no demand and consequently no sale for it.  Very few people would be interested in the whole range of museum material.  Catalogues of this kind are no longer produced by most museums. Of greater interest to visitors are an outline guide to the principal collections, already available, and more detailed guides to particular material in which they have a special interest.  A number of guides in the latter category are also already available or in course of production.</P>
    <P>I cannot subscribe to the criticism of the museum's publication record in general.  The current list of museum publications runs to 22 items.  Since 1962 an annual list of the archaeological acquisitions has been published which gives full particulars of every item acquired during the year, many of them illustrated by drawings and photographs.  In addition, members of the museum staff have over the years contributed an extensive number of research articles dealing with museum material to learned publications of various kinds at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>A statement was made to the effect that collections in other countries, presumably of Irish interest, are available to this country on request.  In this context reference was made to the Pitt River's Collection in Dorset. It is true that the collection does contain or did contain some important <Col N="1156" /> Irish items which the National Museum would be interested in acquiring in the ordinary course.  It is understood, however, that there are legal difficulties associated with the collection which do not offer a prospect of being easily surmounted.  The museum authorities are not aware of any other collections of Irish interest abroad which are available for acquisition and, with one exception, none has been offered.  The exception was a collection of Irish material called the Brackstone Collection which was housed in Salisbury Museum and which, thanks to the co-operation of the Curator of that museum, the National Museum duly acquired.</P>
    <P>It may be that, as was suggested during the debate, the museum could profit if a greater measure of publicity were given to the facilities and services it provides.  This suggestion will certainly be given serious consideration.  I should, however, mention in this context that the museum caters for some 20,000 school pupils every year by way of educational tours and that large numbers of students from Dublin schools also visit it from time to time.  These are apart from the ordinary visitors at home and from abroad who count a tour of the museum as a necessary part of their visit to the capital city and who do not offer any criticism of the services which the institution provides.</P>
    <P>Deputy Power raised the question of student assistance in regional technical colleges.  Careful consideration was given to the question whether a national scheme of grants should be established to assist students taking third level education courses in the regional technical colleges. New legislation would be required for this since the courses at present provided in these colleges would not be admissible for the tenure of grants under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968. Furthermore a national grants scheme of courses at this level would have to be based on a lower level of qualification than that prescribed for grants to degree level courses but, since the level of student maintenance <Col N="1157" /> assistance would need to be the same, it would be virtually impossible to avoid merging the two schemes into one third level grant scheme at the lower level of qualification and this might very well result in very few of the grantees competing for the courses provided in the regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>There was also the consideration that a national grants scheme would have to be administered under rules which of necessity would be inflexible. Legislation already existed in the Vocational Education Act of 1930 under which student assistance for attendance at technician level courses could be provided by vocational education committees by way of scholarships and such scholarship schemes were in operation in many vocational education areas for some time past.  These schemes admitted of greater inflexibility than could be achieved under a national grants scheme established under statute and so could be more suited to regional needs.</P>
    <P>For example, scholarships could be offered in an industrial area for competition between students who did not reach the leaving certificate but who pursued their studies in trade subjects after entering their apprenticeships. It was decided that the needs of students for assistance in the non-degree third level area of education could be served satisfactorily by giving increased funds to vocational education committees to enable them to offer substantially more scholarships and this was done.  The increased funds were distributed as fairly as possible over the country on the basis of the numbers of leaving certificate students in each vocational education area.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of awarding scholarships to second year students who did not hold awards in their first year it must be emphasised that such a practice does not obtain in scholarship schemes generally.  A scholarship by its nature is awarded on the basis of merit as shown in competition and to allow a student who had completed a year in third level education to compete with candidates who were only <Col N="1158" /> leaving secondary education would be unfair.  Besides this would give all the unsuccessful candidates in the entrance year a second chance on more favourable terms in a subsequent year with consequent effects on those seeking scholarships in that particular year.</P>
    <P>I should like now to say a few words about higher education.  Following the decision of the Government at the time to establish a third level education institute in Limerick the Higher Education Authority was asked to recommend how such an institution might be fitted into the existing or future provisions for higher education. The authority made certain recommendations and the National Institute for Higher Education, Limerick, was established and, as I said recently, when I was presented by the planning board with its development plan, that institute has already in its brief existence shown that it is designed to play a very full, creative and innovative role in Irish education. Four years have passed since the Higher Education Authority reported on the institution to be established in Limerick.  Several events have occurred in intervening period which have affected the situation which then prevailed in the Limerick region.  In the first place there has been established on the same campus the National College for Physical Education which it is planned to expand to cater for the education of teachers of many other specialised subjects.  Secondly, a course leading to the higher diploma in education is now being provided in Mary Immaculate Training College from University College, Cork. Thirdly, the training course for primary teachers, which is also provided in Mary Immaculate Training College, is to be extended from two to three years with those who successfully complete it being awarded a degree.</P>
    <P>These three developments have altered the whole landscape of higher education not only in Limerick but in the country generally and other developments, new needs and new demands which must be met have also changed the educational situation. All of the changes and developments <Col N="1159" /> that I have mentioned have made Limerick a great centre of educational activity.  It was in this context that I made my recent statement and I want to make it clear that, when I said I would envisage a university for Limerick, I was not thinking about the immediate future but about a development which might come about in the next decade.  Meantime diplomas and degrees earned in the Limerick Institute of Higher Education will be awarded by the National Council for Educational Awards.</P>
    <P>Deputy Healy spoke about the dental hospitals and dental education. I propose to deal with the dental hospitals in Dublin and Cork together since they are intrinsically bound up with the recommendations on dental education contained in the report of the Higher Education Authority on university re-organisation.  It has been stated that conditions in the existing premises of the Dublin Dental Hospital are not fully satisfactory.  Of this I am fully aware, but there is nothing that can be done about it immediately beyond continuing with such ameliorative measures as are feasible by way of adapting the additional accommodation in Dunlop Oriel House, Westland Row, to supplement the facilities in the main building in Lincoln Place and to enable the space in both buildings to be used more constructively in the context of the hospital's general needs.</P>
    <P>The trouble is that new dental hospitals were projected for both Dublin and Cork but the Higher Educational Authority advised, as an integral part of its recommendations on the re-organisation of higher education generally, that on educational, financial and demographic grounds the case for the rationalisation of dental teaching by providing for it in a single centre and for the selection of the Dublin Dental Hospital as that centre is overwhelming.  Pending a decision on that recommendation by the Government the proposal for the provision of a new dental hospital in Dublin has had to be deferred and, for the same reason, the plans for the building of a new dental hospital in Cork had to be put to one side <Col N="1160" /> although in this case they had reached a very advanced stage.</P>
    <P>If it were just a question of deciding the future provision to be made for dental education alone the matter might be resolved with reasonable expedition but, as Deputies will be aware, the future of dental education cannot be divorced from the future of higher education generally and treated in isolation. Neither do I have to remind the House, I am sure, of the complexities inherent in the restructuring of the university system in the Dublin area in particular.  While, therefore, I appreciate very fully the sense of disappointment and frustration at the lack of progress by those closely associated with dental education in Dublin and Cork&mdash;and they have made their views known to my Department in no uncertain terms&mdash;I feel that I can offer no lasting solution to the problem until I am in a position to formulate long-term proposals for the re-organisation of the country's system of higher education generally and my proposals have been approved by the Government.</P>
    <P>What I have said about the dental hospitals in Dublin and Cork applies equally to the question of the provision to be made for architectural education in the future.  The Higher Education Authority dealt substantially with this matter in its report on the Ballymun project.  It was referred to also in the authority's report on university reorganisation. In brief, the authority, having considered the matter in all its aspects, reached the conclusion that the best interests of architectural teaching would lie in there being only one school of architecture and considered that that school should be on the campus of University College, Dublin. The authority recognised that if this recommendation was accepted the two existing schools in Dublin could not be immediately integrated and envisaged that the process of phasing out the courses in architecture now provided in the College of Technology, Bolton Street, might take five years to complete.</P>
    <P>The authority's recommendation in this respect takes its place amongst <Col N="1161" /> the several recommendations which the authority has made in the two reports referred to for the re-organisation and development of higher education generally, and a decision in relation to architectural education will not be taken except in the context of the Government's overall determination, in due course, of the form which the organisation of higher education is to take in the future.</P>
    <P>A question was raised about town planning.  A course leading to the award of a diploma in town planning is provided by University College, Dublin.  The course is a post graduate one of three years duration and candidates for the course must have obtained a degree in architecture or civil engineering, or an honours degree in economics or geography, or a qualification of equivalent standing approved by the college's faculty of engineering and architecture.  The authorities of the college, and the Higher Education Authority, agreed last year on certain steps deemed to be necessary to strengthen the department of town planning.  These included the creation of additional teaching posts which have since been filled and the provision of funds to enable the accommodation at Earlsfort Terrace to be suitably adapted to serve the department's requirements.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the amount provided in the Estimate for adult education is too small but, as I said in my speech, the whole matter of adult education has been subjected to an exhaustive examination by a special committee.  I have received the committee's report and I hope that a Press conference to be given by the committee in the near future will enable the public to appreciate the reasons, and the principles, on which they base their report.  This will take place in the very near future.  I do not have to remind the House that adult education in the light of the demand for continuing education is a most important sector.  It is my firm intention to support it as strongly as our resources will allow.</P>
    <P>A question was asked about the National College for Physical Education, <Col N="1162" /> particularly about teachers of physical education and the new course of Irish studies.  The position in that regard is that all students at NCPE will follow a course in Irish studies during their first three years in college.  Some students will select at the end of their first year Irish studies as their second area of specialisation and will study the subject in depth during their second, third and fourth years.  I am satisfied, from all the advice available to me, that the students who specialise in Irish studies will be qualified to teach Irish, and will be unusually well qualified to teach the new Irish studies course envisaged for the secondary schools.</P>
    <P>That brings to a conclusion my remarks on the Estimate for Education. I should like to refer briefly to a point raised by Deputy Griffin on proposals in the matter of incremental credit for teaching service in developed countries.  I should like to state that these are under active consideration in my Department.  Those who write letters to the newspapers reminding me of the position I took, when an Opposition Deputy, in regard to incremental credit for those teaching abroad can take my assurance that I am pursuing this matter with the utmost attention because I believe myself that something must be done to change the regulations in this regard but the public at large will have to await discussions on this matter. I am certainly pursuing it with all the vigour I can.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to thank all the Deputies who contributed to this debate.  I regret, as I said at the outset, that one of the Deputies does not consider me fit to be Minister for Education.  I want to welcome an old colleague and friend, Deputy John Wilson, as spokesman for the Opposition on Education and the Arts and to assure him of my full co-operation with him as I am sure I can be assured of his co-operation with me in what is largely a bi-partisan approach to educational matters in this country.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a period of great expansion particularly in third level education.  No time is being wasted in <Col N="1163" /> my Department in coming to conclusions about the many difficulties of the third level area and I hope to be in a position very shortly to announce Government proposals in this field. This may be before the end of the year, or it may be after the end of the year.  Some people castigate me for having made a promise that I would produce results by the end of the year but I said in this House&mdash;I believe it was in answer to Deputy John O'Connell&mdash;that I would do my best but that I was not going to be tied.  I can assure the House that I will spare no effort to bring our deliberations to a conclusion in this field in the very near future.  I should like to thank the Members of this House for the kindly way they received my Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that I am entitled to ask a few questions through the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask if the Minister is satisfied that sufficient money has been allotted for research this year and if he might consider increasing the amount during the year?  Does the Minister consider that we have adequate information on the proposed regionalisation since the document states that it is to be confined to vocational education and yet most reports we receive indicate that other sections of what we call secondary education have been invited to participate? I should also like to ask in what year will the Examinations Board be in charge of examinations for the first time?  Regarding the idea of apprenticeship after a secondary course would the Minister not agree that it would be desirable if young men and women who are without jobs should have their attention directed to the possibility of apprenticeship? Does the Minister not agree that there is a kind of <i>folie de grandeur</i> about having the leaving certificate which often blocks off that area of employment to people who hold it?  Does the Minister not agree that the AnCO people in Ballyfermot are on the right line by even taking in university graduates and directing them towards <Col N="1164" /> industry and giving them ground training?</P>
    <P>With regard to the National Library, and accepting what the Minister has said already by way of criticism, would the Minister not agree that the receipt of a vast amount of material from the EEC since the beginning of this year has added a new dimension to the difficulties of the staff in the library?  With regard to the National Museum, would the Minister not agree that there is a necessity for a guide to the different rooms and a description of the items in the various cases?  Some years ago before I went to Athens I could only study the material relating to that city in the rooms from the National Museum guide.</P>
    <P>I wish to praise the Minister's commitment to adult education but I should like to ask him if the report is generally available.  I have asked the office to obtain this report for me because I was away in another part of the country when it was presented. I do not know if it is generally available.</P>
    <P>I should like to praise the Minister's determination to do something about the recognition of service abroad.  My question would be: how soon could this be managed?  Just one other question: seeing that there are ethical difficulties about scholarships in the second year at regional technical colleges, would it be possible to make a grant at that stage on merit to somebody who missed it on the first stage?</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>There is never enough money available for education but whatever influence I can use will be in the direction of increasing the money available for this purpose from whatever source it may come. In saying this I am not confining myself to ordinary Exchequer sources.  In regard to regionalisation the draft document submitted for the consideration of various educational interests may have been misleading in that&mdash;I now quote from memory because I did not realise the Deputy would raise this point&mdash;one of the original statements <Col N="1165" /> in it was that nothing in the document would call in question management of private secondary schools, or something on those lines.  A similar statement was made in regard to primary schools.  These statements simply meant that the concept of regionalisation, or devolution of authority to county and regional authorities, did not in itself require any change in the management structure. It did not exclude such changes. I think I might say that if we had realised that this would confuse people we might have worded it slightly differently but I can assure the public that the question of change of management, say, in primary schools is separate from the matter of regionalisation and is, in fact, being dealt with separately.</P>
      <P>I am always in a difficulty when a Deputy asks me about when something will happen.  I have already referred to the unnecessary criticisms of certain educational correspondents who criticise me and anticipate failure to deliver on a promise, as they put it, when I say that I will try&mdash;and I have all along said that I shall try&mdash; to have something on third level education, say, by the end of this year. When I give a date in reply to Deputy Wilson's question for example, about the examination board I give it in the same context, not as a promise and not to be reminded by education correspondents that I made a promise.  I am setting a target for myself to keep myself hard at it.  If they would only get it into their heads that I am not breaking promises but giving myself a target date which I must, with all public opinion behind me, strive to attain, they would be closer to reality. In that context I shall try to answer Deputy Wilson's question about the examination board by saying that I would hope that we would have this board in operation for the examinations of 1975.  May I submit to anybody dealing with educational matters, if we do not reach the target, it is not to be regarded as a broken promise.  It is a target at which we shall aim and hope to achieve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I answered the Deputy's question about apprenticeship to some <Col N="1166" /> extent in my reply.  Whatever the educational merits&mdash;and I concede there is educational merit in the Deputy's point of view&mdash;I have already stated that it would be difficult to achieve in the reality of the situation. There is an implication here that what we have already done in the secondary schools is wrong but while I might be prepared to concede to the Deputy on educational grounds I want to remind him of the difficulties of achieving this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson asked about the amount of literature now being made available in the library.  A vast amount of literature is now available as a result of the EEC but the Deputy will probably agree when I say that for years here an increasing amount of literature has been coming from other European agencies.  We have strengthened our departmental staff dealing with the European scene and if I can be of any help to the Deputy in coming to any agreement about procedures as to how we might deal with this vast mountain of literature I shall certainly talk to him privately about it.</P>
    <P>I have already expressed my views about the guide for the museum. Perhaps other countries with greater resources have been able to produce the type of guide the Deputy has in mind.  In these matters I must be guided by the professional advice available to me and I have already stated what that is in my reply.  If funds were available to do this sort of thing we would all desire to do it but I do not think we have the resources for it.</P>
    <P>He asked about the adult education report.  This has already been passed by the Government for publication and will be published within a week. I shall make a copy available immediately to the Deputy for his private consideration.  He has already mentioned that incremental service abroad is being examined.  I know of his interest in this and he knows of mine and it is only a question of how soon the desirable objective can be achieved.</P>
    <P>In regard to technical colleges and the availability of schoolarships on <Col N="1167" /> merit in second year, the problem here is that we have no money to give them but I am having an examination made of the whole field of grants and I shall bear the Deputy's point of view in mind and see if something can be done in regard to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MylesStaunton" hpid="Mr. Staunton Mr. Staunton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Staunton</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke on this Estimate the other evening I referred briefly to the beef cattle incentive scheme of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and I said there were serious problems in the western parts of the country regarding the second inspection under this scheme.  In the interim quite a few people have made representations to me in regard to this problem.</P>
      <P>It appears that the second inspection, which is necessary before farmers are paid grants, is being carried out much later than is desirable from an agricultural point of view.  In west Mayo the second inspection has not yet taken place.  This means that the farmers who are involved in the scheme are penalised regardless of how they opt.  If they decide to sell at an earlier stage they will not get the grant, but if they hold their cattle until a very late inspection they are engaging in very poor agricultural practice and are also losing.  I would urge the Minister to arrange an immediate review of the scheme. There are two or three simple options.  In certain parts of the country where the problem is intense one might opt to arrange to have only one inspection or, alternatively, it might be possible to arrange that the second inspection takes place much earlier.  At any rate, it requires redress.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister referred to the small farmers' bonus scheme. I am pleased with the development of that scheme and, as someone from Mayo, I am proud I come from the county in which there has been the highest level of participation in the country.  This may tend to give the lie to some suggestions nationally that people in that part of the country are not interested in working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1170" /> There is a problem at the moment with regard to the advisory services in County Mayo.  The farmers are intensely involved in the bonus scheme but the programme is being delayed because the county committee of agriculture require additional agricultural instructors.  Planning and instruction in agricultural methods must go hand in hand and it appears somewhat illogical to allow the present situation to continue.  I would urge the Minister to arrange for sanction to the employment of the extra instructors the county committee of agriculture seek.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred briefly to problems in the poultry industry.  I might add a few comments to up-date the situation since he made his speech, because there has been tremendous concern in Northern Ireland at the most severe outbreak of fowl pest there for very many years.  This is causing great concern both in the North and in Britain.  Whether we like it or not, we know there has been a great deal of traffic, much of it illegal, between the North and the South, involving the merchandising of poultry products, including eggs, broilers and other commodities.  To date it may have been not unreasonable to turn a blind eye to certain things that were happening but at this time in the interests of the poultry industry in the Twenty-Six Counties it is absolutely critical to ensure that every step possible is taken in Border areas to stop this traffic. Not alone is it illegal but if it is allowed to continue at the present time it can be totally detrimental to the poultry industry in this country.</P>
    <P>The poultry industry has had a fairly rough time for the past few years.  Many years ago there was State support for the export of eggs to Britain but that is not the situation now.  We were engaging without subsidisation in a fairly archaic method of production which did not bear comparison with methods adopted in Britain and Europe.  The result was that the industry went into tremendous decline.  In more recent years intensive husbandry has developed but that, in itself, has had problems not entirely unconnected with the lack of adequate inspection in Border areas.</P>
    <P>There have been substantial increases <Col N="1171" /> in the prices of compound foods and this has led to increased costs that were not reflected until recently in higher prices.  This has been corrected but if fowl pest breaks out in the Twenty-Six Counties the present happier situation for the poultry industry will decline to a most unhealthy position, with the result that many interests in the industry could be forced out of business.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the problem of compound foods and he spoke about the price position, which has been appalling.  It must be said that the question of price control in compound foods is a matter that has been entirely outside our control.  It has been due to world prices, to the politics of the American and Russian situation and the failure of the Russian harvest.  For those reasons the price of compound foods has increased drastically.  However, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, in co-operation with the Department of Industry and Commerce, might do more to inform the public to a greater extent about the reasons for the substantial price increases. It seems some people are not entirely aware that the general public should get information from time to time about commodity prices, cereal prices, about the soya bean and the fishmeal position.  There is a danger in this time of fluctuation: during a period of substantial increases there can also be substantial decreases in certain commodities.  It is important that the Department monitor very carefully the prices and relate them at all times to the prices being charged for animal compound foods so that they may be satisfied margins are equitable&mdash;but no more than equitable &mdash;and that the farmer can purchase his compounds at the going price, based on the price of commodities entering the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred briefly to trees and forestry development.  There is a substantial difference in the approach to forestry development here in comparison with most countries where there has been considerable development in this area.  The essential difference <Col N="1172" /> is that investment here has been almost entirely directed by the State. While there may be grants available to farmers to develop the forests, it is a fact of life that the extent to which they have taken up this option has been minimal.  In a relative sense, there has been practically no forestry development through the private initiative of farmers.  This fact has been commented on and decried by commercial interests involved in forestry who would like to see more private development.  As a Deputy, I should like to support a move towards more private development.</P>
    <P>I think it impinges on the area of the function of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries in the sense that while the Department of Lands may be concerned with substantial forestry development programmes covering large tracts of land, one of the areas of advantage of private planting of trees is that, due to the farm structure and the small size of many farms, and the fact that there is a great deal of sub-marginal land on many of these farms, if the incentives are sufficiently good the planting of trees on such small tracts of small farms could be of benefit to the farmers concerned.  In an environmental sense this would enhance greatly the beauty of the country over a number of years.  There would appear to have been more trees in this country in past centuries than there are at the present time.  Increased planting would be desirable.</P>
    <P>I am glad to note that the EEC are bringing in a special premium over a three-year period for beef and sheep production.  I note that this will be on an acreage basis.  The horse may have bolted at this stage.  It may be too late to do anything about it.  It would seem to me that in Ireland, with a very limited acreage, we might benefit to a greater extent if payment were on a headage basis.  I should like to hear some comments about this.  I accept that there may be a <i>fait accompli</i> and that we cannot have everything our own way.</P>
    <P>I note that the EEC is considering a special system of aids for handicapped agricultural areas and the <Col N="1173" /> Minister states that this would apply, if implemented, to a substantial part of Ireland.  I should like to urge the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries to bring to the attention of the relevant authorities of the EEC certain work which has been carried out in this country with regard to the development of land resources, farming activities and the betterment of farmers in handicapped agricultural areas.  I refer specifically to the report on agriculture in the west of Ireland entitled &ldquo;A Study of Low Farm Income Problems&rdquo;, which was produced by Professor John J. Scully who was at that time western regional officer of the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  This is an immensely interesting volume which spelled out the structure of western farms in terms of population, social structure, acreage and potential.</P>
    <P>At that time it was generally accepted as a marvellous statement of the position.  Allied to that report at the time was the development of the pilot schemes.  There is an immense amount of documentation available in Professor Scully's report and in regard to the work carried out in the pilot areas which may be of interest in considering the question of special aids for such areas.  I would merely remind the Minister that Professor Scully, who was very highly thought of in western areas, is at present working in the EEC and effective liaison there would be in the interests of this country.  It may well be taking place at present.</P>
    <P>I welcome the three EEC directives in the area of farm modernisation, retirement benefits and socio-economics. I welcome particularly the fact that the directive covering farm modernisation states that priority for land which will be available from the State land bank, from the Land Commission, will be given to progressive farmers and to farmers who are prepared to plan their future under a farm modernisation scheme. This is entirely as it should be and in the interests of agricultural development and production and also in the interests of farmers who are concerned about farming and about <Col N="1174" /> developing their farms and improving their own position.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the development of the benefits in the retirement area and would like to compliment the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Lands, Deputy Fitzpatrick, on introducing retirement benefits at an even higher level than is contained in the EEC directive.  This, of course, can be the key to the development of our land resources because, as Professor Scully pointed out in his report, and as more recently farming organisations have pointed out, there is an immense amount of land which is still under-utilised.  If one looks at all the resources of the nation in regard to any area of economic activity one realises that the greatest underdeveloped resource is land.  That deserves top priority.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the scheme introduced by the then Minister for Lands about five years ago was unsuccessful. I believe the reason was that the incentives were not pitched sufficiently high or made sufficiently attractive for older farmers to consider joining the scheme.  Let it be said in fairness that the present Minister has the advantage of our involvement in the EEC to help this scheme.  This matter must be examined very closely, in a social sense, to find what the barriers are if the scheme is not working as it should.  Too much time should not be allowed to pass without a review of the effects of the retirement benefit scheme.  All the tools of public relations and effective communication with the farmers concerned should be used in order to ensure that the scheme will be successful.  I would urge the Minister to arrange for a review of the scheme after a fairly short period and for continual reviews thereafter, in order to ensure the success of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The mere introduction of a scheme is not enough.  We must judge by the results.  The results of the scheme introduced about five years ago for retirement benefits have been very poor.  We do not know whether the new scheme will be successful or not. I would urge the Minister to arrange for constant review and to avail of <Col N="1175" /> all the resources of his Department in regard to communicating to elderly farmers the advantages of the scheme to them and the immense advantage to the nation involved in the flow of land to young farmers in terms of production and exports.</P>
    <P>I welcome the socio-economic directive which I believe is of greater concern to this country than to any other country in the EEC, with the possible exception of the south of Italy, because of our farm structure and population.  The intention of the directive is to arrange for information and guidance for farmers by agricultural and other advisers so that their socio-economic situation can be improved both within agriculture and &mdash;a significent phrase&mdash;outside agriculture. I believe it to be so terribly important because of the imbalance of the population structure, the degree to which the structure is different from that of most developed countries in Europe and the fact that we know, if we are to be pragmatic in this area and if we are to learn from the history of what has happened in developed countries and our own recent history, there will be a continuation of certain trends in regard to population.  Taking the period from 1960 to approximately 1970, whereas family farm income increased from £112 million to £170 million and State expenditure increased from £26 million to about £80 million or £90 million, the total farm labour force decreased from 382,000 to 306,000.  So, the problem we are facing is that referred to by the Minister when he said that the continuing decline in labour requirements due to increased modernisation means that this increased income is being shared amongst fewer people.</P>
    <P>Today we have a very healthy agricultural industry which is bound to improve over the next few years in terms of export production.  There will be immense improvements in methods and in mechanisation.  The result of this will be that whereas many people at present engaged in farming may aspire to work in farming for the next generation or two there will be a disappointment at a human level when <Col N="1176" /> it is seen that the increased production in agriculture is not resulting in increased employment.  It will result in a decrease in employment if trends continue.  We should use international comparisons when we discuss a matter such as this; it is not enough to look at our performance over the last ten or 20 years.  When we look at the population structure we will find that agriculture and fishing have resulted in employment for 7 per cent of our people.  In western areas we find that over 40 per cent of our population is involved in agriculture and fishery employment.</P>
    <P>In all of Europe there are only two countries, Spain and Portugal, with a higher proportion of people involved in agricultural employment.  Denmark, a country with intensive agricultural industries, have only 11 per cent so employed.  That 11 per cent in Denmark is approximately the average of the developed European countries.  To compound the problem, we see violent political activity at times in farming circles in these developed countries.  We hear people saying that one of their major problems is that 11 or 12 per cent engaged in farming will decrease. This poses a major problem for them.</P>
    <P>We are beginning to understand the intense problem which this country has and will continue to have in a social sense in the area of agriculture because of the population structure.  For that reason I welcome particularly the development of this socio-economic directive.  I urge the Minister to arrange that his advisers, as they have been doing, should examine this from a human point of view and consider the needs of people. The opportunities for such people, especially small farmers with many children, should be made quite clear to them.  They should be assisted to get jobs in local factories or shops or in the cities.  This is a very important matter and it is probably more relevant to this country than to any other country in the EEC.</P>
    <P>In this regard we can welcome our involvement in the EEC.  It is obvious that there is no area of national activity which will benefit to a <Col N="1177" /> greater extent than agriculture.  Even in the area of sheep, hoggets, lambs and wool, where it was thought we would do badly, we find that the position is better than we had thought possible.  As a new Deputy I would like to compliment the Minister on his approach, on his introductory speech and on his recent personal victory in Brussels where he achieved substantial benefits for Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>I should like to continue by referring to an area in which I believe there can be dynamic growth&mdash;land resources development.  If we are successful in the retirement plan area there would be great benefits.  We should be aware that if we are talking about land resources development there are substantial tracts of land which are entirely under-utilised. I refer to tracts of marginal and sub-marginal land, such as bogland in the western areas.  I know the Minister has visited Glenamoy agricultural station and was very impressed with the work done there.  It is the Minister's intention to do something in this area.  I believe it to be of immense importance. It is an area where investment would be directly followed by an increased production leading to increased employment and increased exports. It is an area of potential dynamic growth.  This area should be of great interest to the Minister and his Department.  It is an untapped source about which we can do much.  Vast sums of money will be needed if investment is to be made on a scale which will result in such growth.  Such investment would be of immense gain to the country.  It is something that must be done particularly having regard to the social conditions in the western counties.</P>
    <P>It appears that the position on the other side of Ireland is brighter today than it was before.  There are three factors here.  One is the increased price of agricultural land.  Another is the increased prices for agricultural produce and the third and most important factor is the advance made in research and development, which has resulted in new methods of husbandry and modern machinery for developing <Col N="1178" /> land which was not thought to be of value some years ago.  I would like to advise farmers who own such land to be wary of selling it at prices which may seem attractive based on prices paid five or six years ago.  I would advise the farmers to take advice before selling unless there is real necessity to do so.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the other land which is more immediately capable of development under the land project scheme.  There has been considerable dissatisfaction about this land because with increased prices farmers are keen to use it as much as possible.  They are finding that there is a considerable portion of their land which must be drained and which would come under the ambit of the land project scheme but such land does not normally come under the aegis of the Office of Public Works. That office are largely concerned with the larger drainage schemes.  Such land also can rarely be drained under the local improvement scheme because in most counties a very small proportion of the money is used for such purposes.  The buck must stop at the land project offices.  Unless those offices start working on this problem the farmers will be held back.  I know these offices have an immense number of applications and severe problems concerning staff.  I urge the Minister to arrange, particularly in western areas, for a substantial increase in the number of officers who investigate the problems and examine applications. They should arrange the implementation of schemes more rapidly.</P>
    <P>Investment in this area is not social, it is economic and should be directly followed by benefits to the nation.  The money will not in any sense be going &ldquo;down the drain&rdquo;.  I noticed in a newspaper lately that reference was made to the possible disbandment of the county development officers.  These officers were appointed a number of years ago under a central development committee.  They were involved in 12 or 13 of the western counties and in all the areas of economic activity under such local authorities.</P>
    <P>It is the view of many of us that the development officers have been very successful.  The county development <Col N="1179" /> officers have served as most useful liaison officers between the various sections of the local authorities and the various State agencies.  This development was a decentralisation of an economic function.  A county development officer has been concerned with the counties under his care in helping agricultural interests, cooperative movements and individual farmers with projects.  He has worked closely with the county committee of agriculture and the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.  A rash decision should not be made.  The Minister and his Department should examine this question relative to the needs.  They might look favourably at what has happened to date.  That might reinforce the view which I am expressing and which has been expressed by other people.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to suggest that the whole question of agricultural development is part of an overall approach to regional development. We are hopeful that if we get substantial funds from Europe in the regional area this will also be of benefit to agriculture.  I welcome the Minister's philosophy under which it is his view that farmers should continue to have a level of income which is comparable with that in urban areas, and I have no doubt that his heart is in the right place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to wish the Minister well in his office.  I should like to draw attention to the fowl pest situation in the Six Counties and to the danger of its spreading across the Border.  I notice from today's paper that eggs have been seized by the customs.  There seems to be irresponsible people who do not realise the seriousness of such activities.  Coming from a Border area, I appreciate the task of the Minister and his officials, and also of the customs officers, the Army, the Garda and the members of the IFA in patrolling that area. and checking all Border roads.  I would ask the Minister to spare neither money nor manpower in this respect to ensure as far as possible the prevention of the <Col N="1180" /> spread of this disease to this area.  I would ask him to be ruthless in his approach to this.  Monaghan is the largest poultry-producing county in Ireland, producing 35 per cent of the total broiler production.  It is also a large producer of eggs and turkeys, and also ducks, which I think are not subject to fowl pest.  As well as being a means of livelihood for producers the poultry industry is a great source of employment, from the point of view of distribution and all the other aspects of the industry.  In this year when the farmers should after many lean years, be reaping the reward of the excellent EEC terms negotiated by the last Government, we instead find ourselves facing many hardships, especially in areas where small farmers predominate.  One ill-effect is the increase in animal feeds. This differs in severity throughout the country, according to the type of farming involved.  This increase in animal feeds has a particularly serious effect in my constituency, where there are many small farms, and where farmers cannot concentrate on tillage, dairying, beef or pigs.  They usually spread their efforts over a complete range of farm activities, so that a reverse in any line has an adverse effect on the farm income.</P>
      <P>The pig industry has always, in good times or in bad times, been a great standby for the small farmer of Monaghan.  In years gone by the pig used to be referred to as the gentleman who paid the rent, and this is a title which was not given without good reason.  Now with the need for greater production from small farms, that is still true, and the pig industry has taken the most serious blow of all arising out of increases in pig feed prices in the region of £20 a ton since April of this year.  This entails not a slow death but a sudden death for the pig industry.  The only reason the industry is surviving at the moment in my area is that it is a traditional industry of the area; people do not, as a rule, make sudden changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the last session I raised with the Minister the question of the sudden fall in pig prices.  He commented at that time that pig farmers <Col N="1181" /> had been doing well previous to the drop in prices.  With the present price for pig feeds, I do not think the Minister would attempt to sustain that claim, and I would strongly impress on him the seriousness of the situation in the pig industry, especially in my constituency.</P>
    <P>Sow numbers are down drastically. According to the most recent figures they are down at least 25 per cent.  I need not spell out to the House that the inevitable result of the drop in sow numbers is that the pig population will quickly drop to a very low level. While massive pig enterprises in pig farms would still survive probably on a lower profit margin, the small producer could not survive.  A severe contraction of the pig industry in my constituency would mean ruin for many small farmers.</P>
    <P>During the last session of the Dáil I also appealed to the Minister to ensure that action would be taken by the Pig Marketing Board to cushion severe fluctuation in pig meat prices. I say to him now again that immediate action must be taken to limit the increase in pig feed prices if the industry is to survive, at a time when there is so much talk of another substantial increase in feedingstuffs.  This also applies to dairy feeds, the price of which has risen to something like £26 a ton since April.  Such an increase is serious in any herds but more so in herds in a constituency like mine where there are low herd sizes.  In 1971 only 5 per cent of the farms in County Monaghan had 16 cows or more, whereas 55 per cent of them had five cows or fewer, and only 30 per cent of the farmers had six to ten cows.  It is substantially increased since then, but it still gives an indication of the small herds.</P>
    <P>On a small farm where every effort is made to carry as large a herd as possible, the acreage left for the production of hay or silage is dangerously low at any time.  The result is that bought-in feeds are essential to maintain herd sizes.  Such a disastrous increase as has taken place in the past six months would definitely wipe out the greater part of the increase in <Col N="1182" /> income from this source.  We should remember that in that part of the country a dairy farmer raises the calves he produces.  It is unlike other intensive dairying areas in the south where they sell off the calves.  This makes added demands on both the farm produced feeds such as hay and silage and the bought-in compounds.</P>
    <P>A matter that is disturbing to the farming community is the drop in real value of grants under the land project scheme.  The delay in attending to applications runs into five or six months and in the case of schemes in hand there are now added costs. There is a steep increase in the price of drainage pipes, either crockery or plastic and in the price of gravel.  The contractors have increased their prices considerably.  There is also an increase in the cost of reseeding the land.  The real value of the grant has dropped substantially.  In the past year the cost of reseeding reclaimed land has increased by 200 per cent and seeds are hard to obtain.  I appeal to the Minister to increase the maximum grant per acre paid under this scheme.</P>
    <P>An aspect of the situation in my area which should merit particular attention and justify special action is the effect of the northern troubles on conditions in Monaghan.  We have not had a violent spill over from the North but we did have the side effects.  Industrialists at present are not keen to come to border areas.  We have no sectarian problems in Monaghan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>We are paying a price for the troubles in the northern area and because of that we would require a vigorous and prosperous farming community to offset any losses we might have on the industrial side.  I would ask the Minister to keep that in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to the expected increased cost of fertilisers. In each of the past five or six years we had roughly a 10 per cent increase in <Col N="1183" /> fertiliser costs.  We had that increase this year.  Now according to the <i>Irish Independent</i> the farmers are facing a £12 million rise in the phosphates bill.  This is very serious at a time when farmers have discovered the benefits to be gained from the use of fertilisers.  It would be a great pity if there were any fall-off in the use of fertilisers due to a price increase.  If the increase were to be £12 million, as is stated in the newspaper, with roughly 190,000 farmers in the country it would mean an increase of something like £60 per farmer, taking small and big farmers.  In the same report it was said that the early booking of fertilisers from NET was to the extent of 40,000 tons this month as compared with 3,000 tons in the same month last year.  That would indicate that farmers who have the money or are able to secure credit facilities will be able to purchase fertilisers before this massive anticipated increase. Could the Minister in any way provide for the small farmer who may not have the cash or be able to secure credit facilities to purchase his fertilisers?</P>
    <P>The agricultural advisers are doing great work to bring new methods and new developments to the farmers. They are restricted by the number of advisers available for this work.  Perhaps the Minister, in conjunction with the committees of agriculture, could use primary schools, most of which are now well lighted and heated, for classes.  The agricultural advisers would not be available for this type of class but people who would be competent to impart knowledge to such classes could be found.  There could be instruction in such things as farm accounts which are a &ldquo;must&rdquo; for the farmer in the years ahead.  Adult education is very necessary in this respect.  Those classes would be very desirable in country areas.  The committee of agriculture in my county have fine new offices which the Minister had the privilege of opening.  They have provided a very fine lecture hall. If money were available such a lecture hall would be very useful in other areas.  This hall is in Monaghan <Col N="1184" /> which means that it is a distance of up to 30 miles from some parts of the country.  Perhaps it is only wishful thinking to envisage the provision of seven or eight centres in the county but it would be well worthwhile spending money in this way.  The advisory service of the county committees of agriculture must spread into every area in the county.  The lecture hall we have is well equipped for such purposes as domestic science classes. The county committees of agriculture are to be complimented on the breakthrough in this respect.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I reiterate my plea to the Minister to do all in his power to prevent the spread to poultry establishments in this part of the country of the fowl pest that is now being experienced in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be afforded this opportunity of contributing to this very important debate.  At the outset I congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him well in the major task confronting him.  No doubt the farming community appreciate the effort, dedication and hard work that the Minister has brought to bear on the Department since his appointment.  In this regard, too, I should like to include the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy M.P. Murphy.  He, like the Minister, has a great knowledge of agriculture and in particular he has a very good knowledge of the problems confronting the small farmers.  Therefore, the farming community in general must be happy that these two men are now in charge of the agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to discuss agriculture while remaining within the regulations of the House without infringing on other Departments.  For example, in relation to the achievement of viable units, the Department of Lands have an important role to play.  Because of the lack of progress that has been made to date regarding viable units I suggest that there be greater liaison between the Departments of Lands and Agriculture and Fisheries.  I am inundated with complaints regarding the Forestry Division <Col N="1185" /> to the effect that they are planting trees on arable land.  I am aware that I cannot deal with this matter on the present Estimate but perhaps the Minister will bring it to the attention of the Minister for Lands.  People must not be replaced by trees.</P>
    <P>Every effort should be made towards helping the small farmer to become more independent and the only way in which this can be done is by helping him to increase his holding. I am not opposed to unemployment assistance being given to small farmers in the west but it would be much better policy to help them become more independent.  Of course this is a problem which is very great in the constituency I represent and will take some time to solve.</P>
    <P>I hope to deal briefly with what is a major part not only of the Minister's work but of the industry as a whole, that is, the dairying industry and the reorganisation of creameries. The Minister has made considerable progress in this regard.  As in the case of the small uneconomic holdings, the day has come when there is no place for the small uneconomic creamery. Because of cost and other factors rationalisation and reorganisation of the creamery industry is essential. During the past eight months the Minister has made more progress in this direction than was made in the 16 years before he took office.  It was never intended that the Dairy Disposal Board should be a permanent structure and, if I understand the Act correctly, it was for the purpose of setting up a board which would provide a creamery service until such time as the farming community formed co-operatives and took over the creameries.  This move should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to reflect in any way on the Dairy Disposal Board.  They have provided a creamery service in areas where co-operatives did not exist, but the time has come when creameries suppliers should be encouraged to buy the creameries and, so, to be masters of their own trade. This is very essential.  The Minister can rest assured that he will have the full co-operation of the farming community. <Col N="1186" /> It is a difficult task to form co-operatives of small farmers in certain areas of small producers, but great progress has been made in this direction.</P>
    <P>Progress has been made also in the dairying industry but there is still room for improvement.  One of the greatest problems facing the dairy farmers at the moment is the lack of capital.  Farmyards have been modernised. Where once the farmers used horses and carts to deliver milk to the creameries they now have bulk tank collection.  The Minister should provide incentives to farmers who have not got bulk tank collection to change over to this system and save labour costs.  A lot of the farmer's time is spent delivering milk to the creameries, at least three hours a day.  In my constituency some farmers have installed the bulk tank system.  This means that not only do they not have to go to the creamery but they have a collection every second day.  A number of people are aggrieved because the milk cannot be collected by the articulated trucks.  Our roads are not up to the standard required for these trucks to travel on.  This subject must be tackled at another level and I will discuss it further on another Estimate.</P>
    <P>More credit will have to be made available to the dairy farmers if we wish to compete with our counterparts in Europe and modernise our production.  A number of farmers are conscious of the necessity of providing milking parlours and, as I have already said, bulk tank collection. These cost money.  A farmer starting off today, or a son who is taking over the farm, will find it impossible to get credit to help him carry on until he gets into full production.  The day of the horse and cart is gone.  Nobody is more conscious of this than the farmer.  When going through my county I was very encouraged when I noticed the improvements to farmyards, herds and the increased production over the past number of years. I hope this progress will continue and that the Minister will not be found wanting in making credit available to farmers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1187" /> The beef cattle incentive scheme is very good.  The Minister should consider the possibility of increasing incentives to beef cattle producers. There is a big difficulty here.  People involved in this scheme are not in a position having reared their calves and particularly this year when the price of weanlings was not so good, to carry them over the winter.  The bigger farmer, or cattle dealer, can buy these weanlings, feed them, carry them over the winter, sell them and make the profit which, by right, belongs to the small farmer.  Credit is one of the major factors involved here.  These farmers need credit to carry them over the winter, to feed their stock until the spring or summer when the price of cattle increases.  I know farmers who had to dispose of their weanlings because feeding was not plentiful, the quality was not good, and, because of their financial circumstances they were not able to carry their stocks over the winter period.  These problems may not appear very great to some people but extensive credit could encourage these farmers to increase their productivity. Small farmers involved in this scheme would find it uneconomic to go into dairying, because of the expense involved, and supply milk to the creameries.</P>
    <P>The advisory services and the Agricultural Institute provide a great service to the farming community.  The Minister should examine the possibility of having more open days in places like Moore Park, Fermoy, where the farming community can see the experiments being carried out there.  There is a lot to be learned from a visit there.  The day has gone when people felt that any type of person could run a farming business. There is a general awareness today that it takes expertise and experience. I should like to pay tribute to the staff in Moore Park.  On open days they explain new schemes and go into detailed discussion with the farming community about breeding and rearing of cattle and pigs.  There is a growing awareness of the service they provide.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1188" /> I should like to refer to the agricultural advisory service and agricultural instructors.  At one time it was accepted generally that when passing through the countryside one could detect where the farmer had had consultations with the agricultural instructor. They have quite a lot of knowledge to give to the farmers.</P>
    <P>Where an agricultural instructor is based in a temporary capacity naturally he will not have the same interest in the farming community which he would have if he were based there in a permanent capacity.  A temporary instructor is at a disadvantage. Members of the Cork County Committee of Agriculture of which I have the honour to be chairman were unanimous about that.  The Minister should examine this.  He must realise that this is a fact.  The advisory service are also interested in this aspect.</P>
    <P>Over the past few years there has been a very lackadaisical approach to the warble fly dressing scheme.  An abortive effort was made some years ago to eradicate warble fly but it was absolutely unsuccessful.  This nettle will have to be grasped firmly.  The Minister should insist that every herd should be dressed and every animal in every herd should be dressed.  A survey carried out this year proved that 2.6 per cent of our cattle had warbles.  That figure is too high because that 2.6 per cent could infect very many other cattle and retard the conditioning of our cattle.  There is no point in one farmer dressing his cattle if another farmer is evading the issue.  In 1971, 22.6 per cent of our cattle had warbles.  We have progressed from 26.6 per cent to 2.6 per cent this year but we must insist that every animal in every herd is dressed. This is very important if we are to eradicate warble fly.  This would benefit the farming community and we would have better quality beef.</P>
    <P>I visited a pilot area recently and I had a meeting with members of the county committee of agriculture in that area.  I was told that instructors knew widows in the area who were in receipt of widows' non-contributory pensions.  If they improved their <Col N="1189" /> farms, or if they got an extra cow or an extra sow and if their income went up, the social welfare officer came to investigate them and they were deprived of their widows' pensions.  The Minister, his officials, the advisory service and everybody involved in the industry should aim at having every available acre of land brought into full production.  People who improve their farms should not be penalised. I said at the outset that it is difficult to discuss agriculture without infringing the rules of the House.</P>
    <P>This anomaly was brought home to me in the pilot area.  The Minister should take note of it.  One instructor in that pilot area told me there were no fewer than five such people in his area who were being penalised because they improved their holdings and increased their incomes.  This should not happen.  Instead, they should be compensated. The emphasis should be on increased production and bringing every available acre into full production.</P>
    <P>I want to deal very briefly with the contribution made by the Fianna Fáil spokesman on agriculture and his attack on the Minister which was most unwarranted coming from somebody like Deputy G. Collins.  As reported at column 1461 of the Official Report of Wednesday, 7th November, 1973, Deputy Collins said:</P>
    <P>I see from newspaper reports that the Minister is kept fairly busy attending the many functions to which he is invited.  On a more personal note, if I were prone to give advice at this stage it would be to the effect that attending too many late night functions could eventually mean that the Minister might not be in the best condition to attend to his office duties the morning after.  Neither might he be in the best condition to make a case for us at the European bargaining table of agricultural Ministers and we all, of course, realise and appreciate that it is of vital importance that this should not happen...</P>

      <P>This was a cheap attack <Col N="1190" /> on the Minister by Deputy Collins because the inference is that the Minister is not doing his job.  The farming organisations in Deputy Collins's own county publicly congratulated the Minister on the job he was doing in their interests.  In Cork a branch of a farming organisation publicly congratulated the Minister on the work he was doing.  This attack came from a Deputy whose party, to their discredit, jailed Irish farmers and used the army&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that I think Deputy Collins had a great cheek to attack the Minister.  It has been proved, and it is, I think, recognised by all, that the Minister both here, in Europe and everywhere else has worked extremely hard on behalf of Irish producers.  Recently he achieved something no other Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries has ever achieved, namely, guaranteed minimum prices for sheep and potatoes. He has succeeded in bringing about a lowering of the levy on beef to the USA, a reduction from £80 to £60, a marvellous achievement.  Nobody in Opposition should infer or imply that the Minister carouses by night and does not look after the interests of Irish farmers.  That is, of course, just a cheap jibe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, he got sow units of 25 to 100 included in the one-third grant scheme which applied hitherto to fattening units only.  Are these the things <Col N="1191" /> Deputy Collins has in mind?  The Minister is to be complimented on his achievements at home and abroad and nobody appreciates that better than the farming community.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also to be congratulated where rationalisation of the creamery is concerned.  I am sorry Deputy Fitzgerald and Deputy Meaney are not here because for five years in mid-Cork the farming community failed to have a deputation received by the former Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  They were aggrieved and their grievance was justifiable.  At one meeting a letter from the Minister's predecessor was read out stating that under no circumstances would he receive a deputation.  Deputy Fitzgerald and Deputy Meaney did not show up at that meeting.  The present Minister has received a deputation and in one week after receiving that deputation the farmers' problem was resolved.  The Minister realised there was a problem.  That is the kind of Minister we want.  That is the kind of Minister the farming community want.  That is why I resent the attack made by Deputy Collins.  Deputy Fitzgerald and Deputy Meaney realised full well that the people had a grievance but their Minister would not listen to them.  Great progress has been made in the rationalisation of the creamery industry and great credit is due to the Minister for that and for the progress that has been made.</P>
    <P>There is a problem in relation to cattle disease.  Progress in the eradication of disease has been lamentably slow.  Immunisation is of vital importance. I know the Minister is examining the whole question of TB eradication. This scheme has already cost the taxpayer millions of pounds, a great part of which was money poured down the drain because we did not get the results we should have got for the expenditure involved.  In my own area we still have reactors and cattle which have to be slaughtered because of this disease.  I do not know what is wrong but there will have to be a thorough investigation to find out what is wrong.</P>
    <P>Brucellosis is a big problem and its eradication will be a major task.  This <Col N="1192" /> is a task we shall have to tackle by encouraging the farming community to participate in the scheme.  The cost of replacements will be enormous and this is something which will have to be borne in mind when encouraging the farming community to participate in this voluntary scheme of brucellosis eradication.</P>
    <P>When a reactor is detected the animal is branded and the farmer has four years in which to get rid of the animal. He cannot offer it for sale in the open market.  I believe this is tending to spread the disease because infected animals are being offered freely for sale in various places and no precautions at all are taken to stop the spread of infection.  There is no question of the isolation of infected animals.  Disease is becoming quite rampant and that is proved by the increase in the number of cases of undulant fever in humans as a result of consuming the milk of brucellosis infected animals.  The movement of such animals should be controlled.</P>
    <P>There is a serious health hazard in connection with the collection of dead animals.  I am not concerned with the depots because they are very well controlled and run.  These animals do not come within the provisions of the Slaughter of Animals Act and they cannot, therefort, be dealt with by the local authority except when they constitute a nuisance under the Public Health Act of 1878.  These animals may have died from infectious diseases and infection can spread from the lorries which collect the animals because any effluent spills out on the roads and infects streams.  This helps to spread disease.</P>
    <P>I wonder are we equally as lax in relation to the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme?  I would emphasise to the Minister as strongly as I possibly can that these are matters that must be tackled without delay.  I have found that where animals are left lying around such depots for days the disease is spread by dogs and cats removing pieces of the carcases into neighbouring farms.  There is nobody in the vicinity of such depots to point out that the animal died from an infectious disease.</P>
    <P>There is no law, with the exception <Col N="1193" /> of the Dogs Act of 1906, under which it is compulsory to bury an animal, to stop the spread of this disease.  The Minister should examine this matter because if something is not done soon the cost of eradicating brucellosis will be equally as high as the cost of eradicating TB.  I brought this matter to the notice of the previous Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  I was informed then that there was no danger in this regard and this was not a problem.  People at such depots have made lucrative profits out of disposing of the carcase and selling it around the country as dog meat.</P>
    <P>Surely if we are sincere or serious about eradicating disease this is something we should not allow to happen. The former Minister, in reply to the debate last year, told me that this was not a danger because the meat was boiled to such an extent that it would not spread the disease.  This is not true.  In asking the present Minister to examine this matter I should like to warn that if something is not done about this the brucellosis scheme will be a complete failure.  It is a major problem and it is something that must be tackled.</P>
    <P>There are people, particularly dairy farmers, who are trying desperately to build up a brucellosis-free herd.  They have difficulty in doing this because they are not getting the co-operation of the farming community generally. I believe the Minister is aware of this. To encourage those people to build up a brucellosis free herd, and to try in some more effective way to eradicate brucellosis in our cattle, we must adopt a more stringent attitude to these matters.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the pig industry I should like to emphasise the importance of this industry, and the poultry industry, to the small farmer.  In this House and outside it a lot of lip service has been paid to the problems of the small farmer by politicians and others but very little has been achieved.  The poultry industry has been completely taken out of the hands of the small producer and the pig industry is going in the same direction.  This is a very dangerous trend.  We now have a situation where we have huge pig fattening units of <Col N="1194" /> between 3,000 and 10,000 animals.  I expressed the view to the former Minister, Deputy J. Gibbons, that there was a danger that these units could become self-sufficient.  I pointed out to him that we would find that those who are buying the store pigs from the small farmer would establish their own sow units and produce their own bonhams.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed me that because of the health hazard this could not materialise and we would not see the day when we would have large sow units.  The former Minister may have been sincere in saying this and may have been acting on the advice of his officials, but there are a number of those units in the southern part of this country that have become self-sufficient and are providing their own sow units.  There is no danger of any health hazard or any health risk. That is detrimental to the small farmer and to the small producer.  If we confined the poultry and pig industry to the small farmer we would not have any problem in relation to them.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are difficulties involved.  It is not possible to stop private enterprise and we cannot tell anybody, farmers or any others, that they cannot build a piggery.  However, the Minister, and the Government, can tell such people that they will not be grant-aided over and above a certain amount.  Thousands of pounds are making their way to people who have no interest in or connection with farming and for that reason the matter should be examined.  It is not possible to stop a doctor, a veterinary surgeon or a business man building pig units but it is wrong that the taxpayer should be asked to grant-aid him.  If this is allowed to continue it will spell doom for the small farming community.</P>
    <P>I should like to ascertain the amount paid in grants to those people because the Exchequer is paying such people to take the livelihood from the small farming community.  Quite a lot of money provided in the Agricultural Estimate is finding its way to such commercial enterprises with the result that the small farmer receives little. <Col N="1195" /> These farmers who must provide the necessaries of life for their families are not in a financial position to embark upon such big projects.</P>
    <P>The scheme of grants should be examined with a view to introducing a two-tier system.  The small farmer cannot afford to buy artificial manure and he cannot avail of the subsidies because he does not have the money but the big rancher can buy the artificial manure and avail of Government subsidies.  Because of the economic circumstances of the small farmer he is not getting his fair share of the subsidies.  In the past, faceless men who have managed to buy big ranches in this country have flooded the Department with applications for various grants.  The result is that most of the money allocated for such grants has gone to these people.  The small farmer should be in a position to benefit to a greater extent but all the existing schemes are designed purposely to help the big farmers and the big ranchers.  This should be examined in detail.</P>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that the Minister and his Parliamentary Secretary&mdash; and I am expressing the views of the vast majority of the farming community&mdash;are doing a good job and that there is a major job before them.  I wish them both well and I sincerely hope that we shall have a Minister like Deputy Clinton and a Parliamentary Secretary like Deputy Murphy for many a long day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not profess to know a great deal about agriculture and what I have to say will relate to matters as I see them in my constituency and in the area where I live. Taking things generally, we have a situation in which agriculture was beginning to come into its own for the first time in years.  Nobody will deny that this came about as a result of the previous Government conducting its business well while in office.  Our entry into the EEC, which I admit had the full support of the main Government party, promised big things for our farmers. Our entry was piloted by the Minister and the Government of the day and through their negotiations and <Col N="1196" /> good management a situation was reached in which our farmers enjoyed an income of which they had never even dreamt.  This is evident in every part of the country.  Even in the more backward areas people are now more interested in land.  Small farmers who had to emigrate, finding it impossible to make a living at home, now have more confidence in the country and are inclined to come back, work the land and try to make a living at home.  In the west it had not been easy because about 55 per cent of the farms are under 30 acres.  In a lecture a few years ago Dr. Scully estimated that 640,000 acres of land were occupied by elderly people.  This made the situation even worse because it meant that a basic resource was not being fully utilised or developed.</P>
      <P>Along with entering the EEC and increased prices for cattle, various grants were made available to farmers to help them to reclaim their land and make it more productive.  We had grants for lime and manures which were of great importance in helping to get a better return from the land.  We also had subsidies, the beef subsidy and the subsidy for mountain lamb. At the moment, however, the promising build-up we had is not quite as good as it was.</P>
      <P>Many farmers in the west who had adopted the system of single suckling calves when they let the calves run with the cows on open range on mountains very often were doing reasonably well but they are not too happy with the present situation because there is a tremendous drop in the price of weanlings.  Many farmers have told me that if they had sold their dropped calves last March or April they would have got a price then which would be equivalent to what they could now get for weanlings. We are told this situation may improve in the spring but farmers in the west do not have any facilities&mdash; no lowland to use, no shelter; they have no farm buildings to hold the stock&mdash;and with the present cost of feedingstuffs it would not be economic for them even to attempt to hold the stock.  Their only option is to sell at a low price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1197" /> We all understand the problems the Minister has in dealing with increased prices of foodstuffs but I personally think the millers got away with murder in many cases.  There was a time earlier this year when soya beans were at a premium but I understand the price has dropped considerably now and also that the price of barley has been reduced.  But, unfortunately for those who have to buy feedingstuffs, they find no reduction in price.  Even quite recently the millers were given permission to increase their prices by a further 10 per cent.  It is very hard to understand how a situation like this can arise and be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>In regard to farm development in Mayo, something which bears out a point I made earlier, we had 3,750 applicants for the small farms incentive bonus scheme which is doing a great job in helping farmers to develop the land they are farming. The scheme cannot be successful, of course, without a proper advisory service and one of the problems we have to face in Mayo from time to time is that we never seem to have a full team in our advisory service. The county committee of agriculture have to appoint temporary instructors to make up for the numbers leaving.  The scheme itself has encouraged farmers to do something positive about making their land productive and has helped them to realise the value of the advisory service. No words of mine could do justice to the wonderful work that has been done by the advisory service in Mayo.  We have been very fortunate in having people of a high standard of ability who work very closely with the farming community.  They do not finish work at 5.30 p.m.; in fact, they work long hours and their homes are open to farmers who may wish to see them.  They are doing a wonderful job that is only now beginning to be appreciated by the farming community.</P>
    <P>It has been hinted that the present system operating with regard to the advisory service may be changed, to be replaced by a system operating on a regional basis or else directly under the control of the Department.  I <Col N="1198" /> think this would be undesirable because it would lead to centralisation. At the moment the service is a local matter and the local adviser is not regarded as a civil servant, as someone from Dublin who comes to look around the farmyard and then departs.  It is a personal service and it would be a shame if any moves were made to change it.</P>
    <P>The experiments that have been carried out by An Foras Talúntais have been of help to the backward areas.  In Mayo there is the station at Glenamoy and I must compliment the people in charge for the work they are doing.  Many experiments have been carried out to see how bogland might be made productive, how stock could be reared on it and crops planted there.  Minfhéir Teoranta in the Geesala area have been very successful and in the Creagh institute in Ballinrobe tremendous work has been done with regard to sheep breeding&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody should tell the Minister for the Gaeltacht about it because he did not know it yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope greater use will be made of the information gained from the experiments by An Foras Talúntais in order to make the land more productive.  Recently I asked the Minister about the possibility of providing a laboratory service at Creagh.  The Minister stated it was not feasible at the moment because there was one at Sligo and another at Longford or Athlone but they are 70 or 80 miles from Creagh. The county committee of agriculture have been asking for this service at Creagh and I would ask the Minister to consider the matter.</P>
      <P>Good work is being done in the pilot areas but I am not sure that the information gained from the experiments is being utilised to the full.  The pilot areas might be extended and a more intensive advisory service made available so that greater benefits might be obtained for the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The beef incentive scheme and the scheme for fattening lambs have brought wealth to some farmers. However, there is one problem about <Col N="1199" /> the beef scheme, namely, that the Department insist on two examinations, the second one being carried out as late as December.  This creates a major problem for farmers who must keep the calves until that time. The Minister might consider this matter to see if the last inspection could be carried out in August, or at the very latest in the first week of September.  Hill farmers have no facilities for keeping the weanlings and by the time the second inspection is completed they suffer a loss.  If they were in a position to sell in September, the calves would be in better condition and would be a more saleable proposition.  Farmers in western areas would welcome some positive action in this matter.</P>
    <P>Deputy Staunton referred to land drainage.  The major drainage schemes, such as the Moy, the Corrib, the Mask, and so on, have been beneficial and have made land available for farming but there are small schemes for which grants cannot be made available.  In Mayo the only grants available are local improvements grants.  Over a number of years we have been allocating 25 per cent of the local improvements grants for drainage.  This year our total local improvements grant is in the region of £65,000.  When cost of administration is deducted the amount left for drainage work is very small, sufficient perhaps to make a few drains but the drainage of a small river or a scheme involving a large catchment area would be out of the question.  The Minister might consider this matter and see if moneys could be made available for the solution of this very serious problem of drainage.</P>
    <P>There are many instances where farmers who carry out land reclamation work find that they will not get the grant under the land reclamation scheme on completion of the work because of the fact that there is no outlet for the drainage that is carried out on the farm.  I can give the information to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy has such information I should like to have it.  It does not seem to make sense that <Col N="1200" /> a scheme is passed and then the farmer is told he cannot be paid because there is not an outlet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I can state definitely that cases of this kind have been brought to my notice where a grant was not allowed because there was a main drain or something running close to the land and it was not their responsibility, if you like, or could not be properly cleaned or that the water could not be taken off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>This is quite frequent and widespread.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the advancements that have been made in agriculture during the last few years it is only fair that we should compliment the Agricultural Credit Corporation on the work they have been doing.  Unfortunately, there are many small farmers who are reluctant to seek credit or to accept credit. Where people who had foresight and the proper business approach to farming have taken advantage of the facilities provided by the Agricultural Credit Corporation the results are there to be seen.  From my small experience of the officers involved I find them most helpful to farmers. They are certainly doing a very worthwhile job.</P>
      <P>A problem arises in regard to the grants for farm buildings.  The Minister would need to consider the grants now being made available.  They should be improved substantially in order to help the farming community and to encourage them to modernise to a greater extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this respect there seems to be no liaison between the Department of Local Government, the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries and the various other Departments in regard to the way the grants are provided. The improvement of a farmhouse, the laying on of water, and so on, can be regarded as a social matter.  It is also a matter of vital importance to the economy.  There are many rural areas where farmers could be much more efficient if they had a proper water supply.  This is a very important <Col N="1201" /> matter, particularly in the case of dairy farms.</P>
    <P>In this connection a comprehensive plan is urgently required.  There should be a regional development plan covering every aspect of community life and aimed at the integration of agriculture, industry and services, whereby improved facilities could be made available.  I wonder if we are taking full advantage of our membership of the EEC and if we are getting the benefits which we understand are obtainable for this type of work.</P>
    <P>The Minister has possibly the most important Ministry to deal with.  He needs the assistance of all sides of the House in doing his job.  If we have not a good agricultural industry, the economy will flop.  Therefore I wish the Minister well in his work.  We hope that the good work which has been commenced will be continued, in the interests of the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>I was delighted that the last speaker finished on the note on which he did, offering the Minister the co-operation of all sides of the House because, as he said, agriculture is still the mainstay of our economy. I should like to join with those who have already spoken and congratulated and complimented the Minister on the amount of work he has achieved in the short time in which he has been in this important position.  We all know that the Minister is a man of tremendous energy, ability and stamina.  It is interesting to note the close attention he is paying to the voluntary organisations, the number of deputations he receives and the amount of time he gives to voluntary organisations to hear their views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister makes time to visit agricultural shows and to travel around the country to see every aspect of agricultural life so that he, in his capacity as Minister, may benefit from the experience of those directly involved.  All voluntary organisations, whether agricultural or otherwise, have one end in view and that is the betterment of the people for whom they are working.  They have a tremendous amount to offer from their experience in various <Col N="1202" /> fields.  The Minister is to be complimented on the attention he is paying to those organisations, listening to them and hearing their views.</P>
    <P>But most important of all is the amount of time&mdash;and it is time-consuming going backwards and forwards to Europe&mdash;which the Minister has spent in the corridors of power, whether in Brussels or any other capital in Europe, since we became full members of the EEC.  If those countries did not realise before there was such a place as Ireland they know it now.  Not only do they know that we exist but they feel we are a force to be reckoned with, certainly in the person of our Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, who has achieved so much in that regard in a very short time.</P>
    <P>In that context of service I am quite sure that the main preoccupation of the Minister is the betterment of the farming community.  The betterment of the farming community leads to the expansion of industry and consequently the betterment of the nation as a whole.  With increases in production must come the necessity for good marketing organisations.  It is very little use having increased production if we do not have the outlets for it.  For all too long in past generations, we were tied to just one market.  Admittedly, we were very glad to have that market but even the British farmers themselves had little, if any, option but to produce cheap food for the industrial workers. Our farmers produced cheap food and very often found, having produced a crop, that there was no outlet for it.</P>
    <P>I can recall the time when crops were not even removed from the ground but were ploughed back and sown again in the hope that the market might be better in the following year.  This left the farming community with absolutely no hope whatever of getting together the necessary capital which would enable them to improve their system of agriculture and their premises.</P>
    <P>What applied to the crops applied equally, if not more so, to the cattle production.  Older Members will recall <Col N="1203" /> that before selling cattle one watched the papers and listened to the radio to hear whether a shipment of beef was arriving in England from the Argentine. If the beef floated into Britain from the Argentine the prices dropped.  I am ashamed to say that if we heard of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the Argentine we almost received that news with glee.  For all too long the economics of Agriculture were the economics of a madhouse.</P>
    <P>In a madhouse, as it was known, in those bad days before psychiatry was recognised for what it is and before it was recognised that most of those people in that establishment could be cured, the practice was that if the patients became disturbed they were given an injection to quieten them down.  That kept them quiet for a while until they became disturbed again when they got another injection.  So it was with the farmers.  If the farmers became disturbed with their lot they got a financial injection here and there and later on when they raised their heads again they got another injection. So it went on.  Now, thank God, the scene which is unfolding is vastly different. As we enter the EEC a vast market is waiting for us.  I am certain, with the diligent attention which our Minister will give to his job, our country will get a fair share of this market. As the Minister's predecessor remarked when speaking on the Estimate, there will be a lot of hard bargaining to be done.  There will be almost endless discussion, with a compromise here and there to be met.  A tremendous amount of energy will be required travelling to and from Europe.</P>
    <P>The Minister needs not only our good wishes but also our congratulations on the start he has made and the efforts which I know he will continue to put into this great work and which will be seen to be of great advantage to the nation in the years that lie ahead.  Having said that, I should like to thank the Minister for supplying us with details, as in former years, of the activities of his Department for the past year.  They contain a wealth of information which, I am sure, has been a great benefit to all Deputies.  I should like to comment on a few of them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1204" /> It was interesting to note, from listening to other speakers, that everybody referred to the problem of land drainage.  Until I looked at the figures the Minister supplied to us I had begun to wonder whether, as far as my county was concerned, the scheme had been wound up.  It is fascinating to note that, during the year ended 31st March last, an area of 87,332 acres were reclaimed or improved by farmers with the aid of grants amounting to £2,580,128.  That is a tremendous achievement.  If one looks further one will see that the trend of the improvement in the farmers' lot is reflected in the increase in the number of applicants for grants under the scheme.  In my county one would need a four-leaf shamrock in each hand when going to the land project office to get a scheme heard with any hope of having it done in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>I wonder at the figures supplied by the Minister but I have no doubt that that amount of land has been reclaimed and I hope that it will continue at the same rate or, if possible, be increased in the years which lie ahead.  The amount of land reclaimed since the inception of the scheme amounts to almost three million acres. I thank the Minister, his predecessors, and above all Mr. James Dillon, who started this scheme.  The Minister should get every acre possible into production.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies referred to the problem of outfall hindrance to various schemes.  One which arises in my constituency concerns a State-sponsored body, Córas Iompair Éireann.  There is a drain running along the river embankment.  CIE are supposed to maintain it.  I think they do a little on it now and again, but they will not allow it to be lowered.  Unless it is lowered the work which the farmers higher up want to have carried out, and are trying to carry out, is in vain and money is wasted.  The Minister should have a word with his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, to see if something could be done in this regard.  The solution, of course, would be a viaduct under the railway but the engineers adamantly refuse to <Col N="1205" /> permit this.  Consequently it is a hindrance to a great many farmers who are endeavouring to have reclamation work carried out.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is very much aware of the necessity of having all possible available land brought into production.  When he addressed the newly-appointed council of An Foras Talúntais on Thursday, 6th September he stated that our primary strength lies, of course, in the continuing development of agriculture on our good soils where the problems of intensification are relatively simple. He understood that only about one-third of our total national acreage consists of these soils and that, on the other hand, we have major areas of land now in very poor condition the result of many years of natural decay.  Only one-third of our national acreage consists of the type of soil suitable for major development and intensive farming.  This stresses in no uncertain way the points made by other speakers and I should like to reiterate the necessity for bringing every acre of land, where it is possible to do so, into production at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>From the figures supplied by the Minister on sheep population I am pleased to see a small increase in the numbers.  I should like to see a sales incentive scheme mounted in Europe for mutton and lamb.  Last year we saw pictures of some of our sales promoters, and the Minister, I think, enjoying a steak at a food fair.  I should like to think that at future events a lamb chop would be presented as well.  The people in a great many areas on the Continent are not familiar with the taste of lamb and mutton.  They do not keep sheep. Because of the hazards of their climate sheep would have to be housed all the year round.  Consequently it is only by promoting the taste that we can achieve a greater slice of the market for both mutton and lamb.</P>
    <P>One thing which puzzles me in this section dealing with sheep, and it also comes under the heading of veterinary research, is the dipping of sheep.  We were told some years back that by <Col N="1206" /> introducing sheep dipping twice a year that we would eradicate sheep scab, yet the scheme goes on and has to go on because pockets of sheep scab still arise every year.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>

      <P>Electricity is being installed in the Gaeltacht islands with the assistance of a grant from Roinn na Gaeltachta.  There are grants available from my Department for the installation of gas but this does not seem to be practicable.  It would be extremely costly to provide generators for these islands.  I appreciate the Deputy's concern.  Naturally there is a certain amount of indignation because the Gaeltacht islands down the coast can have electricity installed and these islands, just 50 or 60 miles <Col N="1207" /> north of them, cannot.  The cost of installing electricity would be prohibitive for the number of people living there.  The bottled gas grant is available, but I am afraid it looks, from my preliminary soundings into the cost of special generators as if that also will be prohibitive.  One generator is not enough, there must be a stand-by generator as well.  This makes the cost extremely dear at present.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Questions Nos. 26, 27, 28 and 29 on 5th December, 1973, on the current oil supply situation.  It would not be practicable to provide special petrol supplies for Christmas visitors.  Any such persons intending to bring their cars home for the holiday should endeavour to make prior arrangements with their relatives and friends to ensure some supplies.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that some 3,000 people have booked to take cars to Ireland during the Christmas period?  Apart from the importance of this to the economy would the Minister not consider it advisable to give some guarantee to those people in relation to petrol supplies?</P>

      <P>The Deputy may be aware that on a prior occasion in 1972 a request was made by the firm in question to the National Prices Commission for permission either to discontinue the door-to-door service or to impose a charge for it.  On examination of the cost factor their application was disallowed at that time.  I recognise that the service is a useful one but that it costs some money.  However, this firm and others in retailing are able, to some extent, to subsidise, this service from the profits accruing from retail sales over the counter.</P>

    <P>I know that the NPC are monitoring the whole situation in Dublin of the retail distribution firms.  If there is evidence that firms engaged in the door-to-door milk delivery service are at a serious financial loss because of <Col N="1215" /> this activity.

      <P>While receiving retirement pension, claimant applied for old age contributory pension.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree entirely with the Deputy that the <i>Asgard</i> committee, as it is commonly known, has done extremely good work and trained an enormous number of young people.  In fact, I sailed in the <i>Asgard</i> across the Irish Sea and up to Caemes Bay and back. Next week I will be meeting an enlarged <i>Asgard</i> committee&mdash;I presume this will mean the end of the <i>Asgard</i> committee as such&mdash;and it will include all the members of the old committee; they have been asked by me to continue.  From there on we go to the building of a new training vessel and it will then be a question for decision when the success and the demand of sail training where the new vessel is concerned has been assessed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The desire would be that the new vessel would be built in Ireland.  The question of design is something one has to balance as between the best vessel and whether or not the best is Irish.  The committee I will be meeting next week will be advising on this and I think, therefore, it would be inappropriate for me to make any statement over and above what I have already said.</P>

The design to which I referred will be among the designs this committee will consider.  The ship referred to by the Deputy did not sail across the world.  It was <i>Gipsy Moth III</i> and it went across in the transatlantic race with Sir Francis Chichester and, as far as I know, he won it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (Mr. Clinton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The farm buildings scheme grants for pig breeding and farrowing accommodation which I introduced earlier this year are at the rate of 33? per cent of the approved capital cost in respect of construction and equipment for not less than 20 and not more than 100 sows.  I made this change in order to encourage farmers to build up economic-sized units.</P>
      <P>Any farmer who wishes to build a smaller unit can qualify for grants under the scheme at the rate of 40p per square foot, and can extend on that basis in stages to a 20-sow unit. When the final stage is completed, the balance between the grants for smaller units and the grant of 33? per cent will then be payable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it would be better to have the 33? per cent grant for all units to enable small farmers to engage in this type of enterprise? It is a very big decision for farmers with two and three sows to take.  They cannot avail of these grants unless they go for the 20-sow unit.  Would the Minister not agree that a 12-sow unit as requested is not unreasonable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Deputy, I was concerned about the 20-sow unit at the beginning and I looked very hard at it.  The farming organisations were anxious to get this size because the feeling was that there was an inclination on the part of producers who are only in it in a small way to get in and get out with every cold breeze that comes.  The fact that we have now decided to give them the 33? per cent when they reach 20 in retrospect covers the complaint and it retains the inducement to grow up to a size of 20 sows.</P>

      <P>Many of the farmers in the north-west could never reach 20 sows.  In the north-west, where there are smaller farms than in the rest of the country, this should be acceded to.  The biggest co-operative society in the north-west have requested this change and for that reason the Minister should consider the matter seriously.</P>

      <P>Postmen at Sligo are taking unofficial industrial action at present by way of a ban on Saturday working and overtime.  The action is stated to be in support of the cessation of postal deliveries in Sligo on Saturdays with a view to enabling delivery postmen to be given a Monday to Friday five-day week. Apart altogether from the reduction in service that would be involved, this claim is in conflict with an agreement between my Department and the Post Office Workers' Union, which represents postmen, on a five-day week for postmen outside Dublin and Dún Laoghaire.  The agreement provides for the introduction of a five-day week on a staggered basis and for maintaining Monday to Saturday delivery services.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>I was dealing with the Minister's statements regarding the activities of his Department in connection with sheep, mutton, lamb and wool.  I pointed out that the incidence of sheep scab is still high.  In the section dealing with animal health and veterinary research, it is stated that there were 76 outbreaks of sheep scab in 1972-73, as compared with 35 in 1971-72 and 81 in 1970-71.  While they are an improvement on 1970-71, the figures for 1972-73 are double those of the previous year.  This will be a source of great disappointment to the many sheep farmers who conscientiously comply with the provision to have their sheep dipped twice yearly.  When the disease is discovered it may not be the fault of the farmer on whose land the animals are kept and I wonder if there are any means by which the previous owner could be traced.  We have spent much time and money in combating this disease and I wonder how much longer it will take to eradicate it because we are led to believe it can be eradicated if all the farmers co-operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When speaking about sheep in Kildare one immediately thinks of the Curragh, a vast expanse of land nearly all in grass, producing as little as one could imagine under an Irish <Col N="1247" /> sky.  The Minister might investigate this part of the country to see what could be done to increase production by way of land reclamation.  While the Curragh is under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Defence, it is important to the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries that every available acre be brought into production and this can be done in a number of ways on the Curragh.</P>
    <P>Apart from the necessity for preserving the area the military require for their exercises, the important bloodstock industry is involved also.  However, there is quite an amount of land that has nothing but furze and it has never been treated with fertiliser.  The reason usually given for not utilising this area is that if the number of sheep on the Curragh are increased there will be a correspondingly higher traffic hazard on the road going through it. I understand from another Department that in the near future there may be a proposal to build a dual carriageway across the Curragh. While this is desirable, if fencing is not included a greater problem will be created.  That can be dealt with on another occasion when we are discussing another Estimate.</P>
    <P>It is true that the Curragh has a potential that has not been realised. The Minister, in co-operation with the Minister for Defence, should examine this matter and see what can be done to improve the situation.  He might bear in mind the number of sheep on the Curragh and, perhaps, consider including them in the extension of the mountain lamb subsidy scheme.  It may sound ridiculous to talk about the Curragh in the context of this scheme but the sheep reared on the Curragh are a mountain breed and they should qualify.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMolone" hpid="Mr. Malone Mr. Malone">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Malone</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for the increase in the mountain lamb subsidy and I hope that at a future date&mdash;perhaps in the <Col N="1248" /> next budget&mdash;he will remember the poor Kildare farmers.  I referred to the bloodstock industry in connection with the Curragh.  I know the Minister is very interested in this industry and it is not out of place to pay tribute to the magnificent work being done in the National Stud at Tully, Kildare.  The manager has made a tremendous success of a very important job, and the ever-increasing number of visitors are enormously impressed. It seems rather ridiculous that the National Stud is under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Finance when, in fact, it should be under the jurisdiction of the Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.  The Taoiseach might take a look at this some time and make some very desirable changes.</P>
      <P>The National Stud is one of the places to which we bring visitors with pride in what we have to show them. The results from the stud are to be seen at race meetings and in the sales yards.  The almighty dollar, the deutschemark and more recently the Japanese yen are very important currencies and a great deal of these currencies come through the National Stud at Tully, County Kildare.  The manager there is certainly to be complimented not only on the work he has done but on opening up the place to the public to see.  For years I passed by the main gates and did not know to where they led.  The gates are open now and it is the pleasure of the manager to conduct visitors around the stud and let them see where their money is being spent, how it is being spent and the return they are getting for it.  That is certainly as it should be.</P>
      <P>In regard to disease eradication I should like to join Deputy Creed in his remarks regarding the danger of the spread of disease.  There is one matter which I fail to understand regarding the warble fly.  In his introductory statement the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast majority of herd owners have complied fully with the statutory requirements relating to warble fly treatment.  Legal proceedings were instituted against a number of persons who defaulted and, where <Col N="1249" /> appropriate, defaulters were debarred from the benefit under the beef cattle incentive scheme.</P>
    <P>As I understood it, any farmer who failed to have his cattle dressed against warble fly was not given a certificate to attach to the &ldquo;TD&rdquo; card and consequently could not offer them for sale.  If there are cases, and obviously there are, where the scheme has been evaded the greatest possible punishment should be inflicted on the persons concerned.  As Deputy Creed has pointed out this scheme was undertaken a few years ago without much success.  The effort was abortive because of the fact that it was not carried on for a couple of years longer and was not thoroughly carried out but for the last two years a very through dressing was carried out. The words in the Minister's statement &ldquo;the vast majority&rdquo; are not good enough for me.  I hope that next year the Minister will be able to report that every farmer has undertaken dressing.</P>
    <P>In regard to veterinary research I do not think I have to remind the Minister that farming at the present time is an occupation which requires an abundance of energy, technical skill and business acumen.  There is one matter which is causing concern to farmers.  There are certain drugs which a farmer can administer to his own animals.  The farmers are worried that this facility may be removed from them and that they will be able to get the drugs only on veterinary prescription.  That would be disastrous because all too often a farmer will not call in a vet until it is too late or the vet may not be available when he is called.  If the farmer is allowed to have the drugs on hand and to administer them himself, time and money would be saved. Every animal life that is saved represents money to the farmer and benefit to the nation.  I would ask the Minister to keep that aspect under close observation.</P>
    <P>Horticulture is the cinderella of farming enterprises.  We know and can understand that the great demand at present is for meat and the emphasis should be placed on increased <Col N="1250" /> production of meat, whether it be beef or mutton.  The market is readily available.  People are waiting with outstretched hands in England and Europe for all the meat we can supply to them.  I would hope that the energy crisis would not prevent deliveries of meat to the Continent or to Britain and that every facility will be afforded to those engaged in the exportation of meat.  There is another outlet for farming activity, horticulture, which is confined to a small area but which is lucrative.  In 1971 there were 20,000 acres of vegetables produced in this county and only 6 per cent or 7 per cent of that total was exported as fresh vegetables.  The total value of vegetables exported was £3.8 million.  This is a figure that could be vastly improved.</P>
    <P>In Britain alone in 1970, £354 million was spent on fresh vegetables, almost £1 million per day.  The figure has been vastly increased since then. There is, as there was of old, the trouble in the horticultural section that they do not have the guaranteed price to offer to the producers.  The Minister might take a look at this and see if and where it can be expanded. If I might make a suggestion to him as to one place where it could be very rapidly expanded, it is on some of our cutaway bogs.</P>
    <P>The Almighty, when he was creating the world, did not give us a lot of minerals.  Any country at present which could claim an oil well could feel happy.  We do not have such an advantage.  We are extremely lucky to have the bogs of this country.  Possibly the light by which I am reading my notes is being produced from peat. It is extremely fortunate that we have such peat.  I ask the Minister to ensure through his colleague, the Minister for Transport and Power, that the entire boglands are not burned to make light.  By that I mean that sufficient peat should be left for the growing of crops.</P>
    <P>This point is of great concern to the people working in bogland areas at the present time.  They are worried about what will happen to them when the bogs are worked out.  There need be no worry if the Minister ensures <Col N="1251" /> now that the vegetable-growing industry is started and gradually expanded over a period of years as the bogs are used to provide employment, light and power.</P>
    <P>Not only do the bogs employ the Bord na Móna workers actually on them at present, but their employment potential is tremendous.  The yield of vegetables on peatland is far higher than on mineral soil.  I am absolutely convinced that, if arrangements can be made to market the produce, there is a ready market available not only in Britain but even on the Continent. At present England alone are importing fresh vegetables from anywhere they can get them.  Let us grasp that market while it is there.  Let us not miss the opportunity.  If we do that we will build up an economy in that particular sector.  We will also ensure that in whatever time lies ahead of Bord na Móna&mdash;and we hope it will be a long time but the supply is not unlimited&mdash;there will be employment for those who come after us. It will be of benefit to them and to the nation if such an arrangement can be made.</P>
    <P>The Minister has seen the research station at Lullymore.  He has seen what can be done.  The surface is only scratched now.  Bord na Móna have shown the Minister what can be done. Anyone who has taken the trouble to study it can see the potential is there. They have the &ldquo;know-how&rdquo;.  It is only a matter of somebody giving them the go-ahead and they will get on with the job.  I will not be at all surprised if we become so preoccupied with looking to the bogs as a source of energy that we forget what will happen to them when they have been worked out.  Now is the time to consider what should be done.</P>
    <P>There is just one other point to which I want to refer.  It is the rates allowance for employment.  The Minister might examine that.  It is a ridiculous figure.  We realise that many farmers are becoming more and more dependent on family labour.  Nevertheless, there are still a large number of people employed on the land and <Col N="1252" /> they are not getting anything like what they should get by way of pay in return for their hard work.  They are getting as much and in many cases more than is laid down by the regulations, and also as much as the farmers can pay.  It would be a very great gesture on the part of the Minister to have this allowance increased so that the farmers could retain their work force by giving them more pay. We want to see in Ireland, whether in industries in the cities or in agriculture, a situation arising which, without being frivolous about it, would be similiar to the situation in a cartoon in a magazine called <i>The Grower</i> of 14th July of this year.  It shows a man arriving at the employment exchange looking for workers to help him to pick the fruit crop.  In one hand he has a newspaper with the heading &ldquo;Serious shortage of Pickers&rdquo; and he says to the man behind the desk &ldquo;If there is no unemployment in this area would you and your staff care to do a few days' picking?&rdquo;.  That is what we want to see.  We do not want to see unemployment agencies or places staffed with people paying out unemployment benefit but rather a situation in which there would be no unemployment either in agriculture or in industry and in which the benefits accruing to the country would continue.  It is to be hoped that the Minister, with his interest and knowledge of agriculture, will have another good year to report when he introduces his Estimate again next year.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I might conclude by quoting the Minister's own words when he addressed the newly-appointed council of An Foras Talúntais on 6th September, when he said:</P>
    <P>Finally, I think we can all agree that we stand on the threshold of exciting times in development of our agriculture and of our rural areas.  The contribution of agriculture today to our national wellbeing is greater than it has ever been in our history.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister on his appointment to this very important Ministry.  I knew the <Col N="1253" /> Minister long before I came into Dáil Éireann.  Knowing his ability and knowledge of agriculture and of farming in general, I have no doubt but that, as Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, he will be a leader and an example for agriculture in this country. While the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, in so far as decision making is concerned, is not as important as it was before our entry into Europe, nevertheless it is important in that we must now have a Minister and a Department who are very much aware of what is happening in Europe and in the world.  While major decision-making is not now a function of the Department there are other decisions to be made there, perhaps of a minor nature but nevertheless important.  We must remember that while the number of people engaged in agriculture is decreasing, as it is in all countries of the world today, we now have a lesser number of people producing a greater amount than was being produced ten, 12 or 15 years ago.</P>
      <P>Our entry into Europe has changed the pattern in so far as marketing and the financing of agriculture are concerned.  The Minister and his Department have a major role to play in the implementation of the many directives which will affect agriculture and indeed will affect people engaged in industry and elsewhere.  The implementation of these directives would seem to require much co-operation from large numbers of people and tremendous planning.  It seems that in the future a very large number of farmers will be keen to participate in implementing EEC policy directives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to the farm modernisation directive to which the Minister also referred.  He said it has two major objectives&mdash;to provide for a selective system of aids to &ldquo;development&rdquo; farms and to regulate the type and level of investment aid which may be given to farmers outside the &ldquo;development&rdquo; category.  The World Bank loan already in operation requires great documentation and great planning.  This brings me to the advisory services in so far as they have <Col N="1254" /> to meet these commitments.  Farm accounts are also involved under this directive.  As time progresses our farmers are realising more and more the value of modern methods and are anxious to avail themselves of the incentives which are now available within the EEC.</P>
    <P>There is a question as to whether the advisory service can meet their commitments.  There is also a question in regard to specialised advisers for farm planning, farmyard planning, cattle housing, milking layouts, beef layouts and the many aspects of a good farming plan.  Is our advisory service geared to meet those needs at present?  Is it qualified to meet the needs in a specialist manner?  Have we sufficient specialists in the advisory service?  In the past the agricultural advisers have done a tremendous amount of work, but I wonder if the number of advisers being appointed by county committees of agriculture is keeping pace with the volume of work, which seems to increase as each day goes by.  Apart from our entry into Europe the demand for the advisory service is growing and this is a good thing.  It must continue to grow because, no matter what we say about industry, for a long time agriculture will be, as it has been in the past and is at present, the very bedrock of our economy.  If agriculture fails the whole economy will fail.  We can see the importance of a sound, well-trained corps of advisers.  We must continue to work towards that and in that way we can compete with any of our European counterparts. Many of those countries have been held up to us in the past as examples, but I have no doubt that we have in this country farmers as good as, if not better than, some of their European counterparts.  Our problem is that they are too few.  We must bring up the mediocre farmer and the poor farmer to the highest level of the farming pattern in this country.  In doing this we shall be helping the economy in a major way.</P>
    <P>While the problem of the marketing of agricultural products confronted this country before our entry into Europe, it is not as great a problem <Col N="1255" /> now as it was then, in that markets are available.  On the other hand, our responsibilities are as great, if not greater.  We must, first of all, consider the question of processing our products.  It is in the processing and, just as important, the presentation of our agricultural products that we failed and failed badly in the past.  In the past our milk and beef products were literally dumped on any market we could get and left to work out their own salvation.  Through the advent of the various marketing boards like Bord Bainne and the beef board, this aspect of it has been tackled.  Through our different processing firms we can present a commodity which is attractive to the continental housewife or to the housewives in any of the countries where we market our products.</P>
    <P>However, all this needs planning and specialist advice.  This brings me back to the important role which our advisory service must play in the future.  The Minister, as he has said in his brief, is considering many aspects of the advisory service, and I asked last year that a White Paper be issued on the restructuring of this service.  I would like to hear what the Minister and his Departmental officials are thinking on the restructuring of this vital service to agriculture and ultimately to the community.</P>
    <P>Many suggestions and many papers are presented to the Minister by the relevant organisations, farming organisations, county committees of agriculture and, indeed, the organisation dealing with the advisory service itself.  I still think the Minister should issue this White Paper and let all the relevant associations come together and consider how the Department and all the other agencies can best serve the farmer by way of specialist advice and otherwise.  I know the Minister says he has had sufficient information, but since the restructuring of this service is so important and since whatever new organisation has emerged will be with us for many years, a great deal of thought should be put into the question.  The best <Col N="1256" /> brains possible should be picked so that we can have in the end an advisory service of which this country or any country can be proud.</P>
    <P>The advisory service served the community well in the past.  Many attacks have been made on the system, more especially as operated by the county committees of agriculture. No matter what has been said about the members of those committees, a great deal of worthwhile work has been done by them.  What worries me at present is the question of control. These committees had one thing going for them: they had control of their destiny in their own counties.  It is vital that we try to continue this control at local level in order to maintain the confidence of the farmers in the advisory service.</P>
    <P>As a member of a county committee of agriculture, I have seen situations in which we had to wait months, perhaps closer on a year sometimes, for a decision which could not be made locally.  This is what worries me in regard to the restructuring which is envisaged, and we must consider it very carefully.  I would like to see the present committees continue, and I would like to see them having the same authority as they enjoy at present, if not more.  Personally, I would like to see machinery being made available whereby these committees could have representation from the different farming organisations.</P>
    <P>I can appreciate the problems involved when there are so many organisations dealing with different aspects of farming.  There are the economic, educational and cultural organisations and, indeed, an organisation dealing with all aspects on a much wider basis altogether.  It should not be beyond the capacity of the Department to devise ways and means of ensuring proper representation of farming organisations on the county committees of agriculture.  The importance of authority at local level cannot be over-emphasised, first, so that decisions can be made on the spot and, secondly, so that we can maintain the confidence of the farming community in the advisory service, a confidence that took a long time to build up.  I trust <Col N="1257" /> that the Minister will consider very carefully any change that may be proposed in relation to autonomy at local level.  I acknowledge that the Department must retain certain controls but the level of this control should be as little as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the question of proficiency courses and award programmes that are being carried out by the advisory service in relation to specialised aspects of farming.  In this context I am glad to note that Macra na Feirme are playing a vital role in the promotion of this programme. It is of vital importance that education in farming be a continuing process for any young boy who stays at home and hopes to inherit the family farm.  Young farmers have available to them the agricultural colleges as well as the winter farm schools and the agricultural classes organised by the advisory service but this aspect is merely a drop in the ocean in so far as a general education in agriculture is concerned.  I hope that these courses and also the proficiency award programme will continue.</P>
    <P>We must make every effort to provide our young farmers with the skills required to equip them for modern-day farming while at the same time having regard to the various types of farming that are traditional in particular areas.  Good farming methods and practices will ensure that our country can gain the greatest advantage possible by reason of the markets that are open to us in Europe and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>In talking of young farmers' organisations I would like to compliment Macra na Feirme on what they have achieved in the sphere of education in agriculture.  This organisation, working mainly on a voluntary basis, are carrying out work that is vital to the future success of our agricultural industry.  Therefore, it was with regret that I read a newspaper report recently to the effect that the Minister is not considering an increase in the grant that has been made available to this organisation down through the years.  Perhaps there have been some developments in this regard since <Col N="1258" /> I read that report but I appeal to the Minister to increase this grant and take a particular interest in the work being done by the organisation.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister has a keen interest in agricultural education and that is why I am confident that he will endeavour to solve whatever problems there may be as between the Department and Macra na Feirme.  This organisation are appointing development officers and organisers and are organising the rural communities to be better members of the community.  Their activities are not confined to the farming community. For these reasons any money that can be provided by the Department to help Macra na Feirme can be regarded as being money well spent.  Perhaps when the Minister is replying he will have something to say in relation to this organisation.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies mentioned the question of animal diseases and in particular their eradication.  The Minister mentioned the increase in the number of reactors that have been detected as a result of the tuberculin test. This is a source of worry not alone to the Department but to the farmer. He has to suffer the loss when the animals are removed from his herd. The compensation paid by the Department is completely inadequate when one considers the cost of replacing, for instance, a dairy cow.  The maximum amount which the Department can pay is £200.  To replace that animal would cost nearer £300 or £350.  The Department must set itself the task of eradicating this disease as quickly as possible.  We must have disease free herds because the cattle industry is a very important industry.</P>
    <P>The brucellosis eradication scheme is very important.  As the Minister said, we are now living on borrowed time.  How right he is.  The fact that he mentioned this is proof, to my mind, that the Department are making very poor efforts to eradicate this disease.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on this scheme as it affects Limerick and neighbouring counties.  The Minister said in Volume 268 of the Official Report, column 1451:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1259" /> Outside the compulsory eradication area, herdowners have available to them a free breeding heifer vaccination scheme, a brucellosis certified herds scheme under which individual herds cleared of the disease are registered as brucellosis free and a new voluntary pre-intensive brucellosis scheme which aims to reduce the incidence of the disease in all the counties outside the brucellosis free and clearance areas.  The new voluntary scheme is based on milk ring testing.  It will permit herd owners to phase out their reactors gradually and with a minimum of disturbance to the economy of their holdings.</P>
    <P>I take issue with the Minister on this. He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>Herdowners are required to dispose of reactors for slaughter at whatever time best suits them.  A headage grant is payable on slaughter of each reactor plus a further grant when all reactors in the herd are disposed of.</P>
    <P>In the early days tuberculin testing was free to the farmer.  I cannot see why this scheme which operates in Limerick and other counties cannot be free also.  I previously mentioned the question of the replacement of animals purchased by the Department under the bovine tuberculosis scheme and that the compensation paid by the Department was inadequate.  The Minister is asking the farmers to eradicate this disease on a voluntary basis.  He is providing a headage grant once the scheme is completed.  It may take six to eight years to eradicate this disease.  The incentives are not good enough to ensure that farmers will avail of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows the importance to this country of animals which are free of disease, particularly tuberculosis and brucellosis.  If the Department agreed to pay the costs of testing by the veterinary profession, it would go a long way to meet the demands of farmers and increase the chances of their participating in the voluntary eradication of this disease. It is important to advise and point out <Col N="1260" /> to the farmer the nature of this disease, the source of infection and the standards of hygiene required for its control.  Milk ring testing is another problem.  It is difficult to identify individual reactors.  To put it mildly, the farmers are very dissatisfied with the incentives to dispose of brucellosis reactors.  The Minister should give careful consideration to this scheme and look into the aspects of it which I have mentioned.  They are important if we are to eradicate this disease.</P>
    <P>As the Minister rightly pointed out &mdash;and it is worth repeating&mdash;we are really living on borrowed time because, in four years' time, we will have to comply with the full veterinary requirements of the EEC in regard to our domestic and export trade in live cattle.  Therefore, we can see the necessity for speeding up the eradication of this disease.  Provided the incentives are there, and provided we get the co-operation and goodwill of the farming community, we can speed up the eradication of this disease which is costing the country, agriculture in general, and farmers millions of pounds each year in the loss of milk and calves.  I want to emphasise the importance of taking a fresh look at the eradication of the disease which affects the areas and the counties which are now doing it on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>When one speaks about agriculture the subject is so wide and so varied that one can only pick out and deal with certain aspects.  On the question of pig production the first thing one asks oneself is: is bacon production economic for farmers when one considers the ever-increasing cost of foodstuffs week after week?  We have seen the number of sows which have been disposed of over the past 12 months because pig production is no longer economic for farmers due to increased costs in feeding stuffs and other overhead charges.  We have seen the amount of grants which were made available down through the years for the erection of sow houses, fattening units, and so forth.  I am afraid many of these houses will be empty in the future.</P>
    <Col N="1261" />
    <Speaker pid="MarkAClinton" hpid="Mr. Clinton Mr. Clinton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clinton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is too gloomy a picture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan Mr. Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, but the Minister will agree that it must be considered carefully.  He realises, as well as I do, the problem of the cost of feeding stuffs.  I know that the price to the farmer for his pigs is outside the Minister's control.  These are facts and it should be possible to do something to relieve the gloomy picture I have painted.  Many aspects are now outside our control but we must approach the problem realistically and we must give the farmers who are in pig production some guarantee for the future.  We must consider the price of feeding stuffs from abroad and particularly the protein feed prices such as maize and soya bean meal.  The farmers who have continued to specialise in pig production and who have modernised their buildings are entitled to some guarantee and some hope for the future.</P>
      <P>I come now to dairying.  Being in dairying myself I hope I can speak with some authority.  We all agree that, at long last, over the past 12 months our dairy farmers have been getting good prices for their products. In the dairying counties production is continuing and the herds are getting bigger.  Milking facilities are being improved.  We achieved this by our entry into Europe.  Now our dairy farmers can enjoy a standard of living which heretofore they could not enjoy.  Now that the Department no longer have to subsidise the dairying industry they can interest themselves &mdash;and again I come back to this important aspect of farming today&mdash; in providing specialist advisers in dairying.  Although prices have improved costs are also increasing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also, and rightly so, the important matter of producing quality milk.  There is a problem in producing quality milk which is so important for the many milk products which are required on the British and continental markets.  They can be produced only by having the highest standards of cleanliness and hygiene in our dairies and in the production of milk. <Col N="1262" /> Processors are continually seeking a better quality milk and it is a continuing difficulty for many of our dairy farmers in certain areas to produce this better quality milk.  We have come a long way and we have made some major progress in this particular sphere but there is still room for improvement, particularly from the point of view of our having to compete with our European counterparts. Good quality milk depends to a very large extent on a good water supply. On some farms the water supply is very, very poor and the prospects of getting a good supply are not particularly bright.  Incentives are just as important here as are the incentives in other agricultural spheres.  Our farmers should be encouraged and advised in regard to the matter of better water supplies because in future only the highest quality milk will be accepted.</P>
    <P>Rationalisation of our dairying industry is progressing satisfactorily.  It took a good while and there were many difficulties to surmount; some were real and some were imaginary but good progress was made over the past two to three years under the Minister's predecessor.  There are still some problems to be solved.  I believe the Minister has both the capacity and the ability to solve these problems and surmount any difficulties that arise in relation to the rationalisation of the dairying industry in the same way as his predecessor surmounted difficulties and solved problems.</P>
    <P>When rationalisation has been successfully completed there will be still other problems to solve.  Bulk collection is now an everyday occurrence. Unfortunately, many of the roadways and entrances to farms are not in a fit condition to take this bulk transport and the possibility is that the farmer will be involved in some cost here.  There is a certain amount of controversy as to the best type of tank.  I read a report in the Press recently and I understood from that report that An Foras Talúntais has made a study of bulk tanks in the Cork district last year.  I do not know <Col N="1263" /> if the Minister has seen the results of this study.  I would think that they should be made available to the advisory services and to farming organisations. Some processing plants favour one type of bulk tank and some favour another.  If there is a cheap tank quite suitable for the purposes it is designed to serve we should be told about it.</P>
    <P>Difficulties arise from the point of view of power.  Some of the lines are not capable of carrying the necessary current.  All these things affect the dairying industry, its modernisation and its rationalisation.  If we modernise properly we will be able <Col N="1264" /> to compete successfully, but we will be able to compete successfully only if all the requisite facilities are made available to the farmers.  The remaining problems must be tackled by the Minister and his Department in the realisation that only by a proper system of farming on the most modern lines possible can this country hope to achieve its targets in the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again.</P>
