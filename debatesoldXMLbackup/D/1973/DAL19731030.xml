      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach tell the House how he can reconcile recent appointments with the intention as expressed in the television programme by the Attorney General that in future all such appointments will be made on merit alone?  Does he not think it unusual that this merit appears to be perceptible now only in those who are favourable to the Government?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Seeing that the Taoiseach was involved in the appointment of the Attorney General, would he not how agree that, while an Attorney General may make a good politician, a politician does not necessarily make a good Attorney General?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not think that, in view of the appalling increases which were announced in the past week, he should now reconsider the decision which he has now announced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCosgrave" hpid="The Taoiseach Liam Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  This says nothing about increases.  It is about consumer affairs and the answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>While the increases which were announced last week may not be stated in the question, surely one of the prime consumer affairs is the cost of living. Should not the Taoiseach now consider the appointment of a Parliamentary Secretary to co-ordinate such activities in view of the failure of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will increase the number of places in Irish hospitals for training student nurses in view of the fact that many girls have to go to England each year to be trained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr. R. Barry) Richard Barry">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health (Mr. R. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter primarily for An Bord Altranais who have certain statutory duties under the Nurses Act, 1950, relating to the approval of hospitals for training student nurses.  I am informed, however, that the number of nurse training hospitals, and the total number of places in them, have increased in recent years and that a further two hospitals have been approved in principle by the board as nurse training schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should make it clear, however, that the number of nurses being trained in Irish hospitals is more than adequate for our needs and there <Col N="763" /> must be a reasonable upper limit on the total number of places available for training.  Nursing is very popular as a career among Irish girls but it is not a practical proposition to provide training for all girls who wish to become nurses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Parliamentary Secretary reconcile this with the fact that there appears to be a shortage of nurses inasmuch as a great number of married women are now employed part-time as nurses while a large number of girls have to go to England each year to train, as I stated in the question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>We have all had questions about Irish girls who would like to become nurses.  My personal view is that most of them would make excellent nurses but there is a limit to the number we can have.  My information from the officials of the Department is that the training schools now available are adequate to provide for our Irish needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary facilitate so far as possible nurses who have done a psychiatric course and who would be prepared to take a general course if places were available, but find that it is impossible to get a place in a general hospital, despite the fact that they have psychiatric training?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that one-third of a student nurse's time is spent on education and instruction in classrooms.  The remainder of the student nurse's time is devoted to practical procedures and instruction in the hospital wards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Health Boards have discretion in this matter and I am informed that, in a number of cases, they allow more than the £2 per week mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimate of additional cost is calculated by reference to the differences in eligibility for services between here and Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="765" /> Most of the additional cost would arise in extending to the whole population the general medical services, which are at present available free to about one-third of the population, and the dental, ophthalmic and aural services, which are available to about the same number of persons.  The estimated cost of extending these services would probably be of the order of £25 million.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Possession of a British passport does not, as such, entitle the holder to any medical services in this country.  However, I want to make it clear that insured persons and social security pensioners coming to this country from the United Kingdom are entitled under EEC regulations for the social security of migrant workers to free general practitioner and hospital services for themselves and their dependants. Temporary visitors are entitled to these services only in the case of urgency.  A similar arrangement operates in respect of Irish insured workers and pensioners in the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>United Kingdom visitors who have no entitlement under the EEC regulations are treated on the same basis as Irish citizens.  That is to say, their eligibility is assessed on grounds of income and the level of services available to them is determined accordingly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read reports on the matter referred to in the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago the National Drugs Advisory Board examined especially the position regarding the use of <Col N="766" /> bronchodilators in aerosols in this country.  It considered that in proper dosage and mode of inhalation the bronchodilators are of great value in the treatment of asthma, but that their misuse could have serious reactions.</P>
    <P>Warning letters were issued by the board to all doctors and to the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, for the attention of dispensing chemists, drawing to their notice the importance of adequate instruction of the patient in the proper use of the medication.</P>
    <P>The board also held discussions with the pharmaceutical firms concerned and for some years the containers bear acceptable forms of cautionary labelling and instruction.</P>
    <P>The board consider that the measures taken have achieved a more cautious use of these agents.</P>
    <P>The board indicate that a survey of asthma deaths possibly attributable to excessive use of these preparations indicated that 18 occurred in 1968, five in 1969, two in 1970 and one in 1971.</P>
    <P>The question of providing, in poisons regulations which it is proposed to make shortly, that aerosols containing drugs used as bronchodilators can only be made available to the public on prescription is under consideration by Comhairle na Nimheanna.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated in the Press statements and advertisements issued in this connection, the Minister set up this board in consultation with the Association for Justice for Irish Thalidomide Children for two broad purposes.  First, it was to assist parents who might have a claim against the German compensation fund, as the processing of claims by the assessors of that fund is now nearing completion.  Secondly, the Government had decided in principle that it should help to augment the <Col N="767" /> compensation which will be made available to Irish children from the German fund and I wished to have expert advice on the special needs of each child to help me decide in what way such needs can best be catered for.</P>

      <P>I do not propose at the moment to ask the chief executive officers of health boards to add to the factors which they now take into account in determining eligibility for medical cards.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of an increasing number of hardship cases, particularly in the Southern Health Board area, and in view of that can be say whether he will examine urgently the possibility of greater allowances in <Col N="768" /> respect of such cases?  No doubt he is aware of the recent withdrawal of medical cards in that area in many cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>While I fully appreciate the reasoning underlying the question, the arrangement suggested would not be appropriate primarily because a person in receipt of unemployment assistance could already be the holder of a medical card. Health boards do, however, in assessing eligibility for medical cards, have regard to other means tests which the applicant may have undergone to qualify for State benefits, and this, of course, helps considerably in speeding up the granting of medical cards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBarry" hpid="Mr. R. Barry Mr. R. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that in 99 per cent of such cases, there is entitlement to medical cards but there are some cases&mdash;and this might apply more to south Kerry than to other areas&mdash;where there is a means test and where the valuation of land is a consideration, but valuation is not always the best way of judging a person's means.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cunningham</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this reply is a direct contradiction of a statement made by the Minister for Health when he stated categorically in reply to a question from me that every unemployment assistance recipient who applied for a medical card was deemed to be entitled to this benefit.

      <P>The National Drugs Advisory Board, with the co-operation of the pharmaceutical industry, operate an effective scheme for assessing the safety of new and reformulated drugs before they are put on the market in this country.  The board also monitor reports on adverse effects of drugs already in use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, although these arrangements are operating satisfactorily, it is recognised that they should have statutory backing and it is proposed to provide for this in comprehensive <Col N="770" /> legislation controlling the safety, quality and efficacy of medical preparations. In the meantime, regulations for the licensing of pharmaceutical manufacturers and wholesalers, which are being made under existing powers in the Health Acts, are at an advanced stage of preparation.  In addition, regulations for the licensing of the marketing of individual pharmaceutical products are being drafted under the European Communities Act, 1972, as our EEC obligations require us to have a legally based product licence scheme before 30th June, 1974.</P>

It can, however, be stated that where claims <Col N="775" /> from school bus drivers in respect of school holiday periods have been refused by the statutory deciding authorities, disallowance has usually been on the grounds that the claimants have other regular occupations of a nature so substantial as to make them unavailable for employment other than for the part-time job of school bus driver.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions for entitlement to retirement pension, claimable at age 65, is that the claimant shall not engage in employment which is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts otherwise than for occupational injuries benefit only. <Col N="776" /> Employments which are classified by regulation as being either subsidiary employments or employment of inconsiderable extent are insurable for occupational injuries benefit only, and do not disqualify the worker for retirement pension.

    <P>Briefly, the scheme provides that pay-related benefit will be paid for up <Col N="778" /> to 24½ weeks to supplement flat-rate disability benefit, unemployment benefit, maternity allowance and, in certain circumstances, occupational injury benefit.  The amount of benefit will be 40 per cent of the employee's reckonable weekly earnings in excess of £14 subject to an over-riding limit yet to be prescribed.  Pay-related contributions will be payable by both employers and employees as a percentage of the employee's current earnings, again subject to an over-riding limit which, with the rates of contribution, will also be settled by regulation. These contributions will be collected by the Revenue Commissioners through the income tax machinery.</P>

      <P>The position is that the head of the Air Corps holds the rank of Colonel which is equivalent to the naval rank of captain.  The establishment in the Naval Service, while we would like to see a higher rank, does not for service personnel qualify for a higher rank than captain.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence the steps he has taken to <Col N="780" /> ensure against a recurrence of the type of incident in which a civilian was shot by the Defence Forces near Navan some months ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 29 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>The incident referred to in the questions has been investigated by the military authorities.  It has also been the subject matter of inquiries by the Garda Síochána.  Pending the outcome of those inquiries, I consider that it would be inappropriate for me to make a statement in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister, regardless of the outcome of these inquiries, to commit himself in the public interest to having a public inquiry into this particular incident.  A closed inquiry, no matter how diligently carried out, cannot meet this particular case in that it is a most unusual case, the first of any such cases which leaves so many questions unanswered and there is a great unease in the public mind as to the manner in which the Defence Forces are being used for these police duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to help the Deputy as best I can in this matter.  The position is that nobody has been charged.  Therefore, the matter is not <i>sub judice</i> and the Deputy is quite in order in asking questions. However, at the same time, the matter is with the civil authorities and they have not concluded their investigations. While we have held a military investigation on the matter, the civil authorities have not concluded their investigations. The matter is in Limbo and at this moment the decision of the civil authorities is awaited as to what they intend doing, whether anybody is to be charged or whether a report on the incident is to be sent to me.  Then, and only then, can I comment on the military investigation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister had any information as to the likely date when the Garda inquiries may conclude and also whether the military inquiry has concluded?  Talking of limbo, I should like to ask what is to <Col N="781" /> become of the victim of this shooting who is very much in limbo at the moment in that he is paralysed and in a rehabilitation centre in Dún Laoghaire without any real means of support?  What is to become of this individual in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first supplementary is that I am hopeful that the civil authorities will finalise this matter within a matter of weeks, not months.  The person who was injured in the incident is receiving the very best medical care.  I reject any implication at this stage that there is any fault to be found with the arrangements, the regulations or with any individual person.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware if the authorities who would seem to be involved and responsible for this young man's present dire plight have and are taking an interest in the case as to the well-being of this young man and whether this young man's future will be in any way secure by way of compensation for the shooting that has taken place?

      <P>The Deputy has asked two supplementaries and I am endeavouring to help him in every way.  First, the Minister for Defence is certainly taking a very active interest in the whole situation.  The answer to the second supplementary is that the matter is with the civil authorities who must clear it and then we can become more actively interested in it.  In the meantime, all that can be done is to make sure that the person who is injured is receiving the best medical attention, and that has been done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the Deputy has in mind the award of special allowances.  One of the statutory conditions for eligibility for a special allowance is that the applicant be incapable of self-support by reason of age or permanent infirmity of body or mind.  Persons over the age of 70 are deemed to be so incapable.  No change in the statutory conditions is contemplated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree there are not many people in this category and that it is not worthwhile their going to the bother of getting a medical certificate?  I presume most of those people would be approximately 65 or 66 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Mr. Donegan Mr. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 10,700 people already in receipt of special allowances and it is believed about 30,000 medal-holders are alive.  In order to qualify for a military pension it is necessary to have the medal with bar for active service.  In the case of a special allowance, where there is a need to help someone, the bar for active service is not required.  We are trying to help those who need it most, and the Deputy may be assured that we will do this in every way we can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donegan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that helicopters must be serviced at Baldonnel. They are easily moved from one part of the country to another. The helicopters we have at the moment have certain limitations with regard to fishery protection and work with the Naval Service in connection with this work.  The helicopters cannot fly at night and at the moment I am investigating whether a navigational system can be installed so that at least one or two helicopters might be flown at night both for fishery protection and also for the removal of patients from islands.  That investigation is not complete as yet.  At the moment the best course is to have the helicopters available&mdash;usually at Finner and Baldonnel&mdash;to be sent to the Naval Service as required.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I have asked local authorities to submit proposals for revision of local electoral areas with a view to bringing about equality of representation within individual local <Col N="784" /> authority areas.  It is not proposed to alter the overall membership of local authorities in this review.  I would point out however that so far as county councils are concerned there are no constitutional or statutory requirements governing the ratio between councillors and population.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyOConnor" hpid="Mr. O'Connor Mr. O'Connor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the ratio varies from 12,890 in Leitrim to 11,374 in Dublin county?  In my own county the figure is 4,500.  In view of this, the nine north-central countries who have 216 councillors on a representation of 4,500 should have only 91 while in the southern area, where there are 178 councillors, they should have only 89. For a number of years my county and those adjoining it have tried to get representatives elected to the Seanad but we have not been successful.

This situation, which I agree is not right, has existed since that time but no effort was made until now to change it.  I would have changed the representation now but for the fact that a public inquiry would be required and, since it is proposed holding local elections in June, 1974, it is almost certain the public inquiries could not be held or the results known before that date.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government when the plans for the housing development at Shanganagh Vale, County Dublin will be completed; and when it is contemplated that the first houses will be built.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose with your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 35 and 36 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am so aware.  Separate figures are not available from Dublin County Council for the Rathdown constituency area.  I understand, however, that the <Col N="789" /> number of applicants for re-housing in the Ballybrack housing area is about 590.  The latter area, as designated by the council, does not coincide with the Rathdown constituency area.</P>
    <P>At the request of the county council, the National Building Agency is finalising plans for about 600 dwellings which would include local authority houses and sites for private houses at Shanganagh. I am not in a position at this stage to say when the first houses in this scheme may be built.  The scheme is, however, being dealt with as a priority, with the intention that a substantial number of houses will be built in 1974-75.  The agency are also preparing plans for a scheme of 162 houses and 100 private sites for the council at Sandyford.  Plans for a county council scheme of about 600 dwellings at Deansrath, Clondalkin are also being finalised by the agency.</P>
    <P>Dublin County Council also have work in progress on schemes of 58 houses at Rathcoole, 100 at Ballinteer, 96 at Dundrum, 12 at Stillorgan and 8 at Glenamuck.  Schemes of 112 houses at Walkinstown, 22 at Roebuck and four at Kilternan are at tender stage and schemes of 108 houses at Clonburris, Clondalkin and 272 at Ballyboden are being planned by the council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesTully" hpid="Mr. Tully Mr. Tully">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tully</NameTxt>
      <P>The position about the housing schemes referred to is that no house is held up in the Department <Col N="790" /> of Local Government.  As soon as it is submitted the scheme is sanctioned and sent out and the money is already notified to the local authority so they can proceed immediately with the building.  No schemes are being held up by the Department and if they are being held up at local level I am sorry.  I am sure they are doing their best, but there is nothing I can do about it.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That pursuant to section 2 of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960 (No. 44 of 1960), Dáil Éireann approves of the despatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force, for service outside the State as part of the International force which, pursuant to a Resolution on the Middle East by the Security Council of the United Nations on the 25th day of October, 1973, has been established by that Council for the performance of duties of a police character.</P>
      <P>May I say, a Cheann Comhairle, that copies of my very brief statement should be available in a few moments. I apologise to the House.  There has been urgency about this and my statement should be available in a few moments.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the Government have received a request from the Secretary-General of the United Nations to provide an Irish contingent to participate in the United Nations Emergency Force in the Middle East.  The Government have decided to meet the Secretary-General's request, subject to the approval of Dáil Éireann which is being sought in this motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Emergency Force was established by a resolution of the Security Council on the 25th October.  The terms of reference of the Emergency Force are set out in a report to the Security Council by the Secretary-General on 26th October. The force will have the task of supervising the implementation of the Security Council's demand for a complete cease fire between the parties in the positions occupied by them at 1650 hours GMT on 22nd October.  The force is also required to use its best efforts to prevent a recurrence of the fighting and will co-operate with the International Committee of the Red Cross in its humanitarian endeavours and, in the fulfilment of its tasks, the force will have the co-operation of the military observers of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation.</P>
      <P>The Secretary-General has stipulated three essential conditions to enable the force to carry out these tasks effectively.  First, the force must have at all times the full confidence and backing of the Security Council; secondly, it must operate with the full co-operation of the parties concerned; and thirdly, it must be able to function as an integrated and efficient military unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The force will be under United Nations command, vested in the Secretary-General under the authority of the Security Council.  The commander in the field will be appointed by the Secretary-General with the <Col N="799" /> consent of the Security Council.  The interim commander is General Siilasvuo of Finland who was formerly Chief-of-Staff of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation in the Middle East.  I might mention here that two Irish officers have been appointed to very senior positions in the United Nations peace-keeping and supervisory operations in the Middle East.  This is a tribute to Ireland's role and to the exceptionally high calibre of our officers.</P>
    <P>The commander of the Emergency Force will be responsible to the Secretary-General, and all matters which may affect the nature or the continued effective functioning of the force will be referred to the Security Council for decision.</P>
    <P>The Emergency Force will operate at all times separately from the armed forces of the parties concerned.  Consequently, separate quarters and, where-ever desirable and feasible, buffer zones will be arranged with the co-operation of the parties.  Appropriate agreements on the status of the force will be concluded with the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>The Secretary-General has stipulated that the force will be provided with weapons of a defensive character only and will not use force except in self-defence. Self-defence would include resistance to attempts by forceful means to prevent it from discharging its duties under the mandate of the Security Council.  The force will, of course, act with complete impartiality as between the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>Present indications are that the force will have a total strength of the order of 7,000 all ranks and will be initially stationed in the area for a period of six months.</P>
    <P>The cost of the force according to preliminary estimates prepared by the Secretary-General is put at approximately 30 million dollars for a period of six months.  As far as costs are concerned, the Security Council has decided that these will be considered as expenses of the organisation to be borne by member states.</P>
    <P>The total strength of the Irish contingent will be in the region of 240 all ranks, of whom approximately one <Col N="800" /> half will be transferred from Cyprus.  If the House approves this motion, arrangements will, it is hoped, be put in train for the immediate transfer of our Cyprus contingent to the Middle East and the balance of our force will follow as soon as possible.  Deputies will be aware that advance contingents from Austria, Finland and Sweden are already on the ground in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>This is not the appropriate occasion on which to enter into any detailed discussion of the Middle East problem as such.  Deputies will appreciate that we should be careful to avoid saying anything at this stage that might prejudice our position.  I should tell the House, however, that we have for some time past in consultation with our partners in the Nine been considering the whole situation to see if any initiative could be worked out in a European context that might help towards an eventual solution.  While these efforts have so far not been fruitful we shall continue to explore all possibilities for peace in the area.  In this connection I want to recall what I have said on other occasions that a primary basic objective of Irish foreign policy is to help to maintain world peace and reduce tensions.  For that reason we are anxious to support the United Nations and the Security Council in the measures they are pursuing to bring a settlement to this troubled area of the world.</P>
    <P>It is an honour for Ireland to be asked to make this practical contribution to deal with this situation, which has not only disrupted the peace of the Middle East but which has serious repercussions far beyond the immediate area of conflict, and particularly for Europe which is so closely connected to it.</P>
    <P>It is indeed flattering and a recognition of our impartiality and the independent and constructive attitude which has characterised our role in the various international organisations in which we participate, that we have received this invitation.  The task to be undertaken by our troops, in common with those of other countries participating, is obviously a most difficult one and one fraught with vital consequences <Col N="801" /> for the preservation of world peace.  I have the fullest confidence that our officers and men will discharge their heavy responsibilities in a manner fully in keeping with the traditions of the Army and with the high standards of efficiency and dedication to duty which have always been displayed by our troops when they have been called upon in the past to assist the United Nations Organisation in its primary task of maintaining international peace and security.  We must hope that this force will be a factor in bringing about not only an end of the conflict but will also contribute to a lasting settlement in the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can be assured of the support of this side of the House in giving approval to this motion.  The Minister has indicated that it is an honour for Ireland to be asked to make this contribution to deal with the situation, and he has further stated that it is flattering and a recognition of our impartiality and the independent and constructive attitude which has characterised our role in various international organisations. It is, indeed, an honour; it may well be flattering, but all of us feel that it would almost be surprising if Ireland had not at this time been asked to continue to play the role she has so effectively played since our forces were enabled to act by virtue of the 1960 Defence (Amendment) Act, in the United Nations peace keeping operations.  It is a good thing for that reason that under section 2 of that Act motions of this type must come before the House for approval, first of all, so that we can assess the role our forces have played, are playing and, we hope, will play in the United Nations peace-keeping operations; and, secondly, so that we can be assured that in connection with any particular operation for which troops may be requested by the UN, the purpose and function of the United Nations and the purpose and function of our forces within the United Nations can be adequately fulfilled and achieved.  When the Defence (Amendment) Act of 1960 was being introduced in Dáil Éireann the then Taoiseach said at columns <Col N="802" /> 1877-78, Volume 183 of the Official Report of 20th July, 1960:</P>
      <P>It is a weakness in world organisation that their members often tend to be more conscious of the advantages these organisation seem to afford them than of the obligations which membership of them applies.</P>
      <P>At the time when that legislation was introduced in this House, it was regarded by the Members of this House as being a major break through, and I do not think any contribution made on that occasion was more indicative of that attitude than the contribution of the present Tánaiste when he said that it was hundreds of years since an army sponsored by the Irish Government had gone overseas.  The break through was made in 1960.  Indeed, it is fair to say that before that time, even in 1958, we had sent a force of 50 officers to the UN observer group in the Lebanon.  It is important that we recognise what has been achieved by our forces and our policies in the interim period, and also, of course, to recognise the great potential they have in the future.</P>
      <P>One might ask why it is that Ireland should be called upon at this time to play this role.  For an answer to this question one need go no further than to note what the Taoiseach said when this Act was first being passed through this House, at column 1878, Volume 183, of the Official Report of 20th July, 1960:</P>
      <P>The question naturally arises why the Secretary-General should address his request to Ireland rather than to other members of the United Nations which, from many points of view, might be better able to contribute to the United Nations Force than ourselves.  The answer is provided, I believe, by the special position we occupy in relation to world affairs and by the policies we have been able to pursue since we became a member of the United Nations in 1956.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the answer then, and I am glad to say it is the answer now.  I hope it will always continue to be the answer. <Col N="803" /> In so far as the Fianna Fáil Government initiated this trend, we certainly, not just for that reason, but for the obvious reasons behind the Minister's proposal today, are very ready and willing to support it.</P>
    <P>There are, however, some differences in this situation of which the House might take note.  The first difference which arises between the Congo situation at that time which was the purpose behind the Defence (Amendment) Act of that date, and the present situation, is that here we are concerned with an international conflict, one in relation to which the Minister said we must be careful that anything we would say should not in any way inflame the position there. Nonetheless, from the point of view of our troops going there, we have to face the fact that here we are concerned with the situation that a cease fire has been brought about basically through the intervention of two world powers exercising their influence and protecting their interests.  We are very anxious to ensure that the cease fire, brought about for whatever reason, will be maintained but that, even further, it will lead to a permanent and secure peace in that area.</P>
    <P>However, I understand we have a situation in which &mdash;the Minister can elaborate on this in his reply&mdash;the troops will be placing themselves between the combatants prior to the cease fire within almost hundreds of yards of each other.  This is very different from any position in which our troops would have found themselves either in the Congo or subsequently in Cyprus.  It will obviously call for the greatest restraint on the part of our troops and the UN peace keeping force but also for the greatest restraint and guarantees on the part of the combatants and the other nations involved as well.  What can be achieved here can only be achieved through the good will and co-operation of all concerned.  We would like to be assured that our forces there and all the UN forces&mdash;because when we speak of our forces we speak of them as being part of the UN peace-keeping force and not in any narrow <Col N="804" /> national sense&mdash;will be protected and be given guarantees in the performance of their duties to the best possible extent.</P>
    <P>This is a period both of great hope for the Middle East and at the same time a period of great danger both for the Middle East and for the forces giving their services in the cause of peace.  We are, therefore, concerned for the physical protection of our troops who, we hope, will not have to engage, in the defence of peace or otherwise, in any confrontations. We are concerned for the physical protection of all the forces that will be engaged on this very delicate mission.</P>
    <P>There is another factor as well pertaining to our force to which I shall just make a passing reference, as our spokesman on Defence will deal with it in further detail.  The Minister has said it is intended from our point of view to provide in the region of 240 of all ranks of whom approximately one half will be transferred from Cyprus. As I understand it, the individual members of our forces on UN peace-keeping operations are there in a voluntary capacity.  I wonder whether the Minister and his colleague, the Minister for Defence have considered&mdash;I presume and hope they have and if not I would like that they would now consider&mdash;that those who are in Cyprus would be given an opportunity of volunteering for this service and will not be just transferred, without consultation with them, to this new service.  It is service of a different type though service for the same end and the same purpose, the maintenance of world peace and order.  The individuals concerned and their families may be anxious that they would be given the option, as they would be given before signing on for any operation, of accepting or rejecting the opportunity of serving in this particular operation.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, too, the question of Cyprus itself.  I was very gratified, as I am sure so many Members of the House would have been gratified, to hear from time to time from the Turkish Foreign Minister and the Greek Cypriot Foreign Minister at <Col N="805" /> European level, both publicly and privately, of their recognition of the very effective role our troops were playing in the peace-keeping operation in Cyprus, due to the confidence which the people of Cyprus had in them and their tolerance, good humour and understanding.  If it were necessary up to now to maintain the peace-keeping force in Cyprus it is equally necessary to do so now despite the urgent and serious demands which exist for a peace-keeping force in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>We are always ready to meet our responsibilities, but I must ask whether we intend to replace the troops in Cyprus?  Does the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister for Defence have any information to suggest that the position in Cyprus is now such that these troops are not necessary?  We wish to serve the cause of peace where-ever that may be necessary and where-ever the opportunity arises.  We want to help to ease tensions wherever they arise.  It is quite clear that the trends of the world today are such that, no matter where tensions arise or how narrow their base may be initially, somehow the major powers of the world may become involved in a peripheral or indirect way as a matter of status, influence, or determination of their position.</P>
    <P>We must be sure that wherever there are trouble spots internationally our forces and the UN forces in general will be able to head off any possibility of developing friction.  The financing of the UN peace-keeping operation was raised over a considerable period by a former Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Aiken.  To the best of my knowledge there were significant arrears due to the Government here from the United Nations Peace-Keeping Operations Fund. There were significant arrears to that fund which were due from some of the major powers who were indirectly involved in bringing about the situation which led to the cease-fire in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>If we want to maintain a situation where the UN can function effectively and promptly we must, particularly in times of peace and not just in times of crisis, ensure that the <Col N="806" /> machinery will exist to finance peace-keeping operations when the occasion arises.  Every member of the Security Council representing the major powers should honour their commitments and obligations by, as the Taoiseach of the time said, contributing to the peace-keeping operations of the UN.  This might be an appropriate time to raise this question again because some of those who have been constantly in arrears are fairly actively concerned with the Middle East situation.  It is interesting to note how times have changed. Deputy Corish said, when speaking on this subject on an earlier occasion, that we might consider sending someone outside the Army to keep an eye on the situation to see that our volunteers were not involved in something in which they should not be involved. Time and events have since proved that no such suggestion was necessary. Our Army are trained and equipped to discharge their functions without being overseen by anyone outside the Army.  Events have proved that they, in conjunction with their colleagues, whether in the Congo, Cyprus or the Middle East, have discharged their responsibilities to the UN and have played a very significant part in bringing about peace in these areas. They helped to ease world tensions in the long run.</P>
    <P>There is a broader side to this conflict. I do not intend to discuss it in detail.  I intend to recognise the limits on our political involvement or influence in the Middle East situation. Nevertheless it must be said that for many years now there has been a constant problem in the Middle East, not just for the nations concerned but for others.  There has been misery and suffering, which we recognise now to be part of our misery and suffering insofar as nations now have a greater understanding of their brotherhood with each other than they had 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>Had the moneys provided by the great powers in supporting the military activities of recent weeks been provided for the purpose of bringing about a peaceful resolution of the Middle East situation, how much further would we have come on the road to a permanent <Col N="807" /> and just peace in that area, even allowing for the complexities of the problem.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs of a previous Government, Mr. Aiken, suggested at the UN on many occasions that it was necessary to set up a compensation fund for the Arabs who had been deprived of their lands. This money should provide, where possible, for the restoration of their lands. Full compensation and an opportunity to set up elsewhere with capital amounting to $1,000 per head was suggested in 1958.  That is 15 years ago.  It was suggested that the great powers should help those who suffered, perticularly in the Middle East and Israel. Israel was born out of disaster, persecution and suffering.  We recognise the sufferings of the people there during their lifetime.  Their numbers were increased by the persecution of other nations in Europe during the Second World War.  The suggestion of help to those who suffered is still there but has not yet been taken up by the major powers.  The suggestion has not been promoted to the extent one would have hoped for.</P>
    <P>Where one reads the debates of 1958 one senses the feeling and hope that the problem of the Middle East would be solved and that it was necessary to solve it within the foreseeable future, speaking as of that time.  Now, 15 years later, we are still in the same situation. One has the impression that the European nations, recognising the limitations set on them, are looking to their own national interests rather than to the contribution which they can make to effective and permanent peace in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the complexity of the position.  It is strange that it was due to the nuclear alert of the United States and to the possible confrontation between that Power and Russia that the cease fire came about.  Other nations who might not be directly concerned might have played, not just in the last few weeks or months but in the intervening years, a much more effective role in bringing about a situation which would have helped to head off these developments.  We are in a position of relative peace and ease <Col N="808" /> arising out of what might have been an international conflict of major proportions. It is time that we, small as we are, made it clear that our existence and the existence of peoples all over the world can be compromised and put at issue by the power play of the major nations with their nuclear armaments and power.  As long as this situation is allowed to continue we will be dependent on the reactions of the powerful nations and, in particular, on individuals in positions of power in those nations.</P>
    <P>We must lead a movement for peace in the United Nations to ensure, as was done by a former Minister, Mr. Aiken, the control of the spread of nuclear weapons and armaments and, to go on from there, the reduction of the stockpile of nuclear weapons with a view to destroying or effectively putting an end to the threat of nuclear war which hangs over every one of us every day of our lives. This is not a situation in which young people can grow up in peace and security.  We want to make a contribution to world peace and understanding. The result of this situation is that it has brought about a cease fire.  I should not like to think that we would have to go to the brink on any future occasion to ensure world peace.</P>
    <P>We may be small, but I believe our view of the role we play in world peace through the United Nations is repeated by every small nation seeking peace throughout the world.  Since our force is one of those to be called upon on this occasion, as it has in the past and will in the future, and since we are one of the non-aligned nations who can speak with independence and confidence about our position and world peace and security, we must make it quite clear that, while we may not have strength of arms behind us, we certainly have the strength of justice.  We must ensure through international co-operation, and particularly through the United Nations, that those situations can be prevented and world peace guaranteed.</P>
    <P>I welcome this opportunity and am confident that our forces will play an <Col N="809" /> effective role in peace keeping in the troubled areas.  We, on this side of the House, will support this motion and any further motion the Minister may feel necessary to introduce to the House from time to time to fulfil our role in the cause of international peace and security.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ConorCruiseOBrien" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien) Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Dr. Cruise-O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to intervene very briefly in this debate.  My own past experience of what is involved in peace-keeping operations makes me very anxious that there should be no misunderstanding as to the risks involved in a peace-keeping operation.  I would hope that there is no misunderstanding among the powers who set up this peace-keeping emergency force&mdash;but we cannot determine that here&mdash;or by the Members of this House or among the people of this country about this.</P>
      <P>I am speaking in support of this motion, which I hope will be carried unanimously.  I should like everybody to be clear on the fact that this is not a no-risk operation.  Deputy O'Kennedy spoke of the need to ensure the physical protection of the force and of the Irish contingent in it.  We all hope that their will not be in danger and they will not come under fire; but if they do and something goes wrong, there is no one who can afford them physical protection.</P>
      <P>Brave men, tested in similar conditions elsewhere, go there to provide protection for others.  There is no one, but no one, who can protect them.  We should be clear about this. If there is anyone here who feels that this risk should be run, let him say so.  Let no one come back afterwards in other circumstances and say that these men should not have been risked.  I said this was not a no-risk operation but I do not want to suggest that these risks are excessive for the great purpose of maintaining the peace and giving an opportunity for lasting peace to be restored in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some ways this particular peace-keeping operation starts with happier auguries than any other in the past. <Col N="810" /> As compared with the previous United Nations Expeditionary Force in the Middle East, this is one which is based on a Security Council decision and therefore, has a higher status in international law.  This is a point in its favour.  You may say that the United Nations operation in the Congo also started out as a Security Council decision, but it then ran into difficulties because of the failure of consensus and, a division of opinion among the great powers.  There is reason for better hope now.  The Congo operation took place in &ldquo;cold war&rdquo; conditions and before the existing <i>détente</i> between the great powers. This is the first <i>post-détente</i> Security Council operation.  These are good auguries.  As quoted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the points made by the Secretary-General in his interpretation of this are valid.</P>
    <P>It remains true however that we are taking a risk.  Those who go into this with their eyes open are also taking a risk.  It is our duty to those concerned and the people who elected us to make that explicit here.  The fact that it is a peace-keeping operation does not mean that it will always be taking place in peaceful conditions.  In his speech Deputy O'Kennedy rightly underlined that fact and it is undoubtedly true.  The force would be in great difficulties if war were to break out again because they would have to be got out and there would be risks involved.  If concensus broke down in the Security Council the whole matter would have to be looked at again.  We hope none of those things will happen and there are good auguries for such hope.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude on an optimistic note.  We are sending them in hope but not closing our eyes to the risks involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully subscribe to the views expressed concerning the honour that the request for Irish troops to go into this troubled spot bestows on our Defence Forces. While I have no doubt that they have earned a reputation which would make them acceptable in any trouble spot throughout the world I cannot but think at the same time that it is <Col N="811" /> a bit of a horse laugh to see our Government and our Defence Forces seeking to create peace where there is trouble throughout the world while here in our own country we do not seem able to do anything about it or even to be trying very hard and, if we are, we appear to be trying in the wrong way.</P>
      <P>I also suggest that in this exercise the Minister for Foreign Affairs should take whatever steps he can to ensure that those who do not know the score here in our country are not misled by the presence of our troops in this new trouble spot into believing that we have no trouble at home that we might need help to solve.  If at all possible he should try to get the UN more interested than they appear to be in our problem here.  We seem to be very fine members of the UN when something is required of us but when we have required something of that body the goods do not seem to be delivered. Perhaps this new demand on our resources, whereby we are sending a voluntary force into a very troubled area, should be an occasion when we should underline to the UN that we have problems and that there are very few outside this land caring, doing or prepared to do anything about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest also that in the Minister's contacts with the two major powers who have intervened and acted so quickly in this dispute he should realise that if they could be induced to utilise their colossal influence they could bring a peaceful end to our problem here in a very short time. This occasion might be used to get across that point of view.  As regards what the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs said, I could not agree more in that our troops in going to the Middle East are not having a picnic outing and that there are very definite and grave dangers that they will run into trouble.  It is wise to put that before the House in terms as specific as those used by the Minister.  The House in agreeing to this measure&mdash; as I am sure they will&mdash;will be doing so without any illusions that it is a picnic or that there are no dangers. <Col N="812" /> The dangers are there and will remain for some time and although we all hope it will not happen, anything can happen.  We hope our peace keeping force will return with their mission accomplished in a fairly short time.</P>
    <P>Overall, I think the exercise is good for the morale of the Army.  This type of exercise, since we first began to participate in it, has raised the morale of the Defence Forces and the more frequently and pressingly our forces are requested for those delicate tasks the more it becomes clear to members of the Defence Force that they have been doing a good job and, perhaps, through experience have learned to do it even better now than they did initially.  In the long term it is good for us to be able to say that to the extent that we have resources of this type at our disposal we have played our part. Yet, I cannot but feel with many of those who know the situation in this country that it is rather queer that we seem to be able to help quite substantially despite our small size in settling the problems of other nations in any part of the globe and yet we seem unable to perform this service for ourselves nor do we seem to get much sympathy or thought from the other powers of the great United Nations who seem to be able to act if the situation is grave enough and represents a threat to the greater powers or threatens to lead to a major conflagration. I think the smaller members of the UN are used to run errands when required by the big powers but if these small powers want something themselves as we do&mdash; peace in this land&mdash;very little can be expected from the big powers. We have learned that in recent years. While I agree with sending our troops as proposed, I do so not forgetting that we are leaving our own problem unresolved.  It is a burning problem and in relation to the size of our community it is, perhaps, as great a problem as the one we now propose to try to alleviate in the Middle East.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJVMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that we have time to discuss this motion.  I can appreciate the efforts required on the part of the Minister to bring it to the <Col N="813" /> House in a hurry.  It was only on 25th October that the United Nations Security Council passed the resolution and here we have this very important motion just a few days later.  I and my colleague Deputy O'Kennedy will agree that we should send those troops on this peace-keeping mission.  We are well aware, as others have said, that there are risks involved and we know that our troops in this mission will be exposed to very great dangers which may lead to loss of life or permanent injury. Nobody here is under any illusion as to what is at stake.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I think there is a little confusion about the motion and I should like the Minister for Foreign Affairs when replying to clarify the matter.  I may be critical but it is constructive criticism.  I see, according to the motion that the force has been established by the Security Council of the UN for the performance of duties of a police character. Further on I see that the Secretary General has stipulated three essential conditions to enable the force to carry out these tasks effectively&mdash;first, that the force will have at all times the full confidence and backing of the Security Council; secondly, that it must operate with the full co-operation of the parties concerned and thirdly, it must be able to function as an integrated and efficient military unit.  I think this is a little confusing but no doubt the Minister will be able to clarify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Later on I note that the Secretary General has stipulated that the force shall be provided with weapons of a defensive character only and that self-defence will include resistance to attempts by forceful means to prevent it from discharging its duties under the mandate of the Security Council.  I think there is something contradictory in those statements and I say this because it is only fair when our forces are going there that whoever is in command should know what it is all about and what he has to do.  Like the other speakers, I am well aware that we as a nation are playing more than our part in trying to promote peace in the world.  We send troops or observers to many parts of the globe; we have lost men in foreign <Col N="814" /> fields.  That was very sad for us but we and our men have gained a reputation of honesty and impartiality and our troops have been most efficient and have been welcome wherever they have been.  That can be said truthfully, no matter where an Irish peace keeping force has operated.</P>
    <P>It is sad that some of the bigger members States of the United Nations will not send their forces or, should I say, that their forces are not acceptable to both sides in the present dispute. That is the kernel of the matter. Our troops will be joining troops from Finland, Austria and other small nations.  The non-aligned countries are being asked to carry out many peace keeping duties.  This seems unfair. Small countries are being asked to carry a burden which is out of proportion to their population and their military strength.  Domestic matters may arise which will not allow them to play that role forever.  The United Nations should be well aware that the small nations cannot forever bear the burden the bigger nations should be bearing.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy said that the United Nations were in arrears in paying money to the nations who provided soldiers and observers for peace-keeping duties.  I hope the Minister will bring us up to date on that position. We are all anxious to hear what he will have to say about it.  The Minister told us that 250 men of all ranks will be going and that approximately half of them will be transferred from Cyprus.  I understand that when men were being recruited for the Cyprus operation it was on a voluntary basis.  They volunteered and there was not much trouble in filling the contingents.  I should like the Minister to state whether that is the position at the moment.  No doubt the motion before the House will be passed unanimously but I should like to know are men still volunteering for this service.  There will be a strain on our Defence Forces on the home front. The Minister stated that the strength of the Army at the end of June had not increased over the previous three or four months.  Since we are sending out extra troops, we will be put to the <Col N="815" /> pin of our collar with regard to security.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy O'Kennedy, I should like to inquire who will be taking the place of the Irish troops in Cyprus. They did a good job and they were very welcome.  They were very successful. Is there any danger that the troops who will replace them, and who will be coming from other nations, might upset the balance within that island?  Everybody must realise that it was the success of our troops and those of other nations which made peace possible in that Island.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of the safety of our men when they are deployed in the Middle East.  I do not know where they will be going.  I suppose it will be wherever the Commander-in-Chief thinks fit to send them.  I have no doubt that the Government are as concerned as I am to see to it that our personnel will be well looked after.  It is vital that supplies will be kept up.  There has been some talk&mdash;I do not know where it came from&mdash;to the effect that it will not be easy to send supplies to those troops in the event of hostilities breaking out again, even in a localised way.</P>
    <P>If some great power&mdash;as happened before&mdash;starts to arm either side or both sides, what happens?  In the recent conflict millions of pounds were spent on providing arms and military material, ground to air missiles and air to air missiles, for both sides.  That was very sad.  Was any guarantee given to the United Nations by the USA and the Soviet Union that that would not happen again?  If they again start to provide arms to both sides, we should have a hard look at what role our peace-keeping forces should play.  If the Minister becomes aware that both sides are arming for another battle, he should come back to the Dáil for a further discussion on what our role in the Middle East should be.  Everybody knows that the peace will have to be kept for two or three years until they are ready to have another &ldquo;go&rdquo; at each other.  Our men would then be caught in the middle and it would be very hard to get them out.  I have no <Col N="816" /> doubt that the Minister and the Government are as concerned about that as I am.</P>
    <P>Like the Minister, I could not praise our Army too much for the excellent way in which they behaved in the various fields to which they were sent. They established themselves as a highly trained force, very efficient and impartial.  Our party will give consent to this motion.  We are well aware that many risks are involved.  We are depending on the Government to take every precaution to safeguard our personnel. If the Government want extra legislation to safeguard our troops, we will be only too glad to come back to the House to discuss it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickSDonegan" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan) Patrick S. Donegan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Donegan)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great honour that we should be asked to send our troops to take part in this great work of charity.  The horrible things which have happened have been encouraged if not motivated by other forces larger than ours.  It says something for our Irish heritage and for our position internationally that we are acceptable to both sides.  That holds good for other small nations such as Denmark, Finland, Sweden and Austria.  There are Canadian troops in Cyprus.  There are also observers from other countries.</P>
      <P>Last week was quite tumultuous so far as the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs were concerned because, when hostilities looked like ceasing, the question arose as to how peace keeping could be achieved, and how observers could be provided.  The first request received was for nine officers.  The Government acceded immediately to that request. Those nine officers have been selected and, so far as I know, are at the moment almost finished with their medical and other tests and will be going out within the next few days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then there was the request that our troops in Cyprus be transferred to the Middle East.  After consideration of the request it was decided that, in order that our international obligations be met and our high reputation preserved, the request should be complied with.  At that stage it was pointed out that the number that would leave Cyprus would <Col N="817" /> be about 125.  It is not possible to be specific on the number because a small number must remain behind to carry out such duties as looking after equipment. Attention was then drawn to the fact that this was not even a lieutenantcolonel's command and a request was made that we provide about another 100 men.</P>
    <P>At present our own security duties are heavy.  We must ensure that subversives of all kinds will not continue with the activities that have resulted in almost 900 people being killed during the past four years.  Therefore, we have to consider this request very seriously but the concensus of opinion in the Government was that, notwithstanding our heavy commitments at home, Ireland should again carry her head high and that we should provide these extra men.</P>
    <P>Only this evening I received from the Chief-of-Staff the present proposal, that is, that we would increase the 25th Infantry Group by 131, that the additional company would be 93 and the extra HQ personnel would be 38.  I presume that would include the nine officers.  There are other people, such as doctors and technical staff, who were not taken into consideration in the first appraisal of the situation.  It is necessary that the group should be self-contained, that they would be able to look after themselves medically, technically and in every other way.  They are not going on a picnic.  The military authorities are carrying out their responsibility to the letter of the law to ensure that our men are provided with the very best that it is possible to provide for them.</P>
    <P>It has been pointed out in the House that at some stage the men could experience difficulties in obtaining food. Of course, it will not be all fun and games for them.  However, the Army are to be congratulated when one considers that the earliest departure date was Monday, November 5th.  The actual date will be determined by medical process.  Five days is the minimum required and that is contigent on all the people having had overseas service within the past three years. Therefore, the date, November 5th, may be extended by a few days; but in <Col N="818" /> the case of the specialists who must go and who have increased in number, as I have indicated, the medical process will take 14 days.</P>
    <P>I wish to accentuate that this is not a matter merely of another 131 men. These men must be taken from their various commands.  We must choose the young and the fit, people who would be able to endure the climate of the Middle East both in winter and in summer.  I spent a period of six weeks in that area at one stage and I can tell the House that the climate is not very nice.  We must decide whether the men are fit physically for the arduous duties that will be required of them.  We must replace them at home but we must ensure that we send a contingent of young men of whom we can be proud and whom the UN will be glad to have.  The assignment is a difficult one.</P>
    <P>During the past week I have been engaged in the discussions relating to the duties that may be required of the men and I have been advised by senior staff officers of the Army, each of whom has served either in the Middle East, in the Congo or in Cyprus, of what will be involved.  It may transpire that our men will be the jam in the sandwich, that is, that they may find themselves in a situation where the Arabs are half a mile away on the one side and the Israelis on the other side.  Our men may be popular when then arrive; they may be popular a year later or they may be very unpopular. However that is something that will be dictated not by them, not by the diligence with which they perfrom their duties, not by how friendly they may be with the people concerned, but by how politics move in the Middle East and by the light in which the Israelis and the Arabs view their presence.  Each may see them as a body helping the other side.</P>
    <P>As has been recalled, the Niemba ambush resulted in Irish blood being left on foreign shores.  In this instance, too, our boys are undertaking a serious task.  The decision to send them was a serious one; but, now that that decision has been taken, we must back them with all the help that they <Col N="819" /> need.  Most of the equipment they require will be provided by the UN.  I assure the House that, so far as I am concerned, I will keep as close a contact as possible, through my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and directly in the military sense, if necessary, to ensure that the Irish contingent are well serviced.  I know that the other side of the House are with me in this regard.</P>
    <P>I move now to a pleasant feature of this matter, that is, the fact that two colonels of our Army have been placed in extremely important positions in the Middle East.  Colonel Paddy Hogan is second-in-command to General Siilasvuo, the Finnish general who is Chief-of-Staff there, that is, he is in command of the entire force there.  It must be remembered that there are two types of force.  The first request we received was for nine officers for UNTSO, which is mainly an unarmed force of officers whose duty it is to observe a truce that may exist in any part of the world.  Where a breach of a truce is seen or, in their opinion, has occurred, they report such breach to the UN so that a more serious breach or major hostilities could be prevented at source and negotiations begun immediately.</P>
    <P>Colonel Bunworth is acting head of UNTSO in the whole of that war-torn region.  I cannot tell the House at this stage what is the position in relation to General Siilasvuo and Colonel Bunworth, but it is satisfactory to know that two of the most senior appointments have been given to Irishmen and that they have been given them because of their good service in that region.</P>
    <P>I have been asked what is the position in relation to volunteers.  In relation to the first request for officers I can assure the House that almost every young man, married or single, wished to be sent to the Middle East. What happened was that the OCs of the various commands put forward six names.  Twenty-four people were short-listed and of these nine have been selected by the military authorities. <Col N="820" /> I presume that manner of selection was as good as any other.</P>
    <P>The position in relation to the men who are in Cyprus is that those who joined the force before 1966 have the right to opt out if they do not wish to volunteer, while those who joined after that year can be sent anywhere under the terms of their admission to the Army, but at no time has anybody wanted to get out of it.  They are a devoted body of men who act as a unit.  They joined up as soldiers. They took an oath.  A lot of the time being a soldier entails watchful waiting, but when the opportunity arrives, when, shall we say, the chance is presented for him to be a real soldier, a member of our Army will take it.  I have the utmost confidence that that will occur in every case.  All of our troops in Cyprus have signed agreements. They can be transferred, but the legal position is pre-1966.  They would be in a different position if they had not signed their agreements.</P>
    <P>I must at this point call attention to the fact that our Army is under-established and that we are to begin a heavy recruitment compaign almost immediately.  I intend to say in another place, and I say it now in the House, that the removal from here of 300 officers and men has a much greater effect on us than the proportion of 300 to 11,000 would seem to represent.  When those men come back they will have one month in which they can be put into their various commands again, to be reassimilated, before they are ready again for the Border duties which are so important.  The Government, with the full co-operation and support of the Opposition, had to take the decision to put Ireland's head high abroad by placing our troops in foreign services so that our reputation abroad would be preserved, and I do not think anybody will object to my asking in the House to join with the Government in asking for replacements in the Army.</P>
    <P>The opportunities are good and I try my best, and will continue to do so, to improve them.  Our men at the moment are serving as long as 100 hours per week, even though for 35 <Col N="821" /> hours of that they may be in barracks waiting for a call.  Still, they are far from their wives, families or sweethearts. This is a disincentive for them at the end of three years to rejoin, and we are now looking for replacements if for no other reason than to ensure that those now in the Army will not be asked to serve further extra hours, may I say without overtime. Then, perhaps in months or a year or one and a half years those young men will have reached a point where they can join those honoured men now in the service of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiBrugha" hpid="Ruairí Brugha Ruairí Brugha">
      <NameTxt>Ruairí Brugha</NameTxt>
      <P>All will agree with the plea of the Minister for Defence for replacements for the troops who will be leaving.  It is appropriate to say a few words on an occasion like this, even though they will have to be careful words.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be replying to some points made by Deputy Meaney. I agree that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was quite right to point out that the troops we are asking to go to the Middle East will not be going into a situation such as that which exists in Cyprus.  There is more than that involved and it is important that they should go as volunteers, as did all our troops who went abroad.</P>
      <P>One Deputy queried the apparent inconsistency of our sending troops abroad when we have our own problems. That is a valid point.  It appears to be an inconsistency, but this is not the place in which to engage in a debate on that issue.  I hope that at some stage we will have reached a quieter situation in which the problems referred to by that Deputy can be fully discussed here.  Nevertheless, I think one can say, bearing in mind that there is little or nothing that can be done by way of use of troops in the area of our country in which there is difficulty, that it is very much to our credit that over the years a small country like this, which has had its very difficult, almost impossible, national problems, has been and is now contributing to peace keeping efforts in different parts of the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been made of the point that the UN, or perhaps some of the <Col N="822" /> major powers in that organisation, have not taken greater interest in our problems here.  The UN are precluded from doing so by what is called international law.  Nevertheless, it is a good thing that a small nation like this, despite the disinterest of the major foreign powers in our problems, is still prepared to make its contribution in difficult world situations.  I do not think it is any harm to speak out at a time such as this, when we have been asked by the Security Council to make this contribution.  A small nation should be able to speak independently and constructively about the rather frightening play of power politics among the major powers which we have seen in relation to this area of strife in the Middle East during the past 15 years.  These powers, as has been said, have been engaged in supplying arms to both sides, not in the interests of any fundamental rights but because of their own involvements in power politics.</P>
    <P>There is not a lot small nations can do but those nations which apparently qualify only because they are not involved in major power politics&mdash;independent nations&mdash;should in the near future make their voices heard more strongly in pointing out the fright and the fear that is being caused by games of power politics among the major world powers.  Perhaps a little telling-off of this kind would be listened to.  In any case it would not do any harm.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Minister for Defence, said that this is a great honour for our country, but it is not entirely an honour so much as an obligation.  I would not mind pointing out to some of these powers that there are very few independents available because of their various influences.  These powers should be told that they are in a pretty bad way when they have to come to a small independent nation of this kind looking for forces to contribute to peace when they could themselves make major contributions to peace if they made up their minds to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a good thing to see that we have 100 per cent of a goodwill send off for our contingent. With a great sense of pride I noted <Col N="823" /> the tributes paid by Members of this House to the members of the Defence Forces who for many years have played an important part in peace keeping duties throughout the world. In that troubled land they are going to throw oil on the troubled waters and I hope they will be very successful.</P>
      <P>I am aware that oil has been thrown on the fires burning in these lands by the bigger nations.  It may be that it is sensible to have a smaller nation, who knows what it is to have suffered, involved in such peace keeping operations. The remark by Deputy Blaney that this Government is doing nothing in its own country for peace is regrettable. In this regard I would suggest that Deputy Blaney examine his own conscience.</P>
      <P>I hope, and pray, that we will not have a shot fired in anger by our own Army, that they will continue with the good work they have done in the past, bring honour and glory to this country and bring peace and goodwill to the land that once gave us those words.  I hope they will be successful in bringing peace and goodwill between all men and all nations and I hope that will apply to our own country very soon.</P>

It was very nice to hear the obvious concern being expressed by all Members of the House for their welfare, especially the concern expressed by our Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Defence and Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is significant to note that our Army has been acceptable to take part in this very important and, perhaps crucial area at the same time other members of the European Community have not fared so well&mdash;indeed sanctions have been taken out against them almost.  Since our country, under the present leadership, have embarked on a positive and dynamic outward looking policy we are happy to see the reaction and the effect this <Col N="824" /> is having.  I should like to compliment the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the way he has consistently portrayed our country in Europe and in the United Nations.  It is not only to his credit but to the credit of those who before him embarked on this same type of policy.  In this way our country can regain a good name and show that we are capable of playing a fuller and better role in international politics.  I want to support the Minister in the arduous work he is doing and wish him every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald) Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Dr. FitzGerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Brugha when he said that it was not just an honour but an obligation for us to assist in this matter struck the right note.  It is an obligation and one that we recognise to be such.  It is not merely a general obligation&mdash;if asked, one obviously wants to help.  It is even more than that because the position in the Middle East is such that the number of countries available and acceptable to assist is remarkably few and this is now posing a problem.  By mutual agreement the great powers, the permanent members of the Security Council, are at this stage regarded as being out of court for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Because of doubts amongst the different alliances in Europe about each other, members of these alliances are mutually unacceptable at this point in time.  The Middle East affair has aroused such partisanship in many other parts of the world that many other countries are so identified with one or other protagonist&mdash;rather more with one than the other numerically&mdash; that to define countries whose forces would be acceptable to both sides is in this instance quite strikingly difficult. It is the recognition of this fact, as well as a sense of the honour paid to us, that has made it necessary for this Government to take this matter very seriously and try to meet this obligation.  It has not been easy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The original request was for nine officers and that was met.  The Minister for Defence has said that he was then asked to transfer the Cyprus force and this was agreed to very rapidly.  Then we were asked to reinforce <Col N="825" /> this and to virtually double its strength.  That, of course, poses a problem because it involves reduction in the available strength at home and we had to consider that very seriously.  Indeed, it was not without very careful thought that we agreed in view of the pressure we were under. One Deputy spoke about the Army being at the pin of its collar to do the work it has to do at the present and that is a very fair expression.</P>
    <P>In normal circumstances and had there not been this very particular problem we would not easily have agreed to transfer forces in this country at this time, but given the fact that so few countries are in a position to help we had no alternative but to do what we could even if this puts our own domestic situation under strain.  The Minister for Defence has said that he intends to initiate a recruiting campaign, which, I think, was due in any event, but it is all the more necessary now.  I hope, as the Minister indicated, it will be all the more successful perhaps, in view of the attention drawn to the Irish Army and its role by what is now happening.</P>
    <P>It is important that we succeed.  We have a problem at home of a kind which the other participants in this force do not have and it is not easy for us to meet the dual demands of our own domestic security and our international role which the particular circumstances of the case have devolved upon us somewhat unexpectedly and in a way that we cannot resist.</P>
    <P>Deputies have made several comments on the role of the super powers in this area.  Deputy O'Kennedy said that perhaps if the money spent in supplying arms had been spent in other ways the crisis might not have arisen.  That is a point of view that could well be true.  Another Deputy raised the question of whether these super powers are going to continue supplying arms to the participants thereby potentially increasing the danger to the United Nations force. That is a very fair question.  I cannot, at this moment, assure him that there is any guarantee that it will not happen. It will certainly be the purpose of our <Col N="826" /> Government to try to prevent that happening.  Any efforts we have made &mdash;and we have been concerned to do what we can throughout the past month&mdash;have been in that direction. There will now be another incentive to reinforce them in view of the increasing danger that will arise if more arms are poured into the area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Meaney raised that point, one which I consider to be a very fair point and one which is very much in my mind.</P>
    <P>The question of the danger to our forces has been mentioned.  The Minister for Posts and Telegraphs was concerned least the particular mode of expression of Deputy O'Kennedy would suggest that he felt there was some way in which we could offer a guarantee that they would not be in danger.  I hope this was not Deputy O'Kennedy's intention.  Indeed, Deputy Meaney went on to stress that they would be, in fact, in very great danger.</P>
    <P>We can offer no guarantee on this point.  They are separating two very large armies which have already come into conflict in major wars on four occasions and have had on other occasions been involved in minor conflicts along the border.  All we can do is to help to create the conditions internationally propitious for negotiations and likely to lead to a reduction in tension.  Our diplomatic efforts will be directed towards that.  However, there can be no guarantee of the safety of our force which is going to be, in a sense, pinned down between two such combatants with their long tradition of repeated conflict.</P>
    <P>As the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs so rightly said, no one should have any illusions on this point.  Deputy Meaney made the position of the Opposition clear on that and we are agreed in recognising the danger but realise we have an obligation to accept that danger.  The troops concerned will be those who volunteered for overseas service and, in the circumstances, that is important.</P>
    <P>I was asked what troops would replace them in Cyprus.  We are not at the moment in a position to say what troops would replace them, although it is the intention of the Secretary-General <Col N="827" /> that they will be replaced in Cyprus.  I can only add to that that the Greek, Turkish and Cypriot Governments have agreed to our troops being transferred.  Our troops have been extraordinarily acceptable in Cyprus.  The work they have done has endeared them to the two communities in the difficult situation in which they find themselves.  The Cypriot, Greek and Turkish Governments recognised there was a particular need for our forces there but perhaps it may be somewhat easier to find alternative forces in Cyprus than in the even more controversial area of the Middle East. However, we have no information at the moment about the troops who will replace our soldiers.  Immediately, I think they will be replaced by the remaining forces in Cyprus extending their area of activity temporarily, pending the transfer of other forces.</P>
    <P>I was asked about the question of arrears.  There has always been a problem of arrears of payment to us in respect of Cyprus due to the way that operation is organised.  However, that will not arise in this case because what we have here is an operation that is part of the normal expenditure of the United Nations and we should not face a problem in this case as we faced in Cyprus.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to elaborate on the problems of the arrears regarding Cyprus due to the way that operation is organised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="Dr. FitzGerald Dr. FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure I can elaborate on it in great detail from my recollection at the moment.  I was not briefed to talk about Cyprus in this debate.  As a former Minister, the Deputy will know that there has been a problem here in the past and that the particular resolutions under which the Cyprus operation was organised are such that there is not an accepted obligation for it to be financed as a normal UN activity.  This has meant that the operation has depended on voluntary contributions which have not always come.  The arrears are not very serious at this time, but there always is an arrears situation.  It is my understanding that the Middle East operation <Col N="828" /> is quite different, organised as it is under the Security Council and as part of normal UN activities.  For that reason we should not face the problem of arrears.  I cannot develop it further. If the Deputy would like more details of the arrears problem perhaps he would put down a question and, given due notice, I shall be glad to enlighten him further.</P>
      <P>Deputy Meaney raised a question of the different terms used for police activities, military units, and self defence.  It is quite understandable he should raise a question here.  The position is that UN operations are regarded as police operations because they are policing situations with a view to preserving the peace.  They are not military operations in the sense of setting out to conquer territory or to defeat another army.  They are police operations carried out by military units, as is the case, less happily, in Northern Ireland.  Obviously, police duties can be carried out by military units, and we ourselves are using military units to reinforce and assist in police activities in this country.  There is not any contradiction here.  The police activities refer to the nature of the objectives and the aims of the United Nations.  The force is policing a cease fire with military units who will only engage in military activity in self-defence or in defence of the operation they are carrying out.  I hope I have satisfied Deputy Meaney on this point.</P>

      <P>Obviously in this case the police activities involve policing a cease fire between two armies.  I did not intend my analogy to be a full one but only to say that the mere fact that an army is involved does not mean it cannot be engaged in policing activities of one kind or another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. FitzGerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  Perhaps the analogy was a badly drawn one.  The question of volunteers has been dealt with by the Minister for Defence. <Col N="829" /> Deputy Meaney referred to the problem of the static size of the Army.  The Minister dealt with that by referring to the imminent recruitment campaign, which I hope will solve that problem to a considerable degree.</P>
      <P>Deputy Blaney raised other issues not really proper to this debate.  I would only say that this Government have been concerned to ensure that the attention of other governments with whom we have friendly relations is drawn to the situation in Northern Ireland.  We have taken every opportunity, and we have gone out of our way, to seek opportunities, to explain the position to other countries with which we have diplomatic relations. We have ensured that the United Nations, through the speech I made there, are aware of the situation and in our contacts with the UN secretariat we have made sure they understand the position here.  We do not seek at this moment UN intervention in a situation of which there are some hopes of solving by negotiations between the different interests in the country, negotiations involving the United Kingdom Government.  However, so long as the situation persists and is not resolved, one can never exclude the possibility of the situation arising in which assistance might be called for from other countries.  That is why we keep in close touch with them and keep them fully informed. That is why in the last sentence of my UN speech I made it clear we do not close off that possibility because it is something that could happen.  We hope it never will arise, we pray it will never happen, but we have not excluded it.  In replying to Deputy Blaney, I would not want in this debate to go beyond those few comments which I think are appropriate.</P>

      <P>The United Nations have a very good record of going to great lengths to protect the <Col N="830" /> forces operating on their behalf.  I do not think we have any fears there will be any lack of concern on the part of the Secretary General of the United Nations or the officials under him so far as that is concerned.  All that can be done will be done.  It is a question of trying to reduce the tension so that the dangers are minimised by getting back to a normal situation and by moving towards peace in the area which, hopefully, will make it possible for this force to be withdrawn completely.</P>

      <P>Tairgim: &ldquo;Go leifear an Bille an Dara hUair anois.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Is é cuspóir an Bhille a shocrú go mbeidh feasta ag foirmeacha Gaeilge logainmneacha na hÉireann an seasamh céanna sa dlí atá anois ag na foirmeacha Béarla atá in úsáid go h-oifigiúil.</P>
      <P>Dá n-úsáidfí anois logainm Gaeilge i reacht nó in aon cháipéis dlí, ní bheadh aon chinnteacht ann caidé an réim thíre a bheadh i gceist, mar d'fhéadfadh go mbeadh leaganacha eile Gaeilge in úsáid don réim chéanna nó an t-ainm céanna do réimeanna eile.  Ní cosúil gur ghá d'aon chúirt na logainmneacha Gaeilge a aithint.</P>
      <P>Mar réiteach ar an deacracht sin, bhéarfaidh an Bille seo cumhacht don Aire Airgeadais, tar éis dó comhairle a fháil ón Choimisiún Logainmneacha, ordú nó orduithe a dhéanamh ag sonrú foirmeacha Gaeilge na logainm lena n-úsáid chun críocha dlí.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ceapadh an Coimisiún Logainmneacha trí bharántas an Aire Airgeadais dár dháta 24 Deireadh Fómhair, 1946, chun logainmneacha na hÉireann a scrúdú agus chun liostaí de na logainmneacha sin ina bhfoirm Ghaeilge a ullmhú le foilsiú <Col N="831" /> agus le húsáid go hoifigiúil.  Sa bhliain 1955 socraíodh gur i gcumas comhairlitheach, faoi Oifig na Suirbhéireachta Ordanáis, a d'oibreodh an coimisiún feasta, agus sa bhliain 1957 ceapadh foireann taighde logainmneacha sa tSuirbhéireacht Ordanáis.  Ón am sin i leith, tugann an coimisiún comhairle faoi logainmneacha Gaeilge na tíre, an chomhairle sin bunaithe ar an taighde a rinne an fhoireann logainmneacha. Tá comhairle tugtha cheana féin ag an gcoimisiún faoi ainmneacha Gaeilge na bpostbhailte ar fad &mdash;clúdaíonn na postbhailte gach cathair, baile mór agus sráidbhaile sa tír.</P>
    <P>Tugann alt 2 cumhacht don Aire ordú logainmneacha a dhéanamh ag sonrú na bhfoirmeacha dlíthiúla Gaeilge de logainmneacha.  Beidh cumhacht aige ordú den sórt sin a leasú nó a chúlghairm, ach ní mheastar go mbeidh gá leis an gcumhacht sin ach go fíorannamh.  Leagfar gach ordú faoi bhráid Tithe an Oireachtais agus beidh cumhacht acu sin iad a chur ar neamhní taobh istigh de thréimhse áirithe.</P>
    <P>Tugann alt 3 seasamh i ndoiciméid dlíthiúla do na foirmeacha Gaeilge a bheas ordaithe ag an Aire.</P>
    <P>Ní dhéanann an Bille aon athrú ar sheasamh ná ar úsáid na logainmneacha Béarla.  I gcás logainmneacha Gaeilge a bhfuil feidhm dlí acu faoi achtachán eile, ní bhainfeadh an Bille seo an fheidhm sin díobh.</P>
    <P>Mar focal scoir, ba mhaith liom anois chomgháirdeas a dhéanamh le foireann an Choimisiúin Logainmneacha as ucht an oiread sin oibre atá déanta acu i rith na blianta.  Táimse an-bhuíoch dóibh go léir thar cheann an saothair inmholta a rinneadar agus an dea-chomhairle a thugadar dom agus do gach Aire Airgeadais sna cúrsaí a bhaineann leis an mBille seo. Beidh an chomhairle sin agus, ar ndóigh, na tuairimí eagsúla a nochtadh ins an Teach seo in a cúnamh mór dom chun cuspóir agus spiorad an Bhille seo a chur ar aghaidh.</P>
    <P>Molaim an Bille seo don Teach.  Tá súil agam gur coitianta a úsáidfear foirmeacha Gaeilge logainmneacha dá bharr.</P>

      <P>Mar is eol don Rúnaí Parlaiminte, bhí ar ceannaire an phairtí seo a léiriú don Dáil le déanaí gur thárla rud nár thárla riamh cheana.  I rith an tréimhse fhada a bhí an Dáil ar athló i rith an tSamhraidh níor ullmhaigh an Rialtas Bille ar bith. Is eagal liom go raibh na hAirí róghnóthach ag caint agus ag plé leis na nuachtáin chun a gcuid oibre a dhéanamh. Ar aon nós, tá an Bille seo ós á gcómhair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Colley</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuirimid fáilte roimh an mBille.  Níl mórán le rá agam ó thárla go raibh baint agam féin lena ullmhú.</P>
      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos, de réir mar a thuigimse an scéal go dtí seo bhí feidhm dlí le roinnt logainmneacha Gaeilge.  Is dócha go raibh ainm oifigiúil Gaeilge ag Dún Laoghaire agus feidhm dlí aige.  Ach tá an-chuid áiteacha a bhfuil logainmneacha oifigiúla leagtha síos dóibh nach bhfuil feidhm dlí acu.  Sin í an chúis is mó atá leis an mBille seo a thabhairt ós comhair na Dála.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ach tá rud beag amháin atá ag déanamh buartha dhom.  Níl a fhios agam an féidir leis an Aire é a leigheas ach ceapaim go mba chóir é a lua.  I gcás logainm Gaeilge a bheith socraithe ag an gCoimisiún agus é á úsáid i ndoiciméad nó i gcáipéis dlíthiúil atá déanta nó sínithe roimhe seo, de réir <Col N="833" /> forálacha an Bhille seo ní bheidh feidhm dlí acu de bhrí gur deineadh an ionstraim nó gur síníodh an cháipéis roimh an dáta feidhme a luaitear sa Bhille.  Tuigim fáth an scéil. Tá ar an Aire, is dócha tabhairt faoin ndeacracht ar an gcuma sin, ach seo an rud atá ag déanamh tinnis domsa. Maidir le cáipéisí Gaeilge a ulimhaíodh na blianta ó shin ina n-úsáidtear an fhoirm Ghaeilge de ainmneacha áiteacha éagsúla de réir mar a thuigimse an scéal ar a laghad tá amhras ann an bhfuil feidm dlí leis na cáipéisí sin.</P>
    <P>An bhféadfadh an tAire foráil a chur isteach san mBille i gcás cáipéisí ina n-úsáidtear logainmneacha Gaeilge atá ar aon dul díreach leis na logainmneacha atá socraithe ag an gCoimisiún go mbeadh feidhm dlí leis na hainmneacha sin ins na cáipéisí cé gur síníodh na cáipéisí cheana féin.</P>
    <P>Tá baol ann, cé go bhfuil an Bille seo os comhair na Dála, nach mbeidh feidhm dlí leis na cáipéisí úd.  Tá a fhios agam nach bhfuil sin cinnte ach tá amhras ann agus tagraíonn an tAire don amhras seo.  Os rud é go bhfuil an Bille seo os comhair na Dála ar bhealach cuireann sé sin leis an amhras atá ann i gcás na gcáipéisí sin.  Muna mbeadh an Bille seo an d'fhéadfaí, b'fhéidir, argóint a dhéanamh go bhfuil feidhm dlí leis na focail seo ach sa mhéid go bhfuil an Bille ann agus go bhfuilimid ag rá gur gá Bille a thúirt os comhair na Dála chun feidhm dlí a thabhairt do na h-ainmneacha seo is féidir argóint an-láidir a dhéanamh anois nach bhfuil feidhm dlí leis na logainmneacha Gaeilge úd sna cáipéisí dlithiúla atá déanta amach cheana féin.</P>
    <P>Tuigim an dearcadh a bhaineann leis seo ach do mholfainn don Aire smaoineamh air agus féachaint an bhfuil bealach ar bith ann chun an Bille a leasú chun feidhm dlí a thabhairt do na cáipéisí sin siúd is go bhfuil na logainmneacha Gaeilge á n-úsáid iontu ar aon dul leis na logainmneacha a leagfar síos in ordú faoi alt a 2 san mBille seo.  Tá doiciméidí eile ann go bhféadfaí, b'fhéidir, an argóint chéanna a dhéanamh futhu ach tuigim gur féidir teacht timpeall ar na deacrachtaí ina gcás sin ach i gcás na gcáipéisí teidil ní féidir, is dóigh liom, agus ní leigheasfaidh <Col N="834" /> an Bille seo an scéal.  Mholfainn do nAire smaoitiú ar an gceist seo féachaint an bhfuil réiteach na faidhbe aige.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Faoi mar adúirt an Teachta Colley ar ball, bhí géar-ghá leis an mBille seo agus is ró-mhithid dúinn Bille dá shórt a bheith againn chun go mbeadh feidhm dlí le pé foirm oifigiúil a cheapfadh an Coimisiún Logainmneacha i gcóir áite ar bith sa tír.</P>
      <P>Níl i gceist agamsa ach béim a leagan ar chomh dona a bhí an scéal go nuige seo.  Dúirt an Teachta Colley cúpla nóimeat ó shin gurab é a phairtí féin a chum an Bille seo agus a shocraigh an Bille seo a thabhairt isteach. Ach d'fhág sé ar lár ar fad a admháil gurab iad siúd na daoine céanna a d'fhulaing ar feadh tamaill an-fhada raiméis a bheith á scaipeadh ar fud na tíre a bhí in ainm a bheith mar logainm ar áit éigin sa chathair nó faoin dtuaith; agus cé nach bhfuil mé ag iarraidh moladh dá laghad bhaint den phairtí ar leis é mar gheall ar shocrú ar an mBille seo a thabhairt isteach, ba cheart an méid seo a rá in éineacht leis-go bhfuilimid cráite le leathchéad bliain anuas i gcás na gcomharthaí bhóthair a cuireadh suas ar fud na tíre, go mór-mhór ó aimsir an Chogaidh anuas.  Táimid cráite le droch-Ghaeilge, le Gaeilge lochtach toisc gan na logainmneacha a bheith socraithe go cruinn ag údarás nó coimisiún éigin, toisc gan feidhm dlí a bheith acu agus toisc go mba chuma leis an Rialtas a bhí ann pé ráiméis nó seafóid a bhí á chur suas ar fud na tíre ag déanamh ceap-mhagadh dínn. Sin é an locht atá á fháil agamsa, ní ar an mBille féin, ach ar stair an Bhille.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Níor mhaith liom mórán eile a rá seachas an méid seo: tá súil agam tar éis an Bhille seo a bheith rite ag an dá Theach go dtabharfaidh gach údarás Stáit, agus na h-údaráis áitiúla go h-áirithe, go dtabharfaidh siad siúd aire do cibé logainm oifigiúil a shocrófar amach anseo ag an gCoimisiún Logainmneacha agus go gcuirfidh siad beagán stró orthu féin aire a thabhairt do cibé comhartha sráide a bheidh faoina gcúram i dtreo go mbeidh an Ghaeilge atá ann ceart agus go mbeidh <Col N="835" /> caighdeán éigin le feiceáil ann.  Is náireach an rud é an Ghaeilge a bheith in ainm a bheith á h-aithbheochaint againn sa Teach seo le leathchéad bliain anuas, ach ní gá dhuit ach súil a chaitheamh timpeall sa Teach seo agus feicfidh tú raiméis.  Amuigh anseo os cionn dhoras Bheár na gComhaltaí tá focal nach bhfaca mé riamh cheana, &ldquo;comhaltaí&rdquo;.  Ní focal Gaeilge é sin ach is féidir an focal seo a fheiceáil taobh istigh de Theach Laighean.  Taobh amuigh de mórán chuile dhoras sa Teach seo tá raiméis le feiceáil, agus is sinne na daoine atá in ainm bheith i gceannas ar fheachtas na h-aithbheochana.  Nach náireach an rud muide do bheith ag cur ina luí ar dhaltaí scoile agus eile go mba chóir dóibh Gaeilge a fhoghlaim agus a labhairt nuair is soiléir gur cuma linn ar fad an sort Gaeilge atá á úsáid ag na h-údaráis áitiúla nó fiú amháin ag Rannaí Stáit.</P>
    <P>Má bhíonn tú ar an mbóthar ó Chill Chainnigh go Port Láirge tiocfaidh tú ar sráid-bhaile ar a dtugtar &ldquo;Ballyhale&rdquo; i mBéarla.  Cúpla míle roimh an sráide-bhaile seo a bhaint amach dhuit feicfidh tú comhartha bhóthair agus fógraíonn an comhartha bhóthair sin duit go bhfuil tú i ngiorracht dhá mhíle do &ldquo;Bhaile hAol&rdquo;.  Díreach ar theacht isteach sa sráid-bhaile duit feicfidh tú comhartha an-mhór eile, suite díreach ar imeall an tsráid-bhaile, agus fógraíonn an comhartha sin duit gur &ldquo;Baile Héil&rdquo; atá ann.  Cúpla míle níos faide anonn ar an mbóthar go Port Láirge feicfidh tú comhartha eile a chuireann in iúl duit go bhfuil tú tar éis &ldquo;Baile hOal&rdquo; a fhágáil id dhiaidh.  Is náireach an rud é sin, agus tá dlúth-bhaint idir an cheist sin agus ceist iomlán na logainmneacha. Dá mbeinn im dhalta scoile sa sráid-bhaile beag seo i gCill Chainnigh ag éisteacht chuile lá leis an múinteor nó le boicíní móra ó Bhaile Átha Cliath nó le hAirí, nó le Taoiseach agus iad ag iarraidh chur ina luí orm nach raibh ach leathÉireannach ionam mura mbeadh an Ghaeilge agam, agus mé ag féachaint ar thrí foirmeacha éagsúla &ldquo;Gaeilge&rdquo; ar mo bhaile dúchais&mdash;nach dtiocfainn láithreach ar an smaoineamh gur <Col N="836" /> chuma leis na boicíní móra an Ghaeilge beo nó marbh, gur chuma leis na húdaráis áitiúla, gur chuma leis an Roinn Rialtais Áitiúil agus leis an saol fásta an Ghaeilge beo nó marbh, agus nach raibh ach cur-igcéill á chur i bhfeidhm ormsa.  Sin sampla beag amháin.  Tá na céadta agus na mílte sampla eile le feiceáil ar fud na tíre seo ach níor mhaith liom moill a chur ar an Teach.</P>
    <P>Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil na cáipéisí dlíthiúla faoi ar labhair an Teachta Colley chomh líonmhar sa tír gur mór an deacracht dúinn iad, ach tá na comharthaí bhóthair an-líonmhar sa tír.  Is féidir le duine lá iomlán a chaitheamh gan focal Gaeilge a fheiceáil seachas na comharthaí sin, agus ba cheart dóibh bheith cruinn, beacht agus caighdeánta, agus mura mbíonn siad cruinn, beacht agus caighdeánta agus ar aon dul lena chéile is náireach an rud dúinn a bheith ag chur in iúl don phobal go bhfuilimíd i ndáiríre faoin Ghaeilge a athbheochan.</P>
    <P>Ní chreidfeá an raiméis atá le feiceáil anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath ar na sráideanna agus ins na bóithre sa bhfóchathair atá á chur suas ag Bárdas Bhaile Átha Cliath le deireannas. Agus ní creidfeá an raiméis atá ar chuid mhaith de busanna CIE agus atá á úsáid ag údaráis uile an Stáit. Níl locht ar bith agam ar dhuine ar bith toisc gan an Ghaeilge a bheith go foirfe aige.  Rugadh agus tógadh ár mbunáite le Béarla agus ba mhór an stró dúinn an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim. Ní fhághaim locht ar bith ar dhuine a dheineann botún Ghaeilge ach tá locht le fáil ar údarás gur chuma leo cén raiméis a chuireann siad suas.</P>

There has been a lot of nonsense about these names and I have seen it even in Dublin city, but I would also hope that we might ensure that the names are in English as well as in Irish.  I would strongly oppose <Col N="838" /> the dictatorial attitude of local authorities in compelling residents to have the names of the estates and the roads in the estates in Irish only.  People have voiced their objections to this and their objections have been overruled. There is too much hypocrisy about this language.  Those of us who go out preaching that we must have Irish are the last people to speak it. Those people who speak it here in the House, you will never see them putting their names in Irish on a ballot paper, which is an astonishing thing; all the rest of the time you will see their names in Irish.  This is sheer hypocrisy.</P>
      <P>Due to the fact that there has been this compulsory Irish over the years, I have developed an apathy, almost a detestation, of the language, which is a terrible thing to say.  I spoke Irish fluently, but the whole hypocrisy associated with it has turned me completely off it so much so that I would resent in my area seeing the name of my road in Irish only, and I would hope there would be no attempt to force this on the people against their will.</P>
      <P>We had the situation many years ago when Irish was spoken&mdash;and it is many years since Irish was our official language&mdash;when the English names were a corruption of the Irish names. Now we must admit to ourselves that the Irish equivalent of the English name is merely a corruption of the English name.  The reason for the different versions of the English name is that people are interpreting differently the meaning of the English word. It reminds me of the time when I was doing chemistry and physics through the medium of Irish.  There were no equivalent Irish words for the English words in physics and chemistry, and as a result we sufferred a tremendous disadvantage in the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations.  It was a crying shame that we were asked to pursue the study of these subjects through the medium of Irish.</P>

      <P>Yes, against almost insuperable obstacles.  It was absolutely ludicrous that schools should impose the like of this on us through the medium of Irish.  I am saying this because I think there is much hypocrisy associated with the language.  I say to people who are advocating the use of Irish so much that they should put their names in Irish on the ballot paper.  This would be a good test.  This does not happen.</P>
      <P>I do not want to digress.  The Ceann Comhairle may feel worried about this. I would agree about standardisation and some uniformity but I would also suggest that we should be logical and realistic.  In my own area there was a district known as Inse Caoir.  &ldquo;Caoir&rdquo; was a berry, if I remember correctly. This has been completely corrupted now to Inchicore.  There has been corruption of the Irish word.  There is no semblance of sanity about our interpretation of the words.</P>
      <P>I would respectfully suggest that we should get back again to studying the meaning of the words.  A proper interpretation should be put on them.</P>

      <P>Silim go mbeadh sé an-dheacair ainm amháin a ghlachadh mar tá go leor áiteanna ar fud na tire ar a bhfuil cúpla ainm Gaeilge. D'fhéadfainn a lán céann acu a luaigh. Bheadh sé deacair na daoine go léir a fháil ar aon aigne cé acu de na h-ainmneacha Gaeilge a bheadh in úsáid.  Ní maith liom &ldquo;purism&rdquo; ar fad i dteanga ar bith.  Is iad an dream a dhein an damáiste is mó, sílim, d'athbheochan na Gaeilge le 40 bliain anuas ná na &ldquo;purists&rdquo; a chrochfadh duine dá ndéanfadh sé dearmad gharmaidhaigh nó dearmad liteartha, nó dá mbeadh an litríu micheart aige.  Ba cheart deireadh a chur le &ldquo;purism&rdquo;.  Mar sin féin, is maith an rud caighdéanú a dhéanamh ar logainmneacha i dteanga ar bith.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rinneadh iarracht caighdéanú a dhéanamh i leith na &ldquo;dialects&rdquo; sa tír seo roint bhliain ó shin.  D'éirigh cuíosach maith leis an iarracht sin ach ní féidir caighdeánú ceart a dhéanamh ar theanga agus dá bhrí sin ar logainmneacha. <Col N="840" /> I nGaeltachtaí ní ceart ach ainm amháin a bheith in úsáid ar na comharthaí bóthair, na bailte agus mar sin de.  Ní ceart ach an leagan Gaeilge a bheith in úsáid ar na logainmneacha sa Ghaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Bhí díospóireacht faoin Uaimh bliain nó mar sin ó shin faoi cé acu ainm a úsáidfí i gcás an bhaile sin agus sílim gur vótáil muintir na h-áite agus gur buadh ar an leagan Gaeilge amháin a úsáid.

Maidir leis an logainm úd &ldquo;Dún Laoghaire&rdquo;, sílim go bhfuil feidhm dlí leis ach nílim cinnte. Beidh feidhm dlí ag na logainmneacha a shocróidh an Coimisiún Logainmneacha ach beidh amhras nó dabht faoi aon logainm eile.  Má éiríonn conspóid maidir le logainm le linn cúis dlí do phlé is ar an gcúirt a bheidh an dualgas an cheist a réiteach.</P>
      <P>Ní chóir an Bille a leasú mar a mhol an Teachta Colley maidir le seasamh iar-ré a thabhairt d'úsáid logainmneacha i ndoiciméad dlithiúil. Ní léir go mbeadh an leasú a mhol sé saor ó chontúirt.</P>
      <P>The question that Deputy O'Connell raised is, I think, a legitimate one, I should like to assure him that the purpose of the Bill is not to replace English townland names or names of places or districts with Irish ones.  It is simply to give legal status and impact to the Irish versions and to remove doubt and uncertainty.  If a name is in common use and if it has reasonable validity that is the name that the Commission chooses as the Irish version of the name.  So far there is very little conflict between the common usage and the name the Commission adopts.  All proposals will have to be placed before the House.  It will be open to anybody to challenge them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that there is a road in Deputy O'Connell's constituency <Col N="841" /> which has the unflattering title of &ldquo;Blackditch Road&rdquo;, but when I had the honour of representing that area for many years nobody ever quoted the name of that road to me as Bothar Dubh Claoi.  That is the only legal title of that road.  It was named at a time when the Dublin Corporation had a bye-law which required all new roads to be named in the Irish language only.</P>
    <P>One should be realistic about the situation.  Titles in either language which are acceptable to the people should be used.  If we do that we would remove a great deal of the dislike which existed previously in the minds of some people in relation to the use of Irish.</P>

Those who opposed the change then saw the error of their ways and proposed in Dublin Corporation that all naming services should be bilingual.  The result is that they are all bilingual now.  Roads which were named at the time of the operation of the particular bye-law are probably named in Irish only.  It will now be open to such people to have the names of the streets made bilingual.</P>

    <Title>Coiste Airgeadais.   Committee on Finance. - Holidays (Employees) Bill, 1973: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary) Michael O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to increase from two weeks to three the workers' minimum annual holidays entitlement with <i>pro-rata</i> entitlements for periods of employment of less than a year.  In other words, the Bill is a synthesis of the practices followed in good employment.  Provisions in the Bill also deal with holiday cesser pay and public holiday entitlements on a basis broadly similar to the 1961 Act.</P>
      <P>The provisions in the Bill do not apply to agricultural workers.  They are covered by separate legislation administered by the Agricultural Wages Board.  Deputies will be aware that the Government have already announced that the legislation which determines the wages and holidays of agricultural workers is under review in consultation with the interests concerned.  I have taken power in the Bill, with appropriate ancillary and supplemental provisions, to bring agricultural workers within its scope by affirmative order of the Oireachtas if it should be considered appropriate to do so.</P>
      <P>Since the existing minimum statutory holiday entitlements of two weeks' leave and six public holidays were prescribed in the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1961, the majority of workers have, through collective bargaining, secured an additional week's holidays. The general position now is that the three-weeks minimum holiday obtains in good employments throughout Irish industry.  This Bill will however assist those workers who cannot invoke the aid of a trade union and who are deprived of holiday entitlements by virtue of their weak bargaining position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from increasing holiday entitlements, the Bill has a number of other features which are an improvement on the 1961 Act.  It prescribes a standard &ldquo;leave year&rdquo; beginning on 1st April each year, which will apply to all workers.  This replaces the provision <Col N="846" /> in the 1961 Act whereby leave entitlements were related to a worker's &ldquo;employment year&rdquo; based on the date on which he took up employment and anniversaries of that date. Thus, employees in the same firm could have different &ldquo;employment years&rdquo; depending on the date on which they started work.  This Bill, if enacted, will simplify matters inasmuch as leave entitlements for all employees would be calculated in future by reference to the same &ldquo;leave year&rdquo; from 1st April to 31st March.</P>
    <P>The qualifying conditions for entitlement to annual leave have also been eased.  Under the 1961 Act, an industrial worker had to complete 1,600 hours during his &ldquo;employment year&rdquo; in order to qualify for the two weeks annual leave.  There was no provision for proportionate leave entitlement for an employee working less than 1,600 hours except where he ceased employment. Under this Bill, as drafted, an employee will be entitled to paid leave in a leave year in which he has completed at least one &ldquo;qualifying month of service&rdquo;, comprising a calendar month in which he works at least 125 hours, or 115 hours if under 18 years of age.  For 12 such months, the worker qualifies for three weeks leave, and he gets proportionately less for 11 or fewer qualifying months.  If he has eight or more qualifying months of service, he is entitled to an unbroken holiday period of two weeks.  There is provision for excluding from an employee's annual leave period a day on which he is sick, provided he furnishes a medical certificate.  There was no corresponding provision in the 1961 Act.</P>
    <P>The prescribed minimum of 125 hours in a &ldquo;qualifying month of service&rdquo; makes allowance for the general reduction which has occurred in the working week since 1961 and for possible absences due to sickness and other reasons.  Casual and short-term workers would also qualify on this basis.  The Bill has also removed the distinction between the qualifying conditions for leave purposes as between &ldquo;domestic&rdquo; and &ldquo;non domestic&rdquo; workers which existed under the 1961 Act.  It was one of the anomalies of earlier legislation on holidays that one of the most <Col N="847" /> exploited sections of our work force, domestic workers, had this underprivileged position enshrined in the law.  This has now been corrected.</P>
    <P>Provisions in the Bill about public holiday entitlements and for compensation, where workers opt, or are obliged, to work on public holidays, are somewhat similar to those in the 1961 Act.  However, a full-time employee automatically qualifies for public holiday entitlements if he is in employment at that time; he does not have to work for a specified minimum number of hours beforehand.  This is an improvement compared with the 1961 Act.</P>
    <P>The provision about leave arrangements permits an employer to decide when annual leave may be granted but only on certain conditions.  These include consulting with the employee or his trade union at least one month beforehand and allowing the leave to be taken within the relevant &ldquo;leave year&rdquo; or within six months after it ends.  Thus, for the leave year starting 1st April, 1974, holidays may be allowed in the 18 months between that date and 30th September, 1975.  Flexibility of this kind is designed to benefit both the employer and/or the employee.</P>
    <P>Sections 7, 8 and 9 of the Bill contain the usual provisions relating to prosecutions of offences and the recovery of moneys due to an employee.  The provisions in sections 10 and 11 about the keeping of records and the enforcement powers of inspectors are similar to those in the 1961 Act.  However, the provision about records has been made more precise to facilitate inspectors in checking compliance with the provisions of the Bill.  A specific requirement has been placed on employers to keep records of annual leave for examination by inspectors.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that this legislation, as an instrument of social reform, retains a capacity to be adjusted in accordance with desirable social trends, under section 13 I have taken powers to modify provisions in the Act by regulations.  The use of <Col N="848" /> such powers would require prior consultation with the appropriate workers' and employers' organisations. There is also a requirement that drafts of regulations, for the purposes of section 2, must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas with a view to securing their approval by means of affirmative order.  In this way it will not be necessary to introduce amending legislation on each occasion when a major change is being made in relation to the &ldquo;excluded categories&rdquo; while ensuring, at the same time, that the Oireachtas retains full control over such changes.  I think this power is necessary as this is the third piece of legislation we have had on holidays, and for changes envisaged in the future we should not have to embark on the procedure of fresh legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 16 provides that if the Bill is enacted annual leave or public holiday entitlements shall no longer arise under the 1961 Act.  That section contains transitional bridging provisions, however, whereby workers will be able to preserve title to any holiday entitlements acquired under the 1961 Act while, at the same time, they would be building up entitlements under this Bill, if enacted.  In order to avoid very complex provisions which would be only of a temporary nature, simply designed to ensure this bridging effect, a special formula was designed which would afford a worker a choice of two options when the proposed Bill comes into force.  First, he can claim the statutory compensation in lieu of holiday entitlements, whether in respect of annual leave or public holidays, due to him under the 1961 Act in the same way as if his employment ceased on the day before the new Act comes into force.  If he accepts the cesser pay involved, further holiday entitlements will accrue only under the new Act. Alternatively, with the agreement of both parties, he may carry over leave due to him under the 1961 Act into the new &ldquo;leave year&rdquo;.  This arrangement was included in order to give effect to my wish that no worker should suffer loss of benefit to which he would otherwise be entitled under <Col N="849" /> the 1961 Act simply as a result of the new Bill being enacted.</P>
    <P>As regards section 17 and the Schedule to the Bill, I should explain that, following consultation with the Minister for Finance, it was decided that in future I should be responsible for administering legislation about public holidays.  Under existing legislation there are six &ldquo;public holidays&rdquo; to which this Bill applies.  I have taken power, however, to appoint, by regulations, new public holidays or to change an existing public holiday to a different day.  I have also taken this opportunity to formally substitute the first Monday in June as a public holiday instead of Whit Monday. This will obviate the need to make an annual order changing it, which was necessary under the present legislation.</P>
    <P>Similar flexible arrangements have been made in the case of Church holydays.  I feel that flexible measures of this kind are desirable to avoid unnecessarily cumbersome legislative procedures, especially when these matters are for the most part noncontroversial.</P>
    <P>At this point I should like to say a word about public holidays in general. The position is that Britain and Ireland have the fewest public holidays of all EEC countries although Britain has now decided in favour of an extra public holiday.  Both countries have at present six public holidays. And, as I said, Britain has made a decision to have an extra one.  That leaves Ireland at the bottom of the list with six public holidays just below Britain.</P>
    <P>The position elsewhere in the EEC is that Italy has 17 public holidays, Germany ten to 13, depending on the province, Belgium and Luxembourg ten, Denmark nine to ten, depending on regional variations, France five to ten and the Netherlands seven. Clearly here in Ireland our working people in the public holidays they enjoy will have to be brought closer to the European norm.  Naturally from a position where we are lowest in the table, this will require a phased approach in consultation with both sides in industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="850" /> I have decided to add an extra public holiday to the present six which we have and the Government have so agreed.  January 1st has been mentioned as a likely date.  Before making any formal decision on the actual date of this new public holiday, I would hope to consult further with unions and employers because I should like to see our approach on this process of the levelling up of the number of our public holidays to that enjoyed in other EEC countries proceeding in as comprehensive a fashion as possible rather than piecemeal.  I am proceeding with this consultation and, before the Bill passes all stages, I hope I will be able to make a more concrete statement on the matter.</P>
    <P>This holiday legislation is the product of a great deal of consultation with both employers and trade unions. Its provisions are designed to provide that workers in a weak bargaining position, who cannot invoke the aid of a trade union, enjoy holiday entitlements which remain in line with those prevailing in good employment currently.</P>
    <P>In legislation of this kind consultation with employers and unions is of a continuing kind.  Due to developments since its drafting I should like to inform the House that I propose during Committee Stage to move the following amendments:</P>
    <P>(a)  Provide in section 3 that, as an alternative to qualifying for leave entitlements on a monthly basis only, an employee in continuous employment who works 1,400 hours, or 1,300 if under 18 years of age, in a leave year, may also be entitled to three weeks holidays irrespective of the number of hours worked during any one month.  This restores a somewhat similar provision contained in the 1961 Act;</P>
    <P>(b)  Provide in section 3 subsection (6) that the minimum hours per &ldquo;qualifying month of service&rdquo; for leave entitlement purposes shall be amended to read 120, or 110 hours if under 18 years of age, instead of 125 and 115 respectively, as appears in the Bill as circulated. These reductions are considered justified in line with the general trend <Col N="851" /> towards a 40-hour normal working week;</P>
    <P>(c)  Provide in section 5 subsection (2) that compensation for annual leave in respect of cesser of day-to-day employment where the employee has worked 120 hours during the preceding 30 days shall be at the rate of 1¼ days' pay.  This will bring the compensation into line proportionately with annual leave entitlements on the monthly basis.</P>
    <P>Looking at the Bill as a whole, the House will, I think, agree that its provisions, including the amendments which I have mentioned, represent a further legislative advance in the conditions of employment of a large number of Irish workers.  It is a very simple and straightforward piece of legislation which, at the same time, will afford flexibility for modifications in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>I am naturally anxious to have the Bill enacted well in advance of the beginning of the new &ldquo;leave year&rdquo; on the 1st April, 1974, to afford both workers and employers ample time to familiarise themselves with its provisions, and to enable them to make the necessary arrangements about leave entitlements on the new basis.  For these reasons, I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to the speedy passage of all its Stages.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. Anything Dáil Éireann can do to improve the lot of the Irish worker will get our support.  I can assure the Minister that no obstacle will be placed in the way of the passage of the Bill.  I am glad to see the improvements on previous legislation which the Minister has written into this Bill and the modifications and adjustments which he has mentioned.  To move with the times it was necessary for us to up-date our legislation.  Many important aspects of the Bill which the Minister mentioned will have the support of every member of our party. The Minister was wise to take powers to make amendments or alterations in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the 1961 Act through collective <Col N="852" /> bargaining a considerable number of workers have secured three weeks paid annual holidays but a section of unorganised workers have not.  This Bill will give them that entitlement in a positive way.  It serves an excellent purpose in so far as it grants this minimum number of holidays to unorganised workers.  Various arguments have been put forward by employers in relation to unorganised firms who, they claimed, had an advantage over the workers and over the firms by virtue of the fact that some paid for holidays and others did not.  This Bill compels them all to pay and that is desirable.  Some employers are not so co-operative and they evade their responsibilities by pointing out that no provision in the Act forces them to pay.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to take note of a situation which developed with Dublin Corporation under the 1961 Act.  I do not think this aspect is provided for in the Bill and I would ask the Minister to take it into consideration before Committee Stage.  If an employee died in the service of Dublin Corporation there was no provision whereby payment could be made for a holiday entitlement to that person's representatives.  This has caused an amount of concern to widows.  They were entitled to back pay or to the pay to which the person was entitled but, on the question of holiday pay, some employers, including Dublin Corporation, evaded their responsibilities.  I hope the Minister will ensure that, if a person dies in employment and he had an entitlement to annual leave, payment will be made to the next of kin.  I understand that the law agent advised the corporation on this, and I understand they sought advice from the Attorney General.  Many widows have suffered and I hope there will be an appropriate section in the new Bill to deal with it.</P>
    <P>On the question of what the future holds for Irish workers, and workers as a whole, we are working towards the draft social action programme of the EEC, and working towards four weeks annual paid holiday by 1976.  I hope we will not be behind other <Col N="853" /> countries on this occasion and that our workers will obtain this even prior to 1976.  It is desirable and necessary that in industry, where there are pressures and tensions and the development problems which cause considerable strain to workers in conveyor belt conditions or in production lines, all involving monotony, the workers should have reasonable periods of relaxation.  We must endeavour to move towards a situation in which it will be possible, by way of extra relaxation time, to alleviate the stresses and strains of the present age. Experience has shown that where additional holidays were granted to workers there was a remarkable increase in productivity.  More mental power is required of workers in this technically advanced age and that is another reason why it is necessary to have legislation of the type now proposed.</P>
    <P>Another important aspect is that we must meet our wider commitments as members of the EEC.  If workers are under the impression that their conditions of employment are to their disadvantage rather than to their advantage they cannot be expected to give of their best.  I welcome the Bill and assure the Minister that we on this side of the House will co-operate with him in expediting it through the House and that where possible, we will try to have it improved so that those workers who are being deprived of the additional holiday period proposed will become entitled to it without delay.</P>
    <P>There are a few aspects of the Bill I find difficult to understand, but which the Minister may elucidate for me in his reply.  The first of these is in relation to section 12, which refers to reward being irrecoverable for work done during annual leave.  We are not told whether the reward is irrecoverable by the employee or the employer. The section is vague in this respect. There is also the question of the suspended worker.  Suspension is a device that is used from time to time by some employers for the purpose of victimising a worker.  I should hope that suspension, as against dismissal, would not in any way debar a worker <Col N="854" /> from full entitlement to annual leave. I hope this aspect is covered in the Bill; if not, it should be covered before the Bill is enacted.  In some cases workers have been suspended for as long as six or eight months.  This is an undesirable situation and one, which, if allowed to develop, might be adopted by more employers.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his new post.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the previous speaker in welcoming this Bill. For some years past there have been firms, mainly the bigger ones, that have been granting three weeks annual leave to their employees.  Usually there is a strong trade union in such firms, whereas in the smaller firms there may be no trade union so that employees are not in a sufficiently strong position to bargain for better conditions.  This Bill is desirable because it will ensure that people working in such firms will have legal entitlement to a three weeks holiday period.  The question of job satisfaction arises in this context.  It is important that everybody engaged in industry should have absolute job satisfaction, that they be alert mentally and physically in carrying out their duties and that at all times they consider their work as being very important to the country as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would make a plea here for people engaged in the hotel business and in respect of whom it is difficult to ensure that proper holidays are granted because they must work when other people are free to take holidays.  The Minister should ensure that the interests of these people are protected fully.  Some hotel employees work exceptionally long hours, sometimes on seven days a week.  Most of them receive overtime pay, but there are some who are not paid for these extra hours.  The staffs of bigger hotels are usually trade unions members but this is not the case in respect of the staffs of the smaller establishments. I urge the Minister to ensure that hotel employees are properly looked after and their interests safeguarded.  The vast majority <Col N="855" /> of hotel managements appreciate the rights of their employees but there are exceptions and it is to these exceptions that the Minister should particularly direct his attention.  Many of the staffs of hotels are young boys and girls between 16 and 18 years of age and they are perhaps not as well able to stand up to dogmatic employers as those with more experience.  I urge the Minister to be particularly attentive to the holiday rights of such young workers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dowling touched on a point which is analogous to one raised by the Minister in his speech&mdash;the number of holidays a worker is qualified for if he leaves employment or if he is dismissed. On a number of occasions I have come across people who have left employment but who have not been given the holiday pay to which they were entitled.  I am not clear from reading the Bill what their entitlement is in this respect and I should be grateful to the Minister to clarify the position when he is replying.  People sometimes leave employment or are dismissed after four or five months and Deputies and Senators would be glad to be able to give precise replies when they are questioned on this matter. When a person leaves employment he may be out of work for a period and the holiday pay to which he is legally entitled could be of immense importance to him, his wife and family.  The three weeks holiday provision is very welcome and so is the provision about an extra day off each year.  The Minister mentioned New Year's Day.</P>

      <P>Personally I would favour a day at some other time of the year.  Around the New Year there are numerous holidays and I suggest that some day between October and Christmas would be more welcome: that is a period when there are not any public holidays.  The Minister said these are matters for negotiation between workers' representatives and employers.  However, it is good to see this Bill before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Bill.  I am sure both employers and trade unions have been fully consulted and that their advice is to a great extent reflected in the Bill. Therefore, it is not for us seriously to question particular provisions in the Bill.  As the Minister has stated, the provisions in this Bill have been already got by trade union negotiations and the vast majority of workers have been enjoying the three weeks annual leave for a number of years.  This Bill became necessary particularly to cover sections of workers who had not been able to get such benefits.  For that reason alone it is very welcome because it helps workers who could not themselves enforce their rights through trade unions.  They could only be looked after by legislation. This was their only way to get their entitlements in regard to holidays.</P>
      <P>One point I particularly welcome in the Bill is that, if a worker becomes or is ill during any day of his annual leave, provided he supplies a medical certificate, that day is not included in his annual leave.  In future I should like to see legislation that would qualify workers who have had long service in a particular employment and who may be ill for many months of the year for this entitlement to holidays. As they stand, the provisions of the Bill are good.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One particular advantage in the Bill is the automatic entitlement to a public holiday to a person who might start in a job on a Monday morning.  He will be entitled to a full week's pay if there is a public holiday on a Tuesday or a Wednesday of that first week.  That is most desirable and necessary.  The Minister mentioned one extra holiday. In that respect I should like to put forward the idea that this additional day be attached to a weekend, in other words, that it be a Friday or a Monday. I do not know what the continental position is, whether such public holidays come at weekends or in a haphazard way.  Some of the public holidays mentioned in the Bill are liable to occur in mid-week and the benefits to some extent are lost to the workers.  Church holydays, whose benefits some workers enjoy, often <Col N="857" /> fall mid-week and as a result the full benefit is sometimes lost.  In contemplating additional public holidays that may be given over the next few years this should be borne in mind.  The question of attaching them to existing days or to weekends, the Friday or the Monday, should be considered because the vast majority of workers work from Monday to Friday.  Because of this it would be more beneficial and advantageous to have the additional holidays either at the beginning or at the end of that five-day cycle.</P>
    <P>Under the 1961 Act a worker who works a public holiday receives payment at the rate of twice a day's pay. The usual practice is that if a worker works the public holiday he gets double time on top of the holiday. In other words, he receives a day's pay if he does not work the holiday and if he works he receives his day's pay plus double time.  In effect he has three days' pay for the one day's work.  That is a practice that is now quite common and the normal procedure. I would like to have the Minister's comment on this.</P>
    <P>In this legislation that part of the 1961 Act is continued.  The Minister might look at this now or at least in the not too distant future.  I should like to pay tribute to the inspectors in the Minister's Department who have been investigating the complaints under the 1961 Act.  They have performed well their duties, which at times are very difficult because of the type of employers they have to approach.  Such employers are usually the most difficult people, the most difficult employers and the most troublesome.  Because of this the task of the inspectors has not been an easy one.</P>
    <P>Because of the way in which the employment year went under the 1961 Act it was difficult for even an inspector of the Department to come to grips in determining entitlement in respect of individual workers.  The arrangement whereby the 1st April will now be the date for everyone irrespective of when they start in a job if it does nothing else will facilitate the pursuit of defaulting employers under this Act.  It will also make the <Col N="858" /> job of detecting those in default a lot easier.</P>
    <P>Under this Act a worker who commences work on the 1st April or at any time will not be entitled to the full entitlements until the following summer 12 months.  I cannot see any way out of this difficulty nor am I in a position to make any suggestions as to how the Minister might overcome this, because most workers prefer to get the bulk of their annual holidays in the summertime due to family commitments and school holidays.</P>
    <P>The date of their first year of employment will make it difficult for them to get the full holidays during that year.  They will have to wait until the following year.  I agree, however, that this will seldom occur, perhaps, only once in a lifetime.  In welcoming this Bill I should like to say that the only regret I have about it is that it was not law some years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. M. O'Leary)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies for granting my request that the Bill should have a speedy passage through the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dowling asked about section 12, which refers to the fact that reward for work done by an employee during annual leave shall be irrecoverable. That section is in the 1961 Act. It is there to discourage employees from the temptation of working during their annual leave.  It states simply that the employee who works during that period will be unable at law to call in legal sanction to recover any moneys owed to him during that period.  It is necessary to have such a provision if we wish to comply with the ILO Convention, I believe it is No. 132.  The worker who insists on working during his annual leave does so at his peril if there is any dispute about the salaries which he earns during that period.  We think it is important that everybody working in the country should take this period of holiday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling mentioned the question of suspension of workers and this being a growing practice.  I do not know if it is true to say that it is <Col N="859" /> a growing practice but I will have a look at that situation.  It would not obtain for trade unionists for the most part, but what I would be anxious to avoid in legislation of this kind is entering into an area of dispute about whether a suspension was justified or not.</P>
    <P>It would be difficult to see how we could get legislation of the kind that would cover the eventuality Deputy Dowling felt would give rise to dispute in which people would find themselves deprived of their entitlements. However, I will have a look at it in its later passages to see if there is anything that can be done subject to the difficulties which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright asked if an employee worked less than that statutory period what he would be entitled to.  There is a provision in this Bill for proportionate leave entitlement for an employee working less that 1,600 hours where he does not cease or terminate the employment contract. Under the Bill one can break down proportionately what an employee would be entitled to.  If an employee works six or seven months during the leave year and he averages over 120 hours per month he gets 1¼ days for each month.  For over a six-month period an employee would receive 7½ days; for eight such months he would receive ten days.  In this legislation we provide for him to be able to get proportionately what he is entitled to subject to those qualifications.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright commented on what should be the extra public holiday. As I remarked when introducing the Bill, we must advance on a phased basis of progression to something nearer what is the average now existing in the EEC countries.  While no formal decision has been made on the actual date of the extra holiday which the Government has agreed to in principle, I agree with Deputy Enright, and with other speakers, that such a holiday would be of most benefit if it was situated nearer a weekend.  That would be a time when people would appreciate the extra day. The extra holiday in Britain will be on 1st January, but I think there is <Col N="860" /> much weight in the argument that an autumn holiday might be of greater benefit to people in the long gap between annual holidays and the Christmas season.  I may be able to say more on this after further discussions with unions and employers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOLeary" hpid="Mr. M. O'Leary Mr. M. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>That would depend on who won.  I think the Deputy also mentioned holidays near weekends; of course, he assumes that Kilkenny will be permanently in the All-Ireland final.  With regard to the matter of sickness of older workers, the question of their annual leave entitlement not being endangered is incorporated now and it is an improvement on the previous position.</P>
      <P>Deputy Pattison also mentioned the matter of three days' pay for a worked bank holiday.  This is not a universal practice; perhaps it may be only where the transport union in Kilkenny is effective.  At any rate, this practice does not obtain everywhere, although it applies in some places.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this legislation is to extend what is a good employment practice throughout industry, to extend the benefits that have been gained by the collective strength of trade unions in their negotiations with employers. It is to ensure that the benefits are extended to workers who are in weak bargaining situations&mdash;for instance workers in small jobs, in isolated or in service jobs where union organisation is not strong and where employees have not been able to get benefits which are general or have been widespread throughout industry.  I shall certainly look at that situation in as helpful a way as I can see if we can get an amendment of that kind.  If Deputies have any further amendments of this kind which might improve this legislation I shall be ready to listen to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a a few comments on post-primary education. The post-primary curriculum is not suited for many pupils.  Of the numbers who attend these schools, how many sit for examinations or are successful in the examinations for the vocational group certificate?  If a boy or girl does not sit for this examination it is obvious there is something wrong with the curriculum and we must consider what can be done to adjust it.  The headmaster should be allowed to use his discretion in this matter so that he may adjust the curriculum to suit the majority of the pupils.  This would ease much of the frustration experienced by teachers and I would ask the Minister to consider this matter.</P>
      <P>For a considerable time I have been referring to the question of prosecutions for non-attendance at school.  A fine of £2 solves nothing.  We must have a more realistic approach.  Much depends on the school attendance officers.  They are rather like social workers advising the children and the parents.  The Minister should encourage these officers to attend courses where they could be enlightened on the approach to this problem.  This is a very important matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is morally wrong to bring a child into a courtroom because of non-attendance at school and it will have a bad effect on the child.  Such investigations should be held in community buildings or some similar buildings.  I know the Minister is interested in this kind of approach to problems of this nature.  Let us get away from the courtroom <Col N="863" /> so far as children are concerned. It has a psychological effect.  Accounts of the prosecutions appear on the daily papers and it is not nice for a boy or girl to have their name mentioned in the newspaper for not attending school.  I am surprised that this has not been changed long before now.  I ask the Minister to give it consideration.</P>
    <P>Much emphasis is placed on academic education but social education should go hand in hand with that. Too much of the responsibility for this is placed on youth clubs, <i>et cetera</i>.  They have a contribution to make because youth clubs should be centres of education, but there is an obligation on the school here.  The Minister should give this attention.</P>
    <P>There is a very poor choice of sports in some of our secondary schools. There should be a wide choice. Teachers should encourage pupils in the fields of mountain climbing, dancing and things of that sort.  This would build up a very happy relationship between the pupil and the teacher. We should have that mutual understanding. This should be our approach to education.</P>
    <P>We should have another look at civics.  People with experience in certain professional fields should be invited to schools to speak on rates, income tax, politics and things of that nature.  The Garda should be asked into schools to talk to pupils.  This is very important where the teaching of civics is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not devote much of his brief to adult education because he is waiting for the report of the speical committee.  This is a report in which many people will be interested.  I would strongly recommend to the Minister that where adult education is concerned there should be short courses, not running into a year or two years. Courses usually end up with perhaps a 50 per cent fall off in attendance. There should be courses on youth and community leadership but they should be short so that people would be encouraged to attend them.</P>
    <P>If we are to achieve anything in the field of sport it is important to <Col N="864" /> have sufficiently trained personnel available for coaching and organising training courses throughout the country. I am glad the Minister has placed quite a lot of emphasis on this.  There is a crying need for this at present, for people who are qualified in their field to organise courses.  There is quite a development now of community associations throughout the country. Many of them have erected buildings.  Physical education could be taught in those buildings.  The Minister might say that the cost of building would be a problem here but there is a wealth of facilities available in community buildings.  Grants should be available to people who want to promote this kind of education so as to provide the necessary equipment in the buildings.  I want to emphasise this because, now that people realise the importance of community associations, they should be attracted to these community buildings and every possible facility made available to them. I know that many associations would be delighted to provide this facility for young people.</P>
    <P>We have the problem of early school leavers.  A boy or girl may develop a taste for education a short time after leaving school but would be most reluctant to go back to a classroom atmosphere.  Here again is an area in which we could use the community building.  There is a tremendous opportunity here for the Department of Education to organise, with the co-operation of the vocational education committee of the area, classes for such people.  It might be costly because it would mean night classes but many of our vocational schools are overcrowded at night and cannot facilitate all applicants.  I am talking specifically about the early school leaver who might avail of this opportunity to improve his standard of education.  We all know that it is after we have left school we can see opportunities lost. But people are reluctant to go back to the classroom atmosphere to continue their education.  I would ask the Minister to consider this because I know that a number of community associations would welcome it and give it every possible support. <Col N="865" /> School transport has been a problem down through the years.  It needs reviewing periodically.  I believe the Minister should allow school buses to convey children to places of recreation. Many boys and girls are deprived of the opportunity to participate in a particular field of recreation because of cost.  As well as that there is not a regular bus service in all parts of the country.  We could be depriving children here and I would ask the Minister to consider allowing school buses to convey children to places of recreation.</P>
    <P>Parent-teacher involvement is of vital importance and should be encouraged. Community involvement in education will benefit all.  Naturally parents should have a say where their children are concerned.  I do not say they should be a dominant feature but, as I said earlier, education is the concern of all and all must play a part in it.  The greater the involvement the happier the community relations.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise again the need for two secondary schools in Cork. Some months ago, in reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister assured me he would give all possible attention to this matter.  I think he acquired ground from the vocational committee in Cork for the Togher development.  Since then the convent school in Blackrock are in urgent need of suitable secondary education facilities for their children.  The Minister is fully aware of the situation. I ask him to treat this as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Once more, I wish the Minister well.  I wish him success in his high office.  His is a very important office because education is very important. I appeal to him to go on consulting the people, especially community associations.  I advise him to give them every possible encouragement.  They can make a contribution and they want to contribute.  If we build the kind of atmosphere in which the Minister, his officials, parents, teachers, the local community and the children all work together for the common good, then we shall certainly <Col N="866" /> achieve something and the Minister will be assured of a very fruitful period in office if he continues on the lines on which he is moving at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to compliment the Minister on what he has done for education in the very short time in which he has been in office. He has made fantastic strides and he has projected a terrific image as Minister for Education.  I wish him many long years in office.  He has a great deal to contribute out of his own experience and out of his abilities. I am very proud to be associated with him.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wyse very rightly dealt with those areas with which he is most familiar.  I shall do the same.  Speaking broadly for the moment, I believe enough is not being done in the schools for the student who has no aptitude for conventional subjects.  In our new situation in the EEC, with new industries cropping up all over the place, requiring specialised skills, I am just a little worried that not enough is being done for the young people who will have to earn their living in these new industries.  Instead of concentrating on academic subjects we should be concentrating on the development of particular skills and aptitudes.  A great deal more should be done in regard to career guidance at a very early age so that children could be channelled into specific types of education designed to train them for their particular vocations.</P>
      <P>Very little has been done in the way of formal education designed to train the farmers of the future in the very competitive field of agriculture in the EEC.  Our universities do not recognise agricultural science as a subject for matriculation.  Because of that the secondary schools have dropped agricultural science as a subject.  The result is that young people spend up to five years in a boarding school and return home to their farms completely ignorant of farming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Cork we have been waiting for a long time for the new dairy science and food extension.  I understand this has been sanctioned by the Department <Col N="867" /> of Agriculture and Fisheries but there is some hold up in the Department of Education; it is too expensive. I would appeal to the Minister to use his good offices here.  We cannot afford to have any cheeseparing. This new building must comply with the high standard of hygiene and so forth required by the general food standards in Europe.  Nothing but the best will do.  We must not delay too long in erecting this building.  If we dally we may find ourselves in a situation in which we could lose a very substantial grant from the Kellog Foundation.</P>
    <P>With regard to university education, I would like to see the New Zealand system in operation here. There you have the veterinary students on the same campus as the agricultural students.  They have much more in common naturally with the agricultural students than they have with medical students.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment Macra na Feirme on the Trojan work they have done over the years in voluntary education.  It is not enough, I admit.  The agricultural advisers have done a great deal too.  However, we must have formal education in agriculture in all schools.  I would like to see the vocational side expanded.</P>
    <P>A great deal has been said about school transport.  It is inadequate and there is not enough flexibility.  It is not right that buses which are not filled should pass by students on the road.  If the parents of these children can make a contribution towards the transport so much the better.</P>
    <P>Again on this whole business of transport, I was glad the Minister did something about these two-teacher schools, because in closing down all these small schools around the country, we have got a further problem, the problem of transport.  I was often wondering if we really solved anything or if we created a bigger problem than we solved.  Transport now costs in the region of £5 million, and it looks as if it could be double that in a short time. We closed a lot of very good small schools.  I believe there is a lot to be said for these schools, where you had <Col N="868" /> the children growing up in their own environment, in their own parochial, social-type surroundings.  Results have shown that these children did quite well for themselves.  I have often been wondering if all these services that the bigger school is supposed to provide is not something of a myth.  Maybe time will tell.  However, I have a very strong feeling that the bigger school is not always the answer and that we should be very reluctant to close any school that is in fairly good condition with sufficient pupils to justify two teachers, as we have been doing in the past.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment, too, the Irish Christian Brothers, the nuns and the teachers generally in that they have devoted their time and their lives to our education and the education of all our children.  We should be proud of them.  Our teachers, lay and religious, have been unfairly criticised of late.  It is only right that they should be praised for what they have done.  Our standards are as high as, if not higher than, anywhere else in the world.  Our graduates are widely accepted abroad at the moment.  A lot of this is due to the work done in the past by people like the brothers and the nuns who gave virtually free education when the country could ill afford to give it.</P>
    <P>Again I wish to compliment the Minister and to wish him well.  I hope he will continue his policy of consultation. He is the man who started real consultation.  By consultation I mean that he takes into account the opinions of the managers, the teachers, all concerned, before any major step is taken in any area.  That is vital in any democracy. I do not think any Minister should do anything without consultation. I am very proud that the Minister for Education, Deputy Burke, has made this his <i>forte,</i> that he regards consultation as of primary importance. I hope he continues to do that for many long years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous speaker concluded by referring to the record of the Minister in the field of consultation with the education authorities. While I am familiar with the Minister, having served with him on the Dublin County Council since 1967, <Col N="869" /> prior to his appointment, I must say I was bitterly disappointed with the record of the Minister in consultation having regard to his recent statement on rationalisation and regionalisation in the educational field.</P>
      <P>The Minister sent out a notification to the vocational educational committees, on one of which it is my honour to serve, the County Dublin Vocational Committee, asking for the committee's views on a very important item affecting vocational and post-primary education throughout the whole country.  We had the sum total of five to ten days in which to consider this very important item and, having considered it, to send to the Minister our recommendations on it. I think any reasonable person&mdash;and I know the Minister is a reasonable person&mdash;would give longer than that period of time for the consideration of such an important document which has implications for the educational sphere for years to come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister obviously gave this document a lot of consideration.  The County Dublin Vocational Education Committee is probably the most rapidly growing educational committee in this country, and the Minister gave that meagre time for the consideration of this very important document.  In replying to a question in the House the other day, the Minister assured us that next time round we would get a greater opportunity, but this should not have had to be done.  I am not 100 per cent sure of the exact dates but the document was sent by the Department some time in the middle of September and the information had to be sent on prior to a meeting which was taking place early in October.  The Minister may challenge me when I say the time allowed was for five to ten days, but anyway it was much less time than a month.  The Minister is familiar with the situation which pertains to local authorities during the summer break. He is also aware that it is sometime into the middle of September before the committee of local authorities are fully operative after the summer break.  The Minister should have given <Col N="870" /> us more time to consider such an important document.</P>
    <P>I wish to speak about the primary and post-primary schools in County Dublin.  The problems in County Dublin are unique because never in the history of this state has an area expanded so much with such a large explosion in population.  This expansion has taken place over the last five or six years.  The Department of Education are lagging behind in the provision of educational facilities.  Let us first consider primary education. The population of Swords, where I live, has doubled over the last three years.  It is envisaged that over the next three years it will double again. We have one school which was completed two or three years ago.  By the time it was completed it was already overcrowded.  We have asked the Department of Education for sanction to construct a new school.  We have received that sanction.  Our main problem is finance.  The Department of Education will give a grant towards the building of a school but they will not pay for the site.  In County Dublin a major item in the cost of any school is the cost of the land.  The land costs in developing areas are high because the land is needed for the building of houses, factories and schools.  There is little point in the Minister giving a grant for the construction of a school and the provision of furniture therein without providing a grant for the site.</P>
    <P>In Swords the county council are providing a site for a primary school but they are forbidden by the local government regulations to sell any land at less than the cost price.  The only way that Swords will get a school at a reasonable cost is by the Department of Education providing a grant towards the cost of a site.  At present they are not prepared to do this.  This is wrong.  History will chastise those in power at this stage because they did not accept such a reasonable proposal.</P>
    <P>What applies to Swords applies also to similar areas in County Dublin. The Minister represents an area in <Col N="871" /> South County Dublin.  It is a rapidly developing area.  It is developing so rapidly that we may all be out of jobs following the changes in the constituencies which we hear are coming. The Minister's constituency takes in places such as Tallaght.  I believe the Minister will not be representing Tallaght when the constituency changes take effect.  Tallaght has problems which are unique to County Dublin. It is a rapidly developing area which is badly in need of primary and post-primary schools.  In areas such as Blanchardstown and Tallaght Dublin Corporation have purchased large tracts of land with a view to housing the people on the housing list.  As the Minister knows, a family must have three or four children before they get a corporation house.  When families are housed in a new area like Tallaght they must find schools for their children, some of whom may be five or six years of age.  There are no primary schools in these new areas.  There may be some mobile or temporary classrooms but they are inadequate for children in their formative years.</P>
    <P>We need a dynamic approach to the problems of education.  I had expected such an approach from the Minister.  The Minister is in the enviable position representing such an area and being aware of its problems. I am disappointed at the progress made in regard to primary education.</P>
    <P>I would like to speak now about places like Clondalkin and Blanchardstown which have problems similar to those in Tallaght.  Corporation tenants are moving out into the county.  There is also great expansion in the private sector with large numbers of houses being sold to people getting mortgages.  These people have young children and are often unable to get places for them in primary schools.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Department have a general policy for primary education covering the whole country. County Dublin is unique because of the tremendous expansion and development there.  There was rapid development in the city which has been followed by development in the <Col N="872" /> county towns.  I would remind the Minister of what was contained in the development plan adopted two years ago.  Cities of 100,000 to 150,000 people were envisaged.  The solutions to the educational problems of these people have not come from the Department of Education.  The Department's lack of foresight has caused problems.  They should improve their records over the next few years.</P>
    <P>In a town like Balbriggan there is rapid development and growth.  People in Balbriggan are looking now for proper educational facilities at the primary level.  Before the town expands any further, the Department, together with the reverend manager, should seriously consider the primary education facilities in the area with a view to rapid improvement because the facilities at the moment are, to say the least of it, inadequate.</P>
    <P>I am nervous about mentioning Portmarnock.  The position there is appalling.  I never thought I would see the day when we would have to raise this particular problem in the Dáil. Over the last number of years Portmarnock has developed even faster than Tallaght.  There are children in Portmarnock at the moment unable to go to primary schools because there are no schools available.  Children of four and five years of age who are attending school spend their day in mobile, temporary classrooms situated at least one and a half miles from the centre of population.  These children must walk to their temporary classrooms.  If it is a wet morning they must sit in school all day in wet clothes and they are still wet coming home.  How there have not been fatalities due to pneumonia or other causes I will never know. Portmarnock is crying out for justice. I appeal to the Department of Education to do something for that community.  It is a diabolical situation and it is getting worse.</P>
    <P>To anybody not familiar with the developments of the County Dublin area it is very difficult to explain exactly the problems.  Portmarnock is ultra typical of what is happening. Young married couples with young families are buying houses in the area. There is no immediate demand for <Col N="873" /> post-primary education, but there is an immediate demand for primary education.  While the Department consider the problem these children are growing up, attending primary schools in temporary accommodation.  If they are to start their education in life in such accommodation what chance will they have later?  I would ask the Department to take an urgent look at the Portmarnock area and take rapid action to see that the situation is rectified.</P>
    <P>What I said earlier about Swords applies also to Portmarnock.  The grants paid by the Department are directed only to school building and not to the school sites.  In an area&mdash; for example, Portmarnock&mdash;where the cost of the land for a school is higher than the cost of the school building, the Department can revise their scheme to include the cost of the site as well, as the cost of the buildings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamCunningham" hpid="Mr. Cunningham Mr. Cunningham">

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R.P. Burke Mr. R.P. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R.P. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  We should not have any schools without playing-fields. A healthy body means a healthy mind.  We need playing facilities but we particularly need the classrooms.</P>
      <P>I should like to make particular mention of the children of the 300 residents of the Arthur Griffith Park Estate.  This is a county council estate situated approximately 1½ miles from the primary school in Lucan.  I had a question down to the Minister regarding school transport and he told me very kindly that he would be prepared to discuss with CIE the provision of a school bus for which the pupils would have to pay the full CIE fares.  This is a local authority housing estate.  One of the conditions of securing a house there was that a person would be in a certain income bracket, and have a certain number of children.  It was allocated on the points system of Dublin county council, but in practice the families have to be large before they can secure a house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These people are not in a position to carry the massive burden quoted by CIE of £300 for the transportation of their children from Arthur Griffith <Col N="874" /> Park to the primary school in the first few months to Christmas.  I would ask the Minister to reflect on the decision he made with regard to Lucan and the children of Arthur Griffith Park and use his much publicised talents to see if he could devise some scheme whereby these children could receive justice, because they are not getting justice at this stage.</P>
    <P>Skerries is a rapidly-developing area similar to the other areas I have mentioned.  The residents are demanding proper facilities for their children at primary level.  What I said for the other towns holds equally for Skerries.  These problems are in the towns and the city fringe areas.  We have them in Donaghmede, the Donaghies and Darndale right across to the Coolock fringe.  This is a developing area which is straddling the city and county boundary.  These fringe areas are entitled to special attention.</P>
    <P>There is a new development in Darndale which the corporation envisage as a very large housing scheme. When these houses are being built a school should also be built.  There is no use in families going into houses unless there are educational facilities as well.  Thanks to the work of the late Donogh O,Malley there is a realisation of the need for education. Parents are aware of the need to secure proper educational facilities for their children.  There is no use sending people to a housing ghetto, be it private houses, local authority houses or any other sort, because housing estates are mere ghettos until they have the facilities of schools, shops, churches, playing fields and proper community buildings.</P>
    <P>It is important that the lessons of the past be learned by the Department. In Darndale and other developments primary schools should be built at the same time as the houses.  The day the housing contract is signed should be the day when the first contract for building a primary school in an area should also be signed.  Until we reach this situation we shall have problem after problem in regard to delinquency and associated troubles.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="875" /> I should not like the Minister to get the impression that we have nothing but rapidly developing towns in County Dublin.  We also have areas as rural as in any part of the country. The Minister was considering closing Oldtown National School until I put a question to him just after his decision on Dunquin.  He backed off rapidly and changed his mind about Oldtown school.  He assured me in this House that he had reconsidered the matter and was prepared to leave Oldtown school intact.  This is just one of the many areas in north-west County Dublin which deserve special attention and which I am sure the Minister will give them.  One very special area is St. Margaret's.  Due to no fault of its own that village is situated close to Dublin Airport. Because of a decision by the Department of Transport and Power the runway complex at Dublin Airport is to be altered and the main runway, instead of running north-east/south-west will now be on an east-west orientation so that the end of it will practically arrive in the classroom of St. Margaret's school.  That is no exaggeration and is admitted by the Department.  If this does not demand special attention, what does?  The people of St. Margaret's are very proud of their community spirit.  They have a very active community council and are anxious to see their village complex retained but they are aware of the problems facing them following the Department's decision on the construction of the new runway.  I should like the Minister to say what is in the mind of the Department about educational facilities in St. Margaret's because if ever a matter needed clarification this does.  How many other areas suffer from the same headache of the noise problem that will affect the children in St. Margaret's?  I should like some assurance from the Minister when he is replying on that situation.</P>
    <P>I have so far spoken principally of the situation regarding primary education in north County Dublin. I shall now consider post-primary facilities, or the lack of them, in that area.  The policy of the <Col N="876" /> Department at present, to say the least, is muddled: in some areas or towns the Department is encouraging separate development of post-primary facilities with brothers, nuns and the VEC participating; in other areas the Department recommends community schools.  I plead with the Minister and the Department to make up their minds so that the people will know where they are going.  Just now there is separate development in one town, community development in another.  In my opinion this is the first step towards the abolition of vocational education in County Dublin. In most areas where the vocational education committee have indicated an interest in the construction or expansion of schools they have been told by the Department that they cannot build or extend because a community school is being considered.</P>
    <P>This happened in Lucan where some years ago the Dublin VEC decided to expand and build a new school.  They were assured by the Department that they would get sanction but were shortly afterwards told they would not get permission for a vocational school, that a community school would be provided in Lucan. After what I consider legitimate pressure the wise decision was made to allow separate development in Lucan and not to amalgamate the existing institutions and facilities there.  The Department decided to allow the Christian Brothers to build&mdash;they had a school there in the area already&mdash; they decided to allow the convent to expand and the Minister himself attended the opening of part of the extension.  Now, belatedly, permission has been given to the VEC to build a new school at Lucan subject to securing a site.  This is after much pressure and much waste of valuable educational time when the Lucan children in the existing vocational school have been striving under undue hardship because of the inadequate facilities in that school.  Now that the Department have made up their minds I would ask that they do everything possible to facilitate County Dublin VEC in building as soon as possible a new vocational school in Lucan.</P>
    <P>The Department have indicated that <Col N="877" /> they are prepared to allow separate development in Swords, where a vocational school has existed for a long time.  This school has a proud record of securing good employment for most of its pupils.  For some years past there has also been an excellent Christian Brothers school in the area. If the Department are allowing separate development in Swords, the obvious separate development is the building of a convent school since there is both a vocational school and a Christian Brothers school in the area.</P>
    <P>I put down a question to the Minister on this subject last week and, in answer to a supplementary question, he said he would be prepared to consider a grant towards the building costs of a convent school.  I should like to press the Minister not only to consider but to consider favourably a grant towards the construction of a convent school in Swords. I would also press him to allow free transport in the meantime to the 100 children approximately who travel out of Swords to attend convent schools in the city of Dublin, in Rush, in Skerries or in Balbriggan.</P>
    <P>I know the free travel scheme is so designed that, if there is a post-primary educational facility in an area, the Department will not consider the payment of a grant towards free travel. While there is in the area the vocational school about which I spoke, there is also a firm body of opinion on the part of many parents that they would like to have their daughters educated in a convent school and not in a vocational school.  I will not give my own views on that one way or the other.  I respect the views of the parents who want to do the best they can, as they see it, for their daughters.  Until the Department give a grant for the construction of a post-primary school in Swords, they should seriously consider the provision of free transport for the young girls who have to leave the town to attend school elsewhere because there is no convent school there at the moment.</P>
    <P>I now come to the post-primary facilities in Skerries.  There is a De la Salle school in the area, a Holy Faith <Col N="878" /> Convent and a small vocational school.  The vocational school is small in numbers but very efficient and very active.  It is small because it has been living under the threat of annihilation and extinction by the Department.  In reply to a question I put down to the Minister last week, I was informed that he is prepared to allow only a single post-primary school to be developed in this area.  He envisages the amalgamation of the De la Salle school, the Holy Faith Convent and the vocational school.</P>
    <P>In reply to supplementary questions the Minister refused to inform me and the House of exactly what he had in mind with regard to the management structure of that school.  A single post-primary school in an area incorporating the two religious orders and the vocational school is a community school to me.  Is the management structure of this community school in Skerries to be the same as the structure in Tallaght or Blanchardstown? In reply to my supplementary the Minister insinuated that it would not be the same.  He did not say that out straight but that was the insinuation.</P>
    <P>When the Minister is replying to the debate on this estimate I would ask him to clarify the situation for the people in Skerries, for the parents of the children attending these three schools, and the parents of children who will be attending one of these schools in the future, because this is a rapidly developing area.  He said last week that it was now envisaged that work on the construction of this school would start in 1975.  We are nearly at the end of 1973 and, if it is to start in 1975, is it not about time the Minister appointed a board of management and a principal so that work on the facilities which are necessary and on negotiations with architects could go ahead?</P>
    <P>What is the point in building a school and then appointing a board of management and a principal and saying to them: &ldquo;Here you have a structure.  It may not be adequate but do what you can.&rdquo;  Would it not be better if the Minister appointed a board of management and let the board of management appoint the <Col N="879" /> principal and let them decide on what facilities are necessary, what classrooms are necessary, whether there will be metalwork or woodwork and how much of each, what chemistry labs are necessary, what community facilities are necessary, what library facilities are necessary?  All of these major policy decisions have to be made at this stage.  They are even late at this stage.</P>
    <P>No longer can the people of Skerries wait while the Minister goes thither and fro trying to make up his mind on what sort of management structure he will put in, in Skerries. The people of Skerries deserve better than they are getting from the Department of Education.  I hope the Minister will clarify his intentions and announce immediately afterwards his management structure for the Skerries school.  In any management structure designed or announced, representation must be given to the existing institutions in the area and to the parents of pupils attending the schools.  In this day and age when parents are so aware of the education of their children, they have a democratic right to be involved in any decision which affects the education of their children.  I should like the Minister to clarify the situation because no longer can it be left on the long finger.</P>
    <P>A number of years ago a convent school was established in Malahide. It was decided by the Department to allow education in Malahide to develop in the form of a community school only.  I was honoured to be appointed by the Vocational Education Committee in County Dublin as one of their two representatives on the board of management of that community school.  What has happened since this board was set up in the spring of this year?  We had a number of meetings.  At the inaugural meeting we had representatives from the Department of Education who promised us the sun, moon and the stars.  All we had to do was blink and we would have a brand new community school outside the door.  I was afraid to go out in case <Col N="880" /> my car had been in the way of some of the trucks bringing in the building materials.  Alas and alack, therein lies a tale.</P>
    <P>Since that meeting, and despite the fact that the board of management went on a deputation to the Department, nothing has happened.  We have been instructed by the Department to open a community school at Malahide but how can the Department expect the board of management to comply with that instruction when they fail to co-operate with the board.  When we made attempts during the month of July to get plans from the Department we were told that official &ldquo;X&rdquo; was on holidays and official &ldquo;Y&rdquo; knew nothing about the matter and when we contacted the Department in August we were told that official &ldquo;Y&rdquo; was on holidays and official &ldquo;X&rdquo; knew nothing in regard to the matter.  That attitude is not good enough in relation to a rapidly expanding area such as Malahide. County Dublin has unique problems which need unique action on the part of the Department but we are not getting any co-operation from them. It is not possible for us to open a community school at Malahide in the time specified by the Department unless we receive from them the maximum amount of co-operation.  My plea to the Minister at this stage is to ensure that his officials move rapidly in relation to this matter.</P>
    <P>Adjacent to Malahide is the Portmarnock area.  This is an area which has unique problems in relation to primary education but which has not the immediate problems of post-primary education.  However, now is the time for the Department to make moves towards the acquisition of a site in Portmarnock for the erection of a post-primary school.  There is no point in going out there in five years time to look for a site because by then every piece of available land adjacent to population areas will have been purchased.  The same goes for any area in County Dublin in which the Department have not acquired land for post-primary education facilities. I ask them to purchase the necessary land now.  They are aware that the price of land in these areas is <Col N="881" /> doubling every 12 months.  They must use foresight in this matter.  If they are not prepared to buy the land they should authorise some other body to do so.  I know from the VEC that on an occasion when approval of this type was sought, it was very slow in being sanctioned by the Department.</P>
    <P>We all had, and still have, great hopes in relation to the Blanchardstown community school but it is operating under the severe handicap of lack of co-ordination and attention to detail. There was a large investment in respect of this school but the necessary equipment for the classrooms is not being provided.  Compared with the large investment in land, structure, <i>et cetera,</i> the cost of the provision of this equipment would be small but its non-availability reduces the capacity and the possibility of teachers to give of their best to the pupils.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to look into the situation in regard to this school and to effect improvements in so far as possible.  It would not require a lot to make of it the ideal community school, if there is such a thing, but the Department have been very short-sighted in their actions to date.</P>
    <P>These, then, are the main points I wish to raise.  Once again, I would stress some of the very important ones. These are: the facilities necessary in a rapidly expanding County Dublin for primary education in such towns as Swords, Malahide, Portmarnock, Skerries, Balbriggan and the fringe areas; and the unique problem facing the community in St. Margaret's because of the decision that has been reached by the Department of Transport and Power concerning the airport runways.  I should like to hear from the Minister what is the thinking in the Department in regard to St. Margarets. The people of the area are entitled to clarification on that point.</P>
    <P>So far as school transport is concerned, the children in Donabate parish, where there are no post-primary facilities, must travel out of the parish to school and, consequently, they should be entitled to free transport. The same applies in respect of the children of Swords who, because of the <Col N="882" /> lack of a convent there, must go elsewhere. Other points I wish to stress concern the post-primary facilities in North County Dublin, separate or community; the co-operation of the Department on community schools, and in relation to separate developments, whether they be convent schools, Christian Brothers schools or vocational schools.</P>
    <P>I will conclude as I began by mentioning that, when the Department were releasing the statement regarding educational facilities more notice should have been given to the interested bodies.  A circular was received on a date that allowed us between five and ten days in which to consider the far-reaching issues involved.  In that time we had to make our views known and forward them to a meeting that was being held under the auspices of the Minister.  This is not how education should develop.  There should not be revolution but education should evolve. It will not evolve if the Minister is to be as short-sighted in the future as he has been in the past, in particular, regarding the amount of time which he is prepared to give to interested bodies to discuss such far-reaching documents as the one circulated recently.</P>

      <P>At the outset I wish to correct a statement made by Deputy R. P. Burke.  I, too, am a member of a vocational education committee and I can tell the House that the document to which the Deputy referred was circulated on July 27 and not on September 26 as alleged by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister for Education on his appointment to that important post.  I am confident he will carry out his duties with great success.  His early schooling in North Tipperary, I am sure, will contribute to that success. He has accomplished many wonderful things in his first six months of office, among them the reopening of Dunquin school.  To many that may have seemed a minor detail but to me it is an accomplishment which confirms one of the foremost aims of the Government, a genuine policy in regard to the language.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="883" /> Listening to Deputies opposite since the reopening of the Dunquin school, one was reminded of the posing of Fianna Fáil as the watchdog of the national language.  Since I was at school I have been listening to the one side of the dual purpose cow&mdash; Fianna Fáil's efforts to take the cream of the creameries' voters on the issue of the revival of Irish.  After 30 years we can see the result of that homage to the dual purpose cow.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>From the Minister's comprehensive introductory speech it is apparent he is concerned with the educational needs of the country.  One reads some of the admirable aims in relation to equal opportunities for all and greater provisions for disadvantaged children.  One can thereby see a mind which is aware of the needs of our children.  In the National Coalition document on education one aim was put very clearly.  It is that in education there should be genuine consultation with parents and pupils. This should be one of the Minister's guidelines.</P>
      <P>I note that the Minister has recommended regionalisation in education. I, for one, am wary of regionalisation in any aspect of Irish life because I have lived through regionalisation in the field of health, the establishment of the health boards, and I realise the lack of consultation there between the Department, the regional boards and the local talkshops&mdash;the advisory committees.  That has made me very wary of regionalisation in any other field, particularly education.</P>
      <P>I should like now to come to some of the problems we inherited from the previous Government in my constituency. We had one in Borrisokane, where parents, pupils and the vocational education committee were at loggerheads for two years with the Department.  Both parents and pupils were fooled by promises and more promises.  Thanks to Mr. Burke, we have the problem resolved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am hoping that the Minister will ensure that the Borrisoleigh Convent will continue to give the service it has given for so many years.  In the primary school in Borrisoleigh there are many urgent needs to be met.  The conditions are primitive in the national school there.  There are plans for a new school and I hope this will commence shortly.  The toilets in the existing school are so primitive that I doubt if an agricultural inspector would allow cattle to be let in there.</P>
      <P>In regard to the vocational education needs in North Tipperary, I should like to pay a brief tribute to the CEO and the teaching staffs.  In the past five years there has been an explosion in the school population in the area, particularly in Roscrea. Thurles and Templemore, where more &ldquo;prefabs&rdquo;, what I might call chicken coops, are urgently needed.  These chicken coops are only temporary measures: in the near future the Minister and the Department must have second thoughts in regard to such temporary measures which are not the answer to the expanding school population.  When one reads the McCarthy Report in relation to North Tipperary one appreciates that the time has now come when the Department must get down to long-term planning for new permanent buildings rather than to continue to provide chicken coop expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot has been said on both sides of the House for and against community schools.  In my town, through bad planning in the past three years, £750,000 has been spent on new buildings which are scattered throughout Nenagh and in no way can I regard that type of community school as being a good plan.  To have a proper community school one must ensure that all aspects of education are catered <Col N="885" /> for in one campus and this is not the case in Nenagh.  The new Christian Brothers' school in Nenagh is one mile from the vocational school.  There is overcrowding in both.  More accommodation is needed in the CBS. I thought the idea was to have a community school in Nenagh and I would ask the Minister urgently to have a look at the situation there.</P>
    <P>Because of dilly-dallying in regard to Thurles we have a situation in which we have not got a school at all. Both the vocational school and the Christian Brothers' School are badly overcrowded.  I appeal to the Minister to make up his mind about Thurles because the overcrowded conditions there are bad for the teachers and detrimental to the pupils, tomorrow's citizens.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the Minister's speech which I regard as extremely important is his proposal to have a re-think on the question of examinations. Having suffered myself at examination times, I believe there must be some substitute for the terror of three or four days at the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations following 12 months of intensive study.  The students possibly blow up on the day of the examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. J. Ryan Mr. J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There must be some way to improve the situation.  With regard to the junior community games, which have proved such an outstanding success this year, it is only fair that tribute should be paid to the man who was responsible for the organising of these games, Mr. Joe Connolly.  The games of 1973 proved that all his work and effort were well worth while.  I should also like to compliment the counties who participated in the games and interested the young children in such worthwhile pastimes.  Competitive games are a tremendous development and contribute to the making of a good character.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lot has been said, and can be <Col N="886" /> said, about school transport but I do not envy the job of the Parliamentary Secretary in trying to deal with a map on which a black pencil was used four or five years ago to divide the country in catchment areas.  We are dealing with children, and very personal problems, and for this reason there should be more flexibility.  I am aware that this might raise complications but I have witnessed cases in my constituency where the child did not count and the only matter taken into consideration was the dividing line between the catchment areas.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to have another look at the catchment areas to see if there are places where this flexibility could be utilised to improve the lot of the school children.  I would like to compliment the Minister on giving university recognition and status to Limerick and I can assure him that the people of this western region who fought a hard battle with the former Government are grateful for this recognition.</P>
    <P>With regard to the means test for university scholarships and grants I believe that the middle class are the section of the community hardest hit by this due to inflation.  An upward adjustment is needed urgently if these people are to be assisted by the Department to ensure that their children receive an education of equal merit to people in other sections of society. Universities should contribute more towards society.  A postal degree course for at least one college and extra mural courses are matters which the Minister should consider because we have people in our society who would avail of such courses.  I also welcome the Minister's promise of a degree course for all teachers but I believe that a lot will depend on the standard of the training colleges.</P>

      <P>Sílim gurab é an tAire Oideachais an tAire is tábhachtaí sa Rialtas.  Tá go leor daoine nach n-aontaíonn leis sin, ach sa saol atá inniu ann go mór mhór tá obair anthábhachtach ar fad le déanamh ag an Aire Oideachais, agus teastaíonn gach cabhair uaidh chun an obair sin a chur i gcrích.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="887" /> Ó tharla gur labhair mé faoin Aire úr ba mhaith liom comhgáirdeachas a dhéanamh leis an Aire a d'fhág oifig, an Teachta Faulkner.  Sílim gur cóir dom a rá le fírinne nach raibh aon Aire riamh sa Stáit seo a rinne oiread ar son oideachais agus a rinne an Teachta Faulkner.  B'fhéidir nach fear é a théann síos go breá nuair a théann sé os comhair na teilifíse.  Ach mar dhuine a raibh dúthracht agus meoin oibre ann, sílim nach raibh a shárú le fáil mar Aire Oideachais.  Tá a chrutú sin le fáil sna h-éachtaí a rinne sé nuair a bhí sé ina Aire.</P>
    <P>Go deimhin, ní h-eol domsa aon rud atá ráite ag an Aire úr nach raibh idir lámha agus nach raibh tús curtha leis ag an Teachta Faulkner nuair a bhí sé ina Aire&mdash;mar shompla, an clár úr, rud an-shuimiúil ar fad. Ghlac gach múinteoir sa tír leis. Laghdaigh sé líon na ranganna anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath, rud a bhfuil go leor ráite faoi ag an Aire úr.  Ins na bunscoileanna chuir deontaisí ar fáil chun gléasanna a cheannach chun cuidiú lena múinteoirí an clár úr a chur i bhfeidhm ins na scoileanna.  Ní gá do mhúinteoir bunscoile a lámh a chur ina phóca agus rudaí a cheannach. Fadó, pé rud a bhí ag teastáil sa scoil, b'éigin dó é a cheannach as a phóca féin.  Rinne an Teachta Faulkner rud éigin ar son na bpáistí malintinne.</P>
    <P>Tá an clár ansin le feicáil os comhair an tsaol.  Tógadh scoileanna ar fud na tíre, scoileanna a raibh lámh aige ina gcur ar bun.  Rinne sé rud éigin dearfa, rud nár rinneadh go dtí sin.  Níl á dhéanamh ag an Aire úr ach leanúint leis an obair a chuir an Teachta Faulkner ar bhun.  Níl aon rud úr i ráiteas seo an Aire.  Ní rud úr ar bith an clár i gcomhair na gcoláistí tréanála.  Tá na múinteoirí ag iarraidh an rud sin a chur i bhfeidhm le fada agus thug an tAire a d'fhág oifig geallúint dóibh go gcuirfedh sé an cúrsa trí mbliain ar bun maidir leis na coláistí oiliúna.  Mar adúirt mé, ní fheicim rud úr ar bith i ráiteas an Aire maidir leis na rudaí sin.  Ach, ar ndóigh, is maith le lucht Fhine Gael ligint ortha go bhfuil rud a éigin déanta aige.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="888" /> I have dealt with some of the matters which the previous Minister did when in office.  I should like to congratulate the former Minister on the wonderful job he did in this Department. Even though he does not get credit for it, no Minister has done as much for education as Deputy Faulkner.  Indeed, in this document which has been presented to us by the present Minister I do not see anything new.  Every single item mentioned was initiated and many of the things the present Minister has mentioned were already under way during Deputy Faulkner's term of office.  I refer in particular to the new curriculum which was initiated by Deputy Faulkner and his predecessor, Deputy Lenihan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the speaker does not intend any disrespect, but Members should be referred to as Deputy or Minister as appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher Mr. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The new curriculum gives a new dimension to the work of the teachers and Deputy Faulkner must be given credit for introducing it.  Because of the curriculum pupils will have an opportunity of studying subjects that previously were not on the programme.  I should like to refer to the teaching of art; anyone who visits a primary school will see the work of the children and will be aware of the pleasure they get in doing this work.  All this will have the effect of making us a better people in the future.</P>
      <P>Another development of the new curriculum is the teaching of music, with special emphasis on native music. This is already beginning to show in the volume of Irish music which we hear on radio and television, although probably we do not hear enough of it. We can trace this to the fact that greater scope is given to teachers because of the new curriculum and this has helped to improve the atmosphere between the teachers and the pupils. The students have an opportunity to express themselves freely and no longer are they entirely subject to the teacher in all things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to an innovation introduced by Deputy Faulkner, <Col N="889" /> namely, the general purposes room in schools.  I regret it is not possible to have this room except where there is a three-teacher school.  The Minister in his speech stated that no further one- or two-teacher schools will be built, either in replacement of existing schools or as new schools, the State grants will not be available for extensive reconstruction or improvement of such small schools.  As most of the rural schools are two-teacher schools, this means the general purposes room available in larger schools cannot be provided for them.  One could say there is discrimination against the rural community in this matter.  There are many two-teacher schools that will not be amalgamated in our time&mdash;at least I cannot see it happening.  It is my opinion that it would be a shame if they were amalgamated.  Many of our best educated people were taught in this kind of school.</P>
    <P>The Minister's decision not to replace or build any two-teacher schools is a harsh one.  While amalgamation is desirable and while it is much easier to work in a larger school, many areas would die completely if they lost their schools.  The school is the hub of the village or parish and the Minister should not make the flat statement that all two-teacher schools should be closed or that necessary improvements or facilities will not be carried out to them.  Many people throughout the country are very annoyed about the Minister's decision in this matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to subjects such as physical training, the rural schools are neglected.  In the larger schools it is possible for teachers to do special training and subsequently to devote their time as PT instructors in their own schools or in a number of schools.  Deputy Ryan mentioned the importance of games.  We all agree with that, especially today when people have so much free time.  I would ask the Minister to consider the position in the rural parishes.  If a PT instructor were employed to serve one or two parishes it would make up in some way for the manner in which the rural areas are neglected in this respect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="890" /> Earlier this year I asked the Minister, in a parliamentary question, about the possibility of providing swimming pools.  This may seem a rather ambitious programme to even contemplate&mdash;indeed the Minister told me that&mdash;but I maintain that, if the matter is tackled in a rational way and if we could have some type of programme prepared in conjunction with the Department of Local Government and possibly Bord Fáilte in some instances, moneys could be provided so that swimming pools might be made available.  I live beside the sea and we are ashamed during the summer to see that our own children do not even know how to go into the water.  We see youngsters coming from England, families of emigrants.  They come from Manchester, from Birmingham, from London.  They teach our children to swim.  They have the PT facilities and they are taught to swim in school in England.  We here have no training whatever for our youngsters.  Perhaps I am going too far in mentioning swimming pools because there are areas where they would not be necessary. However, children should be taught the basics of swimming.  I think it is very important.</P>
    <P>The same applies to athletics and coaching of various kinds.  People today have a great deal more free time on their hands.  We find that the youngsters of 15 and 16 years of age who, a number of years ago, would find their way to the football or hurling field are inclined to be lazy and have not the same interest in sport.  If we had a programme such as I mentioned, with a PT instructor in the different parishes where all forms of athletics would be introduced, we would be doing a very good job.</P>
    <P>On the question of school building there seems to be no tie-up whatever between the Office of Public Works, the local manager and the school inspector.  From the time something is initiated until we see the final result it can take years.  I know a school where small repairs were supposed to be carried out, where the school yard was supposed to be improved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="891" /> The Office of Public Works engineer appears and goes off again.  I do not know what is wrong but it is annoying and frustrating for everybody to find that a simple thing, which would cost only a few hundred pounds, can take so long to get finished.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to look at the position in Belmullet where there is a school in a terrible state of repair, where there is overcrowding, where there is a yard in which the children cannot even walk, with pools of water and stones sticking out.  If we brought a television crew down to examine such a situation and if English television showed the conditions in which children and teachers have to labour it would show us up in a very bad light.  I understand that a scheme of work is prepared for this school.  I would ask the Minister to make an effort to have the work carried out early in the new year.  While the work is going on the children will have to be removed to a hall or somewhere else in the area.  If work is commenced in early January &mdash;I understand the job is likely to take about eight or nine months&mdash;it will mean that there will be the Easter and Summer holidays coming along and the children will be out of schools for the shortest possible time.</P>
    <P>A matter which will be of great concern for future Ministers and for the present Minister is school transport. Today more and more cars are being used.  The Department rule now is that a child under ten years of age living two miles from a school may avail of transport.  A child over a certain age has to be three miles from a school.  A new look will have to be taken at this because, with the car, people are not walking the distances they used to walk.  Perhaps it is not good for themselves or not good for children either, but anybody teaching at present will agree that the children who are being transported to school&mdash; this is an argument for amalgamation, if you like&mdash;are the best attenders.  I am sure the Minister will have greater headaches with this as the years go by.</P>
    <P>With regard to school transport for <Col N="892" /> post-primary children, there is a system of catchment areas for different schools.  I suppose that at the time the scheme was introduced it was only right that the Department should have some yardstick in order to ensure that the transport services would be used to the best advantage for everybody, but very often the Department stick too rigidly to rules and regulations.  If a family live at the edge of a catchment area they should have the right to decide whether the children should attend school A or school B.  Their rights are being interfered with when the Department say: &ldquo;You must go to this school if you want to avail of free transport.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is a certain rueful amusement in the situations that arise.  I saw a situation in which a bus carried children to a certain school and every evening the driver dropped the children at the end of the particular catchment area and drove on and the children had to walk or cycle another two miles to reach their own homes despite the fact that the school bus continued on past their own homes. It is very difficult to explain this situation satisfactorily.  Reams of paper have gone into the Department on the matter but the situation continues. In matters of this kind there should be flexibility.  Cases should be examined on their merits and reasonable concessions given.</P>
    <P>Who is responsible for the children who board the school bus?  Who is supposed to discipline them?  Who is supposed to see that they behave themselves? This is something that will have to be looked into and action will have to be taken to ensure that these children conduct themselves properly on these buses.  Could not a senior pupil or two be given authority to make the pupils conduct themselves on the bus?  From what I hear the problem is becoming a rather serious one and some solution will have to be found.</P>
    <P>I hate to be moaning all the time but the situation in Mayo so far as vocational education is concerned is a desperate one.  The vocational school in my parish is in a shocking state.  The <Col N="893" /> teachers are talking about taking strike action and they are being encouraged by the parents.  There are approximately 160 pupils on the rolls.  There are two toilets for these 160 pupils and their teachers.  There is no excuse for not having proper facilities.  A regional water scheme passes right by the school.  When representations are made we are told that a new school or a community school will be built.  A vocational school was to have been built on a particular site but that has now been changed and the Department is talking in terms of a community school.  A new school will have to be built for the vocational pupils and their teachers.  There is some trouble about getting the present owner of the secondary school in Achill Sound to agree to handing over his school and, because of that, I think the new vocational school should be built immediately at Achill Sound.  A site has been bought and everything is ready.  It would not be a waste of money because the new vocational school could serve as a community school.  The site is practically on the grounds of the secondary school and I cannot see any problem arising.</P>
    <P>Unrest in matters like education is not a good thing.  It is not good for the pupils and it is not good for the morale of the area to have people forced into taking a certain kind of action.  I would ask the Minister to have a serious look at the situation and to take some positive steps to improve the position.</P>
    <P>We always have a problem in Mayo in getting sanction for teachers.  Each year the committee prepares a list for the various schools in the area but the Department never sanctions the number required.  This year we were looking for a number of metalwork teachers.  There were three young men from the county who had trained as metalwork teachers but we were told by the Department that they could not give us metalwork teachers in Mayo.  The three young men got appointments elsewhere but they would have been very happy to have had the opportunity of working in their own country.  It is the same story every year.  There is talk of grandiose <Col N="894" /> schemes and millions for this, that and the other.  Then one gets down to basics and examines the position in certain areas and one finds the conditions under which people have to work and live and the way they are neglected.  It is far more important to get involved in basics rather than talk of grandiose schemes and millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>We do not have the facilities we should have for our boys and girls in the vocational schools and they are not able to do the extra subjects; that means they cannot avail of the AnCO training scheme.  Indeed the AnCO training scheme hardly operates at all as far as children in the West of Ireland are concerned.  Children in the larger towns have the first opportunity. If a teacher goes to the AnCO training centre and tries to have a boy taken in for training the answer he gets is that if somebody sponsors the boy he will for training the answer he gets is that if somebody sponsors the boy he will be taken in.  In other words, if he is already serving an apprenticeship with a contractor or with somebody, say, in the radio business or in any of the other activities for which AnCO has training schemes, he will be admitted. I have had experience of this on several occasions.  Where can a boy in the West of Ireland get an apprenticeship in anything, even carpentry or woodwork? I understand that the trade unions fix a ratio for apprenticeship. If there are four or five carpenters in a workshop, only one apprentice is allowed.  I may not be entirely correct in that, but I think it is four to one. Circulars may be sent around to us as Deputies.  Things are presented to us in a lovely fashion but when one tries to have the various schemes which one hears about implemented for the benefit of one's own area, it is just not on.</P>
    <P>Another matter which is of great concern both to vocational committees and the CEO in counties is the manner in which the Department of Education hold back payments of money due to the committee.  I know a case in which a CEO in a county was told by the bank manager that if certain sums were not forthcoming from the Department he would not honour the teachers' cheques.  There may be a shortage of staff in the Department or there may <Col N="895" /> be other reasons for that, but this kind of thing should not happen.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of life, especially for youngsters, which we have to look at closely.  One problem which is causing serious concern is that of drink among teenagers.  Many schemes were initiated by the Department of Education&mdash;for instance, the savings scheme.  Things like this are a great help to children.  It is time we had some kind of intensive programme in schools, under which people would come in and talk to children about drink and its dangers, and try to do something positive about this scourge. I do not know where youngsters get the money for drink, but I would ask the Minister to initiate a series of lectures and films which would be available to primary, vocational, and secondary schools in order to impress upon youngsters how serious this matter can be for them.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to deal with the matter of drugs, because there are other people who are more competent than I to do so.  However, there are other simple matters.  Take the question of litter.  If you go around any town near shops or schools it is terrible to see the mess children leave. Again the Department of Education, by having films made available to be shown in schools, should do something to solve this problem.  The question of pollution is tied up with this.  It should not be too hard to have some programme introduced which would help to put an end to this.</P>
    <P>Tá imní orm go bhfuil faillí á dhéanamh maidir le ceist na Gaeilge.  Tá daoine ann a deireann nach raibh aon mhaith san éigeantacht maidir leis an Ghaeilge.  Ní aontaím leo chor ar bith. Cé nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge ró láidir agus ba cheart dí a bheith, san am chéadhna tá i bfhad níos mó eolas ar Ghaeilge ná mar a táimíd sásta a rá, ach an t-aon áit amháin go bhfuil laige sa Ghaeilge sílím gurb í i labhairt na Gaeilge.  Níl fonn ar dhaoine an Ghaeilge a labhairt, agus óthárla nach bhfuil aon éigeantacht ag baint le Gaeilge anois le haghaidh scrúdaidhte tá faillí á dhéanamh ann.  Sé an port atá acu anois: &ldquo;Bhuel, ní gá Gaeilge <Col N="896" /> bheith againn le h-aghaidh na h-ardteistiméireachta nó le h-aghaidh scrúdaithe&rdquo; agus tá an port céanna ag na tuistí.  Ní raibh an ceart ag an Aire i dtaobh na h-éigeantachta.  Cuireann sé iontas orm féin gur ghlac na h-údaráis uilig atá ag plé le ceist na Gaeilge leis an rud atá déanta ag an Aire ach ar ball beidh a fhios againn cé aige a bhí an ceart.</P>
    <P>Is trua go bhfuil faillí á déanamh sa Ghaeilge.  Má chaillimid an teanga táimid ag cailliúint i bhfad níos mó ná mar a thuigeann cuid mhór daoine.  Táan teanga agus an creideamj ceangan teanga agus an creideamh ceangailte le chéile agus tá cultúr ár ndaoine ceangailte léi.  Ní ceart do dhaoine bheith ag scigmhagadh i dtaobh na Gaeilge nó ag caitheamh masladh leis an dteanga.  Ní rud politiciúil é.  Tá sé i bhfad níos mó, i bhfad níos airde ná sin.</P>
    <P>Tá go leor cainte seinnte faoi scoil Dhún Chaoin.  Más ceist scoile a bhí ann ní raibh ceart ar bith ag an Aire an scoil a oscailt.  Más ceist theanga a bhí ann glacaimis leis ar chuma ar bith go raibh an ceart aige ach níl a fhios agam cé acu ceist theanga nó ceist scoile ceist Dhún Chaoin.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam nach ndéanfaidh an tAire faillí i gceist na teanga agus an áit is mó a bhfuil imní orm i dtaobh ceist na teanga baineann sé leis na daoine a théann isteach sna coláistí traenála agus na coláistí ullmhúcháin i láthair na h-uaire.  Bímis cinnte de rud amháin.  Bhí Gaeilge ag gach duine a chuaigh isteach sna coláistí traenála nó a chaith 4 bliana sa choláiste ullmhúcháin.  B'éigin dóibh Gaeilge bheith acu i ndeireadh an tréimhse ach tá an-fhaitíos orm anois go bhfuil go leor daoine atá dul isteach ins na coláistí ullmhucháin agus atá a teacht amach ina múinteoirí nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge chomh láidir nó chomh líofa acu agus ba chóir.</P>
    <P>Ba cheart don Aire a bheith cinnte go mbeadh caighdeán sáthach ard ag gach duine a thiocfadh amach as na coláistí traenála, caighdeán i leith na teanga.  Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil scéim ann le daoine a chur go dtí na Gaeltachtaí chun tréimhse a chaitheamh ansin le cuidiú leo feabhas a chur ar labhairt na Gaeilge.  Tá a fhios <Col N="897" /> agam go bhfuil na scéimeanna sin ann agus tá siad ar fheabhas.  Ach an leor an méid sin?  Ba chóir, sílim, ins na coláistí traenála cúrsa fé leith a chur ar siúl do dhaoine atá lag i gcaoi go mbeimid cinnte go mbeidh na daoine a bheidh ag múineadh Gaeilge ins na scoileanna go mbeidh sí ar a dtoil acu. Mura mbí i gceann leath scór nó scór bliain ní bheidh aon Ghaeilge fágtha.</P>
    <P>There are just one or two points to which I would like to refer with regard to education at the higher level. We have a situation where our taxpayers' money is spent to educate people for the professions.  Every year we have a number of doctors, engineers and professional people of all kinds who get university education at the expense of the taxpayer.  When they have received their education they emigrate and are of no benefit to the state.  This is not their own fault. Often there are not opportunities for them.</P>
    <P>Our natural resources have not been developed to the full.  People could have training and be brought back to use that training in Ireland in the development of our natural resources.  Let us consider fishing.  I believe we are years behind in the way we approach some things.  I do not want you, Sir, to think that I am digressing from the subject we are discussing at the moment.  What I am about to say is tied up with education. I believe that we should have scholarships for young people to send them to Denmark, Norway and other European countries where they would learn a good deal about the basic skills in connection with fish processing and other matters relating to the industry.  If a fishing co-operative want to employ a man at the moment they can get somebody who can do the accounts but he may have no practical experience whatever and may know nothing about how to handle fish or how to have it processed. He knows nothing about cold storage or other matters concerned with fishing.  If we had scholarships for young people they could go to the Continent and get the necessary training.  They could come back and use their skills to develop natural <Col N="898" /> resources.  This could help to build up our economy.</P>
    <P>The Department of Education, in conjunction with Bord Iascaigh Mhara and the Fisheries Branch, might take a look at these matters. They could help the economy of the country.  Employment could be given in many areas along the coast where at present it is hard to start an industry. Many fishing co-operatives at the present time could be processing their own fish rather than have the position which obtains in the West of Ireland where it is packed in boxes, despatched and auctioned in Dublin. Proper training for young people living along the coast should be made available by the Department of Education.  This would do the industry a lot of good.</P>
    <P>Sílim gur beag eile atá le rá agam. Traoslaíom leis an Aire arís.  Tá obair an-thábhachtach le déanamh aige agus ní mór dó gach cuidiú d'fháil. Sílim go mbeidh sinne anseo sásta cabhrú leis i ngach slí.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  He impressed me as one who has a proper grasp of the action necessary if we are to improve our education.  I also congratulate the Parliamentary Secretary on his appointment. He is responsible for school transport I wish him luck in this very difficult job.  The attitudes of parents, children and teachers towards primary education is very important and more important than most people imagine. People seem to think that it is just a matter of sending pupils to school and the teacher will teach them by whatever method he likes and everything will work out all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also wish to congratulate everyone concerned with the formulation of the new curriculum.  I understand it was introduced by the previous Minister and most things in it are very good.  In most schools there is not enough time for the implementation of this curriculum in a proper manner.  First things must come first.  I have discussed this with many people who have years of teaching experience and they agree <Col N="899" /> that the first thing children should learn is the three Rs.  It is said that children learn to spell by observing but in my opinion that is rubbish.  Teachers must teach the basics of education to the pupils.  Pupils must know tables, spellings and do compositions.  These are necessary to a proper education.  I doubt if there is time for the teaching of these and other subjects in the school day, school week or school term.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to make sure that when a child leaves a primary school he will be able to continue his education.  If he has not a grasp of reading, writing and arithmetic he will not be capable of taking a secondary education.  This is happening at the present time.  Children leaving national schools to continue in the secondary schools find themselves unable to grasp the more advanced education.  While I agree that everything in the new curriculum is good and if possible should be taught, I would ask the Minister to ensure that the child leaving the national school has the rudiments of education so that he can continue his education.  That is the important thing about national school education.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening remarks, the attitude to the national school seems to be that the child fears going to school and fears the teachers.  There must be co-operation and a feeling of trust between parents and teachers if our education is to mean anything. That situation has developed over the years in rural national schools&mdash;I have not experience of any other schools but rural national schools.</P>
    <P>I was very surprised to hear Deputy Power saying in this House last week that there was a place for the cane in the primary schools.  While I agree that some form of correction may be necessary, I would not like to see a licence given to anyone in any walk of life to beat someone under their control. At present the teachers have a licence to beat children, in my opinion.  Either they are given a licence or corporal punishment is done away with completely.  I would have no objection to a child getting a stroke on the hand in punishment for <Col N="900" /> wrong doing.  Therefore, the sooner the Minister does away with the cane in the school the better for the mutual trust which should exist between the parent, the teacher and the child. Pupils can be stubborn.  Teachers are capable of teaching, leading and organising pupils to do work and instill into them the desire to do it in response to leadership.  If they are not, they are not fit to be teachers.</P>
    <P>There should be career guidance in primary and national schools. Teachers should be available to guide the pupil along the lines his talents lie. If he has the makings of a brilliant student in university I believe he will show some of that brilliance in his primary education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy sort the pupils at primary stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. Bermingham Mr. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not sort them but they could be guided along the proper lines.  If a child who stays in primary school until he is 13 or 14 years of age does not get career guidance at that time, he will have lost a lot.</P>
      <P>I know a good deal about two-teacher schools.  There is such a school close to where I live and fine education has been given down the years in that school.  We should be very careful about saying that all two-teacher schools should be closed or that we should spend no money on them.  The school of which I speak will have to be closed in the very near future if money is not spent on it.  I know arrangements have been made to spend money on it.  That area is four miles from the nearest centre and if there is to be amalgamation it may be possibly five miles away from the nearest centre, because I believe we cannot amalgamate where certain people are not in a position to get promotion or something like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If that is to be the position and if amalgamation involves five or six miles travelling I want to make the case, which I have not heard previously made, for the child of four who should begin going to school.  In modern times if a child is to reach a proper standard of education at a proper rate he will have to begin <Col N="901" /> school at four or four and a half.  In most cases&mdash;I do not say in all&mdash;of amalgamation of schools a child of four or four and a half would probably have to start at eight in the morning to get a bus to go six miles, perhaps in a roundabout way, arriving at nine.  That child would leave school at 2 o'clock while its companions on the bus in a class or two higher would not leave until 3 o'clock.  The child would have to wait.  In most country schools there is no school meals provision.  The child would arrive home about 4.30 or 5 p.m. Would any Deputy like those conditions for his own child of four and a half years of age?  We should be very sure of what we are doing if we decide that it is correct to close a two-teacher school.</P>
    <P>These matters should all be taken into account, and when you take into account the child of four I think these small schools must be kept open.  The child may be in a disadvantageous position compared with the child living much nearer to the <Col N="902" /> amalgamated school.  The small schools have produced some wonderful pupils, whether they were one- or two-teacher schools.  I grant a case can be made to close all these schools but a case can also be made for keeping most of them open.</P>

      <P>Because of the misleading information given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in reply to Questions Nos. 24 to 27 on the Order Paper for Tuesday, 23rd October, 1973, I asked permission to raise the subject matter of these questions.  I thank the Chair for accommodating me and I would remind the House that a couple of the questions referred to were in my name.  The questions concerned the operation of British Army helicopters on active service in our land.  The Minister, with your permission, Sir, decided to take all four questions together.  I would refer the House in particular to Question No. 25 and to show clearly that the Minister set out deliberately to mislead the House in replying to me. The question, as reported at column 312 of Volume 268 of the Official Report for 23rd October, was to ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs &ldquo;the date on which he received the first request from the British authorities to permit their helicopters to carry out surveillance across the Border&rdquo;.  There was no doubt as to what was intended by that question.  We are all anxious that no troops other than our own would carry out surveillance duties on this side of the Border.  This is work they are well equipped to undertake.  In his reply the Minister said, and I quote from the Official Report referred to already:</P>
      <P>Permission has been granted on three occasions for overflights by helicopters, two involving landings. The reasons for granting permission were to save lives....</P>
      <P>Further on, the Minister stated and I quote:</P>
      <P>The first occasion was on 27th January, 1973, when I had no authority to give permission in the matter.  The second was on 4th May, 1973, and the third occasion was on 28th August, 1973.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> In a reply to a supplementary the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>It has been the practice to give permission where lives are at stake.  The previous Government did so on 27th January, 1973, and we have done so on two other occasions.  I propose to continue that practice where there is a question of human life being at stake.</P>
    <P>The Minister set out deliberately to mislead the House by saying that the Fianna Fáil Government gave permission on the 27th January to the British authorities to send in helicopters to this part of the country for the purpose of carrying out surveillance.</P>

The Minister mentioned three dates on which permission was granted.  On the latter two the Coalition Government were in power.  Whatever permission was given or was not given on January 27th can be ascertained by anybody who reads the newspapers for the following day.  I would refer the House to <i>The Sunday Press</i> of January 28th, 1973.</P>

      <P>When I was discussing this matter last week the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs continued to snigger and Deputy Paddy Belton interjected a number of times.  Time will be allowed this evening for a reply from the other side of the House.  <i>The Sunday Press</i> item to which I referred stated that the British Army on the previous day helped the Garda and the Irish Army in a special mercy airlift for a young County Derry clerical student who <Col N="906" /> had been injured in a car accident on the previous Friday night.  The item stated that these authorities came together to help in transferring the student to Belfast for further treatment. This student had not engaged in any kind of military activity on this side of the Border.  Perhaps he was injured to a greater extent than the other people involved in the accident and was being removed because of a decision taken by him or by his family.  However, the point is that the Minister deliberately misled us when I asked when permission was first given for British helicopters to fly across the Border on surveillance duties.</P>

      <P>The truth is being given many a queer twist at the moment by the way in which Ministers are answering here.  Both the Ministers for Local Government and Finance have misled the House on other occasions but why did the Minister for Foreign Affairs choose to <Col N="907" /> do so?  He is our representative abroad and as such we depend on him to give an accurate account of what is happening in this country but how can we have confidence in him to do this when he has deliberately misled the House in reply to question 25 of 23rd October, 1973?</P>

      <P>Deputy L'Estrange is welcome back after his absence of the past few weeks.  If the Minister will admit to having made a mistake and to having given the wrong reply, I shall be satisfied; but it must go on the record of the House that any permission given by the Fianna Fáil Government in respect of British Army helicopters concerned a mercy mission involving the transfer of an injured clerical student to Belfast.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil were in power during the war years.  At that time there were air raids on Belfast and we sanctioned the sending of such help to that city as fire brigades and ambulances so that lives might be saved and fires quelled.  The Minister was well aware of the circumstances when he was replying to my question last week, but we shall say no more about the matter if he will stand up now and say he made a mistake and deliberately misled the House.</P>

If anybody has any doubt about that he has only to look at the record of that debate to see the interjection by Deputy Belton.  He said Fianna Fáil had given permission in January.  Deputies have also only got to look at the Press reports the following day to see that a number of political commentators were taken in by the misleading statement of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the facts, however? Deputy Meaney has outlined them but I think they bear repeating.  They are that in the case of the present Government's approach, they were, on their own admission, in the position where they had purported to give permission to foreign troops on active <Col N="909" /> service to carry out that active service in our territory and the Minister for Foreign Affairs tried to convey that the Fianna Fáil Government had done the same.</P>

      <P>The facts, of course, are &mdash;and I suggest the Minister for Foreign Affairs knew these facts; if he did not know these facts we will accept his apology and he will have to look to his officials&mdash;and there can be no other explanation but that he tried to mislead the House and that he knew when he gave the information to this House that the facts were that in the case of the permission given by the Fianna Fáil Government on 27th January what was involved was a British Army helicopter being allowed to land at Monaghan County Hospital to pick up a clerical student who had been injured in a road accident in County Monaghan and to transfer him to a hospital in Belfast.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not care what effort the Minister for Foreign Affairs will make to try to slide out of this one, either on the terms of the question or the terms of the reply, but the facts are that he deliberately, and successfully as I have shown, conveyed that what happened was the same in the case of the Coalition as in the case of Fianna Fáil.  I suggest that the difference between the two approaches is not merely one of degree but is one of kind.  There is a <Col N="910" /> fundamental difference between the two matters.  The Minister knew it, and he tried to conceal this fact from the House and from the Irish public.  I suggest that a Government which cannot or will not defend the sovereignty of this State, a Government which have no confidence in our Defence Forces and therefore calls on foreign forces to carry out within this State the functions assigned to our Defence Forces, are a Government on which we cannot rely to defend the national interests in the very difficult circumstances which obtain today and perhaps the even more difficult circumstances which will obtain in the future.  I, for one, cannot have any confidence that the national interests are in safe hands when I see that a Government which have done what is now disclosed are looking after the interests of this country.</P>

As far as I am concerned and I believe as far as many people are concerned, one cannot have anything but contempt for this kind of weakness in dealing with the national interests, this kind of deceit in covering up or trying to cover up the weakness.  I believe this matter is of considerable significance in so far as it reveals the attitude of many members of this Government both to the national interests and to this House.

He asked the wrong question, and he has got the right answer to the wrong question.  That is what he is complaining of now.  When he was speaking the Deputy said he wished to further question the Minister but he did not say what the question was.</P>
      <P>On the 23rd October four questions were put down to me, Nos. 24 to 26, from Deputies Loughnane and Meaney.

      <P>In my reply I stated that permission has been granted on three occasions for overflights <Col N="913" /> by helicopters, two involving landings.  The reasons for granting permission were to save lives <i>et cetera</i>.  Deputy Meaney's supplementary, which he is not prepared to read out because he is ashamed of it, asked me to state how many times on the three occasions I mentioned I personally gave permission or delegated somebody to give permission. He said nothing about surveillance as answered to Questions Nos. 24 to 26. I replied to that singularly stupid supplementary that the first occasion was on 27th January, 1973, when I had no authority to give permission in the matter.  I then went on to give the dates of the second and third occasions.  I replied to the question asked.  I know Deputy Meaney should not have asked that question. He should have asked a question about surveillance, but because of lack of experience in Opposition he did not do so.  I replied with precise accuracy to the question asked of me.</P>

The problem was that an object was lying just north of the Border and this could have been an incendiary or explosive device.  If it was not dealt with it could have caused loss of life.  The problem was that in photographing it there was a danger that the helicopter in flying over it to take these photographs might have touched across the Border.
